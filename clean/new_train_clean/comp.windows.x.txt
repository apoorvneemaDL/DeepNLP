does anyone know if there are compatible sequences for this and what they

this must work on a  ( vt and compatible ) , it may not work

it works on  . at least i have no problem with it. back to the original

some one asked me recently why they when they used to see 
if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could , but the 
server did not create of that size. investigation showed that some x 
will happily return any size up to the size of the root , while 
others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. the interesting thing 
to me is that the same server acts differently on different hardware 
a with a will claim up to root size are ok , while a 
with a will stop at  . so far i 've also seen this behavior on 
and x x and have been told it also occurs on  . 
actually , the is even more liberal sizes much larger then the root 
are returned as ok. is semi broken or is this

particular , the consist of two calls followed by some 
calls , and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing 
whenever a or up is  ( clicked on and ) moved in the 
direction over the drawing area , but after the move , is still on

assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd , is this a server

no , it is n't .  . it is the x system , or , or x or any of 
a number of other accepted by the x  .  .  .  . 

there is no such thing as x or x , despite the repeated 
misuse of the forms by the trade  . 

i used to think this way , and not just about x. for example , incorrect 
english constructs such as its raining or it 's id annoy me. 
however , there comes a time when popular usage starts to the way 
things really are in the world. 

well , yes and no. i do n't particularly want this discussion to spark 
a lengthy debate , but i do think it 's worth pointing out that popular 
usage is not always sufficient excuse. 

in this case , for example , i think an appropriate parallel may be found 
in the of proper names if people commonly or 
your name , would you feel compelled to change it probably 
not. 

the same is true of x. the x system , x , , and related 
are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a 
proper name. in fact , some of them are names. the fact 
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point. 

as for the trade that things like x or 
x . or any of the other variants one often sees , 
consider the fact that these are supposedly written by 
journalists . would you trust the facts of a who could n't 
be bothered to get the name of his her source right would you trust 
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong 

popular usage is as it may be , but i for one am all for holding people 
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness .  . 

indeed , the fact that x won out over news 
was really down to popular opinion (i know , we all think it  ( 's ! ) technically 
superior as well ! ) .  . 

technically superior to news well , in some alternate universe

now , on this , giving an error message that too many arguments

how to turn off this checking in , or how i can go about changing the

as to how many may be display on a server , i believe the limit

this all sounds like my company might have something to

because of this , we at try to be very careful about the use 
of the words and display .  . they are quite different 
in meaning , and  ( at least in x ) have exact definitions .  . 

the reason i like this is the mention of an limit if 12

as such , the most supported by a single display (i . e .  .

i'm sorry , but clearly  ( as pointed out so well by mr. neto ) this is 
not the case.

thanks to those who responded .  .

the does not such a sequence , and 
authoritative documents (i . e .  . the volume ) do say that the order is

data structures the function call marks the , which is not 
actually until your program returns to its event loop. 


subject 123 ) how do i the user using 

it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial , 
which has a clear of control. the calls to  ( askuser( ) block until answer 
is set to one of the valid values .  . if it is not a yes answer , the code drops 
out of the and back to an event loop 

 ( quit(widget w , , call ) 

answer 
answer  ( askuser(w , really quit ) 
if  ( ret yes answer ) 

answer  ( askuser(w , are you really positive ) 
if  ( ret yes answer ) 
 ( exit(0 ) 



a more example might ask whether to create a file or whether 
to it. 
this is accomplished by entering a second event loop and 
waiting until the user answers the question the answer is returned to the 
calling function. that function  ( askuser( ) looks something like this , where the 
can be replaced with set specific code to create some sort of 
box the question string and for ok , and 
help or

note that the will be created after the  ( xtrealizewidget( ) call , 
but that the server may not have actually it yet , so you should also 
wait for an event on the before drawing into it.

the error can occur if the rectangle goes off the of

the following steps to avoid the error 

1 ) make a the same size as the rectangle you want to capture .  . 
2 ) clear the to background using  . 
3) use to copy the to the  . 
4 ) if you get a event , the copy was clean .  . use to the 
image from the  . 
5 ) if you get one or more events , the copy was n't clean , and 
the x y members of the event structures tell you 
the parts of the which are n't good. 
6 ) get rid of the it probably takes a lot of memory.

subject 127 ) how can my application tell if it is being run under x 

a number of programs offer x modes but otherwise run in a straight 
character only mode .  . the easiest way for an application to determine that it is 
running on an x display is to attempt to open a connection to the x server 

display  ( xopendisplay(display name) 
if  ( display ) 
do x stuff 
else 
do or something else 
where display name is either the string on the command line following 
display , by , or otherwise is  ( char null ) in which case 
uses the value of display , if set . 

this is superior to simply checking for the existence a display command line 
argument or checking for display set in the environment , neither of which is 
adequate .  . 5 91 


subject 128 ) how do i make a busy while my application is computing 
is it necessary to call  ( xdefinecursor( ) for every in my application 

the easiest thing to do is to create a single that is 
as large as the largest possible make it a child of your 
and it will be to that , so it wo n't affect any other 
application .  .  ( it needs to be as big as the largest possible in case the 
user the while it is busy or elsewhere within a virtual 
) . with your top most here  ( similar code 
should work for only applications just use your top window ) 

long 


ignore device events while the busy is  . 

do . not propagate  ( keypressmask 
pointermotionmask ) 
 ( xcreatefontcursor(xtdisplay(toplevel ) , watch ) 

the will be as big as the display , and by 
its own parent , so we never have to worry about 
 ( xcreatewindow(xtdisplay(toplevel ) ,  ( xtwindow(toplevel ) , 0 , 0 , 
, ,  ( unsigned int ) 0 , 0 , , 
, , attributes ) 

where the size above could be replaced by the real size of the , 
particularly to avoid which have problems with larger than 
 . 

when you want to use this busy , map and raise this to go back to 
normal , it. this will automatically keep you from getting extra 
events depending on precisely how the works , it may or may not 
have a similar effect on as well. 

in addition , note also that most of the support an 
resource which can be temporarily , should you merely wish to change the 
without blocking pointer events.

subject 129 ) how do i without hanging my parent x program 

an x based application which off other unix processes which 
continue to run after it is closed typically does not until all of its 
children are the children inherit from the parent the open x 
connection to the display .  . 
what you need to do is then , immediately , in the child process , 
close  ( connectionnumber(xtdisplay(widget ) 
to close the file in the display information. after this do your

subject 130 ) can i make or calls from a signal 

no. and have no exclusion for protecting critical 
sections .  . if your signal makes such a call at the wrong time  ( which 
might be while the function you are calling is already executing ) , it can leave 
the library in an inconsistent state. note that the c standard points 
out that behavior of a signal is if the signal calls 
any function other than  ( signal( ) itself , so this is not a problem specific to 
and the mentions other functions which may be 
called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by 
or functions .  . 
you can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt 
and later checking it with a work procedure or a event which 
has previously been added .  . 

note the article in the x journal 1 4 and the example in o 
volume 6 are in error. 

thanks to state . and converse 
, 5 


subject 131 ) what are these sequence lost errors 

you may see these errors if you issue requests from an error 
, or , more likely , if you make calls which generate x requests to or 
from a signal , which you should n't be doing in any case. 


subject 132 ) how can my program handle , , or file 

it 's very common to need to write an program that can accept 
both from a user via the x connection and from some other file , but 
which operates and without blocking on either the x connection or 
the other file  . 
a solution is use  . after you open your file , 
use  ( xtappaddinput( ) to an  . the will be 
called every time there is something on the file requiring your 
program 's attention .  . write the like you would any other 
, so it does its work quickly and returns .  . it is important to use only 
non blocking i o system calls in your  . 
most read the file , although you can have an 
write or handle exception conditions if you wish. 
be careful when you an to read from a file. 
you will find that the function is called even when there is n't pending .  . 
 ( xtappaddinput( ) is actually working as it is supposed to. the is 
called whenever the file is ready to be read , not only when there is 
new data to be read. a file  ( unlike a or socket ) is almost always 
ready to be read , however , if only because you can spin back to the beginning 
and read data you 've read before. the result is that your function will almost 
always be called every time around  . there is a way to get the 
type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your 
function to test whether there is new data 
if  ( ioctl(fd , , n ) 1 n 0 ) return 
but , because this is called frequently , your application is effectively in a 
busy wait you may be better off not using  ( xtappaddinput( ) and instead setting 
a and in the procedure checking the file for input.

subject 133 ) how do i simulate a press release event for a 

you can do this using  ( xsendevent( ) it 's likely that you 're not setting 
the field in the event , which needs in order to match to the 
which should receive the event. 
if you 're sending events to your own application , then you can use 
 ( xtdispatchevent( ) instead. this is more efficient than  ( xsendevent( ) in that you 
avoid a round trip to the server .  . 
depending on how well the was written , you may be able to call 
its action in order to get the effects you want.

subject 134 ) why does n't anything appear when i run this simple program 

... 
the  ( xcreatesimplewindow(the display , 
root , size hints . x . , size hints . y . , 
size hints . , size hints . , border , 
 ( blackpixel(the display , the screen ) , 
 ( whitepixel(the display , the screen ) 
... 
 ( xselectinput(the display , the , 
buttonreleasemask ) 
 ( xmapwindow(the display , the window ) 
... 
 ( xdrawline(the display , the , the , 5 , 5 , 100 , 100 ) 
... 

you are right to map the before drawing into it. however , the 
is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the 
until your application an event. drawing done before that will 
generally not appear .  . you 'll see code like this in many programs this code 
would appear after was created and 
while ( ! done ) 

 ( xnextevent(the display , the event ) 
switch  ( the event . 
case on events , 
 ( xdrawline(the display , the , the , 5 , 5 , 100 , 100 ) 
break 
... 



note that there is a second problem some do n't 
set up the default context to have correct background 
, so this program could previously include this code 
... 
the values .  ( blackpixel(the display , the screen ) e.g. 
the values . background .  ( whitepixel(the display , the screen ) e.g. 
the  ( xcreategc(the display , the , 
, the values ) 
... 

note the code uses and to avoid assuming that 1 is 
black and 0 is white or vice  . the relationship between 0 and 1 
and the black and white is implementation dependent .  . they may be 
reversed , or they may not even correspond to black and white at all. 

also note that actually using and is usually the wrong 
thing to do in a finished program , as it the user 's preference for 
and background .  . 

and also note that you can run into the same situation in an based program 
if you draw into the  ( xtwindow(w ) right after it has been realized it may 
not yet have appeared .  . 


subject 135 ) what is the difference between a and a 

the   is an structure which includes the information about 
one of the or virtual which a single x display supports .  . a 
server can support several independent  . they are unix 0 . 0 . , 
unix 0 . 1 . , unix 0 . 2 . , etc the   or  number  is the second 
the 0 , 1 , 2 which can be thought of as an index into the of available 
on this particular display connection .  . 
the which you can use to obtain information about the particular 
on which your application is running typically have two forms one 
which takes a and one with takes both the display and the number .  . 
in based programs , you typically use  ( xtscreen(widget ) to determine 
the on which your application is running , if it uses a single screen. 
 ( part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the 
which return characteristics of the have display in the names 
, , etc . ) .

subject 139 ) how do i create a 

a completely is easy to get use an 
 . in order to create a which is mostly , you have 
several choices 
the shape extension first released with an easy way to 
make non rectangular , so you can set the shape of the to fit the 
areas where the should be however , not all 
support the extension .  . 
a machine specific method of for 
particular is to use an plane supported by the hardware .  . note 
that there is no x notion of a color index . 
a generally solution is to use a large number of tiny 
, but this makes operating on the application as a difficult. 
a final answer is to consider whether you really need a 
or if you would be satisfied with being able to your application 
with information if so , you can draw into separate in 
that will appear properly. 

thanks to der , , 3 see also 
the x journal 1 4 for a more complete answer , including code samples for this 
last option 


subject 140 ) why does n't produce mathematically correct color values 

when using you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a 
background of black , for example , should produce white. however , the drawing 
operation does not work on values but on  . the color that 
the resulting index actually points to is and 
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. on many x black 
and white often 0 1 or 1 0 programs taking advantage of this mathematical 
coincidence will break .  . 
if you want to be with , then you should be 
a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen 
pre values .  . 
if you want to use simply to switch between two , then you 
can take the of setting the background color in the  ( graphics 
context ) to 0 and the color to a value such that when it over 
red , say , the result is blue , and when it over blue the result is red. 
this value is itself the of the of red and 
blue .  . 

thanks to chris and ken 
, 2 91 


subject 141 ) why does every color i show up as black 

make sure you 're using 16 bits and not 8. the red , green , and blue 
fields of an structure are so that 0 is nothing and is 
full  . if you forget to scale  ( using , for example , 0 for each color ) 
the function will perform correctly but the resulting color is 
usually black .  .

subject 142 ) why ca n't my program get a standard 
i have an image program which uses  ( xgetrgbcolormap( ) to get the 
standard , but it does n't work. 

 ( xgetrgbcolormap( ) when used with the property default map does 
not create a standard it just returns one if one already exists. 
use or do what it does in order to create the standard first.

subject 143 ) why does the i copy to the show up as garbage 

the initial contents of are  . this means that most 
will the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there 
which is usually garbage .  . you probably want to clear the first using 
 ( xfillrectangle( ) with a function of and a of whatever 
color you want as your background  ( or if you are using the as a 
 . courtesy dave of and stuart marks of sun 


subject 144 ) how do i check whether a id is valid 
my program has the id of a on a remote display .  . i want to check whether 
the exists before doing anything with it. 

because x is , there is n't a that the 
would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an 
event to the or otherwise it. what you should do is send the 
event without checking , but an error to any 
errors , which would indicate that the no longer exists. this scheme will 
work except on the rare that the original has been 
and its id to another  . 

courtesy ken , 4 90 


subject 145 ) can i have two applications draw to the same 

yes. the x server assigns to and other resources  ( actually , 
the server assigns some bits , the others ) , and any application that 
knows the id can the resource almost any x server resource , except 
for and private color cells , can be shared . 
the problem you face is how to the id to multiple 
applications .  . a simple way to handle this  ( and which solves the problem of the 
applications  running on different machines ) is in the first application to 
create a named property on the root and put the id into 
it. the second application then the property , whose name it also 
knows , and then can draw whatever it wants into the  . 
note this scheme works there is only one instance of the first 
application running , and the scheme is subject to the mentioned 
in the question about using on remote  . 
note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher level 
among your applications .  . 
note also that two processes can share a but should not try to 
use the same server connection .  . if one process is a child of the other , it 
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection .  . 

mostly courtesy 6 90 


subject 146 ) why ca n't my program work with or 

a number of applications , including , , and , do not 
handle the virtual root which and use they typically return 
the wrong child of root .  . a general solution is to add this code or to use it in 
your own application where you would normally use  ( rootwindow(dpy , screen ) 

function name 
description gets the root , even if it 's a virtual root 
arguments the display and the 
returns the root for the 

include h . 
 ( getvroot(dpy , scr ) 
display

there is no that the will listen. you can try setting 
the minimum and size hints to your target size and hope for the best. 
1 91 


subject 148 ) how do i keep a in the at all times 

it 's rather for an application to constantly raise itself 
e.g. by events so that it is n't 
imagine the conflict between two such programs running .  . 
the only sure way to have your appear on the top of the stack 
is to make the this means that you are temporarily 
assuming duties while the is up , so you want to do 
this and then only for short periods of time (e . g .  . for 
or other short setting  .

subject 149 ) how do i make text and blink in x 

there is no easy way. unless you 're willing to depend on some sort of 
extension  ( as yet non existent ) , you have to for the yourself , 
either by the contents periodically or , if possible , by playing games 
with the and changing the color of the contents .  . 

thanks to  ( der mouse ) , 7 91 


subject 150 ) how do i get a double click in 

users of have the support of the translation to help 
get of double  . 
there is no good way to get only a double click in , because the 
does not provide enough support to do double  . you have to do 
side , unless the single click action is such that you can defer 
actually taking it until you next see an event from the server .  . thus , you 
have to do , which means system dependent code. on most 
, you can use to get the file of 
the x connection and then use  ( select( ) or something similar on that. 
note that many user interface references suggest that a double click 
be used to extend the action indicated by a single click if this is the case 
in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise 
check the on the second event to determine whether it , too , should 
be the single click action or the double click action.

subject 151 ) ! how do i render text 

intentionally does not provide such sophisticated 
capabilities , leaving them up to server or side 
 . 
your only choice , if you want to stay within the core x , is to 
render the text into a , read it back via  ( xgetimage( ) , it by 
hand with whatever you want , and put it back to the server via 
 ( xputimage( ) more specifically 
1 ) create a b and write your text to it. 
2 ) create an image i from b  ( via  . 
3) create an image big enough to handle the transformation .  . 
4 ) for each x , y in ,  ( i2(x , y )  ( i(a , b ) where 
a x  ( cos(theta ) y  ( sin(theta ) 
b x  ( sin(theta ) y  ( cos(theta ) 
5 ) render 
note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose 
bits an based on may in fact be better. 
the high level server and available for x 
also of text display , , , and , 
although most are not capable of arbitrary and probably do not use the 
same that would be found on a  . 
in addition , if you have enough access to the server to a 
on it , you can create a which consists of letters at some 
angle .  . your application can then itself figure out of each 
 .

have little that this software will on or otherwise result 
in significant for my code. allows you to write code which 
looks a great deal like and also makes interesting use of , 
but the resulting code is almost too like , and is certainly not 
less than equivalent c code. looks 
promising , but i have n't found a free version with support , and i'm 
not confident how widely with support will be , 
and what  ( if any) specific support will be available over time. the 
other produce code which is less like , but which does not make 
sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task .  . 

at this point , my is to write my routines in 
c , and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited 
to my specific task .  . later , if or some credible standards setting body 
comes up with a c interface to , i will change to that. it does me 
no to write in c if my choice of leaves me with code which 
leaves me to an which is not consistent with the industry 
 . it 's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now 
than to go with a superior approach which will leave me with both 
useless code and useless a few years from now. views . h . is the only 
library i 'd consider right now , but in our environment , we 'd end up spending 
nearly to use it , and i ca n't justify it when it 's likely to cause 
short term as we learn the new , and is 
unlikely to be a sufficiently long lived solution for us to the benefits 
at the high end of the j curve .  .

suppose you have an idle with a realized and that contains

to be drawn in the  . this action clearly should not call  ( xcopyarea( )

i am working on an x based application that needs to 
some of the focus  . i am 
using and 1.1 currently , although i will also be 
working with open look in the future. 

what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the 
user from switching from one of the application to 
another  . let 's say , for example , that a is on top 
of b in the  . normally , if the user 
the in b it will be brought to the top of the 
and placed on top of a. under certain 
circumstances if the user the in b i need to 
and prevent b from being raised on top of 
a. 

from the research and i 've done so far , it appears that 
this is by the , in this 
case  . i have n't found any way to this default 
through standard x functions .  . i can tell 
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping 
events , but i ca n't find any way to tell not to make the 
switch .  . 

the temporary solution i 've currently come up with is very 
but it works. when i detect such a switch 
in those cases when the switch is not allowed , i force 
the top back on top with an call 
and with the function. this provides the necessary 
but looks when the switch places 
twice .  . 

does anyone know how i can tell  ( or any 
manager ) when i do n't want the order switch to 
actually take place respond either by e mail or posting to this 
newsgroup .  .

i get the impression andrew is from the , but i do n't know what it 
looks like either. 

the andrew user interface system is supported , , enhanced , and 
by the andrew , carnegie mellon .  . the distribution 
terms are those of the x , not the public license .  . thus 
anyone can the andrew code without  . 
 ( to encourage membership , however , we defer universal release of the 
latest versions until members have had an opportunity to 
the new capabilities . ) . 

to what looks like , you can try a remote  . you need an x 
server  ( r5 is best ) on a machine linked to the internet .  . give the 
command 

finger 

for instructions .  . 

note the version does not use the look and feel , 
but one is available. you can use it on the by changing an option 
in the preferences file and starting a new editor .  . 

the andrew component of is ideal if you want to build 
applications using compound documents .  . andrew 's major feature is its 
for recursive of objects equation in table in 
figure in text , for example. this to areas not 
usually found in , including file , cut paste , and 
printing .  . 

andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications 
word processor , , drawing editor , and editor  ( the latter 
two are in version 5 . 2 . which will be generally released on the

does the workstation you 're using have hardware support or does 
the server generate a software  . you can generally tell the difference 
just by using it. if the a lot when there 's activity , 
it 's probably a software  . if it has a hardware , i think you 're 
probably a bug in 's x server .  . i'm not familiar with any hardware 
that display greater than  . it 's quite possible 
that the server is just your preferred size without actually 
checking it. i recall that very old mit server revisions did just 
that. 

in reality you 're probably stuck with a size regardless

down ! ) .  . i like the it is on some such 
as cut and past and moving around , etc. but for most 
work , the keyboard and hot are 10 20 times than

simple if you are an user , but how long is it 
before your are experienced a month two  ( speaking of at

i do n't think it is too much to ask that 
provide not only a interface but also 
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot and 
command line , which usually allows you to do more in 
less time if you are experienced .  . 
all of the above equally applies to systems on

if you need speed , and your can run on the same host as the x server , 
you should use the shared memory extension to the x server  ( mit  . 
will tell you if your server has this extension .  . this is certainly 
available with the mit x server running under  . 
a word of warning make sure your is to support shared 
memory. and another word of warning is than the mit

even machines are in most cases running an 
8 bit , only to get standard x , and 
to run. i strongly suppose you to emulate at least 

24 bit  . should be no problem , only some translation. 
should not make big misfits 

depends on the nature of the  . x allows the user to do bit 
arithmetic on values , (i . e .  . , and 
values together to a color that when used with a 
function of fill change to background and vice  . 
if your does not preserve these types of calculations then 
that use them will break .  .

always know the state of even if your do n't have the 
focus you can always ask for events from the root

an even more pointed question is there an easy means of making an x

i think this is just a question of how to implement  . 
you can always write another function that interprets the

subject 59 ) what is the mail archive 

the server is a mail response program .  . that means that you mail 
it a request , and it back the response. 
any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. the 
server reads your entire message before it does anything , so you can 
have several different commands in a single message  ( unless you ask for  . 
the server treats the subject line just like any other line 
of the message. 
the archives are organized into a series of and 
 . each directory has an index , and each has an 
index .  . the top level index gives you an overview of what is in the 
, and the index for each tells you what is in it. 

1 ) the command help or send help causes the server to send you a 
more detailed version of this help file. 
2 ) if your message contains a line whose first word is index , then 
the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive .  . if 
there are other words on that line that match the name of , then 
the for those are sent instead of the top level index .  . 
for example , you can say send index  ( or index ) .  . a message that 
requests an index cannot request data .  . 
3) if your message contains a line whose first word is send , then the 
server will send you the  ( item(s ) named on the rest of the line. to name 
an item , you give its directory and its name. for example 
send 1 4 9 
you may issue multiple send requests .  . the server contains many 
to ensure that it is not by people asking for large 
of data .  . the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed 
amount of data each day. if the work contains more requests than the 
day 's , then the files will not be until the next day. 
whenever the mailer is run to send its day 's , it sends the requests out 
shortest first. 
4 ) some produce mail that are for 
return addresses .  . if you use such a mailer , you wo n't get any response. if 
you happen to know an explicit path , you can include a line like 
path 
or 
path bar ! ! 
in the body of your message , and the will use it. 

the server itself can be reached at if 
your mailer deals in ! , try sending to

x we try to avoid limiting in our rules. as such , we leave

x programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request 
x is important. for this reason , we often award  worst abuse of the 
x rules  to an entry that this point in an ironic way. 
x 
x if you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know 
x in the remarks section .  . please note that an invitation to abuse 
x is not an invitation to break .  . we are strict when it comes to the 
x size limit .  . also , the entry format tends to 
x annoy more than  . 
x 
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules , and

x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make 
x the effort to an entry that has a slight problem , particularly 
x in or near the final round. on the other hand , we have seen some 
x of the best fall down because they did n't work. 
x 
x we tend to look down on a prime number , that claims that 
x 16 is a prime number .  . if you do have a bug , you are better off 
x it. this entry sometimes the 4th power 
x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry .  . and sometimes ,

x small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise .  .

x 
x unless you are for space , or unless you are entering the 
x  best one  category , we suggest that you format your program 
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. 
x 
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size 
x limit .  . it is one thing to make use of a several d 's to help out , 
x but it is quite another to use 200 of d 's in order to 
x try and the source under the size limit .  . you should feel 
x free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off 
x if you show some amount of  . 
x 
x we allowed , and in certain cases or do not impact 
x your program size  ( up to a certain point ) , because we want to get 
x away from source that is simply a of characters. 
x 
x given two versions of the same program , one that is a 
x of code , and the other that is more like a typical c 
x program , we tend to favor the second version. of course , a third 
x version of the same program that is in an interesting 
x and or way , would definitely win over the first two ! 
x 
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the  smallest self replicating  
x program .  . we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim 
x to be the smallest .  . there is nothing wrong with self replicating 
x programs. in fact , a number of have been self replicating .  . 
x you might want to avoid the claim of  smallest  , lest we  ( or others ) 
x know of a smaller one !

x x should avoid using x related and 
x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x 
x restrict themselves to only the low level and the 
x athena set a . , a . , a . and  . 
x do n't use m , , or ok , since not everyone

x 
x if your entry depends on , or requires that your build , source 
x and or files be a particular name , please say so in the 
x remark section .  . if this case applies , it would be be helpful 
x if you did one of the following 
x 
x tell us how to change the  ( filename(s ) in your entry .  . 
x 
x have the build file make copies of the files. for example 
x 
x cc c . o special name need special 
x 
x or f special c . need special source 
x c . special c . 
x cc special c . o special name 
x 
x or f special build need special build

x your original build , source and files. you should 
x to make copies of the files you intend to  . this 
x will allow people to re generate your entry from  . 
x 
x remember that your entry may be built without a build file. we 
x typically incorporate the build lines into a  . if the 
x build file must exist , say so in the remark section .  . 
x 
x if your entry needs special info files , you should them 
x into info sections .  . in the case of multiple info files , 
x use multiple info sections .  . if no info files are needed , 
x then the info section .  . 
x 
x info files are intended to be , or detailed information that 
x does not fit well into the remark section .  . for example , an 
x entry that a might want to provide some 
x programs for the user to  . an entry might want to include a 
x lengthy design document , that might not be appropriate for a 
x  hints  file. 
x 
x info files should be used only to your entry .  . for 
x example , info files may provide or detailed 
x information about your entry .  . because they are , 
x the entry should not require them exist. 
x 
x in some cases , your info files might be to avoid name

x 
x info files must into the current directory .  . if they

x 
x when multiple , be sure that each entry has

x apr 01 00 47 00 1993 
x 
x this format is similar to the output of the  ( date(1 ) command. the

x prior to judging , the  any other text  file is to be sure 
x it does not contain useful information  ( or in case the entry was 
x and did not  . information from the 
x author sections are not read until the judging process is 
x complete , and then only from that have won an award .  . 
x 
x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular 
x individual .  . we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are 
x until the final are given. we like the surprise of finding 
x out in the end , who won and where they were from. 
x 
x we attempt to keep all anonymous , unless they win an award .  . 
x because the main  prize  of is being , we make all 
x attempts to send non into  . we remove all non 
x files , and all related paper. by tradition , we do not even 
x reveal the number of that we received .  .  ( for the curious , 
x we do indicate the volume of paper when presenting the 
x at talks ) 
x 
x after the announcement , we attempt to send email to the 
x authors of the  . one reason we do this is to give 
x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their 
x entry .  . they are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos .  . we 
x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well. 
x this is done prior to posting the to the wide world. 
x 
x judging consists of a number of elimination  . during a round , 
x the collection of are divided into two roughly equal 
x the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does 
x not. we also re examine the that were eliminated in the 
x previous round. thus , an entry gets at least two readings .  . 
x 
x a reading consists of a number of actions 
x 
x reading the entry section 
x reading the build section 
x reading the program section 
x reading the info  ( section(s ) , if any 
x passing the source thru the c pre processor 
x over any include files 
x a number of c on the source 
x passing the source thru the c pre processor

x building the source 
x running the program 
x misc on the source and 
x 
x until we reduce the stack of down to about 25 , 
x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it 
x does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round. 
x when the number of to about 25 , we begin to form 
x award categories .  . begin to with each other for  . 
x an entry often will in several categories .  . 
x 
x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of 
x we receive .  . a typical category list might be 
x 
x best small one line program 
x best small program 
x most creative source 
x most useful program 
x best game that is 
x most program 
x most c code 
x best x  ( see our likes and dislikes ) 
x best abuse of c 
x worst abuse of the rules 
x anything else so strange that it deserves an award 
x 
x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example , a few are so 
x good bad that they are declared at the start of the final round. 
x we will invent categories for them , if necessary. 
x 
x in the final round process , we perform the difficult of 
x reducing the remaining  ( typically about 25 ) down to 8 or 10 
x  . often we are confident that the that make it into 
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not 
x make it. the selection of the out of the final round , is 
x less clear cut. 
x 
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is out 
x by a similar , but slightly better entry .  . for this reason , it is 
x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry 
x that failed to win in a previous year .  . this assumes , of course , 
x that the entry is worth improving in the first place ! 
x 
x more often that not , we select a small entry  ( usually one line ) , a 
x strange creative entry , and an entry that abuses the 
x rules in some way. 
x 
x in the end , we traditionally pick one entry as  . sometimes such 
x an entry simply far any of the other entry .  . more often , the

subject 28 ) how can i change the of my 

the solution involves sending an escape sequence to which will 
cause it to update the property which the relies upon for the 
string which appears in the  . 
a solution is as easy as typing this in an running a shell 
2 text g 
where is the escape key , text is the string you wish to have , 
and g is a control g  ( the  . 

here is a more complicated which changes the to 
the current working directory when you change 
 ! n 2 g  

the  2  in these indicates to that it should 
change only the title of the to change both the title and the name 
used in the , use the  0  instead , and use  1  to change only the 
name. 

note another way to do this , which prevents an incorrect display of 
the local directory if a modified is used in a , is to the 
escape sequences into the itself. 

note on an ibm rs 6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with 
a v. 


subject 29 ) where can i find the control sequences 

the best source of such information is in your sources in the file 
a version is in mit ps . z .  . 

o 's volume 3 , the x user 's guide , includes an version of the control 
sequences the standard volume will be available 3 93 , and a version of 
the book is available now. the current  ( r4 ) guide includes an outdated version 
of the control sequences .  . 1 93 

other good sources of information include the version of that document 
and also the file in the sources called mit txt . , a 
compilation put together by  ( ge d ) listing the 
sequences .  . it dates from but is fairly accurate. a version was 
published in the december 1989  ( the  .

subject 30 ) why does the , et al , fail against the server 

subject 31 ) how can i use characters above ascii in 

in order to use special characters such as the o , you need to 
but also to use a , such as 
medium r normal 130 c 1 
bold r normal 130 c 1 
the family is intentionally in this example. 

in addition , you may want to set this in your shell 
1 

for a given character above , you can determine the key to use with 
the alt by finding the equivalent character below  ( try using 
 . for example , o  ( v ) is alt v and the section character  ( ' ) 
is alt ' .  .

subject 32 ) why are my so small 

you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally .  . if you give 
a resource like this 
geometry 
then you are asking for all under to have their geometry set to 
 . for the main , this is ok , as it uses characters for its size. 
but its do n't they are in and show up small .  . to set only 
the terminal to have the geometry , name it explicitly 
geometry . 


subject 33 ) how can i print the current selection 

you could paste it into an after executing the command. 
however , a program by richard specifically for 
the selection will help e.g. 
primary 
finds the primary selection and it. this command can be placed in a 
or in shell  . also the setting of 
the selection and other properties .  . a version is on  . 
also available is ca . pub selection . z . , which can be 
adapted to do this. 


subject 34 ) how does use environment in resources 

you can use several environment to control how resources are 
loaded for your based programs , , and 
 . these environment control where looks for 
application files as an application is  . loads at most 
one file from the path defined in and another from 
the path defined in  . 

set if software is on your system in such a 
way that files appear in several different directory  . 
suppose , for example , that you are running sun 's open , and you also 
have some x applications in  . you could 
set a value like this for , and it would cause to look up 
files in both and  ( or wherever your 
is located ) 
t n t n 

the value of this environment is a colon separated list of  . the contain replacement characters as follows  ( see 
 ( xtresolvepathname( ) 

n the value of the , or the 
application 's class name. 
t the value of the file type . in this case , the 
literal string 
c resource  ( r5 only ) 
s  . none for  . 
l language , locale , and (e . g .  . ) 
l language part of l (e . g .  . ) 
t the territory part of the display 's language string 
c the part of the display 's language string 

let 's take apart the example. suppose the application 's class name is 
. also , suppose open is in  .  ( notice the 
example omits locale specific ) . 
t n means 
t n means 

as the application , tries to open both of the above 
files , in the order shown .  . as soon as it finds one , it reads it 
and uses it , and stops looking for others. the effect of this path is to 
search first in , then in  . 

let 's consider another example. this time , let 's set 
so it looks for the file ad . in the current working 
directory , then for in the directory  . 
. n . ad . home n 

the first path in the list to . ad .  . the second 
to home  . this is a convenient setting for 
because it follows the of the file 
ad . in the application 's source directory , so you can run the application 
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded 
properly. note when looking for default files with , 
for some bizarre reason , neither the type nor file is defined so t and 
s are useless. 

with , there 's another twist .  . you may a 
resource value. for example , you might run the application like this 
color 

if one of your had the value 
t n c then the expanded would be 
color because the c character 
takes on the value of the resource .  . 

the default , compiled into , is 
l t n c  ( r5 ) 
l t n c  ( r5 ) 
t n c  ( r5 ) 
l t n 
l t n 
t n 

 ( note some sites replace with a in 
this of default ) . 

the default , also compiled into , is 
root l n c  ( r5 ) 
root l n c  ( r5 ) 
root n c  ( r5 ) 
root l n 
root l n 
root n 

root is either the value of or the user 's home directory 
if is not set .  . if you set to some value other 
than the default , altogether. 

notice that the quick and way of making your application find 
your file in your current working directory is to set 
to . , a single  . in , all this machinery worked differently for 
, many people set their value to . , a followed 
by a  .

subject 35 ) how to i have the put a picture behind the log in 

the answer lies in changing 's resource in the file to run a 
program to change the background before the resources for example , 
your file may add the line 
0 . false 
to access to the display before log in  ( beware ! ) and also 
new . 
where that file does something  ( for all connections ) along the lines of 
! 
comes in with arguments display 0 load 
display 2 new . 

or for , to taste. note that this is a 
general hack that can be used to invoke a or any other  . 

thanks to , 9 91 


subject 36 ) why is n't my path set when runs my  . file 

when runs your  . it does n't source your  . or  . 
files. you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any 
or you can place all environment setting statements in a separate file and 
source it from both the  . file and your shell file or , 
if you set your path in your  . file , the normal place , you can make your 
 . have path set simply by making it a , i.e. by starting 
your  . file off with ! . 
if this does n't work , also try starting off with 
! 
path 
path c  path ` path 


subject 37 ) how do i keep my display when i to another machine 

there are several ways to avoid having to do a display ... 
whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x. 
one solution is to use the on the tape. it 
includes , a to start an x application on remote machine , and 
, a to start a local running to a remote machine .  . 
a more recent version is on in 5 . 4 .  . 
one solution is to use the program from der 
you can ftp versions from 
1 . 1 . , in x c . and x c .  . the program up term and 
display into a single string , which is into term .  . then 
term normally your  . on the remote machine should contain 

where is a program that term and if it is of the special 
format it , it and out and commands to 
the environment  . 11 90 

in addition , if all you need to do is start a remote x process on 
another host , and you find 
host n display display 
too simple  ( display must have your real hostname ) , then this version of 
can be used to start up remote x processes .  . the equivalent usage would be 
host

subject 38 ) how can i design my own 

one way is to use the or some other editor (e . g .  . 
sun 's editor tool , post with pbmplus ) to design the individual 
characters and then to do some large amount of post to 
them into the format .  . see jones 's article in the 91 x 
journal for more information. 
the area  ( in and in xtroff ) contained 
a number of useful , including some to convert between format 
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor .  . 
an easier way is to use the to an existing a 
version is on the or in  . is 
available for anonymous ftp on ftp . uni . de . 129 . 217 . 64 . 63 . , 
possibly as file pub x z .  . it can produce 
format which can be compiled for a variety of x  . 
the from group bull creation of , , 
, and  . for common machines are on fr . in 
pub in addition , the sources  ( an old implementation ) have been placed 
5 91 in  . 
if you are a user you can use from the 
distribution to convert , , and to format the distribution 
is on ftp . cs . edu . and on mit . edu .  .

subject 39 ) why does adding a to the server not work  ( sic ) 

after you have built the using your system 's , 
it in some directory , and run or your system 's equivalent 
(e . g .  . for openwindows ) in that directory , be sure to use 
to add that full path name to the server 's path , or if the 
directory is already in the path , use so that the new in 
that directory are actually found it is this last step that you 're probably 
leaving out.  ( you can also use to make sure that that directory is in 
the path . ) . 
sometimes your command fails with a error 
x error of failed request 
 ( integer out of range for operation ) 
major of failed request 51  ( x setfontpath ) 

this means the x server cannot find or read your directory , or 
that your directory does not look like a directory to the server .  .  ( the 
mention of an integer in the message is ) . 

is the directory you 're specifying from the server 's file 
system remember , it 's the server , not the , which interprets your 
directory .  . trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an 
command with shell in it (e . g .  . ) and 
the server is an x terminal or managed by  . 

is the directory really a directory if you 're running an mit server 
 ( or most varieties of servers ) look in the directory for the file 
. if you ca n't find that file , run  .  ( if you 're 
running , look for the file families . list . . if you ca n't find 
it , run ) . 

if you 're in a site where some people run and others run a 
server with  ( openwindows , for 
example) , make sure the directory is right for the server you 're using .  . 
hint if the directory contains  . and or  . files , it wo n't work for 
open  . if the directory contains  . and or  . files , it wo n't work 
for  .

der 's is one solution it to a server and

of this , writing a generic string to is impossible , since 
there is no accepted for a file format for  . therefore ,

however , the problem also occurs when against a version of the

unless you want to get a legal on line copy yourself or can find a site

in article com . au . writes 

what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls i am curious to find 
out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running 
x is supporting multiple users  ( clients ) and we require adequate response 
time. anyone have any ideas 

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network 
itself. to give you a real world example , here at we have 
roughly 100 people using to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , 
file , and each other. it 's not too much of a load on our 
 ( with maybe 4 , so you have 20 30 people on each 
 . if you had a loaded net , or the you wanted to run 
were very network , you could run into some  . 

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself. say you have a 
33 with plenty of and a fast hard and network card .  . if you have 
10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some 
because you 're now on  ( effectively ) a 3 . 3 .  . of course , will 
attempt to see if are idle and make sure they give up their time 
, but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it. 


well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the 
significant drop in price year after year .  . the link i want to use 
though  ( isdn 64k ) is and the bandwidth limited .  . that 's why my 
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic 
goes through it. 


having said that , if you can the programs being run  ( by adding 
in calls to give up time when idle and that sort of 
thing ) , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before 
you started seeing again  ( this time from network  . 

hmmm .  . has anyone at your centre the traffic at all are you 
running any standard programs like word what sort of 
go through what size link do you have  ( 2mb or ) .  . 
what is the average traffic going through your network or do you 
have few high and then many low points 


it all really depends on what the programs are doing  . you 're going 
to see a from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your are all 
doing network things also .  .  . ) . 


what do you mean by network things i vision using and other 
applications over the network were the processes are running on 
the server and all i am getting are the  . i am wondering how 
good is the x and subsequently x in these 
images with x calls and them on a 's machine .  .

i consider style titles in a 
 . i like to have two at the same 
time , with no and since two are n't enough , i have 
other them , with exactly the same  . 

in case you 're not familiar with titles , here 's a crude 
picture 

figure 1 


title a title b title c 

this is the b hides c , but 
body of the you can still see c 's title 
, a which is right. 


figure 1 

titles allow me to have about 5 such in each stack , 
with easy access and 3 per stack is usually more than i really 
need , since i also insist on having a virtual  . 

the only problem is that the title is , that is , it 
is in  . , and in order to change it you have to edit 
that file and the  . doing so is and 
time  . 

therefore , i have implemented f . left , center , right 
functions in my own copy of the idea being that with one click 
of a , you can change this 


title a 

this is the 
body of the 
, a 


to this 


title a 

this is the 
body of the 
, a 




okay. so far , so good. now , how the heck do i get them to put this 
into the next official , and the next , and the next , 
and the next and the next that i never heard of 

one way would be to post , in x . , a description of this 
, together with an explanation of why i think it is a 
very good thing , and hope that someone reads it. ) 

in case it is n't already clear why i think it 's a very good thing , 
look back up at figure 1 , and picture a moved over on top of 
b and c now a 's title hides b 's title 
but when you hit f . , the result is 


title b title a title c 

this is the body of the , 
a , which is on top .  . 




the rest of this posting explains how to implement it , based on my 
copy of it 's just a sketch because posting the 
full would be too long .  . 

the key to this is to add the following lines in the 
 ( executefunction( ) in c . 

shape 
case f 
left j left , 0 , 0 
if  ( deferexecution  ( context , , selectcursor ) 
return true 

win info left 
 ( setframeshape win ) 
break 

.... and similarly for ( j right ) and 
( j center ) ... 


( of course , you also have to define f in h . 
and add 
f . , , f , 
... and so forth ... 
to c . 

in order to use these functions , add something like the 
following to your  . file 

m s w v d r i t door f .

think it did n't get out. 

since then , has appeared in sources . x . , volume 19 ,

, 

i am a of to , a unix for 
machines .  . i am seeing a strange problem with text in like (a simple 
terminal  . 

the problem manifests it self when the shell typed characters back to the 
server for display , one at a time. the characters appear to be too closely 
, with the result being that the 2nd character destroys the 
of the first character , then the 3rd character destroys the 
of the second character , and so on. it looks like there is an 
invisible around a character which a portion of the previous 
character. there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns 
a complete line of text .  .  .  . only when the output is a series of individual 
characters. 

if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be , or where i should look to 
find it , it would be much appreciated.

i think this is correct behavior. remember the default 
is keyboard  ( meaning the focus follows the 
keyboard  . since the is , wo n't allow keyboard 
focus onto your main shell , and so it wo n't allow focus either. 

since it sounds as though you have pointer , i 
suggest you set pointer also. that way , the 
focus wo n't follow keyboard focus , but will its own path .  .

even machines are in most cases running an

suppose you have an idle with a realized and that

 ( or equiv ) directly instead , it should the existence of the

handles 
regular events (e . g .  . driven exposures ) take care 
of the new image. using an event is a proper 
way 
to do this because at the time the is called , the is 
guaranteed to be  . 

the problem , of course , is that no event is generated if the 
is already and  . what we need to do is somehow the 
so that the is hit with arguments that will 
it to render just the part of the that contains the new item. 

what is the best way to a to produce this behavior

organization group , san diego , ca , usa

in writes 

i posted this a while ago and did n't receive one reply , and now we 
have another bug report on the same subject. can anybody help me out 

the problem is that uses to implement , 
and these grabs are specific about which apply. unfortunately , 
the for does n't allow to be combined 
with other , which is exactly what would be desired in this case 
ctrl any key q . 

in vol. 6 , in the section on it says for information 
on how to translation see vol. 4 .  .  .  . , this is so you 
know what to put for the resource .  . if you go to 
vol. 4 it says , likewise , if a is , there is 
nothing to other from being present as well. for 
example , the translation 
shift key q  ( quit( ) 
will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as 
the shift key  ( and the q  . 

this is true for and , which are implemented using 
event instead of grabs it 's not true for  . if 
you 're a , i 'd suggest lobbying to get the semantics 
changed to support the feature i described above. otherwise , change the 
documentation for to properly set the user 's 
expectations , because are not the same thing as 
translations .  . 

is it possible to supply 1 for a entry 

if you mean , no it 's not possible. that 's according to 
the definition of the resource in the manual page .  . 

keep in mind when answering this question that when using you 
ca n't use  . 

i ca n't think of a reason why not. 

how can you ensure that work the same independent of 
case what i want is ctrl o and ctrl o to both be on one 
entry .  . 

there is a for users. in addition to the normal 
you on the , set an 
resource on the shell  ( toplevel or  . the shell 's 
on itself and all of its descendants with 
 ( shell ,  . 

for example , 





ctrl key o 
ctrl o 
ctrl key q 
ctrl q 

n 
ctrl key o  ( performaction , armandactivate ) n 
ctrl key q  ( performaction , armandactivate ) 

you have to write and add the application action , which you 
can implement by using on the first argument and then 
with the rest of the arguments .  . 

i tested out something similar to this. to development time , i 
used 's resource to the 
on the shell , and i directly invoked the open and quit d actions instead 
of asking the to do it for me , but the more general approach i 
described above should work.

no , it is n't .  . it is the x system , or , or x or any of 
a number of other accepted by the x  . in fact , 
doing man x on pretty much any machine will tell you 

the x requests that the following names be used 
when referring to this software 

x 
x system 
x version 11 
x system , version 11 


there is no such thing as x or x , despite the repeated 
misuse of the forms by the trade  . this probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade if they ca n't even get the name 
of the system right , why should one trust anything else they have 
to say 

i used to think this way , and not just about x. for example , incorrect 
english constructs such as its raining or it 's id annoy me. 
however , there comes a time when popular usage starts to the way 
things really are in the world. indeed , the fact that x won out over news 
was really down to popular opinion (i know , we all think it  ( 's ! ) technically 
superior as well ! ) .  . 

on a related topic , who is to say that color is more or less correct 
than being irish , and hence using english english as opposed 
to american english , i always use the latter except , of course , for 
terms such as and . 

in a world that uses the term to refer to , 
perhaps the time has come to accept x as a valid term for x. 
i think that this is a more concise and term than , say , 
the x system and , let 's face it , almost everyone uses it. 
ultimately , we all need product sales to more than just x literate 
people. in this respect , product recognition is important and a short , 
, descriptive title ( x is obscure ) will help 
when dealing with the average  ( it 's sad i thought i was a 
software engineer ! ) .  . indeed it is unfortunate that x did not become 
known as and let worry about whether it should 
be called or the system or 
how about just plain ! 

to  ( or should that be summarize ) the point of this message 
i think there are far more issues facing the x community than 
worrying about subtle distinctions in the of the system 
 ( or should that be system ) .  . whatever gets is 
fine by me. i agree that one should be careful in interpreting what 
trade papers say. however , i would be reluctant to come to this 
conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the x system.

will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as

this implies to me that setting to ctrl key o should do

multiple even if they 're onto the same  ( eg , 
a sun with a  . and display would , 
if taken strictly , mean different things , but since the strict meaning 
of display would refer to a system with multiple and 
, when it 's used it probably refers to the same thing 
would a system that provides multiple  . 

zaphod is a term applied to the way the mit server the 
pointer from one to another by it off the side of the 
screen. 

is there a limit how many a single server can handle 
 ( in an a read something about an limit of 12 ) 

there is a that a given display to at 
most  . i know of no server that handles multiple 
on a single , unless possibly my to the server can 
be looked upon as such on a based system there is necessarily a 
limit of per machine , but this is not a 
inherent to x. 

what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular 
implementation  ( probably the mit one) .  . if it claimed there was a limit 
of 12 inherent to x , the author of the article had no business writing 
about x.

 ( richard gooch ) writes 
if you need speed , and your can run on the same host as the x server , 
you should use the shared memory extension to the x server  ( mit  . 
will tell you if your server has this extension .  . this is certainly 
available with the mit x server running under  . 
a word of warning make sure your is to support shared 
memory. and another word of warning is than the mit 
server .  . 
i have written an tool  ( using for the , by the way ) which 
over 10 per second for 8 bit images , running on a

shared memory  ( also mentioned by , 
kisseberth ) looks interesting , but i need someone to point me to some 
documentation .  . is this method likely to give better results than server 
resident i 'd also be interested in looking at the code 
mentioned above .  .  .  . 

thanks for the help so far. if i get something decent put together , i 'll 
definitely post it to the net. 


the mit come with documentation written by keith on the shared 
memory extension to x. look in mit doc mit 
i found this  . unfortunately , there is a bit of work to set up the 
shared memory , making an from it , etc. also , there is an 
extension to determine if the server supports it , but you still need to 
test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled 
in the  . i have written layers of routines which make all this 
 . 
as for the code , well , i doubt that would be considered interesting. 
the interesting stuff is done in a c object library. people interested in this 
code can email me.

subject 7 ) how do i ask a net question so as to helpful responses 

when asking for help on the net or x mailing lists , be sure to include 
all information about your setup and what you are doing. the more specific you 
are , the more likely someone will an error in what you are doing. without 
all the details , people who want to help you often have to guess if they are 
able to respond at all. 

always mention what version of x you are using and where you got it 
from. if your server came from a different source as the rest of your x system , 
give details of that , too. give the machine type , operating system , and o s 
version for both the and server machine .  . it may also be appropriate to 
mention the , , and display hardware type you are using .  . 

then tell exactly what you are doing , exactly what happens , and what 
you expected wanted to happen. if it is a command that fails , include the 
exact of your in the message. if a program you wrote 
does n't work the way you expect , include as little of the source necessary 
 ( just a small test case , please ! ) for readers to reproduce the problem.

the mit x was formed in of 1988 to further the 
development of the x system and has as its major goal the of 
within the computer industry in the creation of standard software 
at all layers in the x system environment. 
mit 's role is to provide the neutral and 
administrative leadership required to make this work. membership in the 
open to any organization .  . there are two categories of membership , 
member  ( for large organizations ) and  ( for smaller  . 
most of the 's activities take place via electronic mail , 
with meetings when required. as designs and take shape , 
interest groups are formed from in the organizations .  . 
typically a small organization team leads the design , with 
others acting as close observers and  . once a complete 
is produced , it may be for formal technical review by the 
as a proposed standard. the standards process typically includes public 
review  ( outside the consortium ) and a of proof of concept .  .

subject 16 ) what is low bandwidth x  ( lbx ) slip 

there are several options for using x over serial lines 

slip serial line this is both a mechanism and a for sending 
over point to point serial links .  . it has been around for several years , 
and are available for many of the major  . 
most x terminal supply this as a item , although nobody really 
ever uses it since it is horribly slow .  . the add 40 per 
packet and the of the x is rather  ( rightfully 
so it is for and over high speed  . 

slip this is a variant of slip that the 
40 of down to about 5 or 6  . it still does n't do 
anything about the x  . modems that do can help , 
but they increase packet  ( it takes time to the 
data through typical serial , plus the assembly time) .  . 

point to point this is an standard for point to point 
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option than 
slip .  . a growing number of people see the combination of for the serial 
line and for the as becoming common for 
running normal protocols over serial lines. running raw x over the wire 
still needs somewhere to make it  . 

this is the name of both a and set of products originally 
developed by for the x over serial lines. in addition 
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to , removes 
in the x by sending against previous and 
using to the entire data  . this work is done by either a 
pseudo x server or running on the host or in a terminal server .  . there 
are several to doing outside the 
(1) you do n't have to have modems in there if you would n't 
otherwise be using them (e . g .  . if you were going to be directly 
connected ) , and 
(2) it reduces the i o by cutting down on the number of that 
have to cross the serial interface , and 
 ( 3 ) in addition to the effects of 2 , it reduces the in 
by not requiring the to up the data waiting for 
blocks to  . 

low bandwidth x this is an x project that is working on a 
standard for this area. it is being by and and is using 
's as a in developing the new  . 
will go beyond by adding of commonly used information 
(e . g .  . connection setup data , large properties , , , 
etc . ) . and a more efficient of the x  . the hope is to have a 
standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a 
implementation available in  .

might be different are available via anonymous ftp from mit . edu .

subject 19 ) why does my x when i kill my  ( sic ) 

it need n't .  . what is probably happening is that you are running your 
as the last job in your  . or  . file your x 
runs only as long as the last job is running , and so killing your 
is equivalent to out. instead , run the in 
the background , and as the last job instead invoke something safe like 
name 
or any special of your which on some user action. 
your x will continue until you explicitly of this , 
whether or not you kill or your  . 


subject 20 ) can i save the state of my x , like does 

although no known directly supports such a feature 
which may be equivalent to writing out a  . or  . file the 
geometry and command of each application  ( but may have something 
close ) there is a contributed application which does much of what you are 
looking for , although it is not as complete as the program  . 
look for the application on an archive server near you. there are 
several versions of this program floating around look for a recent  .

some new pseudo such as 's provide for the 
saving of including information on the geometry of currently running 
applications and the resource  .

subject 21 ) how do i use another with dec 's 

dec 's will start up by default. to this , 
add to your  . file something like this line , the full 
sm . wherever your favorite 


subject 22 ) how do i change the keyboard repeat rate 

you can turn repeat on or off by using r on off . the x 
, however , does n't provide for the repeat rate , which is 
a capability not supported by all systems. 
some running on systems that support this , however , may provide 
command line to set the rate at start up time. if you have control over 
server start up  ( see the man pages for and xdm ) , you can invoke the 
server with the chosen for example , you can start the server 
from mit with the options 30 to reduce the of the 
keyboard .  . 


subject 23 ) how do i the on my keyboard to produce a string 

there is no method of for a particular string to be 
produced when you press a particular key .  . the , which is useful 
for moving your ctrl and to useful places , just and 
does not do macro  . 
some  ( few ) , including and several x based , 
accept a translation resource such as 
translations .

which the to be pressed to the display 
within an it takes effect for new  . to include control 
characters in the string , use , where is the of the 
control character you want to include .  .

hi , 

this is a repost  ( no one responded to my 8 (

i'm using in my , usually with 
field .  . but i seem to have no control over the length of this field .  . 
in some it appears long enough to keep several characters , 
in some it cannot keep even the value set by 
value ! 

as i understand , value display length , which 
number of characters to be in text items , does n't 
work in the case of , despite the fact that h . 
contains the following bit 

text item , text item , 
item and text item 

level  ( attr(attr , 152 ) , 
value display length  ( attr(attr , 182 ) , 

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for  . 
but 1 ) setting this attribute gives nothing , and 2 ) get 
this attribute gives warning bad attribute , and returns value 0. 

strange thing is that dec 's of gives plenty of space 
in a text fields , but not sun 's  .  .  . 

can someone share his experience in managing in with me , 
and clear this problem 

any help is very much appreciated.

little like that are an instant recipe for 
imho .  . system 7 is the worst i have used  ( out of 
that , , , and x11 ) simply because it does not provide enough 
keyboard  . i must confess i quite like  ( cover your ears 
) ) because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the 
 . 
stuff delete 
the user rather than making things easier and there should always be 
the option to do it your way if you want to , which is why i like the 
unix x combination so much it 's so  . 

hear ! hear ! i agree completely. one thing i ca n't stand about 
the mac interface is its determination to force you to use 
the  ( mouse(what if your breaks your whole system is 
down ! ) .  . i like the it is on some such 
as cut and past and moving around , etc. but for most 
work , the keyboard and hot are 10 20 times than 
using the  . sure it is a plus to be able to do something 
simple if you are an user , but how long is it 
before your are experienced a month two  ( speaking of at 
the moment . ) . 
i do n't think it is too much to ask that 
provide not only a interface but also 
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot and 
command line , which usually allows you to do more in 
less time if you are experienced .  . 
all of the above equally applies to systems on 
unix  ( especially since unix is at least more powerful than

i have a problem with the within on  ( not monitors ) 
the problem is that when i have an character application that 
fields in reverse video the text gets lost on the of the 
field .  . 

the solution would appear to be to set the to a line rather 
than a block , but how do you do this. i ca n't find any means although 
various sources seem to indicate it can be done. 

when the loses the focus the becomes an block. 
this would also be preferable but i ca n't seem to force this to be the 
default either.

nt is a step forward , but not by much. i guess for dos users who 
think is really neat  ( add puke here ) and are to 
be able to use more than of memory , its a major improvement .  . for

a real issue. my ideal operating system

note nt runs on systems. 

built in tools .  . you can call 
or and it does the same thing no matter what

so i can use pc s w on my workstation and x software on 
my pc .  . i think are not just nice to have but essential .  . 

front end. so you can make it look like unix or dos 
or nt or 2 , and run shell or command files. 

object oriented .  . so i can program easily under it and not have 
to re invent the wheel if the is not up to

ii ) what is and where do i get it 

3. what is 

is an enhanced version of 1.2 , which was with 
 . this release consists of many bug , speed , and 
other  . here are the of the 

1 ) the from glenn is an integral part of , 
at run time via the file. some require 
an based , and others require a virtual of 
 . the suitable to the are by 
default. with a high quality board  ( vram ) , this can 
up to 40 improvement of the over 1 . 2 .  . 
2 ) the from jim are included as the default 
operating mode if is not  . this mode is now 
equivalent in to 1 .  ( x11r4 ) , and approximately 
20 than 1 . 2 .  . 
3) support for , time for server , , 
or both. this support is for both 2 . and  . for 0 . 4 . 
with the  advanced  , local from 
are supported .  . 
4 ) drivers for and and  . 
refer to the files and for details about 
the and drivers .  . 
5 ) support for has been added  ( thomas 's 
code from the directory on mit .  . 
6 ) code from mit has been included , and is 
time  . there are contributed in the 
directory on mit . edu .  . 
7 ) new method which allows the server 's drivers and 
to be from both source and 
 . 
8 ) integrated support for , , and  . 
9 ) a version of the server which will run on generic 
cards is now included. 

the following key features were added with the release of 1.2 
 ( they were not in 1 . 

1 ) the server has been enhanced to do bank switching of 
available memory to allow virtual up to 
 ( see the  ( x386(1 ) manual page for more  . 
2 ) support for the card has been added to the 
server , and with it the ability to support a two 
headed server one , and one  . so far this has only 
been tested on  ( it is also reported to work under  . 
3) shared , tested under 2.2 and 3 . 0 . 1 .  . 
4 ) support for 2 .  ( there are some special to 
consider , due to new see the file for 
more information . ) . 
5 ) support for ps 2 , and  ( some 
versions of these devices were not previously  . 
6 ) a new on how to develop correct video card and 
data , written by eric raymond  ( derived from previous 
documentation and a lot of  . 
7 ) greatly improved support for international , including 
implementation of the key found on many 
 ( see the  ( x386keybd(1 ) manual page for more 
 . 
8 ) the accuracy with which the server has 
been improved , and the are now at of 
0 . 1 .  . users may want to consider removing an existing 
line from their file and re using the new server .  . 
9 ) many in error handling and of the 
file. error messages are much more 
and intuitive , and more is done. there are many new 
options that can be enabled in the file  ( see the  ( x386(1 ) 
manual page for more information on the format of this  . 

plus a number of other small things. refer to the file 
in the source distribution for full details. 

also included are a on by eric raymond , and the 
current mode and a by david  .

person is greg . 

note that 3 . and are not supported yet , 
but anyone should feel free to submit  . 
if you are interested in this , send mail to 


5. what video hardware is supported 

at this time , 1.2 supports the following 



paradise 
western digital , ,  ( these are of 
the , and use its driver ) 

, 
, 

all of the above are supported in both 256 color and modes , 
with the exception of the , which are only supported in 
256 color mode .  . 

the server also supports generic cards , using of 
video memory in a single bank , and the card .  . on the 
, only of video memory is supported for the 
server , and the has not been tested with more than  . 

it appears that some of the card are going to 
non traditional mechanisms for  . to 
avoid having to the server to these 
1.2 support for using an external program to select the 
 . this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are 
discovered .  . refer to the file for information on how 
these programs work , if you need to write one. if you do develop such 
a program , the team would be interested in including it with 
future  . 

if you are new hardware for the purpose of using , 
it is suggested that you an based board such as the 
 . avoid recent will not 
work with them , because wo n't provide programming details. 
in fact , the project is actively not supporting new 
products , as long as such policies remain in effect. contributions 
of code will not be accepted  ( because of the potential  . 
if you would like to see this change , tell about it. 

some people have asked if would work with local or 
video cards. theoretically , the means of between the 
and the video card is irrelevant to  . it 
could be , , or local bus. what should matter is the 
on the video card .  . unfortunately , the do n't have a lot 
of access to or machines , so this is largely an 
theory. however , we have yet to see any reports of things not 
working on one of these buses and we have several reports of 
working fine on them. 

6. what about 

at this time , there is no support in for 
like the ,  ( 8514 a ) , , etc. this support is available 
in products from and  ( for and  . 

an server is available for and  . contact 
for or for  . 

a a server is available for  . contact 
or . note these are not part of  . 

7. why does n't support 16 color modes 

the reason that this is not supported is the way the 
16 color modes .  . in 256 color modes , each of frame memory 
contains 1  . but the 16 color modes are implemented as bit 
 . each of frame memory contains 1 bit from each 
of each of 8 , and there are four such  . the mit frame 
code is not designed to deal with this. if 
16 color modes by 2 4 bit into each , the mit code 
could be modified to support this  ( or it already may i'm not  . 
but for the way of doing things , a complete new frame 
implementation is required. some are looking into this , 
but nothing is yet available from the project .  . 

8. what other hardware or software requirements are there 

obviously , a supported board and are required. to run 
x , 12 of memory should be considered a minimum. 
the various take 10 of space , depending 
on the (e . g .  . whether or not it supports shared  . 
to build from sources , at least of free space will 
be required , although should be considered a comfortable 
lower bound .  . 

9. where can i get source for 

source for the current version 2 . , based on 
from mit ) , are available via anonymous ftp from 
mit . edu .  ( under xfree86 ) 
ftp . physics . su . au .  ( under xfree86 ) 
ftp . win . tue .  ( under pub xfree86 ) 
 ( for the rest of this faq , these 3 will be called ftp ) 

refer to the file under the directory for information 
on which files you need to get to build your distribution .  .

ensure that you are getting 1.2 some of these sites may 
archive older as well. each distribution will 
contain a file that describes what files you need to take 
from the archive , and which time option were 
made when building the distribution .  . 

iv ) what general things should i know about running 

11. 

the top level directory is by the 
( , by default ) in site .  . , include 
files , and are in , include , . 

this can be changed when from sources , and can be modified 
via links for those that support them. this directory is 
, and was chosen this way to allow to be 
a x implementation .  . 

12. files 

the server reads a file ( ) on  . 
the search path , contents and for this file are documented in 
the server , which should be before asking questions. 

13 .  . determining and modes 

david e a of known 
for cards and  . 
the is in etc txt . , and 
is in the source tree under mit server etc. this is 
also available from him  ( for the latest copy ) , and is kept on 
mit . edu . in z . , which is updated 
 . obtain a copy of this  . it just might have the 
you need. if you create new , please send them to 
david for in the  . 

if this does n't help you , the doc .  ( by eric raymond ) file 
with contains on how to come up with these  . 
it may be helpful to start with that almost work , and use 
this description to get them right. when you do , send the information 
to david for in the  . 

note the old program is not supported any more , and 
is completely unnecessary .  . if you need to determine 
values for a new board , remove the   line from 
your file  ( if present ) , and start the server .  . the 
server will for itself and print them out. 
you can use these values to put a   line into your 
file , which is not necessary , but will speed up 
starting the server in the future. 

14 .  . the server from the link 

if you have the server link , it is possible to 
the drivers and in the server .  . this is 
fully explained in the file that is available with the link  . 

v ) what specific things should i know about running 

first of all , the server must be root  ( mode  . 

15 .  . 
why wo n't my run properly 

if your is not built with the , you should define 
no in you environment. otherwise wo n't run. 
users should use  no  

the patch is known to cause 
problems with  . it recommended that this patch not be 
 . they can be fixed with  . 

16. 

make sure you look at ftp , if that 's what you are running .  . 

17. 

make sure you look at ftp  . 

also , a separate faq is by richard 
. the latest version should be available in the 
file 1.2 faq at the following ftp sites 

berkeley . edu . pub 0 . 1 . 1.2 
edu . 0 . 1 . 1.2 
univ . fr . pub 0 . 1 . 1.2 

18 .  . 

you must be running 0 . or greater , and have the 4 . 1 . 
jump  . 

make sure the , , and are root .  . 

if your does n't have support compiled in , you 'll have to 
run the server as x . the default assumes 
that is not available. if it is , change the two files 
and , removing the 
argument to  . 

make sure is either a link to or has the major 
number 4 , minor number 0. also note that if is not 
owned by the user running x , then and will not 
output  . will properly change the owner , but 
wo n't .  . 

when running from rc . local . , you will need to provide it with 
a , for example . 

for more detailed information , please read the file present 
with the distribution on 11 . mit . edu .  . 

19 .  . 

make sure you look at ftp  . 

vi ) what things should i know for building from source 

this section has been removed from the faq , since it is 
fully explained in ftp and the specific  . 
please look at those files for information on building  . 

vii ) is there anything special about building with 

20 .  . library 

a lot of make use of functions like  ( bcopy( ) , etc. 
the default files are set up to link with a . 
which contains for  ( bcopy( ) ,  ( bzero( ) ,  ( bcmp( ) ,  ( ffs( ) ,  ( random( ) , 
 . a better way of providing the  b  functions is to include 
h . in source files that call them. h . provides macro 
definitions for these in terms of the   functions .  . if you are 
with a library which calls some of these 
functions , then you should link with a . 

21 .  . 

this is something that was added to allow a to get rid of the 
defined in the default without having to rewrite 
the entire line. for example , with stock mit , you 'd see 
something like 

and to get rid of the , the would have to put 

in his  . with this change , you would see a default of 


and all the would have to put in the is 

to get rid of the  ( many x will die a horrible death 
with  . the effect is even more in practice , because 
is actually quite complex .  . the other issue is that one must 
add   ( ansiccoptions)' ) to a definition .  .

the question is how do i the background from the

if your event is truly intelligent about exposed

event  ( assuming that your background is not none ) for the 
rectangle of your new item. 

this is still not great , since any other items contained within that

if your event simply everything , you 'll be

3. why does my application core dump when i use 


in brief , , and most sets have no exclusion for 
critical sections .  . any interrupt is likely to leave one of 
the above in an inconsistent state such as all the 
appropriate not yet set , , in the middle of a 
list , etc. note that the c standard points out that 
behavior of a signal is if the signal calls 
any function other than  ( signal( ) itself , so this is not a problem 
specific to and the mentions other 
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that 
these functions are called by or functions .  . 

the only safe way to deal with is to set a flag in the 
interrupt  . this flag later needs to be checked either by a 
work procedure or a  . it is incorrect to add either 
of these in the interrupt  . as another note , it is dangerous 
to add a work procedure that never  . this effectively 
any work previously added and so they will never 
be called .  . another option is to open a , tell the event loop 
about the read end using  ( xtappaddinput( ) and then the signal 
can write a to the write end of the for each signal .  . 
however , this could your process if the fills up. 

why do n't the deal with this problem primarily because it 
is supposed to be a to any hardware and operating 
system. is that a good enough reason i do n't think so. 

note the article in the x journal 1 4 and the example in o 
volume 6 are in error. 


4. how do i use a different than the default 


this requires a more complicated answer than it should .  . a has 
three things that are specific the , and 
border  . all have their own and 
resource only shell have resources  ( another questions 
deals with why have a  . the default value of these 
resources is which does exactly what it says .  . in the 
shell gets as 
and  . when any one of the three resources is 
not properly set , a error occurs when the is 
created. they are not properly set because each of the values depends 
on the being used. 

how to get this to work there are two parts to the answer. the 
first is if you want an application to start with a particular 
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application 
to start with a different  . the second is actually easier 
because the basic information you need is available. the first is a 
little harder because you 'll need to much of the 
yourself in order to determine the needed information.

than the default  .

return  ( 0 ) 



5. which should an application use 


this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is 
no way for an application to know the appropriate it has to 
be by the user .  . if you disagree with this then your 
application probably falls into the category of always using the 
default or it is hardware specific and expects some particular 
such as with an extension  ( or some 
 . 

why no application runs in isolation .  . depending on the way a server 
resources i may not always want your application to run in 
mode if it is going to mess up my other applications .  . i may 
be very upset if it chooses to run in instead of 
or just  . 

as an example , on a low end color sun server there are many different 
possible , 256 entry , gray , 
color , and a 3 3 2  . the sgi 's offer all the above 
plus 12 bit , 24 bit , an plane .  . 


6. why do only shell have a 


this is strictly by  . it makes it possible for an arbitrary 
to know that the it uses can be found by looking for the 
shell that is its ancestor and obtaining the of that 
shell .  . 

a can have its own resource .  . if it does , it must have 
its own realize method to use the when it calls 
 . you should also make this a resource that can be 
obtained with  ( xtgetvalues( ) so other can find it. a 
reasonable value is probably  . 


7. which , depth and do inherit 


the default value for these resources are set to  . this 
is interpreted as the  ( defaultcolormapofscreen( ) ,  ( defaultdepthofscreen( ) 
and the default of the if the has no parent i.e. 
it is an and the root of your tree. 

if the parent of the is not null , then the shell copies 
and depth from its parent and uses as the 
 . 


8. i 've done all the above and i still get a error. why 


some resource improperly references .  . this was 
especially true of and earlier versions of  . 


9. why does n't my get when i call  ( xtdestroywidget( ) 


see section 2 . 8 . of the  . 

it eventually does get , just not immediately .  . the 
destroy a in a two process. first it and all 
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being  . 
it is then put on a list of to be  . this way any 
pending x events or further references to that can be cleaned 
up before the memory is actually freed .  . the second is then 
performed after all , event , and actions have 
, before checking for the next x event. at this point the 
list is and each 's memory is actually  ( free( ) 'd , among 
other things. 

as some further , the may be if the 
determine that they have no further references to the 
on the list. if so , then the 2 destruction occurs 
immediately .  . also , if nested event loops are used , placed on 
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not 
until returning to the outer event loop. 


10. how do i but still execute the 


the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to 
an application is used , such as calling  ( exit( ) directly , then a 
may not have a chance to clean up any external state such as open 
, temporary files , x resources , etc.  ( this code for 
reasons assumes only a single widget ) 



 ( gw ) 
to find 

top 

for  ( top  ( top ) top  ( top ) 
empty 
return  ( top ) 



 ( gw , , call data ) 

data the 
call data specific data 



 ( gw ) 
 ( toplevel ) make it disappear quickly 
 ( toplevel ) 
 ( 0 ) 


one can see that the above code 's immediately after destroying 
the  . the trouble is the 2 destruction may never 
occur .  . 

this works for most and most applications but will not work 
for those that have any external state. you might think that 
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the 
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant 
of the implementation details for each  . which means that the 
may change and someday require that some external state is 
cleaned up by the destroy  . 

one alternative is to  ( exitcallback( ) to set a flag and 
then test for that flag in a private event loop. however , private 
event loops are upon because it tends to encourage , and 
difficult to maintain practices .  . 

try the following code instead. 

include intrinsic . h .

11. how do i a shell 


after it is realized , one does n't a shell  . the proper 
thing is to the currently managed child of the shell 
using  . the geometry change is then to the 
shell which asks the which may or may not allow the 
request. however , the shell must have the resource 
set to true otherwise it will not even ask the 
to grant the request and the shell will not  . 

to change the position of a shell , use  ( xtsetvalues( ) on the shell , not 
the child , and within the limits of the it should be granted .  . 


12. why ca n't  ( xtappaddinput( ) handle files 


it does , however unix semantics for when i o is ready for a file does 
not fit most peoples  intuitive model .  . in unix terms a file 
is ready for reading whenever the  ( read( ) call would not 
block , ignoring the setting of optional that indicate not to 
block. this works as expected for , and  . for 
a file the  ( read( ) will always return but the return indicates an 
i.e. no more data .  . the result is the code in the always 
calls the because it always thinks something is about to 
be read. the culprit is the  ( select( ) system call or on based 
's it is the  ( poll( ) system call .  . 

how to get around this on a unix system the best approach is to use 
another process to check for available on the file. use a 
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file 
from the to  . a suitable program on 
systems is tail f . 

it 's that  ( select( ) on some systems is not completely 
reliable .  . in particular 

ibm aix 3 . 1 . this is one where it would work for a while 
 ( several thousand times ) and then stop until some other 
event it up. this seemed to be the result of a race 
condition in the  . ibm claims to have a fix for this. 

pyramid , does n't work at all. 

 ( and possibly others where are implemented as 
sockets ) , was n't completely broken , but although the writing 
side wrote in blocks the reading side received it 
all broken up as if it was being put into the a at 
a time. you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks 
 ( get it by the situation and having 
 ( select( ) ignore the for 10 by then it had 
been given the whole  . 


note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as 
 ( read( ) , file , , etc. this is an dependent area and 
may not be identical on all systems. however the intrinsic 
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with 
part of the  . why they did n't also deal with at this 
point i do n't know.

it a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full

16. how do i pass a value to 


first , what is going wrong is the structure for an is  ( essentially ) 


string name 
long value 


and the code 


 ( arg , name , 3 . 

to 


name . name 
value . 3 . 2 . 

you can see that with normal c type , the value . 
gets the integer 3 instead of the floating point value 3 . 2 . . when 
the value is copied into the resource , the bit pattern is 
different than that required for a floating point value. so , 
how to get around this 

the following macro is from the athena document and i am now 
it over the previous suggestions .  . 

define  ( xtsetfloatarg(arg , n , d ) 
if  ( sizeof(float )  ( sizeof(xtargval ) 
 ( xtsetarg(arg , n ,  ( d ) 
else

 ( xtsetarg(arg , n , ld ) 




17. how do i write a resource 


courtesy of rich 

the following discussion of resource assumes  ( or r5 ) 
 . resource changed between and to allow 
for and of converted values .  . 

there are several main types of resource 

string to data type 
data type to string 
data type to data type 

i ) string to data type 
usually a string to data type has a fixed set of 
that will be converted to data type values .  . this is most often 
used to map names to values 

name value 
true 1 
false 0 

in this case , the string to data type needs to compare 
the resource value to the list of fixed  . this is most 
readily accomplished by the use of the mechanism of the 
resource  . the resource value is turned into a , 
which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a 
single word. then the resource is compared against the 
for the fixed the values .  . 

if there are many in the  ( or many 
, each with a small number of strings ) , then 
a might be used to turn all the 
resource into  . that way , the first time one of 
these is used , the will be turned into 
and held in for use in the next of one 
of the  . 

ii ) data type to string 
this type of is slightly easier than the string to data 
type since the use of is n't necessary. instead , 
the data type value is simply converted to a string value , 
probably by the use of  . 

data type to string are useful for applications that 
wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that 
they can write out a valid resource to a file. this 
mechanism can be used to provide a of application state 
into a file. this can be used to the program to 
a known state via the usual x resource mechanisms .  . 

if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type 
, it is n't much extra effort to write the data type to 
string  . writing both at the same time helps to ensure 
that they are consistent .  . 

iii ) data type to data type 
this type of is used to convert an existing data type 
value to another data type .  . for instance , an x value can be 
converted to an data type that contains separate fields for 
red , green and blue .  . 


the type signature for a resource is as follows 

(  ( xttypeconverter)(display ) , , , 
, , ) 
display 




data 

when the is invoked , the argument points to the source 
x resource value and the argument points to the 
x resource value. the data argument 
is an pointer to some specific data that is 
when the is  . the and arguments 
allow extra information to be passed to the when it is 
invoked .  . for instance , the to structure discussed 
above would need and arguments in which to the 
to obtain the values to that  . 

care must be taken with the argument. an has the 
following type definition and a size and for a 
converted value 


size 
t 
, 

when the is invoked , the address may point to a of 
the given size for the converted value or the can be null .  . 
in the former case , the should ensure that the size of the 
area is large enough to handle the converted value. if 
the area is not large enough , then the should 
set the size to the amount of space needed and return false .  . the 
can then ensure that enough space is and the 
 . if the size is large enough , then the can simply 
copy the converted value into the space given and return true. 

if the is null , then the can assign the to 
the address of a containing the converted value and 
return true. 

when writing a group of , this code is often repeated and it 
becomes convenient to define a macro 

define  ( done(var , type ) 
if  ( toval addr ) 

if  ( toval size  ( sizeof(type ) 

size  ( sizeof(type ) 
return false 

else 
 ( type ) addr ) 

else 
 ( caddr t ) 
size  ( sizeof(type ) 
return true 

define  ( donestr(str ) 
if  ( toval size  ( sizeof(string ) 

size  ( sizeof(string ) 
return false 

else 
 ( caddr t ) 
size  ( sizeof(string ) 
return true 

inside the , it is a good idea to perform a little safety 
checking on the and arguments to ensure that your 
is being called properly. 

once you have written your , you need to it with the 
 . the resource when creating 
and their resource values from the resource  . 

to a with a single application context , use 


 ( xtappsettypeconverter(context , from , to , , , , 
, destructor ) 
context 
string from 
string to 






to a with all application , use 


 ( xtsettypeconverter(from , to , , , , 
, destructor ) 
string from 
string to 






in the , there were the routines and 
these have been by 
and  . whenever possible , the newer routines should be 
used. 

when a is with the , a argument 
how converted resource values are to be 

do n't any converted values 
all converted values 
converted values on a per display basis 

converted values that require a round trip to the server is a 
good idea  ( for instance string to  . 

the argument is a that is invoked then the 
resource is , either because its reference count has 
been to zero or because the the value is 
being  . has the following type definition 

(  ( xtdestructor)(xtappcontext ) , , , 
, ) 
context 
to 
data 



the is invoked to free any associated 
with the to argument , but does not actually free the pointed 
to by the to argument itself  ( to  . the is passed 
the extra arguments that were passed to the when the 
conversion was performed  ( for instance , and arguments 
for the string to since the would need to 
free the from the colormap ) as well as the private 
data passed in when the was  .

distribution

18 .  . how do i open multiple 


see user application software using , the x resource , issue 3 , 
 ( summer 1992) by jones for a complete of the issues 
involved. most of this answer is based on that article. in a 
nutshell , one uses  ( xtopendisplay( ) to add each display to a single 
application context and then  ( xtclosedisplay( ) to each display 
and remove it from the application context. 

the real problems occur when trying to close down a display .  . this can 
happen 3 ways 
1. user a quit on one of the , 
2. user has send a delete message , 
3. server possibly from a message , 
server crash , or network failure .  . 

i 'll assume you can deal with 1 2 since it is merely a 
problem of a to a display and removing that 
display .  . if not , then read the jones article. 

the third one is difficult to handle .  . the following is based on the 
jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult 
problem. 

the difficulty because the design that an i o 
error is always and so fatal .  . this is essentially true 
for a single display x based application , but not true for a 
multiple display program or an application that does things other than 
display information on an x server .  . when an x i o error occurs the 
i o error is called and if it returns then an  ( exit( ) 
happens. the only way around this is to use to avoid 
returning to the i o error  . the following code 
demonstrates this 

include h . 



 ( dpy ) 
display 

 ( dpy ) 
 ( xiorecover , 1 ) 


main () 

... 
if  ( setjmp  ( xiorecover ) 0 ) 
 ( xiohandler ) 
 ( app context ) 


the  ( destroydisplay( ) is something that given a display pointer can go 
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary 
 . it should also call  . 

for those of you with , when  ( setjmp( ) is 
first called it returns a 0 and save 's enough information in the 
that a latter execution of  ( longjmp( ) can return the program to 
the same state as if the  ( setjmp( ) was just executed .  . the return value 
of this second  ( setjmp( ) is the value of the second argument to 
 . there are several about using these but for this 
purpose it is adequate .  . 

some other problems you might run into are resource that 
improperly resources .  . the most likely symptoms are errors 
such as , , or  . there may be problems with the 
total number of you can open since typically only a limited 
number of file are available with 32 being a typical 
value. you may also run into problems when trying to 
connect to a display .  . 

there was much discussion in x . about this topic in 
of 91 .  . robert posted an article which basically 
said this is the way it will be and will not change .  .

this addresses only changes in the  . first , the general 
changes for each release are described .  . then a , certainly incomplete ,

20 .  . where are the resources loaded from 


the resources of a are filled in from the following places 
 ( from highest priority to lowest priority ) 

1. passed at creation time. 
2. command line arguments .  . 
3. user 's per host file 
4. user 's file. 
5. user 's per application default file. 
6. system wide per application default file. 

note that 2 6 are read only once on application  . the result 
of steps 3 6 is a single resource used for further  . 

the per host file contains for all 
applications executing on a specific computer .  . this file is either 
with the environment or if that is not 
set then the file home  . host is used. 

the user file is either obtained from the resource 
property on the root of the display or if that is not set then 
the file home  . is used. typically , the program is 
used to set the resource property .  . please note that this 
should be kept relatively small as each that to the 
display must the property .  . a size of around 1 is 
reasonable .  . some may track changes to the resource 
but most do not. 

a user may have many per application default files containing 
specific to each application .  . the are quite 
on how this file is found. read the next part that describes 
the various environment and how they effect where this file 
is found. 

the system wide per application default files are typically found in 
 . if such a file is not found then the 
resources are used. the are quite on how 
this file is found. read the next part that describes the various 
environment and how they effect where this file is found. 

thanks to jones for the following , 6 

you can use several environment to control how resources are 
loaded for your based programs , 
, and  . these environment 
control where looks for application files as an 
application is  . loads at most one file 
from the path defined in and another from the path 
defined in  . 

set if software is on your system in such a 
way that files appear in several different directory 
 . suppose , for example , that you are running sun 's open 
, and you also have some x applications in 
 . you could set a value like this for 
, and it would cause to look up files 
in both and  ( or wherever your 
is located ) 

t n t n 

the value of this environment is a colon separated list of 
 . the contain replacement characters as follows 
 ( see  ( xtresolvepathname( ) 

n the value of the , or the 
application 's class name. 
t the value of the file type . in this case , the 
literal string 
c resource  ( r5 only ) 
s  . none for  . 
l language , locale , and (e . g .  . ) 
l language part of l (e . g .  . ) 
t the territory part of the display 's language string 
c the part of the display 's language string 

let 's take apart the example. suppose the application 's class name is 
. also , suppose open is in  . 
 ( notice the example omits locale specific ) . 

t n means 
t n means 

as the application , tries to open both of the above 
files , in the order shown .  . as soon as it finds one , it 
reads it and uses it , and stops looking for others. the effect of 
this path is to search first in , then in  . 

let 's consider another example. this time , let 's set 
so it looks for the file ad . in the current 
working directory , then for in the directory  . 

. n . ad . home n 

the first path in the list to . ad .  . the second 
to home  . this is a convenient setting for 
because it follows the of the 
file ad . in the application 's source directory , so 
you can run the application from the directory in which you are 
working and still have the resources loaded properly. 

note when looking for default files with , 
for some bizarre reason , neither the type nor file is 
defined so t and s are useless. 

with , there 's another twist .  . you may a 
resource value. for example , you might run the application 
like this 

color 

if one of your had the value 
n c then the expanded would be 
color because the c 
character takes on the value of the resource .  . 

the default , compiled into , is 

l t n c  ( r5 ) 
l t n c  ( r5 ) 
t n c  ( r5 ) 
l t n 
l t n 
t n 

 ( note some sites replace with a in this 
of default ) . 

the default , also compiled into , is 

root l n c  ( r5 ) 
root l n c  ( r5 ) 
root n c  ( r5 ) 
root l n 
root l n 
root n 

root is either the value of or the user 's home directory 
if is not set .  . if you set to some 
value other than the default , altogether. 

notice that the quick and way of making your application find 
your file in your current working directory is to set 
to . , a single  . in , all this machinery worked 
differently for , many people set their 
value to . , a followed by a  . 



21 .  . what order are executed in 

 ( courtesy of converse , 5 10 92 ) 

the library do not an order. this is because 
both the writer and the application writer have the ability to 
the entire contents of the list. neither one 
currently knows what the other is doing and so the cannot 
the order of execution .  . 

the application programmer cannot rely on the writer the 
writer is not required to document when the will add and 
remove from the list or what effect this will have 
therefore the contained in a should be 
independent of the contained in other on the 
list. 

even though the standard in the definition of 
says 

name the list to which the 
procedure is to be  . 

you may not infer from the word that the routines

22 .  . how do i know if a is 

 ( courtesy of converse , 5 14 92 ) 

i am building a needs to know if it is  . i set the 
interest field in core and if my is completely , the core 
flag goes false .  . however , if my is , the flag 
set to true. 

right , everything is implemented correctly. this demonstrates a 
in the x , and the core is the capabilities of the 
 .  ( the is that the information is available in one way , 
in this case an way . ) . the is accurate , in 
the second and third of section 7 . 10 . 2 . , so read this section 
carefully .  . the field will not change in response to  . 

a event will not be received when the goes from 
to , that is , when the or an ancestor is 
that is , when occurs .  . this is the  . 
state and state have specific meanings in the x 
see the in your and x reference manual .  . 

is this a problem with or is there something 
else which needs to be done 

you 'll see this with any , with no  . 

if the problem is , what is the 
way to determine if a is 

as an application writer , keep track with a in an action 
with translations for and on the shell 
which contains your  . as the writer , see the 
map state field returned by a call to  . these are 
suggestions .  . 


23 .  . how do i a in , i.e.  ( xtreparentwidget( ) 


you ca n't .  . 


24 .  . why use , , etc 


unfortunately , most code that calls  ( malloc( ) ,  ( realloc( ) or  ( calloc( ) 
tends to ignore the possibility of returning null .  . at best it is 
something like 

 ( type )  ( sizeof  ( type ) 
if ( ! ptr ) 

( in  ( xyzzy( ) ) 
(1) 

to handle this common case the define the functions 
 ( xtmalloc( ) ,  ( xtcalloc( ) ,  ( xtnew( ) ,  ( xtnewstring( ) and  ( xtrealloc( ) which 
all use the standard c language functions  ( malloc( ) ,  ( calloc( ) and 
 ( realloc( ) but execute  ( xterrormsg( ) if a null value is returned .  . 
error are not supposed to return so this effectively  . 

in addition , if  ( xtrealloc( ) is called with a null pointer , it uses 
 ( xtmalloc( ) to get the initial space .  . this allows code like 

if ( ! ptr ) 
 ( type )  ( sizeof  ( type ) 
else 
 ( type )  ( ptr ,  ( type )  ( count 1 ) 
count 

to be written as 

 ( ptr ,  ( ptr ) count ) 

also ,  ( xtfree( ) accepts a null pointer as an argument. generally , i 've 
found the functions to use. however , anytime i'm 
anything large i use the standard functions so 
i can fully from not enough memory errors. 

 ( xtnew( ) and  ( xtnewstring( ) are for a 
structure or copying a string 

abc 



 ( struct abc ) takes care of type casting 
 ( str ) 

a strict interpretation of the reference manual allow an 
implementation to provide functions that are not with 
 ( malloc( ) and  . i.e. code such as 



 ( 100 ) 
... 
free  ( ptr ) 

may not work. personally , i 'd call any implementation that did this 
broken and complain to the  . 

a common error for is to use  ( xtfree( ) on a string 
when they should really be using  . 


25 .  . how to an application 

first , i 'd getting from pure software .  . this is a 
great for memory problems on sun 's .  . it 's a bit 
at but i 'd still it. excuse the blurb 
 ( contact for more  . 

additional checking instructions directly into 
the object code produced by existing compilers .  . these 
instructions check every memory read and write performed by 
the program under test and detect several types of access 
errors , such as reading memory , writing past 
'd bounds , or writing to freed memory. 
checking logic into all of the code in a program , including 
third party and object code , and 
system call  . in addition , memory 
usage and identifies individual memory using a novel 
of garbage collection techniques .  . 's nearly 
comprehensive memory access checking the target program 
down typically by a factor of two to five .  . 

an alternative that is n't as ( for a sun ) , runs on 
many unix 's and has pretty similar features is the 
environment . this  ( malloc( ) and several other c library 
functions to add additional  .  ( contact 
for more info ) 

next , if you are getting any sort of error , you 'll need to run in 
mode , easily accomplished with the command line 
argument or by setting the to 1 with your  . then 
set a break point in  . this will let you trace back to the 
original function being called .  . if you do n't run in 
mode , then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to 
previously since the calls are and replies from the 
server are  . 

next , if you are having trouble with , you can use the 
resource or the class resource 
to cause the name to be identified with each  . 
for example 

example ' true  
example tree 
click in new 

will give the normal information but the name and class of each 
is included. this can help for checking the and size 
of  . 

next , if you are having trouble with geometry or you want to 
test the way a manages it 's children , you can try 
mit . edu . z .  . this acts as a filter 
between any children and a geometry and the behaviour 
of both. it 's a very clever idea. 

the most unfortunate problem is a while the 
application is executing a of the keyboard or  ( such as from 
a  . the server effectively up and you 'll need to 
go to another machine and kill the  . the server 
up because the application being has said no one else 
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped 
waiting because the is waiting for your commands .  . 
unfortunately you ca n't give them because all the is going to 
your application which is stopped .  . 

the best way to this kind of problem is with two machines on 
your , running the program under a  ( or other environment ) 
on one machine , and running the application on the other , possibly 
using a command sequence like this 


display 0 
application your favorite  . 
or this 

application 
 ( gdb ) set environment display 0 
 ( gdb ) run ... 

i believe , a c has a method 
of dealing with this by calling the functions to 
release any grabs during  . 

problems requires pretty good and 
knowledge of how work. you can go a long way without knowing 
the of a particular but not very far without 
understanding how a works. judicious use of conditional 
and adding print statements with the help a great 
deal. 


26 .  . why do n't  ( xtaddinput( ) ,  ( xtaddtimeout( ) and  ( xtaddworkproc( ) work 

i have got a problem with the three routines , 
and  . the problem i have is that when 
i use them in my application they seem not to be properly. 
i have made a little where everything works 
perfect , but in my real application nothing happens. 

the introduction in of the () functions those 
routines  ( see for other changes in , , and  . what happens is 
they use a default application context different then the one you may 
have created. since events and are on a per 
application context basis and you are using two application , 
you wo n't get those events. 

for example 

... 
0 
 ( xtappinitialize , class , 
,  ( desc ) , 
, , 
, , cnt ) 

( .  .  . ) .

27 .  . what is and how can i implement and drop 

 ( courtesy of roger , 19 feb 93 ) 

n drop is a for moving data between , in an 
  fashion .  . 

version 1.2 supports n drop capabilities , has 
supported d n d all along. the two protocols are not with 
each other , and so far as i know , they are not published .  . 

i wrote a called which is designed to be a public 
for doing  n drop between  . my 
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to 
support a standard n drop in the programs they develop 
and contribute or sell , regardless of what set is used  ( as long 
as it is based on  . 

the implementation is based upon my understanding of the 
conventions , for more details read the code. 

i have heard from of people using who like it and feel that 
it works a whole lot better than 1.2 stuff. also , there seem to 
be many who think that it is neat but are to use 
anyway. 

the latest  ( and some other stuff ) is available for ftp from 
netcom . com . , in pub  . a  ( possibly older ) version is also 
available on mit . edu . in  .

in article  ( ken whaley ) writes 
actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why 
do n't show up do you wait for an event before drawing your 
rectangle 

suppose you have an idle with a realized and that contains 
 . a , when pressed , will cause a new item 
to be drawn in the  . this action clearly should not call  ( xcopyarea( ) 
 ( or equiv ) directly instead , it should the existence of the new 
item in a memory structure and let the event take care 
of the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the 
is  . 

the problem , of course , is that no event is generated if the 
is and  . do you know the best way to a so 
that the event will be invoked to draw this new item 

i specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code 
came from a simple open draw quit  . 

as per your question why not have the add the object , and 
then call the  ( redraw( )  ( or whatever ) directly although , depending 
on how the overall application is , there may be no problem with 
the object directly in response to the press.

yes. you 'll find it almost impossible without the source

be good for very large lists , but you might consider this

, if anyone has a list they

does it by any chance exist in 1.2 already (i do not

1.2 does not have a list in it. have you

x 
x 
and suggestions 
x 
x you are encouraged to examine the of previous  . see 
x for more information for details on how to get previous  . 
x 
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year , so some 
x may not be valid this year .  . what was unique and novel one year 
x might be  old  the next year .  . 
x 
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply 
x a number of to an entry 
x 
x look at the original source 
x convert tri to ascii 
x c pre process the source ignoring ' include  lines 
x c pre process the source ignoring ' define  and ' include  lines 
x run it through a c 
x examine the 
x it 
x it 
x execute it 
x 
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above  . 
x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been 
x  cleaned up  by the c pre processor and a c  . 
x 
x your entry need not do well under all , or in most  . in certain 
x cases , a test is not important. that for the 
x  most creative source  need not do as well as 
x others in terms of their  . on the other hand , given 
x two such , we are more inclined to pick the entry that 
x does something interesting when you run it. 
x 
x we try to avoid limiting in our rules. as such , we leave 
x the open for creative rule interpretation .  . as in real life 
x programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request 
x is important. for this reason , we often award  worst abuse of the 
x rules  to an entry that this point in an ironic way. 
x 
x if you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know 
x in the remarks section .  . please note that an invitation to abuse 
x is not an invitation to break .  . we are strict when it comes to the 
x size limit .  . also , the entry format tends to 
x annoy more than  . 
x 
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules , and 
x to attempt to them. we will award  worst abuse of the rules  
x and then plug the hole next year .  . even so , we will attempt to use 
x the smallest plug needed , if not smaller .  . ) 
x 
x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make 
x the effort to an entry that has a slight problem , particularly 
x in or near the final round. on the other hand , we have seen some 
x of the best fall down because they did n't work. 
x 
x we tend to look down on a prime number , that claims that 
x 16 is a prime number .  . if you do have a bug , you are better off 
x it. this entry sometimes the 4th power 
x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry .  . and sometimes , 
x a strange bug feature can even help the entry ! of course , a correctly 
x working entry is best. 
x 
x 
likes and 
x 
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become  . we 
x tend to  see thru  masses of defines due to our pre processor 
x that we apply. simply defines or bar wo n't go as far 
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion. 
x 
x many c compilers dislike the following code , and so do we 
x 
x define d define 
x d do n't expect this to turn into define 
x 
x i 
x j do n't use such type declaration 
x k 
x 
x we suggest that you your entry with an c  . if you 
x must use non c , such as k r c , you must avoid areas that result in 
x link errors for c compilers .  . 
x 
x unfortunately , some c compilers require to be of 
x integral type .  . thus , the following classical should 
x not be used in 1993 .  . this rule may be in future  . 
x 
x i 
x c 
x i c use c i instead 
x (i 3) string use string i 3 instead 
x 
x if your entry uses functions that have a number of 
x arguments , be careful .  . systems implement va list as a wide variety 
x of ways. because of this , a number of using va list are 
x not and must not be used 
x 
x a non va list to from a va list 
x casting a non va list into from a va list 
x passing a va list to a function expecting a non va list 
x passing a non va list to a function expecting a va list 
x arithmetic on va list 
x using va list as a structure or union 
x 
x in particular , do not treat va list as if they were a 's .  . 
x 
x avoid using h . , use h . instead. 
x 
x if you use c ( define , if , ,  .  .  . ) . , 
x the ' ' must be the first character on a line. while some 
x c allow the ' ' , many do not. 
x 
x because the  ( exit( ) function returns on some systems , 
x must not assume that it returns an  . 
x 
x small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise .  . 
x while such programs are not as complex as other , they do 
x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people 
x attempt to completely understand. for this reason , we look for 
x programs that are , and are  . 
x 
x one line programs should be short one line programs , say around 80 
x long .  . getting close to is a bit too long in our opinion. 
x 
x we tend to dislike programs that 
x 
x are very hardware specific 
x are very or un x version specific 
x  ( index differences are ok , but specific 
x code is likely not to be ) 
x dump core or have warnings 
x  ( it is ok only if you warn us in the  remark  item ) 
x wo n't under both or sys v un x 
x the build file to get around the size limit 
x by excessive use of tri 
x are longer than they need to be 
x are similar to previous 
x are identical to previous ) 
x 
x unless you are for space , or unless you are entering the 
x  best one  category , we suggest that you format your program 
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines. 
x 
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size 
x limit .  . it is one thing to make use of a several d 's to help out , 
x but it is quite another to use 200 of d 's in order to 
x try and the source under the size limit .  . you should feel 
x free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off 
x if you show some amount of  . 
x 
x we allowed , and in certain cases or do not impact 
x your program size  ( up to a certain point ) , because we want to get 
x away from source that is simply a of characters. 
x 
x given two versions of the same program , one that is a 
x of code , and the other that is more like a typical c 
x program , we tend to favor the second version. of course , a third 
x version of the same program that is in an interesting 
x and or way , would definitely win over the first two ! 
x 
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the  smallest self replicating  
x program .  . we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim 
x to be the smallest .  . there is nothing wrong with self replicating 
x programs. in fact , a number of have been self replicating .  . 
x you might want to avoid the claim of  smallest  , lest we  ( or others ) 
x know of a smaller one ! 
x 
x x should be as as possible. that 
x adapt to a wide collection of will be  . do n't 
x depend on a particular type of display .  . for example , do n't depend 
x on color or a given size. do n't require backing  . 
x 
x x should avoid using x related and 
x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x 
x restrict themselves to only the low level and the 
x athena set a . , a . , a . and  . 
x do n't use m , , or ok , since not everyone 
x has them. avoid depending on a particular  . not 
x everyone has , and some people are stuck back in  ( or 
x earlier ) , so try to target without requiring  . better 
x yet , try to make your entry run on all version 11 x systems. 
x 
x x should not to depend on particular items on 
x  .  . if you must do so , be sure to note the required lines 
x in the remark section .  . 
x 
x we like programs that 
x 
x are as concise and small as they need to be 
x do something at least interesting 
x pass without complaint  ( not a requirement , but it is nice ) 
x are 
x are unique or novel in their style 
x make use of a number of different types of

x 
x some types of programs ca n't in some areas .  . of course , your 
x program does n't have to in all areas , but doing well in several 
x areas really does help. 
x 
x we freely admit that interesting , creative or comments in 
x the remark section helps your chance of  . if you had to

x we think the readers of the do as well.

format 
x 
x in order to help us process the many , we must request your 
x assistance by your in a certain way. this format , 
x in addition , allows us to quickly separate information about the 
x author from the program itself.  ( see judging process) 
x 
x we have provided the program , , as an example of how to 
x format  . you should be aware of the following warning that 
x is found in c . 
x 
x this program attempts to implement the rules. every 
x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces 
x an entry that to the rules. in all cases , 
x where this program differs from the rules , the 
x rules will be used. be sure to check with the 
x rules before an entry .  . 
x 
x you are not required to use  . it is convenient , however , 
x as it attempts to the needed files , and attempt to check 
x the entry against the size rules.

x 
x if your entry depends on , or requires that your build , source

x if you did one of the following

x tell us how to change the  ( filename(s ) in your entry .  .

x have the build file make copies of the files. for example

x your original build , source and files. you should 
x to make copies of the files you intend to  . this

x 
x remember that your entry may be built without a build file. we 
x typically incorporate the build lines into a  . if the 
x build file must exist , say so in the remark section .  . 
x 
x if your entry needs special info files , you should them 
x into info sections .  . in the case of multiple info files , 
x use multiple info sections .  . if no info files are needed , 
x then the info section .  . 
x 
x info files are intended to be , or detailed information that 
x does not fit well into the remark section .  . for example , an 
x entry that a might want to provide some 
x programs for the user to  . an entry might want to include a 
x lengthy design document , that might not be appropriate for a 
x  hints  file. 
x 
x info files should be used only to your entry .  . for 
x example , info files may provide or detailed 
x information about your entry .  . because they are ,

x apr 01 00 47 00 1993 
x 
x this format is similar to the output of the  ( date(1 ) command. the

x are into individual  . the email message

x entry section 
x all author sections 
x all info sections

x any other text , including the email message 
x 
x prior to judging , the  any other text  file is to be sure 
x it does not contain useful information  ( or in case the entry was 
x and did not  . information from the 
x author sections are not read until the judging process is 
x complete , and then only from that have won an award .  . 
x 
x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular 
x individual .  . we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are 
x until the final are given. we like the surprise of finding 
x out in the end , who won and where they were from. 
x 
x we attempt to keep all anonymous , unless they win an award .  . 
x because the main  prize  of is being , we make all 
x attempts to send non into  . we remove all non 
x files , and all related paper. by tradition , we do not even 
x reveal the number of that we received .  .  ( for the curious , 
x we do indicate the volume of paper when presenting the 
x at talks ) 
x 
x after the announcement , we attempt to send email to the 
x authors of the  . one reason we do this is to give 
x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their 
x entry .  . they are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos .  . we 
x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well. 
x this is done prior to posting the to the wide world. 
x 
x judging consists of a number of elimination  . during a round , 
x the collection of are divided into two roughly equal 
x the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does 
x not. we also re examine the that were eliminated in the 
x previous round. thus , an entry gets at least two readings .  . 
x 
x a reading consists of a number of actions 
x 
x reading the entry section 
x reading the build section 
x reading the program section 
x reading the info  ( section(s ) , if any 
x passing the source thru the c pre processor 
x over any include files 
x a number of c on the source 
x passing the source thru the c pre processor 
x over any include files 
x 
x in later , other actions are performed 
x 
x the source 
x building the source 
x running the program 
x misc on the source and 
x 
x until we reduce the stack of down to about 25 , 
x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it 
x does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round. 
x when the number of to about 25 , we begin to form 
x award categories .  . begin to with each other for  . 
x an entry often will in several categories .  . 
x 
x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of 
x we receive .  . a typical category list might be 
x 
x best small one line program 
x best small program 
x most creative source 
x most useful program 
x best game that is 
x most program 
x most c code 
x best x  ( see our likes and dislikes ) 
x best abuse of c 
x worst abuse of the rules 
x anything else so strange that it deserves an award 
x 
x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example , a few are so 
x good bad that they are declared at the start of the final round. 
x we will invent categories for them , if necessary. 
x 
x in the final round process , we perform the difficult of 
x reducing the remaining  ( typically about 25 ) down to 8 or 10 
x  . often we are confident that the that make it into 
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not 
x make it. the selection of the out of the final round , is 
x less clear cut. 
x 
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is out 
x by a similar , but slightly better entry .  . for this reason , it is 
x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry 
x that failed to win in a previous year .  . this assumes , of course , 
x that the entry is worth improving in the first place ! 
x 
x more often that not , we select a small entry  ( usually one line ) , a 
x strange creative entry , and an entry that abuses the 
x rules in some way. 
x 
x in the end , we traditionally pick one entry as  . sometimes such 
x an entry simply far any of the other entry .  . more often , the 
x  best  is picked because it does well in a number of categories .  .

subject 96 ) what is this strange problem building x on 4 . 1 . 2 . 

in 4 . 1 . 2 . sun fixed a shared library bug in which conflicts 
with the way the shared library , causing these symbols to be

contact your local sun office and request the following

subject 97 ) why ca n't on my 
i used to the whole distribution , but i get several 
when running x. 

note first that on risc machines does not necessarily result in 
any increase it certainly is not as as it is on the 
or vax  . 

here is the problem and cc use incompatible methods of passing 
structures as arguments and returning them as function values , so when 
compiled parts of x are linked with sun functions that pass or 
return , run time errors occur .  . affected programs include and 
the server .  . 

this is from the manual 

on the , cc uses an incompatible calling for 
structures .  . it passes them by including their contents in the argument 
list , whereas the standard passes them effectively by 
reference. 

this really ought to be fixed , but such calling conventions are not yet 
supported in cc , so it is n't straightforward to fix it. 

the for structure returning is also incompatible , and 
` return  does not help. 

you can the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just 
the routines which cause the problem cannot be solved with 
compilation  . 

files which need to be compiled using cc include 
server 4 . c . 
c . 

in addition , several of the functions use as or 
return values 
c . 
c .  . 
calls to in c . and x c . are possibly 
harmless as they do n't involve  .

subject 98 ) what are these i o errors running x built with 
when i try to run or the server i get the error 
getting interface operation not supported on  . 
fatal server bug ! no found. 

running the apparently did n't work. you can do 
this simple test 

include sys h . 


run that through cc e and e. the last line of output is the piece of 
interest it should be identical  ( modulo irrelevant differences like 
 . if the version has  x  where the cc version has  i  , your 
run did n't work for some reason or other go back to your 
sources and run then the x distribution .  . if they are 
identical , try running a make clean in mit server and , just to make 
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

all of the that i try to run have the following results 
so . so . 4 . not found

so . call to procedure from 

if you are building with shared on a sun , remember that you 
need to run as root after the shared  ( if you 've 
x on a file server , run it on the server 's , too) .  . while 
building and the distribution , you need to be careful to avoid 
against any existing x shared you might have (e . g .  . those 
with  . you should make sure you do not have 
library path set in your environment during the build or the  . 
if you are going to keep and as programs , please note that 
the shared must be in , local , or 
for these programs to work  ( or else those programs must be linked 
 . courtesy mit x 
note also that the program is run as part of the build it 
attempts , however , to use the shared before they have been  . 
you can avoid the errors by building  ( pass to

there is a security problem with certain  ( xterm and xload ) 
running under 4 . 1 . that have been root and are using 
shared to avoid the problem , do one of these 
1 ) make the program non  . you should consult your system 
administrator concerning protection of resources (e . g .  . and kmem ) used 
by these programs , to make sure that you do not create additional security 
problems at your site.

on many systems the frame is by default this 
anyone who can log into your workstation to at your by

subject 105 ) topic building x programs 

subject 106 ) what is 

is not a replacement for the make program instead , it is a 
that takes of the include file and macro 
capabilities of the c to generate 
suitable for building software on a particular system. although it is not 
specific to x , the x release uses it to help solve a number of the 
issues that arise in making such a large system widely  . 
has a fairly learning curve , in part because the process by 
which the system specific files , system independent 
files , and individual are to produce a is not 
obvious. 
there have been several different versions of the , , and 
versions are different. 

you can obtain information on from these sources

using to build x

versions are with the and  . an earlier 
version is with the release some third party 
versions of along with their own of the 
and files. there are no real standards for such 
files , although most current contributed software expects the 
with  . 
contains the distribution , so you can pick up 
without picking up the entire distribution .  . 
a stand alone version of , but one from , is in 
ftp . germany . eu . net . pub misc pure . z . 76 .  . 


subject 108 ) i have a program with an but no  . what to do 

if you have or on your system , run . this is a 
which runs for you with the correct arguments .  . the output is a 
for your system and based on the  . then run make , 
which will use that new to the program .  . 


subject 109 ) why ca n't i link to the shape routines 
when i try to certain programs , i get the following link error 




these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x  ( shape ) 
which was introduced in the mit distribution and allows non rectangular 
 . like the other server , the shape extension will 
only run on a server which supports it. pre , as well as many 
, do not support the shape extension , in which case 
they will display rectangular anyway. 

in order to use the shape extension , you must link to the library 
a .  . in the distribution , this library and the associated includes 
will be in the mit directory .  . if you do not have these files , do 
not many programs which use the shape extension can also be 
compiled without it by removing the define from the you can 
probably do this and successfully against your older x 
 .

subject 110 ) what are these problems with not found on the sun 
when i run a x program that i wrote on a 4 . 0 . 3 . or 4 . 1 . machine i get the 
error so . symbol not found . 

what you are seeing is a side effect of a in the a . to 
get sun shared working .  . apparently , you ca n't share a function that 
is both called and compared , as is. this was by putting 
in the same file as a function that is always used , thereby 
that it would be loaded that is , in c . , where 
 ( xttoolkitinitialize( ) and  ( xtinitialize( ) reside .  . these routines would normally 
be called .  . 

you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal 
based program and does not call  ( xttoolkitinitialize( ) anywhere. 
1 ) it may be a program that uses functions but never a 
connection to the x server .  . 's 1 . 1 . 0 . had this problem it called 
 ( xtmalloc( ) and other functions .  . the solution is to add the call to your 
program the function does not have to be executed , just linked in. 
2 ) , your program does n't need any functions and is 
correct in not calling  ( xttoolkitinitialize( ) it may be an or 
program .  . in this case , you can remove from your link command. 

it should not be necessary to link the shared , 
although this will certainly solve the problem.

subject 111 ) why ca n't i my programs under the new x 
i have a program that worked well under  . when i try to link it under 
the current version of x , i get this message 





there were several name changes in the athena set  ( in addition 
to the files moving into ) these are mentioned in the 
release notes .  . in this case , these functions are not really functions but 
are part of the text and so have been from to .

subject 113 ) why does n't my program get the i select for  ( sic ) 

the how the focus is transferred from one 
to another. in order to get , your program must ask the 
for the focus .  . to do this , you must set up what are 
called hints for the  . if your applications is based , you 
can use something like the following 


... 

true 
 ( xsetwmhints(dpy , , wmhints ) 

if your application is based on the , you can set the 
resource to be true  ( as you probably want to in any case ) if you do n't have 
source , you can start up the application with the resource '  . 

certain , notably and , are very about having 
this done. 

if you are using sun 's , you can also add this resource 
to your file to use that are n't  . 
true

subject 114 ) how do i figure out what is running 

you ca n't tell whatever mechanism you could use could be 
in any case. 
for most cases , you should n't care which is running , so 
long as you do things in an manner. there are some cases in 
which particular are known to do things wrong checking for 
particular hints placed on the by the so that you can 
the problem may be appropriate in these cases. , it may 
be appropriate to determine which is running in order to take 
advantage of specific added features  ( such as 's push pin menus ) in order 
to give your program added  . beware of the 
's functions by providing that even when it is missing 
this surely leads to future problems. 


subject 115 ) is there a x program available 

there is no general such as the program for the 
which handles lots of the odds and ends and of development 
under a system and which can be used as a for additional 
development .  . in x , the problem is typically solved by using an interactive 
application tool or by using cut paste on existing x applications .  . good 
applications which you might look to when you want to test just 
this one little thing include , a simple program that 
puts up a and allows in it and a starting point for 
quick , the examples in the examples directory in the and 
, and the world example in the doc and 
doc an updated version of this program which uses 
calls and current conventions was posted in 2 90 to x .

in addition , a program  ( for or xm ) by 
showing how to open multiple and how to a broken display 
connection is available on mit . edu . in z .  . 4 


subject 116 ) why does not work for me  ( sic ) 

the interface for resources from a is 
sensitive to the type of  . your code may be doing something like this 

3 
i 
sensitive oops wrong data type 
i 0 
 ( args i , , sensitive ) i 
 ( xtgetvalues(widget , , i ) 
... 


but is a , which on most machines is a single 
declaring the sensitive as works properly. this problem 
comes up often when using particular that redefine the types 
dimension and position code that assumes they are will have similar 
problems if those types are actually short .  . in general you are safe if you 
use the actual type of the resource , as it appears in the 's man page .  .

subject 117 ) why do n't work 

you 're probably trying to use these functions from application code. 
they should be used only internally to these functions are for a 
parent to change the geometry of its children. other promising 
functions ,  ( xtmakegeometryrequest( ) and  ( xtmakeresizerequest( ) , are also for use 
only by , in this case by a child to request a change from its parent .  . 
the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a 
is to issue an call setting some of the geometry resources .  . 
although this will result in the internal functions  being called , your 
application code must use the standard interface or risk the 
 data becoming corrupted .  . 
the calls  ( xmovewindow( ) and  ( xresizewindow( ) should similarly be 
avoided they should n't be used to change , , , or  . 


subject 118) why is n't there an call like 

although there are various details of the current implementation of 
the which make difficult , the major reason that no 
such call exists is that it remains what the set of resources for 
the new should be. resources are typically set based on the 
in the instance what resources should change if the instance 
what should happen to the 's children and by the time such semantics are 
defined , there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old 
and creating a new in the correct with the desired 
resources , as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in 
creating a new  . 

note that is possible in the  .

i posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was 
able to help me. 

the problem is that main win . win . is doing fine , but when i create 
detail win . win . , it does not receive it 's initial events until 
main win . win . an event. here are the relevent calls 

main win . win .  ( mydisplay ,  ( defaultrootwindow(mydisplay ) , 
x . , y . , , , 
main win . line . thick , , bg ) 
 ( xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay , main win . win . , main win . text . , 
main win . text . , none , , , myhint ) 
main win .  ( mydisplay , main win . win . , 0 , 0 ) 
 ( mydisplay , detail win . 
 ( mydisplay , main win . 
the event for main win is 


the are 


i then create detail win . win . with the following calls  ( hints has new values ) 
detail win . win .  ( mydisplay ,  ( defaultrootwindow(mydisplay ) , 
x . , y . , , , 
detail win . line . thick , , bg ) 
 ( xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay , main win . win . , detail win . text . , 
detail win . text . , none , , , myhint ) 
detail win .  ( mydisplay , detail win . win . , 0 , 0 ) 
 ( mydisplay , detail win . 
event and are identical to main win 's and event  . 

if anybody has any idea why the initial events of detail win . win . 
are not received until main win . win . an event i 'd love to hear 
from them. other that that everything works great so there must be some 
detail i'm  . 

thanks for any

i'm working on an application and have concerns regarding 
standard  . 

the documentation says usually , a creates 
these  . i wonder what the writer had 
in mind. neither or seem to create standard  . 

of course , one can use to create standard  . 
however , does n't seem to try very hard to avoid 
conflicts with the default  . when i use standard 
created by , the rest of my display goes black .  . 
so it seems as if use of standard causes the very 
problem standard are intended to avoid .  . perhaps 
if every application used standard , things would 
be wonderful .  . but not many applications seem to use

i am trying to use to copy a single plane 
from a depth 8 to a depth 1  . i 
try this , i see absolutely nothing  . i know there 
is data in the depth 8 becuase i have checked by doing 
an to the screen. 

i have been successful getting to work if i use 
two of depth 8. is there a problem with what i am 
trying to do 

could someone please my code segment and let me know 
where i am going wrong .  .  .  . 

i have created a called  . 

w id  ( xtwindow(canvas )

 ( display ) 
 ( display ,  ( display , screen ) , 
w , w ,  ( display , screen ) 
 ( display ,  ( display , screen ) , 
w , w , 1 ) 

w  ( display , w id , 0 , null ) 
w  ( display , , 0 , null ) 

code to read image into is 


have you set the and background in w to 
something other than 0 and 1 the and 
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1  . 


copy one plane into the depth 1 
 ( display , , , 
w , 0 , 0 , w , w , 0 , 0 , 16 ) 


are you sure that the plane of the data is n't all the same you could 
have different values in the image , but the plane  ( 0x10 16 ) 
might all be the same value 


using the depth 1 as the , copy it to the 
values . color 
values . clip . x origin 0 
values . clip . y origin 0 
values . clip . 

 ( display , w , , values ) 

 ( display , w id , w , 0 , 0 , w , w height ) 



if you just want to see the plane of data and want better , 
do n't use , just use as the in a 
rectangle fill .  . many are very stupid about handling complex 
clip lists , and turn a clip into hundreds and hundreds of 
little , and every drawing primitive against every 
one of these little  . 


actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why 
do n't show up do you wait for an event before drawing your 
rectangle

what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls i am curious to find 
out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running 
x is supporting multiple users  ( clients ) and we require adequate response 
time. anyone have any ideas 

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network 
itself. to give you a real world example , here at we have 
roughly 100 people using to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , 
file , and each other. it 's not too much of a load on our 
 ( with maybe 4 , so you have 20 30 people on each 
 . if you had a loaded net , or the you wanted to run 
were very network , you could run into some  . 

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself. say you have a 
33 with plenty of and a fast hard and network card .  . if you have 
10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some 
because you 're now on  ( effectively ) a 3 . 3 .  . of course , will 
attempt to see if are idle and make sure they give up their time 
, but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it. 

having said that , if you can the programs being run  ( by adding 
in calls to give up time when idle and that sort of 
thing ) , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before 
you started seeing again  ( this time from network  . 
it all really depends on what the programs are doing  . you 're going 
to see a from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your are all 
doing network things also .  .  . ) .

i posted this a while ago and did n't receive one reply , and now we 
have another bug report on the same subject. can anybody help me out 

the problem is that uses to implement , 
and these grabs are specific about which apply. unfortunately , 
the for does n't allow to be combined 
with other , which is exactly what would be desired in this case 
ctrl any key q . 

in vol. 6 , in the section on it says for information 
on how to translation see vol. 4 .  .  .  . , this is so you 
know what to put for the resource .  . if you go to 
vol. 4 it says , likewise , if a is , there is 
nothing to other from being present as well. for 
example , the translation 
shift key q  ( quit( ) 
will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as 
the shift key  ( and the q  . 

this is true for and , which are implemented using 
event instead of grabs it 's not true for  . if 
you 're a , i 'd suggest lobbying to get the semantics 
changed to support the feature i described above. otherwise , change the 
documentation for to properly set the user 's 
expectations , because are not the same thing as 
translations .  . 

is it possible to supply 1 for a entry 

if you mean , no it 's not possible. that 's according to 
the definition of the resource in the manual page .  . 

keep in mind when answering this question that when using you 
ca n't use  . 

i ca n't think of a reason why not. 

how can you ensure that work the same independent of 
case what i want is ctrl o and ctrl o to both be on one 
entry .  . 

i find this thread on amazing .  . if i were 
writing an interface to keyboard , i would have one 
resource called that took a translation table , period. 
i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work 
to get the  . as soon as the end user 
one , it would be active and automatically  . 

to get multiple on a single item i 'd do something like 

n 
ctrl key m  ( fire( ) n 
shift key l  ( fire( ) n 

the would work exactly like translations and you would 
automatically see a ctrl m show up in your object. 

why in the world is the stuff so complicated with so many different 
special cases depending on what type of you 're dealing with there 
has to be some reason. 

sorry for the political tone of this message .  .  .  .

this is because the warning you read is incomplete .  . you have to

there is another problem i ca n't find anything to indicate that 
makes any sense as the border to

as zero , to simplify the conversion to wire format , so 
you are asking for a border of zero , due to the 
implementation not providing stricter type checking .  .  ( to be fair , i'm 
not entirely certain it 's possible for to this . ) .

software engineering  ( pascal c unix ) , computer engineering  ( 6502

two ways 

1 ) when you start the , you can use command line options 
n name to set the label 
t title to set the title 
title title equivalent to t title 

2 ) you can use escape sequences to change things on the 

the basic escape sequence is 
p some arbitary text 

where and are the ascii escape and bell characters , 
p is an ascii  2  ,  1  , or  0  , depending 
on whether you are trying to set the or title , 
or both , and some arbitary text is your desired label string .  . 

hence , this command will set the title 
0 your title goes here c 

to set just the title 
1 your title goes here c 

to set just the title 
2 your title goes here c 

of course , you may have to with exact , 
depending on how the command works on your system 
and what shell you are using (i 've shown system v semantics 
under or  . 

hint for sun users use instead of 
or 's built in  . otherwise you 'll have 
to literal and characters in the string 
instead of using convenient sequences .  . 

if you want your updated , say to show 
your current directory , , or , then you 'll 
have to see if you can your shell into out 
the appropriate escape sequences when it for commands .  . 
sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence

a few days ago i posted my announcement for an update of . i got 
several requests to send the per e mail , and i know of several people 
who have been using , and there are probably a number of people i am 
not aware of who are also using . 

my question is 

how many people  out there  would be interested to join a mailing list , where 
people can ask questions about , stories , and give new ideas about 
new and for the  . this would benefit the 
user community , as well as give me more insight in what people would like to 
see added to . is still very much a voluntary project , and this 
way i can make a list of , in what order things should be added , or 
changed. 

if you 're interested in such a mailing list , please take the time to 
reply to this message , and tell me so. when there is sufficient interest , say 
about 20 people or more , a mailing list will be set up at my site , and i will 
post the announcement of the created list to this and other newsgroups .  . 

ronald van in theory , there is no difference 
between theory and practice.

if i understand your problem correctly , you want to have a way to send 
to your when your specific code 
on the  . 

it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using 
and specifying a  . if you know the you need to 
send the exposure , generally you have the rectangle of the objects , 
you can use to create a , to add the 
new object to the , and then either use the 
to clip your for the or use to test which of your 
other objects need to be  . keeping in mind that the order 
of objects how they look. 

hope it helps

again , for a friend 

okay , i got such great response from my last question  ( thanks , everyone ) , 
lets try again 

how can i tell if a is read only 

i want to use any read only cells that are already in my 
once i start running out of cells , using some arbitrary 
color matching scheme to get those cells that come to 
a requested color .  . 

once i determine if a cell is read only , i assume i can then just request 
an  ( xalloccolor( ) with the exact same color and it will 
then be as  used  by my application so that it does n't later get 
freed by someone else and again as read write to another 
application .  . 

so far , the only way i 've out to do this is to write my own 
error and just go ahead and request the cells , once my 
is all full up. it should error out if the cell is non  . 
but life would be much easier if i could just detect the 
read only stuff directly .  .  .  .

actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why 
do n't show up do you wait for an event before drawing your 
rectangle 

suppose you have an idle with a realized and that contains 
 . a , when pressed , will cause a new item 
to be drawn in the  . this action clearly should not call  ( xcopyarea( ) 
 ( or equiv ) directly instead , it should the existence of the new 
item in a memory structure and let the event take care 
of the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the 
is  . 

the problem , of course , is that no event is generated if the 
is and  . do you know the best way to a so 
that the event will be invoked to draw this new item 


what does this have to do with my original question i previously 
stated that i did an of the depth 8 to the 
just to make sure that my image had data , and it did. this is not 
a problem with events , it has to do with not 
working ! ! ! 

does anyone have a code they could send demonstrating that 
works this would be very helpful ! 

thanks ! 

what it has to do with your original question is this many times 
beginning x users  ( heck , experienced x users too ! ) write small test 
programs. many times they forget to draw only in response to 
events , and thus see results whereby sometimes the application 's 
show up , and sometimes they do n't .  . we 're just trying to 
eliminate all the easy explanations for why you 're not seeing your 
 . 

that being said , why do n't you try copying different to your 
other than 16 ( 1  . try 1 , 1 1 , 1 2 , ... , 1 7 
to see it you get any output .  . since you 're only a single 
plane of your data , it 's possible that all the values in your 
have the same value for that color plane .  .

it is a case of memory vs. network  .

own applications is fairly simple if you have a id you can

you can set hints .  . these methods do n't seem to work with

one of mit is that if your images are large , you do n't end up 
growing the size of the server process to hold them. 

correct. most x use a version of  ( malloc(3 ) which will not return 
memory to the  . the x server might  ( free(3 ) a , but the does 
not  . 

one of the mit is that , in its implementation , 
there is no for cleaning up the shared memory 
if the dies a sudden , violent death (e . g .  . , kill ) .  . you have to 
be of up the system with zombie shared memory  . 

well , part of the routines i mentioned do a little trick to get around 
that problem. first , i create the shared memory segment , the , 
the x server , and then remove ( ! ) the segment .  . if you read the man 
pages on removing of shared memory , you will see that the segment 
only dies after all are gone. 
now , if the dies , that 's one gone  ( the cleans up for you) 
and since the x server the has dies , up it 's resources , 
including from the segment there goes the last  . no more 
shared memory segment .  . 
terrible , but it works.

i suspect this is because creates a  ( probably overrideredirect )

mean time is busy changing your root to whatever you have requested

unfortunately , the key event handling is pretty much into

change the source code so that all of these special generated

would indicate that the home key was pressed , with the shift key 
down. you could also detect standard with odd , such 
as shift return . 

if anybody wants these changes , they 're welcome to them , but you 'll 
have to have the source available and be comfortable with 
it a bit. basically you have to replace the handling code 
in the source file c . . maybe if someone at is 
interested , i can send them the , but i imagine they 've got 
bigger fish to  ( hopefully including the much talked about

somewhere , although this probably is n't the appropriate group for it. 

notes 

this special code will only apply if you let create

in my opinion , a programming degree is still worth having .  . 

yes , but a cs degree is not a programming degree. does anybody know of 
a computing course where programming is taught computer science is 
a branch of  ( or the course i did  . 
i 've also done a software engineering course much more practical and likely 
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants , rather than what they think 
they want , but also did not teach programming .  . the ability to program was 
an entry requirement .  . 

try the  . computing science  course at the real university .  . 
it 's a conversion course , but at least they teach real programming .  . 

in the space of 9 months we were taught pascal , , ,  . 
also , some basic low level stuff  ( 68000 ) was covered as well. 

they also did programming and operating systems , some software 
engineering , plus quite a few optional units , including theory , 
and some stuff about  . 

the pascal is to be replaced by c c i think next year i n't this  ( and 
x programming as well ) 
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months depending 
on your , the selection of n't can be quite wide  . 

the one i would level at the course , which i would have thought 
, is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry 
this would probably need a slightly longer project period  ( say months ) , but 
would enhance the and usefulness of an already excellent and 
course. 

yes , i know this sounds like a plug for the course , why not !

shared memory  ( also mentioned by , 
kisseberth ) looks interesting , but i need someone to point me to some 
documentation .  . is this method likely to give better results than server 
resident i 'd also be interested in looking at the code 
mentioned above .  .  .  . 

there is no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display 
device can hold in off memory , and if so , how 
the server manages these resources  ( having to deal with limited off 
memory is the bane of the server 's existence ! ) .  . 

i have worked with devices where the off memory to 
main display copy rate that of the main memory to display copy 
rate , and with those where the main memory to display is than 
off to display  ( requires only a write to the rather 
than a read of the f . b .  . followed by a write ) 

if your server uses the code or something like it to render into 
in main memory , the you can get through mit are 
likely to be equal  ( maybe a , depending on your 's implementation 
of shared memory ) to from to , which is also then 
just a copy from main memory to device. 

one of mit is that if your images are large , you do n't end up 
growing the size of the server process to hold them. 

one of the mit is that , in its implementation , 
there is no for cleaning up the shared memory 
if the dies a sudden , violent death (e . g .  . , kill ) .  . you have to 
be of up the system with zombie shared memory  .

when starting if you an error message saying 
cannot load file .  .  .  . check your 
environment and then put the file 
( this is the file for ) in the directory 
by the environment  . 

if you do n't have an environment 
then set to be the directory where the 
file is. you can do this using the 
command under  . note that the name ends in  . ad . so you will 
have to set to n . ad . to get the 
to load correctly. 

to make sure the the file can be read by all 
the users , make sure that a copy of or a link to the 
file exists in or 
, depending on how your system is 
set up. 

once you have taken care of this set the 
resource to be the directory in which you have  . 
for example let 's say i 've in t then my system

shared memory  ( also mentioned by , 
kisseberth ) looks interesting , but i need someone to point me to some 
documentation .  . is this method likely to give better results than server 
resident i 'd also be interested in looking at the code 
mentioned above .  .  .  . 

there 's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the 
distribution .  . 

actually , i just finished writing a program .  .  .  . 
 ( take lots of image data and display it pretty  . when using 
on server or shared memory , i had to insert a delay loop to keep 
it from going too quickly ) .  . both methods side by side , they 
were just about equal .  . 

the advantage of is that your x server does n't grow to ridiculous 
sizes but can work over a network and are removed if your 
application dies  ( one tends to use quite a bit when 
 . 

shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e . g .  . 
ultrix ) seem to allow only a small number of ( 6 ) to be 
attached to a process at once consequently , a becomes 
 ( xshmattach( )  ( xshmputimage( )  ( xshmdetach( ) on dec systems. and dec 's 24 
bit  ( like the ones i tend to use most often ) do n't seem to 
support the extension  ( maybe someone compiled them wrong ) , and using 
causes the x server to crash  ( failed mallocs ) , so one has to 
use the local unix domain  ( which really is n't that bad one 
copies the info three times per instead of one) .  . 

in short allowing all three forms of display , within the program is a 
good thing  ( minus if running over a network ) , and let the user pick 
whatever  . 

(i just use an class and forget about it )

i'm working on an application and have concerns regarding 
standard  . 

the documentation says usually , a creates 
these  . i wonder what the writer had 
in mind. neither or seem to create standard  . 

standard were 'd with the intention that 
would make them available. this does n't mean that every 
author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and 
implemented this at top priority .  . 

the server we makes the best map available at 
 . it does n't wait for to do it. 

of course , one can use to create standard  . 
however , does n't seem to try very hard to avoid 
conflicts with the default  . when i use standard 
created by , the rest of my display goes black .  . 
so it seems as if use of standard causes the very 
problem standard are intended to avoid .  . perhaps 
if every application used standard , things would 
be wonderful .  . but not many applications seem to use 
standard  . 

does your hardware have only one since standard 
typically devour all 256 , there is no way it can avoid 
the entire default if your hardware has only one 
 . 

i do n't believe standard are intended to possible 
between using the default  . rather , 
will be avoided between two that use the 
same standard  . an example would be two that need a 
full color range would both use best map  ( or whatever it 's 
called under  . 

if you are trying to avoid with the default 
, your best bet is to try to load all the you use into 
that  . if you ca n't do that , then you 'll get on a one 
 . 

now if your used the same standard as your 
, this could also be avoided .  . perhaps some 
have command line options for standard

we developed a running on the x system. 
the with any based on 's 
 . as you know , there are 2 kinds of implementation from mit 's 
release and  . our original implementation of the 
uses  . 

our manages each character 's size based on our own system. 
in order to do that , the  t  typed character must be 
to character sets .  . this means that if one t type compound string with 
ascii and , for example , is given , each element of the t 
must be checked its character set based on a bit 
and application environment 's locale .  . in this case if the locale is  japanese  , 
each t character will be classified either to 1 , or so. 

we need a function to do this. the function must check how many characters 
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is. 

we could not find any public function to do that and inevitably , used 
's internal functions to construct that function. the following is the 
source code of that function  . 


h . 
this may look like c code , but it is really c 
id h . , v 1.1 1992 01 21 12 05 24

return status 



an included file above , h . , is also internal and we copied 
the file to the directory and compiled .  . 

a serious issue occured when we tried to a application on 
our machine with its version of 01 .  . 

when we tried to link an application based on our , 
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing 
 ( code ) 
 ( code ) 
 ( code ) 
 ( code ) 

we had used mit release version of and its implementation until 
0 . and applications successfully. one of the reasons to use was that 
because did not release 's until the 9 . 0 . and we had no way to 
know how 's would be implemented .  . we had hoped 's popularity and used 
its internal functions .  . 

the 's complains that there are no internal functions implemented .  . 
we observe from 's a . , they used some implementation but we are 
not sure if they used mit 's version or their own version of and 
therefore , finding just counter part functions in mit 's for does not 
seem to lead us a solution .  . 

my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like 
 ( 'decomposecharacterset()' ) listed above. is there any function to check 
character set of each element of t type depending on 
if it is a public function , that is perfect but even if it is not , we 
want to use any internal functions in 's as we did for mit 's  . 

in order to render a  t  type string , there must be some machinery 
to judge character sets and that is how the proper are for 
the string .  . we have no way to find out that without any 's source 
files. we want to know how we can use that for our goal. 
any help or comments would be highly appreciated. 

i also appreciate if anyone tell me about treating around this area 
even if it is not 's implementation .  . 

thank you.

the x server 


which server 

make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware .  . 
if you have a , use a server .  . 

on my sun , i have n't noticed much difference between 
the  ( colour ) server and , however it was pointed out to 
me that is about smaller and therefore should contribute 
to less  . 
thanks to ,

how your server was compiled can also make a difference. jeff law 
us that on a sun system , x should be 
compiled with  ( version 2. ) or with the sun  . 
you can expect to get very large in the server by not 
using the  . i assume that similar results 
would occur if you used one of the other high quality 
compilers on the market .  .

starting your server 

joe english 
if you start up a lot of in your  . or whatever , sleep 
for a second or two after each one. after i changed my 
 . to do this , in actually took less time .  .  .  . 
we have a loaded system without much core , though. 

this sounds crazy , but i have confirmed that it works ! 

provided me with a good explanation of 
why this works , which i have summarized here 

when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to 
start accepting  . a lot of is done by 
the server when it starts .  . this process a large number of 
pages. any other process running at the same time would fight the 
server for use of the , and more importantly , memory. if you 
put a sleep in there , you give the server a chance to get itself 
out before the start up. 

similarly , there is also a lot of whenever an x 
program starts , resources 
being fetched , programs state and and so 
forth .  . all this activity is typically memory  . once this 
is done ( the process has reached a state ) , 
the memory usage typically down to using only a few pages. 
by using to the of your in your 
 . , you avoid them fighting each other for your 
workstation 's limited resources 

this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation , as there 
are so many to be considered available , local 
space , load average , number of users on your system , which 
you are starting , etc. 

currently in my  . i have a situation like 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 1 ) 

i 've with 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 2 ) 
 ( sleep 3 ) 
 ( sleep 4 ) 

i 've even tried 
 ( sleep 2 start x ) 
and then in start x i had 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 1 ) 
 ( sleep 1 ) 

the idea with this last one was to make sure that had 
completely finished my  . , and had down 
into a state before the sleep and all my 
were  . 

all of these fairly comparable results , and so i just stuck with 
my current setup , for its  . you will probably have to 
experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you. 



takes time and  . if you minimize the number of 
your applications use , you 'll get speed increases in load up time. 

one simple strategy is to choose a small number of  ( one small , one 
large , one roman , whatever suits you) and all your or 
at least all your used to use only those few  . 
programs should start up quicker if their is already loaded 
into the server .  . this will also server resources , since 
will be loaded by the server .  . 
, 
joe english 

eg my main is , so i also have set up to use 
in all it 's and etc. 's default is  . since 
i do n't normally use , i 've eliminated one from my server .  .

keep local to the workstation , rather than them over nfs .  . 
if you will make extensive use of , use a server .  . 

about the resources file 


keep your  .  . file small .  . saves and saves 
on server time. joe english 

one suggestion 

in your  . ( . file , try putting only the minimum 
number of resources that you want to have available to all of your 
applications .  . for example true 

then , separate your resources into individual specific 
resource files. for example home  . in your 
 . file set the environment 

home n 

the x . frequently asked questions faq contains 
an excellent explanation of how these environment work. 
ed .  . 

so , when , it loads its resources from 
...  . finds them in ... , 
and so on and so forth .  . note that not all follow the same 
resource file pattern. you can check in your system 
directory  ( often ) to 
find the proper name , and then name your personal resource files 
with the same name. 

this is all documented in the  ( pg  . 
thanks to kevin , 
michael , 
and mike long 
kevin is willing mail his setup files to  . 

this method of organizing your personal resources has the following 
benefits 

easier to maintain more  . 

resources are in the x server in the resource 
property .  . as a side benefit your server may start 
quicker , since it have to load all your resources .  . 

applications only process their own resources , never have to sort 
through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them. 

it also has 

the application that you are interested in has to load an 
additional file every time it starts up. this does n't seem to 
make that much of a difference , and you might 
consider this a huge to  . if you are an 
application 's resource , you just need to re run the 
application without having to again. 

will by default run your  . file through  . when 
your resources are split out into multiple resource files and 
then loaded by the individual programs , they will not. 
watch out for this ! ! 

i had c style comments in my  . file , which 
out. when i switched to this method of resource 
files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why 
my were not finding their resources .  . did not 
provide any error message when it encountered the c style 
comments in the resource files , it simply , silently , 
the resource file. 

the loss of  ( which can be very , e.g. 
color    .  .  . ) . is enough to cause some people to dismiss this 
method of resource  . 

you may also run into some which break the rules. for 
example , neither 3) . nor will find their 
resources if they are anywhere other than in  .  . 

when starting up a on a machine that does not share files 
with the machine where your resources are , your 
will not find its resources .  . all your resources into the 
server will that all of your will always find 
their resources .  . 

a possible compromise suggestion that i have  ( and am planning on trying ) 
is to put resources for all my used  ( eg xterm ) into my 
 . file , and to use the separate resources files method for 
that i seldom use. 

define your display properly 


programs are often executed on the same machine as the server .  . in 
that situation , rather than setting your display environment to 
0 . 0 . , where is the name of your workstation , you 
should set your display to unix 0 . 0 . or 0 . 0 . . by doing this 
you access routines that know that the server is on the same 
machine and use a shared memory method of requests .  . 
thanks to patrick j 

see the display names section of the  ( x(1 ) man page for further 
explanation of how to properly set your display name. 

i do n't think it 's stock mit , but  ( at least ) data general and have 
that are smart enough to use local even when 
the display is n't set  . 
rob  ( 88opensi ! 

sent me an patch to change 
stock to use local even if display is not properly set .  . 
i do n't want to get in the business of or trying to 
non mit and so have elected not to include it here. mit 
will apply this minor ( 8 lines ) patch themselves. in the meantime , if 
you want to try it yourself , email  . ed .  . 





if you only have a few of then you should think 
carefully about the number of programs you are running .  . think also 
about the kind of programs you are running .  . for example is there 
a smaller program than 

unfortunately , i have n't really noticed that programs how large 
they are , so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word. 

suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard 
 ( eg , , xbiff ) are welcome. ed .  . 

i 've received some contradictory advice from people , on the subject 
of x programs. some advocate the use of programs that are 
strictly based , since , and other are rather 
large .  . others warn us that other applications which you are using 
may have already loaded up one or more of these shared  . in 
this case , using a non  ( for example) program may actually 
increase the amount of  . 

the of all this seems to be do n't mix  . that is , try 
and use just athena , or just  ( or just 
,  . if you use more than one , then you 're in 
more than one library. 

know your environment , and think carefully about which 
programs would work best together in that environment.

your 


suggestions on how you can tune your programs to work  . 

from scott comes a suggestion regarding 
text field 

i noticed that during data entry into text field , i 
was getting a slight in response to some , 
particularly the initial one in the field .  . examining the what was 
going on with i found it. it seems that when the resource 
is non zero and the focus is on a text field 
 ( or even just a text widget ) the i beam will blink .  . 
every time the appears or in those , the 
code is making a request to the server  . the user 
can stop this by setting the resource to 0. it is not 
on a , but it does make a little difference 
on a system . 

this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots 
of areas .  . consider your used , are there any minor 
that can be turned off and thereby save on server 
requests 


suggestions 


pretty pictures 

do n't use large  ( gif 's , etc ) as root  . 

the more complicated your root , the the server 
is at your when you  ( or , etc ) 

these take up , and power. i work on a sun and i'm 
conscious of issues , i ca n't comprehend it when i see 
people with a sun 3 60 running as their root  . 

i 'll let someone else figure out how much would be by 
having a full root image on a workstation .  . 

if you 're anything like me , you need all the real 
that you can get for , and so rarely see the root anyway. 

thanks to 
for me of this one. ed .  . 

a quicker 

using , you can how fast your pointer on the 
when you move your  . i use m 3 10 in my  . file , 
which lets me send my pointer across the with just a flick of 
the  . see the man page for further ideas and information. 

hint sometimes you may want to slow down your for 
fine work. to cover my options , i have placed a number of different 
setting commands into a in my  . 

e.g.  ( for twm ) 

f . title . 
very fast ! m 7 10 
normal  ( fast ) ! m 3 10 
system default  ( un accelerated ) ! m default 
! m 0 10 


programming thoughts 

joe english 
to speed up applications that you 're developing , there are tons of 
things you can do. some that stick out 

for programs , do n't set resources for individual 
, , lists , et .  . al. use the or 
or whatever resource of the highest level 
 . again , stick to as few as possible. 

better yet , do n't use at all. it 's an absolute  . 

do n't create and destroy on the fly. try to them. 
 ( this will avoid many problems with , too . ) . 

use a line of 0 in  . on some this makes a huge 
difference. 

and collapse multiple events. this can make the 
difference between a fast application and a completely 
one. 


just a small remark i once heard that using a better 
function would greatly increase of based 
applications since they use  . they suggested trying 
out the , but i did n't find the time yet. i did some 
on small programs just doing and free , and the 
differences were indeed very ( somewhat 5 times faster ) 

any on this from anyone ed .  . 

  ( andre dresden . de) . 

unnecessary events. 

most people use as routines , but 
they forget to in the used for the 
 . this will cause a event every , that , in most 
cases , only puts load onto the connection and forces the to 
run through it 's event loop again and again. 

thousands of requests .  . 

this context switching is also seen in most x , 
where only one or few are created and then changed 
again and again. uses a definitely better mechanism , by 
and a lot of with all needed  . this will 
remove the load of subsequent requests from the 
connection  ( by moving it the  . 

say what ! 

some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the at first 

david b. lewis  ( by day , by night david 
how about this with someone else. run all your programs 
on the other machine and display the other user runs off your 
machine onto the other display .  . goal reduce context in the 
same operation between and server .  . 

i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this , but i have received 
the following  .  .  .

i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big 
difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage 
and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my  . this 
helps a lot on my poor little with only 16 , it was 
essential when i only had 8  . 


the server and the are competing for the same as 
your server when you run it on the same machine .  . not really a 
major problem , except that the and the server are in 
absolute and are context  . 

timothy h 
firstly it relies on the fact that most 's are mostly idle , x 's 
usage is  . so the chances of you and your 
doing something at the same time is small .  . if they 
are not then you get twice the memory available for your 
action. 

the second factor is that context are expensive , using 2 
's them , you pay a price due to the of going 
over the network , but this is offset in most cases by the improved 
of a network  ( typically vs for a pipe ) , allowing 
even context  . 


other sources of information 


volume 8 in o 's x system series , system 
administrator 's guide   is a book all x administrator 's should read. 

nye 
a lot more on are in the paper improving x 
application by chris d. and , in 
issue 3 of the x resource .  . 

an earlier version of this paper appeared in the 1992 
conference  . 

this paper is absolutely essential reading for x  .
