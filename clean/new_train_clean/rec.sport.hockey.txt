what makes you think so i 'd like to understand your reasoning .  . 
from my , the caps do n't really appear to believe that they can 
defeat pittsburgh .  . therefore , they do n't .  . i think their spirit was 
broken in last year 's and has n't really  . i do n't know 
what the series numbers were , but i believe that the won it. 
i think that either the or the will cause more problems for 


what is this spirit crap i'm a caps fan and hope they win 
if they end up facing pittsburgh , 
but i do n't think the caps lose to pitt because of lack 
of spirit .  . yes , the won the series against the 
caps .  . they 've won games in a row for god 's sake. 
did you ever think the might be good , and that 's 
why they win 

i re read what i wrote and it did n't say exactly what i thought. 

sure the are a better team .  . they 've got size and the best 
in the league .  . they 've also got the best  . they 're the 
best team in the league .  . 

but , my point was the caps have not played to their ability level vs the 
since last year 's  . and that 's the mental problem  ( the one they 've 
had for a number of years ) i tried to point out. spirit , mental , 
will to win , whatever you want to call it , it 's missing when the caps play the 
 . actually , you 're right it wo n't make any difference.

the wo n't be playing montreal , because boston will win adams 
play .  . buffalo and quebec will make decent  . 
boston , out of determination , will win a game against the , 
but no more. they have heart , but the have too many big guns and 
too many ways to win .  . 

if boston does indeed win the adams  ( nothing is certain ) , and 
indeed gets to play the , then i think you 'll find a very 
different boston team this year .  . boston will use every trick in the 
book to shut down the offense something they did n't even try 
last year .  . the  weak is defense and if boston 

first , i reading your post. second , i disagree with the pen 's weak 
being defense and for a couple of reasons. has 
had a year no slow start , , 3 . 0 . , and 
leads the league in  . tommy deserves the  . given the lack of 
respect he commands , though , i doubt he will win it. the other reason 
concerns the  team defense .  . they are around 3rd or 4th in the 
goals allowed .  . that is a big improvement for them , and it indicates 
that they are playing better team defense .  . 

can shut down the  offense and get an early goal , then you have a 
real game. if the score first , then it 's practically over. i 
do n't think the have the discipline to stick to the team game if 
they 're held 5 into the second .  . 

boston does n't have the guns of the , but the does n't have 
the defense , , and discipline of boston .  . still , boston can 
put the in the net. remember that boston is not a run and gun 
patrick style team , although they played run and gun for the 
better part of the regular  ( who does  . even 
all the way in behind his own net if necessary. 

penalty killing will be a big factor .  . boston are , i believe 2 over 
the last 40 something short handed situations , meaning they have 
4 while giving up 2  ( one in a game against 
 . 

i 'd say the series will go to 5 or 6. but i'm much less certain 
whether it will be in favor of the or the b 's .  . their going 
into the are too different to make it  . still , i 'd 
place my on the i think. my prediction is that if the b 's 
can get the first goal in four of the games , they 'll take the series .  . 
otherwise the will. 

but i 'd rather wait and see whether the b 's will actually get out 
of the adams to begin with .  .  .  . buffalo , quebec , and montreal are n't 
exactly planning to call it a game and go home !

the subject line says it all. is it terribly difficult to get 
to games , especially now that they are in the would 
it be easy to find outside of the selling 

there are always with outside the  . you might have 
to pay a few extra , but you can always find them. look on the 
street under the message board , or out on the street in front of the , 
or even around gate 1. the later you buy them , the less money you 'll pay , 
and during the regular you could usually find some for near face 
value or below if you wait until game time. might be better to pick them 
up earlier now , though.

recently. this is second hand , so i do n't know how true it is , but i have 
no reason to doubt it either. 

center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee minor 
team .  . the owner of the  ( sorry , i ca n't remember his name) 
either owns or at least out the majority of the funds to build the 
center .  . 

supposedly he was approached by the about an , but 
turned it down because he thought the fee of 50 million was too 
high. 

like i said , i do n't know whether this story is true or just a , but if 
it 's true , do n't look for an team in milwaukee anytime soon. the 
are n't going to be forced out of the building and you wo n't see an club 
and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the 's

and are particularly , but the numbers of on other 
teams is getting worse as well. 

i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about , the 
rocket i will completely up. as it is now , every time i see 
the play i keep someone will cross check into the hard they have to carry him out on a  .  ( by the way , i'm not a 
fan to begin with ) .  . 

okay , the remark was a little carried away. but the point is that

better  . it 's all  . this european is ,

1 brian 
acquired  91 from minnesota in draft 
grade p  ( d ) 

it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end , a career that 
featured three  ( with patrick roy , in '87 , '88 , and 
 . it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing 
grade  ( and the letter grading ) , but he had simply been awful on ice this 
year , save for a bright or two , and even if he had been healthy , he would 
not be any more than the 3rd string  . 

but was a individual , who also in on the  first 
ever victory , the 3rd game of the last year against the flames .  . 
as he , the will remember what a good guy he was. 

30 jeff 3rd 
acquired  91 , from n .  . y .  . in draft 
grade c 

, after  ( deservedly ) the team last , simply 
the year .  . other than a few good  ( 57 saves against los , 
almost against bay , etc . ) . , , with 85 . 6 . save 
percentage and a 5 . 28 . , watched his status go from the team 's 1 to 
at the end of the  . he was expected , early , to carry 
the team along instead , he apparently became , but the an early 
injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor , 
but upon return , he simply was n't up to the task .  . he may not return next 
year .  . 

31 wade 1st  ( still as rookie ) 
acquired  91 , signed as free 
grade i (a ) 

it is pretty hard to a on just one game alone , thus the 
incomplete grade , but yet in the one start that he did get  ( against the 
flames ) , was nothing but for at least two periods .  . he started 
the poorly in kansas city , but finished strong , the  
owner ron to comment that he should be a candidate for the 
 . the would be a major challenge for him as he 
tries to make it into the last year , he was a capable for 
in the throughout the and in the turner cup , picking up 
all star along with now it 's time for him to show that he can 
share the job with next year , because with dan , 
, and scott coming along , if he does n't make it next year , he 
may not ever. 

32 1st 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade b 

i may yet be overly critical of in a year that he clearly established that 
he 's a , perhaps a 1  . he has 
provided most of the little footage that the team had , getting 
the team 's first ever shut out against the los kings on december 26 .  . 
he has been in and out of the net , playing the and 
making passes , people of a young ron  ( except , of course , the 
 . yet he still needs to develop more consistency , which is hard to do 
with such a bad defense in front of him , but if the are to challenge for 
a next , 's the key , as he demonstrated in being named 
as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts .  .

had a point and was the first non to win the hart and 
since  . people turned out to watch him play .  . 

i will grant that a star like will draw , even if the team  . 
but this is short term only i still do not think the increase 
will last , unless the team is a improving butt kicking 
one. pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support 
them. if they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you 'd have knee 
for some of the people jumping off the  . 

i disagree. has demonstrated with that a star brings out the 
whether or not the team is expected to do well. very few real 
expect the kings to do well this year  ( although i do ) and yet they 
still go out to see  . this is the strategy selling the 
game by selling the stars that is employed by baseball and , notably , the 
and this is the attitude that the new leadership is 
bringing to the league .  . they have gone on record as stating that they are 
trying to sell the game on its stars .  . and brett are perfect 
examples of that real know are n't worth a damn and yet , being 
of oriented , have goal 
that would indicate to the casual observer , the very the wants to 
attract , that these are indeed  . 

they made the to try and build a winner around , that is 
true. but the improvement in came before they started doing 
this  ( coffey late in 1987 ) and before they even had a bound team .  . 
a of occured in 1984 85 from the previous year .  . an 
increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that. the 
of is what did it. 

it might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly 
found an interest in and the  . was it gee , is 
amazing , i 'll go watch him play , or was it gee , now we 've got a kick 
ass guy on our side , i 'll go watch him play . i think it was the latter .  . 

it ai n't nearly so simple as this. the casual fan does n't think about much 
at all. can you actually find an adult with a 3 who believes that 
makes good 

i did provide the example of rocket and the of the 
 .  . did . you leave it out because you do n't know much about the if 
that 's the case then fair enough , but if it is n't the case then i'm curious 
to hear your explanation. 

yes but apparently the rocket has not lived up to his 
has he he was , initially , as a , but outside of 
one grey cup game he has done very little to maintain enhance that assess 
of his  . most probably feel the team would be better 
off without him.

the adams division race is certainly interesting this year .  . here are 
important data to keep in mind in the of a tie for a given 
standing position. 

in head to head games 
quebec over montreal , 4 3 0 
boston leads against quebec , 3 1 1 with two games remaining 
montreal and boston are , 4 4 0 with one game remaining .  . 

( .  . ) .  ( aka glacial ) 

, 
for purposes of the tie , you only count the first three games in 
each city. therefore , quebec cannot possibly be ahead of montreal 4 3 , 
and there 's probably only one game that remaining between boston 
and quebec , which means boston has probably already won .  .

what 's going on the russians and the are unable to easy 
opponents , and the austria only 1 0 ! 

it 's the game effect maybe. pros arrive late , for 
, and problems to get the lines may make things 
hard to get it going against these worse nations .  . 
i 'd guess that the better team you face in the game , the better 
it is , since the chances of an upset are greater then. 

some other reasons why the worse teams are so tough to was presented 
by virus  ( former in  . 

1 ) the worse teams  ( referring to france , , austria , etc ) 
have now usually world class  . 

2 ) their play have become much more , they take much 
less unnecessary penalties .  . 

3) they use four lines which makes it harder to make them run out of gas .  . 

4 ) the ice quality in the german is poor. 

the only convincing winner was .  .  .  . germany .  .  . 

another thing was that the played entertaining  .  .

john s problems

problems. on ice , the won the atlantic division title but 
off ice was less happy. a strike by public workers has forced the 
out of the city for much of the last half of 
the  ( since mid  . they have played home games in places 
like montreal , and  . their home 
games will be played in the center in ,  . one 
got violent .  . workers attacked a  and 
it and broke in the john 's memorial  . 
despite the problems , insist that the 
will return to john 's once the strike ends. 

sold 
the new haven have been sold by peter to 
the ottawa organization .  . they are the only canadian 
team with an american , and have made it clear 
they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic 
 . this sale and move has yet to be approved by the 
head office , but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting 
in may .  . the quote in the story from jack made it 
clear the league was more interested in the of the 
accompanied by ownership , rather than maintaining 
the 56 year history of the in new haven .  . 

the are currently in serious with 
new and are expected to move there.

game of the week 
in early , the started a game of the week. the game , produced 
by , i believe , , was televised across the canadian 
and us. the first few weeks saw two games of 
the week , one in canada and another in the us but since then , there 
has been only one. sunday afternoon and night games were covered and 
shown on ny and in the us and , i believe , atlantic 
sports network in canada  ( but i'm not sure about  . i am not

good taste 

according to , the entire article was n't perfect , and there 
were some  shots  by frank and  . 
noted that was n't much of a  ( did n't

one guy has a name like dog food , the other like a

this is the best he can do ! ! gee , of

this nonsense .  .  . making . fun of names it 's bad enough that he makes 
blanket statements about european , but he 's now resorted to making fun 
of their names too he like an idiot , much like he did last week 
when he said that would never make it to his  'em ,  em  video 
until he dropped the  .  .  .

new division names. 

well , what he said was that even though he 's been around the league for quite 
some time , he still does n't know who 's where w . r . t .  . conference and division 
names. ! ! the names have been around for a couple of decades 
or so .  .  .  . he . also invited the audience to name the teams in the  .  . quick . ,

sorry  . wrong on this one. 

ron  ( to don ) i do n't know i like you on your show 
for 30  .  .  . i can hardly stand you on this show for 5. 

this was absolutely hilarious .  . 

's argument about the and baseball was fairly 
good .  .  . unfortunately . he to mention the fines that were levelled in 
the case. serious money .  .  . oh . well , he 's never been one for objectivity , 
has he 

's question to 

would n't it be better 
for you to change your friends so that they like the game , than for 
us to change the game for your friends 

now this i liked .  .

and now , i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you 
another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics 

i passed the final individual posted here the other day through 
a filter to average out games , goals , , points , and penalty 
for the mythical average pro who played in the league this  .  ( why 
because it 's monday and i did n't feel like writing any real code .  .  . ) . 

anyway , after i out the 60 odd in the list , i came up with 

average 55 11 g 19 a 30 

then i passed the list through a second time to come up with the who 
had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories .  . 

 ( nyi ) 56  ( 1 ) 10 g  ( 9 ) 20 a  ( 5 ) 30  ( 0 ) 24  ( 65 ) 
 ( edm ) 55  ( 0 ) 10 g  ( 9 ) 17 a  ( 10 ) 27  ( 9 ) 27  ( 53 ) 

these two are close in games , goals , , and points , but are too far off 
in  . this leaves , as the most average in the 

bobby  ( was ) 65  ( 18 ) 11 g  ( 0 ) 17 a  ( 10 ) 28  ( 6 ) 63  ( 8 ) 

what an honor .  . 

i also passed the list through with the still included. and 
were still in the top three , but rob came flying up from 
behind to take the title 

average 53 10 g 17 a 27 64 
 ( edm ) 55 (3 ) 10 g  ( 0 ) 17 a  ( 0 ) 27  ( 0 ) 27  ( 50 )

they are worthy of this ! i'm so glad we wont have to play them as much next 
year ! ) and here comes the 3rd period .  .  . what . its the again. oh they 
were just waiting for the cap isles to get out of  . good 
they 've put a close game back on. wait ! this shit ! ! they re showing

holy shit they 're changing games ! its about time ! ! lets see if

sorry roger but mr should what he really means here. ie he should 
have said that he hopes in the american can follow the 
names of the divisions .  . the odds that these people other than those who 
are  ( who are probably already fans ) is on the order 
of the 's in hell. 

i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here. if you 
asked somone , who had never heard of before , if la played in 
the division what do you think that the response would be 
what if you asked this person if la played in the west division the 
of divisions after long dead is unnecessary 
 . 

i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason. the names 
patrick , , , adams and campbell are all the names of so called 
of the game. this is the same type of thinking that put stein 
in the hall of fame .  . this is absolute nonsense. the real of the 
game are richard , , , , , etc. if you are going to 
name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people 
who it. 

yes these people as but the old division 
names took into account patrick , , and the prince who 
had alot more to do with the origins of the league than people who came into 
an already established situation. it is much easier to be an element of change 

hardly .  . the established situation existed prior to , et al. 
the cup was a challenge up for grabs to whatever team 
could successfully mount the challenge. what our dear did 
was the challenge. they created a closed league , an 
system , in the interests of making money. 
er or not that system has contributed to better is certainly 
 . we are , however , stuck with their invention and that de 
is academic .  . the point to be made , however , is that people 
played and people watching long before 
and his pals showed up. 

or a in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates 
a new situation. if you want to honor like bobby than i'm sure 
you can find a reason to name a after him such as best offensive 
 . 

what 's wrong with best , period was there ever a better 
was there ever a better and if you think that 
bruce  was somehow more significant than bobby 
's then , in the interests of education , why do n't you take a 
and find out how many people know who was but you do n't have 
to , do you 

no i ca n't for the reasons i gave above. i'm in the same as jason and i 
grew up with the current names and learned them when i was about 
10 years old and who played in what division .  . if a 10 year old american 
can learn this why would it be hard for an occasional fan to pick up 
on who plays in what division 

so you do n't feel that you should have to make the effort to remember 
that vancouver plays in the west division  ( or , or whatever 
other understandable is chosen . ) . 

oh. now i see your point. your intention has been to alert us to the 
of  . i 'll bet you like because it 's , for the most part , played 
by of european  . 

probably not. in my case i'm sure of this. what you said would be like me 
saying that all are as biased , closed minded , ignorant , 

and of course you deleted jason 's rant about the 
game its . quoting me out of context does 
more to your credibility than it does mine. my position is 
clearly progressive and is anything but biased , closed minded , 
. arrogant , i will grant you. 

arrogant , and as you. just because someone a ) does n't like what 
mr is doing , b ) their opinion. and c ) likes the of 
you going to does not mean that you have the right to insult them. 

nice try john .  . but for a flame to be truly effective you have to 
display at least enough intelligence to your target 's 
respect.

stupid anyway , as can be seen with the and  . 
sigh. 
in another note .  .  .  . i 'd have to say the caps biggest surprise was

has a higher , but francis has had more points. and take it from 
an informed observer , francis has had a much better than 
 . this is not to take anything away from , who had a 
decent year  ( although it did n't live up to the expectations of  . 

tended to francis at times because he is a style 
 . he plays hard at all times , does n't disregard his 
and is a good leader. rewarded him be increasing his 
ice time. 

can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude. 
this the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time. 

throughout the year , francis recieved more ice time than 
 . i have never seen on this subject , i am pretty 
sure that had more points per minute played that francis .  . when 
you add to that 's better , i think it becomes evident 
that had a better not that francis had a bad one. 


actually , what i think has become more evident , is that you are determined to 
your ignorance at all cost .  . did not have a better than 
francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a of 
knowledge. save your almost devotion to the almighty 
plus ... it is the most stat available. 

until the a more useful statistic including ice 
time per game and some measure of its quality (i . e .  . , is the put out 
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he up 
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc ) , i would 
much rather see the disappear instead of having its dubious 
merits by those with little understanding of its implications .  . 

thank you for posting this. as the person who first brought up the 
fact that has a much higher than francis , i can you 
that i brought it up as an example of the absurdity of 
comparisons , even on the same team .  . i never , ever thought that anyone 
would argue that 's higher actually better two way 
play .  . 

in my opinion , francis 's low is purely a result of him being asked 
to play against opponents top at all times the fact that he 
can chip in 100 points while the other team 's top center 
is a testament to how valuable he is , even if his suffers .  . on the 
other hand , , for how big , fast and he is , ca n't even get 
90 points , no matter how his is. 

 ( by the way , do n't get me wrong i like  . he may be a lazy 
, but he turns it on at exactly the right times like 
of  .

after watching the all year  ( and as many other teams as 
possible ) , i 've really noticed an increase in tom 's cheap shots 
this year  ( and not noticed a increase with other 
 . 

have a look at ed  . 

he also kicked john  . of 
course he was n't called for that. 

kicked when the wings played the  
a couple of weeks ago. no penalty .  . no review .  . no  . 
this was after he attacked bob in the previous period. 
he was for that. 

there 's no doubt in 
my mind that is the since  . 
he 's also very good. 

likewise  . too bad he goes down so much ! )

all of this is fine. i never said that was a bad  . i merely said 
that he is n't the best in or even a for that honor .  . 
if is as great as you claim the wings would have won the cup 
by now probably more than once. if he was as great a as you claim 

i think you missed one of my points there. it takes more than a great 
to win a cup , even once. some of the guys on the list you 
gave earlier never won one. i agree that you and i could probably argue 
back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best in 
that is a matter of opinion , and who is to say my opinion is any better 
than yours or yours than mine but the point of my original original 
post  ( if not well stated ) was that has the abilities but not 
the abilities .  . which leads to below 

and he was as poor a as you claim he would have been intelligent 
enough to the to push the team to the next level of success. 

i think at this point there 's a personal , emotional element involved here 
which transcends 's logical thought. as , it 's fine for 
us to say , he should a different  . in fact , he has talked about 
doing so in the past. but , the press  ( here in , at least ) has so 
built up this business about never getting past the second round of 
the as a , that i think he has taken it upon himself to 
prove to the world that he is capable of a team past the second 
round. he needs to , as the papers say , get that off his back .  . 
so it becomes a matter not of intelligence , but of pride .  . is it foolish 
to let pride stand in the way of sound logic perhaps , but we 're all 
a little that way from time to time. i think eventually he 'll step down 
from behind the and concentrate on his duties , and the team will 
improve as a result. 

i think his duties take away time he might have otherwise spent 
on work. in that sense , once he steps down as , we 'll see how 
good of a he really is. 

but is an average  ( unspectacular ) and a pretty good 
so none of this is true anyway. 

i may not agree with everything you 've said , but it 's been fun discussing 
it with you.

in response to a debate about who has has a better of francis 

i think did he probably had a better point per minute ice time 
do n't exist to properly analyze this and he had a better . 


actually , what i think has become more evident , is that you are determined to 
your ignorance at all cost .  . did not have a better than 
francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a of 
knowledge. save your almost devotion to the almighty 
plus ... it is the most stat available. 

until the a more useful statistic including ice 
time per game and some measure of its quality (i . e .  . , is the put out 
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he up 
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc ) , i would 
much rather see the disappear instead of having its dubious 
merits by those with little understanding of its implications .  . 

is a useful statistic .  . if a is on the ice when his team scores a 
lot of goals and only allows a few goals , he must be doing something right. 
it is especially useful to compare between as they play for the 
same team and should have roughly similar if they are equally 
good  . it can be with degrees of success to compare 
between on different teams .  . 

i agree it would be nice for the to keep more statistics but how useful 
are the ones that you suggest total ice time would be very useful it is 
a missing stat in vs francis arguments from before. somehow measuring 
the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless. it would be a 
better stat for evaluating ie are the given quality ice 
time actually their ones a very good could be given low 
of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid who 
does n't recognize his talent and a very bad could be given lots of 
quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid that 
thinks he is an effective  . this stat would be much more flawed than 
and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding talent .  . 

is a useful stat .  . it is quite useful in evaluating talent .  . 
you are the one ignorance because of your to see 
that being on the ice when goals are but not when they are allowed 
is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such.

after watching the all year  ( and as many other teams as

this year  ( and not noticed a increase with other 
 . i 've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. just 
as examples last night , i noticed him scott in the 
head , which basically started the whole match that got 
 ( scott ) and 2 minute  . he also kicked john  . of 
course he was n't called for that. is n't kicking an automatic match 
penalty and 10 game i think glenn got one a few 
years ago for kicking in the  . there 's no doubt in 
my mind that is the since  . he 's also 
very good. 

how about that head butt is there an automatic that 
goes along with a  ( non kicking ) match penalty i ca n't remember anymore.

to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota 

from what i have seen in the local news  ( tv and newspaper ) , various people 
in the area are trying to get a new team .  . a for the st. 
paul press wrote an article giving the inside on the 
issue. there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible 
to move to the cities .  . first the sites target center , 
center  . paul ) , and yes , even the met center .  . the was pretty 
confident that minnesota will get a team , and that the target center will 
ultimately win out. he argued , however , that the competition from the other 
two sites will delay the process  . without the 
inter site competition , the  ( sorry , i ca n't remember his name) 
believes that minnesota would have a team by the  . also , 
because of the situation with the , things will be 
until  ( unless ) the city of takes over the target center .  . 
however , they are unlikely to do so until the met center is , 
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for 
conventions and short term events  ( even with at  . to add to 
this mess , a study  ( 6 to 12 months ) is going to be conducted on the future 
of the met center , which obviously the process even 
further. i hope that the study is cancelled , which will have the effect of 
knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging 
to take over the target center sooner .  . the city would be 
be even more if the ball is taken to the met , 
which may happen. 
regarding possible , the three teams are 
, bay , and new jersey .  . i would prefer the  ( minnesota 
ice demons ) although the may have potential. although it has n't 
been yet , it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the 
target center next year .  . apparently the are interested in playing in 
as many of those games as possible , and i would n't be surprised to see 
and show up there either. so , minnesota may end up 
getting another team , but it may take a few years.

so in other words , if out the and out 
the , that 's because it was the decision come on , 
joe , think about what you 're saying ! who they played is very significant .  . 
why they played them is what 's irrelevent .  . a low against good teams 
is better than a low against bad teams in the context of comparing two 
 . a low is better then a higher  . a low against good 
teams is much , much better than a higher against bad teams in the context 
of comparing two  . 

let 's start over. i'm not arguing about who is the better  . i 'd 
take right now. what i am saying is that can be a 1 
 . the difference is less than half a goal per game  ( less than 
that after last night ) , their save are close , and their records 
are similar. and with that , i just do n't see how you can label as 
the most on the flyers this  . 

you say played against better competition .  . that may very well 
be , but there is no way of knowing how would have performed in 
those games. besides , against the better teams like pittsburgh , 
the defense is more up than they are against san jose .  . 

the same 
for in the game. two real chances , one he made a 
great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other  . if 
you were judging on that game alone , you have very little to go by. 

but i'm not just judging on that game alone. i 've seen him play 
for the past two in and before that in  . it 's just 
my opinion , but i think he 's got what it takes .  . of course , i thought that 
about mark , too. but i never did about young. so i'm 
 . in judging talent since the era. 

as for the game , you can say he was saved by a mistake by the 
offensive if you like. but had his in position to make the 
save .  . if he did n't , it would n't have if the did n't 
get the up or not. it would have been a goal. on a that 's 
what the wants to do , take away as much as possible and force the 
to him. 

but if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the , you saw a 
stand on his head to get that  . that was a 1 in action. 
does n't have a game like that in him. 

i seem to remember doing an excellent job against on 
night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending 
 . and not to take anything away from because he was 
in that game the  . but you ca n't tell me that a 
montreal had an open net to shoot at some point during that game 
and just flat out missed it. mistakes , both on offense and defense are 
part of the game. or there 'd never be  . 

anyway , i'm happy the flyers have both and and 
i'm not going to argue about it anymore. besides , with the current 
7 game and expectations for next year , i 
do n't want to you off to the point that you do n't sell me any

bos at 7 00  ( tsn and fox ) , and mon que at 7 30  . i think that if 
each series goes its i could be watching for 40 some odd 
nights (i have n't counted so that 's a pure guess) .  . 

i have two tv 's in my house , and i set them up side by side to watch mon que 
and keep an eye on bos at the same time. i did the same for the two 
afternoon games. 

btw , those abc were great ! i was quite impressed they seemed 
to know that their audience was n't likely to be well in lore 
and they did an excellent job. they were quite also , imo.

contact white house office of the press , 

washington , april 19 following is a 
of remarks by president clinton to the university of black 
bears division i 

the rose garden 

9 a . m .  . edt 

the president good morning and  . it 's 
an honor for me to welcome the university of black bears , the 
winner of the division i national to the 
rose garden and the white house. i understand from 
that this is the first team from the university of every to win 
a national  . and we 're glad to have them here. 

i'm inspired not only by how the team together to 
win the , but how the entire state together to 
them onto victory .  . 

coming from a state that is also relatively small in 
size , but also filled with pride and tradition and community , i can 
understand how the people of must feel about the black bears .  . 
in our state people are still talking about the time we won the 
orange bowl over the number one team , and that was 
back in  . i'm sure that 15 years from now , the people of 
will as proud of this team as they are today. 

you know , in my state is a slightly more 
popular than  . we do n't have a lot of ice .  . ) . 
but after spending three months getting around in this town , i 
can understand a little more about than i did before i came 
here. is a tough game. it 's a hard hitting  . it does 
have one virtue though , there 's a penalty for delay of game. i wish 
we had that rule in the senate .  . ) . 

in government as in , leadership is important. in 
the united states senate , our team has a great , the majority 
leader and the from , george 
cohen looks so young , i ca n't imagine. ) . i'm 
actually bitter about cohen because he looks so much 
than me. 

on your team , the jim has done 
a great job. he the goal late in the 
game , you to a come from behind victory something else i 
know a little bit about. 

brings out the best in individuals and in teams 
and in communities .  . i share the pride that and 
cohen and andrews and all the people of 
must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a 
team , how to bring out the best in one another , and how to come from 
behind. 

i think it 's important , as i ask young people from 
around america who have achieved outstanding things in working 
together , to come here to the white house to be recognized and 
by their country , to remember that those kinds of values 
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all 
of our lives. 

we now have another role model , and i'm glad to have 
them here today. ) .

q mr. president , did you the move on 
this morning , sir 

the president i was aware of it. i think the 
general made the decision. and i think i should refer all questions 
to her and to the fbi .  . 

q did you have any instructions for her as to how it 
should be executed 

the president no , they made the tactical decisions. 
that was their judgment , the fbi .  . 

q is this a 

the president and i will i want to refer you to 
talk to the general and the fbi .  . i knew it was going to be 
done , but the decisions were entirely theirs , all the tactical 
decisions. 

q what did you and talk about this 
morning 

q any chance for that 

the president ought to pay my 
 . ) . i was in there  . 

you have to pay that  . 

the president i was ready. ) . 
, he 's worth a any day. 

q any chance for your bill , sir 

the president we talked about what was going to happen 
this week in the senate and about what other meetings we 're going to 
have for the rest of the week. we only had about five to 
talk .  . and we agreed we 'd get back together later , around noon , and 
talk some more. 

q said over the that your 
compromise is no compromise .  . 

the president well , i know he did , but , look , 
and a lot of the other now in the senate voted for 
the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in and our research 
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28 
emergency spending measures over 100 billion when reagan 
and bush were president , in those  . and many of those 
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people 
back to work. i do n't want to go back and every one , but you 


can do it. you can look at the research there. so this position 
they 're taking is not credible .  . we have a very tough five year 
plan .  . all these costs are covered during that time 
and then some. and the very people that are saying this has all got 
to be paid for do n't have much of a history on which to base their 
position. they 've got 12 years of vote for measures of this 
kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to 
work. so i think we 've got a chance to work it out , and i'm  . 
we 'll see what happens today and tomorrow .  . i'm feeling pretty good 
about it. 

the press thank you

i'm for a miracle , but i agree that boston will likely win the 
series .  . is about equal , top offensive are about equal 
 ( mogilny vs. juneau ) , but buffalo has no answer to 
 ( not to imply that is not a top offensive btw , in fact he 's one

will continue in this yes. has

advantage the victory was roy 's .  . at the same time , i ca n't

agreed. ny does n't have the to stop the , independent

credit to ny .  . 

washington vs. new jersey

agreed here too , but i think it will go at least  . jersey has a decent 
team , and washington has done poorly against the division this year .  . 

pittsburgh vs. washington 
if the caps had bill i might see an upset , but 
just does n't inspire my hopes .  . in 6.

a of last year .  . the are just as good as 12 months ago , 
and the are much improved .  . but .  .  .  . in 6. 

if pittsburgh plays boston , imo they win in likely five , possibly  . they 
own the  . if they play montreal , i think it will go to seven , and once

have played pittsburgh very tough this  .

period though the kings off the face off. the kings got 
into the of the game much earlier than the flames as they played out

their first shot on goal. the kings , 16th of the 16 teams on 
penalty killing , shut down the flames .  . the flames went 0 8 on the power play 
and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities .  . the kings had 
their problems on the power play , yet they did to score 2 goals in 10 
tries .  . 

the kings back checked while the defense stood the flames up at the 
blue line , allowing the kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the 
flames .  . rob missed the game due to the lower back but is ex 
to be in the on  . wayne suffered a charlie horse 
in his right  . he took a few shifts in the second period before to 
the room for the rest of the game. on the radio this 
morning , he stated that he was fine and would be in the on  . 

1st period

and went off at 4 57 .  . went off at 12 25 but the kings 
failed to convert .  . carson went off at 14 53 and the flames failed to convert .  . 
went off at 18 34 and went off at 19 30 , giving the kings a 30 
second which they failed to convert .  . the kings recorded 2 goal posts in

2 1. the kings the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play .  . 
, in the far circle passed to at the top of the and headed 
for the net. shot hit in the back and dropped into the low 
where 2 kings  ( shuchuk and granato ) were being checked by 3 flames .  . carson 
came from the far corner , picked up the loose and snapped a shot 
between the legs of from 5 feet above the  . 

3 1. the kings their lead just 24 seconds later. was checked off 
the at the flames blue line. picked up the and sent a pass 
cross the to  . shot off the pass , from the near face off , 
beating a on the side. 

4 1. 2 59 later , the kings had a 3 goal lead .  . took a shot form the 
near point that hit a flame and towards the  . got his 
own , to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low

power plays but the flames killed it themselves when went off for high 
at 17 31. went off at 18 03 to close out the period. the 
kings hit 3 goal post in the period. 

3rd period 
the kings used the phrase , not and it was very evident here 
in the 3rd period as the kings continued to the body and the flames 
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game. 

5 1. the kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1 06 mark. the kings shot 
the into the near corner of the flames  . went behind the net to 
cut off the but he could not control it. , who was behind him , 
at the , sending it into the low  . as back in to the 
, got a shot that hit a flame and to the left of the net 
where fired the behind  . 

went off at 1 24 went off at 3 22 as the teams 4 on 4. 

5 2. , down the far side , around , cut to the net

carson and came in on a 2 1. when carson passed across to , 
with no call .  . the got into the far corner where 
knocked down and checked him from behind into the , drawing 
a 5 minute major and a game at the 6 08 mark. unfortunately , the 
kings the 5 minute power play when  ( at 6 44 ) and  ( at 
8 19 ) took penalties .  . 

5 3. the flames closed to within 2 at the 8 47 mark. , at the near 
point , passed to at the far point. he took a few towards the 
net , wound up and a shot off the near post and in over the of 
 . the play started on another that the kings lost. la .  . 

6 3. took a penalty at 9 56 and the kings converted on the power play 
to the victory .  . , down the far in the flames 
cut towards the back of the net. just as he crossed the goal line , he passed 
the into the low , on the far side , to carson who shot off the pass , 
beating on the ice , stick side. 

at the 16 17 mark , went off for and stern went crazy as he 
went after  . stern wound up with a double minor for , a single 
minor for cross checking and a 10 minute , and he took the flames 
right out of the game. 

on the plus side the kings , for the most part , played very 
as they let  . the kings played good team defense and excellent 
penalty killing .  . 

on the side the kings lost almost every face off. this must improve or 
the flames will surely get that power play back on track .  .

paul is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the  . 
he called a total of 4 penalties on the and one on the  . 
the  penalty came in o . t .  . , being an ex himself , 
was looking to call penalties on the while letting the 
get away with murder .  .  . we . was robbed ! ! ! ! 

no. patrick roy is the reason the game was lost , and ron is the 
reason quebec won .  . everybody said it would come down to , that 
was the key , etc etc. well , the key does n't quite fit if you 're 
montreal .  . the penalty was kind of a call , but let 's face it 
he literally left his feet to an  . blaming is just an 
excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst 
goals he could possibly allow .  . he even saw the whole shot ,  . besides , 
things up a bit by calling a quebec penalty in ot .  . 

montreal played a solid game  ( although they still do n't know how to clear 
traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even  . 
normally i would say that any team that a 2 goal lead with less than 
five , let alone two , to go in time in a game 
especially needs to be their collective heads .  . but i do n't 
think this was a team loss  ( although should have been able to clear 
the just prior to the first quebec  . roy is paid big money to 
play .  . he looked like a in an industrial league on 's shot .  . 

should start in the next game. if not that , he should let 
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two .  .  .  . and . maybe this 
article , if possible. 

patrick roy collapsed after letting in the goal. he was shaky and 
on his for the rest of the night. the goal should n't have 
gone in. 

i did n't think the around was as bad as the second goal. i also did n't 
think scott young should have gotten around the  ( ca n't remember who ) 
in the first place. but you are correct , it should n't have gone in 
regardless .  . 

oh well , at least the lost in o . t .  . also ha , ha ! ! ) 

yep .  . looked bad on 's goal with five seconds left in the second , 
imo. how about though holy shit , what a  . 

speaking of great , man oh man can quebec  . i have n't seen a 
team so on the rush in a long time. watching them break out of their 
, especially , is a treat to watch .  . they me of the red 
army .  . 

but i still hate the team .  . 

on the rest of the games did n't st.  goal come on a 
penalties will cost chicago , especially against  . 
same goes for very , very  . when is 
waving guys to the to avoid , you know something 's up. new

looking at the way the divisions were re , there are teams each

thought occurs to me that inherent in the is of one team 
in the central division and one team in the division , although i 've 
seen nothing published that indicates that. 

actually , when the was formed a couple of years back

that it was the 's plan to grow to 28 teams  ( 7 per division ) by

the to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that 
the current of 26 are fully stable .  . this means that cities 
looking for a club in the future will have to wait until 
one team in some fails or looks to  . 

this is good , imo. there 's no sense in expanding if it only means

do you propose , a worthless vote like they do in college what a 
joke ! 

you boston make me laugh you 're going crazy based on a very 
recent boston over montreal in the  . i mean how 
many cups has boston won compared to montreal 's 23 and who do you 
think is going to win the next cup between the 2 teams montreal 
or boston you know 's going to find some way of screwing up 
even this good boston team .  . he 'll fire or trade away a vital 
star .  .  ( admittedly , his last few have been good ones but how 
long before his luck runs out and he starts making for 
type again ) 


if i remember right , brad park was also involved in that trade .  . he was n't 
all that bad a  . 

but let 's look at some of 's over the years 

for  . i do n't know who gave up for middle 
, so i 'll call this one a . 

for  . . any questions 

greg for  . . see that one 
against roy in last year 's 

for andy  . a  . is a good , 
burned boston in the finals in his first year , and always 
seems to get his points. anyone in vancouver care to comment on 
as a 

ken for dave  ( flyers ) . any more questions 

for adam  . . is an enormous talent and 
a guy , the the play in adam 's division .  . enough said 

so , even if you count the park i do n't remember who 
else  ( joe ) trade as a double , the horse comes 
out on top .  . i submit that the are always good because of , not 
in spite of him. 

btw , do you really think the will back next  . i 'll bet 
they finish fourth or in the conference , behind any of the following 
pittsburgh , quebec , boston , washington ,  . someone correct me if 
these five teams will not be in montreal 's conference .  . 

in summary , things look for the , at least in the near future. i 
suspect that the next team from la to win the cup will be 
that team that did n't want to play for. 

i admit that i 've been suffering lately with the boston gets hot while 
montreal in the type years. but i do have the sure 
knowledge that the montreal will keep away until 
they hit the right for yet another cup .  . whereas if i were a 
boston fan , i 'd have this kind of that as long as 
is running the show , the will always be good but never 
good enough.

the end of the the appeared to still have his rights , but he 
was n't in san jose , he was n't in kansas city , and his name has n't appeared on 
the wire .  . 

sorry , , but you forgot to ask me. if you check the for 
kansas city , you 'll find that larry has been playing for the games , having 
played in 8 games in the period covered in the between 3 26 and the 
4 16 issue  ( 1 3 4 with 13  . not exactly invisible .  . 

he then was sent down to 
kansas city , walked out from there , and was and later 
when it was revealed that he was injured he then disappeared from 
the watching eyes of  ( as the mailing list is now known to 
officials ) faithful , and neither the nor we miss him. 

well , having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times , this is n't quite 
accurate. he injured his back (a injury ) and did one stupid thing , 
which was to hide it from the and he tried to play through it because 
he knew he was on the  . the then sent him to k . c .  . , at which 
point he the injury .  . since he did n't it , the and 
he about the responsibility and he was for not 
reporting .  . that was eventually worked out , the re him as 
injured and put him into , and when he was able to play then 
him down to k . c .  . he fully expects to play in the again , although clearly 
not with the  ( hiding is a stupid no no , beyond just a 
no  . 

very nice guy. always his butt off. he disappeared because he was 
hurt. i expect he 'll surface with another team at some point  ( probably 
another team ) , but is likely to be a for the rest of 
his career. has a good work and is good at getting other

is n't always enough. his future with the was made clear to me 
one night against the flames when he went behind the and tried to 
hold joel against the board. he literally had one around 's 
and another wrapped around 's stick  . casually turned 
around and fed the in front of the for a goal , as though 
was n't there. can only cover size so far. 

the have told me , point , that he 's gone for good  ( ditto

you have to make room for the kids . , in fact , refused to report to

because , at least from the games i saw him in , he was and looked 
fairly lost on the ice .  . i think he shows potential , but i did n't think he 
was quite ready to make the jump to the  . 

he should be a solid for regular duty next  . 

agreed  ( btw , i still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you 
wish they 'd performed than how they actually performed .  . i wonder whether you

i 'll have to disagree with you on this one. i think vancouver will go as

wo n't even make it out of the first round. i think the kings will make 
it out of the first round , regardless of who they play .  . they seem to be

did anyone else see this game last night just like a game ! ! 
lots of hitting .  .  . but . i was by the video goal judge .  .  .  . 
on all , joe 's goal should n't have counted ! it did n't go in net 
! ! and according to the , the video goal judge said that he 
saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assumed the went in ! 
this is terrible .  .  . hope . crap like this does n't occur in the ! 
the game would have ended in 2 2 tie ! 

i thought the red light went on .  .  . thus . , in the review , the 
would be to find conclusive evidence that the did not go in the 
net .  .  . from . the i say , even from the , the evidence was n't 
conclusive that the was in or out .  .  . in . my opinion .  .  .  . 

it seemed pretty conclusive to me. the clearly hit the 
and then came down on the line. and the , admittedly , 
kept about how they must have had a different view 
because it was obvious to them , and , i would have thought , to anyone who 
saw the , that the did n't go in. the originally 
no goal but the video judges initiated contact with 
the to claim that a goal was in fact  . this , to me , is 
of. seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about

yeah , i would have to say that doug was n't playing 
technically smart  . in any case , to claim as greg did , 
that never made a technical mistake is absolutely 
ludicrous .  . 

later on , in your posting , you make reference to putting words 
into other people 's mouths  .  .  . i . would suggest that your last 
paragraph can only be interpreted in one way .  .  . namely . , that i , 
along with greg , claim that never made a technical 
mistake. if you actually read what i 've written , you will find 
that i make no such claim .  .  . , if logic serves me well , 
you 're contradicting yourself.

richard , dick  .  . and . so on .  .  .  . 

i would take and off of the latter .  . 

good for you. you 'd only be your ignorance of 
course , but to each his own .  .  .  . 

roger , i'm not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a 
function of a lack of knowledge and not an 
opinion  .  .  . but . hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by all 
means go ahead .  .  . that . 's if it makes you feel better. 

i think would be to know that you 've included 
him 

i think should feel to know that he is 
at all. 


my word , such against poor ol' bob  . why does 
he bother you so much .  .  . he . was an effective for his style 
of play .  . 

on this list. i also think you have a relatively naive view 
about what a game .  .  . are an integral part 
of 

certainly are an integral part of any team .  . and that 
is simply because there are not enough solid two way to 
go around. who would you rather have as your checking 
centre doug or doug for that matter i would 
take either or as my checking  . do you 
think could cover bob 

i'm really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here. 
why do n't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ , 
himself , in 

now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob with guy 
, you would have a balanced comparison .  . 

any team .  . the is designed to acknowledge their 
 .  . i . think that most people understand that it 's 
not the prize .  .  . so . down. 

you 're wrong again. the is awarded to the forward that 
does the best job and this may or may not be the 
best  . if does the best job in the 
league i do n't see why he should be out of the running simply 
because he also  . 

i'm wrong again .  .  . hmmm . , let 's see .  .  . where . was i wrong in the 
first place i'm only here , , but i have a feeling 
that you 've setup a you 're wrong again macro key on your 
machine .  . 

i agree that my use of the word is simplistic .  .  . but . i 
think you know what i'm getting at. i would also like to point 
out that 's potential as a winner was never part of 
the debate .  .  . are . you asking me for an opinion if so , i think 
there are far too many other to include 
among the  . 

down if you think that i have the to the 
prize then i suggest that you had best down . 
and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth , let me 
suggest that you down before you bother following up 
on my postings .  . 

i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out 
of things to say about the stars on they start to 
the  . grant , , , bob 
, bob , doug , , wayne , 
bob , bob , ralph , richard , dick 
 .  . and . so on .  .  .  . demonstrates a blanket disregard for these 
individuals as contributors to the game .  .  . so . yes , 
down .  .  . nobody . has claimed that they are gods .  .

ten years ago , the number of in the was roughly a 
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 , the numbers of on 
teams have to the following 

400 
americans 100 
100 

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top 
25 on each of the 24 teams .  . my source is the vancouver sun .  . 

here 's the point there are far too many in the  . i am sick 
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team  ( let 's say , the 
red wings and the canucks ) and seeing names like and 
. is this north america or is n't it , , quebec , 
and are particularly , but the numbers of on other 
teams is getting worse as well. 

is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians 

i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about , the 
rocket i will completely up. as it is now , every time i see 
the play i keep someone will cross check into the 
so hard they have to carry him out on a  .  ( by the way , 
i'm not a fan to begin with ) .  . 

okay , the remark was a little carried away. but the point is that 
i owners all these instead of  ( and 
some  . it denies young the opportunity to play in their 
north american league and instead gives it to , who are n't even 
better  . it 's all  . this european is , 
but until owners get over it , canadian and american will continue 
to have to fight harder to get into their own league .  . 

with the numbers of in the , the problem is clearly 
only getting worse. 

and where would canadian be today without the dont say 
that the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game. 
i mean , look at the way you play these days. less and more  . 
imho , canadian has had a positive curve of development since the 
70 's when the game was more brute than beauty .  .  .  .  .  .  . 

i'm all for the creation of a european league , and let the 
and of the world play on their own continent .  . 

oh , look ! ! you do n't like either .  .  .  .  . 

i just do n't want them on mine. 
too bad almost all of you from europe .  .  .  .  .  . 

hmmm .  .  .  . and what kind of a name is  . does n't sound very canadian to 
me. ) 

ps .  . when analyzing teams like , france and great britain you find that 
a lot of their are with double citizenship .  .  .  . 



richard j. you have no idea what you 're doing. 
oh , do n't worry about that. we 're

any dick  . 

as long as the teams involved do not include the us national team or 
the new york , i 'd take john davidson over bill any 
day. 

means something to me. that is exactly why i like 
 ( and  . on the other hand , is a pompous , bull headed , arrogant 
know it all. he 's a real turn off  ( which is exactly what i do when he 's 
 . one complaint i do have about is that he sometimes talks 
too much. if i wanted that i 'd listen to tim doing a baseball 
game.

when the got , granted there was big , etc , etc , 
and interest was immediately generated .  . did the same thing for la .  . 
however , , neither team would have seen a improvement in 
if the team record did not improve .  . in the year before 
came , pittsburgh finished with 38 points. following his , the 
finished with 53 , 76 , 72 , , 87 , 72 , 88 , and 87 points , with a couple of 

cups thrown in. 

it was at this point the was near capacity  ( 34 out of 40 
sellouts ) yet they had n't made the since  . how do you explain 
a place team breaking records when they have n't been to the 
in 7 years is the explanation , imho .  . 

you could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that 
would make the is the reason. 

funny you should mention it .  .  . this . is exactly the case i was going to make. 

but i think the reason is 
had a point and was the first non to win the hart and 
since  . people turned out to watch him play .  . 

i will grant that a star like will draw , even if the team  . 
but this is short term only i still do not think the increase 
will last , unless the team is a improving butt kicking 
one. pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support 
them. if they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you 'd have knee 
for some of the people jumping off the  . 

also , the following year  ( 88 89 ) the had 89 points not 87 .  . 

ok. my numbers came from the guide and record book. 

they made the to try and build a winner around , that is 
true. but the improvement in came before they started doing 
this  ( coffey late in 1987 ) and before they even had a bound team .  . 
a of occured in 1984 85 from the previous year .  . an 
increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that. the 
of is what did it. 

you can give the credit to since he deserves it. but my point is that 
it was n't himself , but it was the expectation of things to come (i . e .  . 
a team ) that he created by being the next great  . and 
before anybody in and says i'm picking and words , go back 
and read from where this thread started .  .  .  . 

it might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly 
found an interest in and the  . was it gee , is 
amazing , i 'll go watch him play , or was it gee , now we 've got a kick 
ass guy on our side , i 'll go watch him play . i think it was the latter .  . 

similar thing happened in l . a .  . before 
's , about per game. after , constant  . they 
are still selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement 
since 's first year there. how do you explain it people are going 
to see  . they certainly are n't going to see a winner , they have n't 
got a winner .  . they 've had much better teams in their past history than 
they currently have , yet they did n't draw as well then. 

i do n't think this is accurate. the sell , but people do n't go to 
the games. i think this thread has already been discussed .  .  . 
in la do n't always use their  . so in effect , after the kings 
initial success following 's  ( 68 to 91 points , same source ) 
and jump , there has been an effective drop in 
even though sales may not have changed much. 

whether or not the kings are a  winner  is  . i claim that since 
's they have at the very least been  .  . i . also claim 
that has made a stupid move in trying to the 
 .  . but . that 's another story and included only because i do n't like 
) .  . anyway , did do some heavy around , and 
that was also responsible for the and 
sales , etc. but as i said , when the kings have been in there little 
over the past couple of years there have been empty at the 
forum even if the were sold .  . 

i think in the case of a or , the can 
as the major drawing power. 

for the short term , imo. although i think that it 's inevitable that the team 
will improve with a such as or , simply because they 
make people around them better. 

but sure as hell helps .  . ) 

well , at least we are in full agreement here ! 

this does not make roger 's point any more valid , but the are n't 

so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point could n't resist .  .  .  . 

getting a huge jump in , yet they are getting a huge 
jump in  . this is due to the emergence of  . 
they have the 17th best record in , it sure as hell is n't because 
they are  . 

yes , but they are doing no worse than last year .  . i think the same type of 
reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people 
showing up at games. it 's difficult to , but do you think 
that if the miss the next that in the year after they 
will maintain their levels i seriously doubt it , because in that 
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone , with or without 
 . 

i did provide the example of rocket and the of the 
 .  . did . you leave it out because you do n't know much about the if 
that 's the case then fair enough , but if it is n't the case then i'm curious 
to hear your explanation.

living in the bay area , i do not get enough 
to pull something out of the , (i would appreciate comments 
on the 3rd line match ups ) but here is the basic 
idea .  .  .  . 

and have no business playing against 
the wings. they are too small .  . the key to any success 
will have to be clark .  . he is the only centre who can have 
any presence within 3 stick lengths of the  . where the 
hell is can  ( in days past ) get under peoples 
 . put a little more , has to be an asshole. 
he used to be good at it. we need him now. 

perhaps , perhaps the can shut down 's second line. 
i was to see and flying last night. 
these guys are the swing for the wings. last year they 
did a major in the and were to blame for the quick 
of the wings. this has to happen again . clark 
should be able to out this line. should do a 
nasty on  . clark should bang the hell out of  . 
score score !

as suggested i would and to stir things up

if the would be enough to play their

let them play .  .

here is a summary of 's 's corner from april 18 , 1993 .  . 
it took place in the first of game 1 of the montreal quebec 
series .  . 

pre game comments 

's comments were mostly aimed at the  .  .  . the 
who gets back his all star form  ( roy or hextall ) can win the series 
for his team .  . 

summary 

this took place  . was holding a hot dog that 
he bought from the stand. 

ron started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the 
sun .  . it featured a picture of , who just saw his 
and will you look at , eh means another 6 weeks 
of me. beauty .  . 

next , talked about the hot dog he was holding .  . according to 
him , the hot dogs at the quebec are the best food in all 
the in the  . 

from there , commented on the quebec montreal game. the game 
had great , because paul calls the best game 
in the  . in , the la game was terrible .  .  .  . all 
stop and go , over 50 of penalties called against 
by dan  . its getting so that the who calls the most 
penalties gets to in the finals .  . 

next , ron showed an old picture of , when he was playing for 
the rochester americans of the  . some of the 
that he had in the quebec  .  .  . during the memorial cup 
and the  . 

finally , and ron discussed becoming of the 
 . the were a team who  . 
sorry for temporary ron smith , who had 
several key  ( to and patrick ) and who 
went cold .  . 

had some criticism for the team .  .  .  . the party 's over , 
adolf  ( keenan ) is there. the organization will no longer 
be a  country  .  .  .  . ny should be of themselves .  .  .  . if 
they go in the with adolf there , they 'll be hanging from the 
by their  . 




nothing too special in this  . 

i 'll give it a 5 . 5 . out of 10.

i think that you are incorrect , roger .  . patrick , 
and adams all played or in the league before becoming 
front office types .  . hence , they did help build the league , although 
they were not great themselves. 

's contributions as a and were far greater than 
those of the above combined .  . should we name a division or after 
him and and the bunch were purely because they 
were powerful owners .  . as owners they certainly did help to build the 
league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether. 
are we going to honour those who contributed to the league 's evolution 
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the 
itself 

i agree that a name is a name is a name , and if some people 
have trouble with names that are not easily by the , 
then changing them to names that are more easily seems like 
a reasonable idea. if we can get people in the  ( arena ) door by being 
, then let 's do so. once we have them , they will realize 
what a great game is , and we can then teach them something 
the history of the game. 

i ca n't disagree with you here. 

the history of the names can be put rather  . all of the 
used the game of to make money. can you imagine a 
division a division or how about a green division 

no , i would not want to see a division .  . but to say 
that these owners are , hence all people are 
would be fallacious .  . , for example , was a 
individual  ( from what i have  . 

what have you heard the major was the definitive little ! he 
originated the phrase if you ca n't 'em in the you ca n't 
'em on the ice .  . that was his idea of  . do you think , by chance , 
that is a individual 

also , is n't the point of to make money 
for all those involved , which would include the  . what i think 
you might be saying is that the have not made as much money as 
should have been their due , and it is the that are what make 
the game great not the people who put them on the ice , so 
division after people rather than is adding insult 
 ( in the form of lesser recognition ) to injury  ( less money than was 
 . 

the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and 
that is it is the that are what make the game great and not the 
people who put them on the ice 

exactly true. divisions and after and the bunch 
is the same kind of that put stein in the hall of fame .  . i have 
always thought that this was nonsense.

i am very sick of  ( fans(and they are my second favorite team ) 
talk about how why ca n't forget about when we have 
forgotten all about adam beside the obvious fact that 's career 
was never by  while is still bother by his injury , 
i think the most important reason is 

adam has played clean ever since ! while 
continues to play  ( dirty(yes , trying to hit a where he s injured

forget about when , when i watch high

hitting a when he 's injured is can you explain this statement 
do you mean a who was just injured on the  ( ice ) or do you mean a 
who is playing hurt. if a is hurt he should not bother playing because 
i do n't any should be let up on just because they are playing 
hurt. 

i'm not an fan but at least i can the fact he is like 's 
in the respect that part of his game is to really other 
off as that 's part of his job  ( but he lacks 's size ! ) .  . 

i am an  ( and pgh ) fan , and what me off about the whole adam 
debate is that plays hard hitting  ( nothing wrong with 
that ) while does what he does when the only way to win a game is to 
intentionally hurt someone  ( which ! ) .  . 

that really me off are the ones who insist on hitting from behind

got to go (i would really like to see get pasted as he is one of the

i thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this to stop crap

heaven imho , if they could get rid of the existing , and institute a new 
system with more than one on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble makers

as the subject suggests the flames were not impressive this afternoon , 
dropping a 6 3 decision to the la kings .  . most of the flames 
to show up , especially in their own , as the kings hit at least 
five posts ! the flames best line was probably

2 red wings vs. 3 in 6 

comment it 's kind of tough to rely on as the team 's main weapon .  . 
he 's a great , but knows all about , which 
puts the burden on steve even more. 's had a hell of a 
and is what you need in the  . 

for a great ) , you seem to remember very little 
history. always shows up in the , which is why he is a 
great pick in pools .  . do n't forget about , one of the 
top in the , imho , and who has the most cup 
of any active  ( correct me if i'm wrong) .  . wings in a 
 . 

oh yeah , how come could never take the caps out of the patrick 
division he up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in 
the second round two years ago. he rarely , if ever , makes it out of the 
division .  . 

1 vs. 4 in 5 

comment it 's more like vancouver vs.  . king and  ( for 
enforcing ) help out a little , maybe a game. 
have their number .  . 

except that the are playing like shit. can win this 
one , though i think vancouver will to slip by. 

so are the , but they can still pull it out. vancouver has 's 
number , so it really does n't matter. 

2 flames vs. 3 kings flames in 7 

comment 7 games looks good as the kings always seem to battle it out. 
flames are back in running and wo n't know of last year 's 
 . is on a tear , but there are too many 
surrounding the kings .  . 

kings always seem to battle it out when where 

kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7 , they never play a four or five 
game serious. there 's a difference between it out and it 
out , as i take to pull it out in 7. 

po ! ! ! we do what comes naturally ! 
patrick division semi 's  91 cup you see now , wait for the 
6 , 3  possibility , do n't you see a 
lead , 1 0 12 straight ! strong resemblance .  .  .  .  89

does anyone know if all the patrick division games are going to be televised 
on and abc if some games are going to be left  ( out(or blanked out by 
southern abc affiliates ) , i was wondering if anyone out there knows 
of any sports in which are by  . i do n't 
want to miss out on any of the games. i am sure that there are some 
 ( fans(now that the are dead ) who would want to watch every 
game in  . 


circle tuesday , april 20th on your tv  . will carry game 2 
from pittsburgh 's or as they are it pittsburgh vs. 
4th place  .  . personally , buffalo or montreal 
quebec city is a much better but is for a 
in the series which it 's not likely to get the way has been 
playing for the past month or so. 

i 'd personally prefer buffalo boston , as a birthday gift from , 
but i do n't think the folks at will that for me ) 
has this for the patrick division , it 
seems. 


some days i have to him he 's not

after reading some of the reports of possible to milwaukee or that 
milwaukee should have an team , i thought i 'd pass along a story i heard 
recently. this is second hand , so i do n't know how true it is , but i have 
no reason to doubt it either. 

center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee minor 
team .  . the owner of the  ( sorry , i ca n't remember his name) 
either owns or at least out the majority of the funds to build the 
center .  . 

lloyd  . 


supposedly he was approached by the about an , but 
turned it down because he thought the fee of 50 million was too 
high. 

like i said , i do n't know whether this story is true or just a , but if 
it 's true , do n't look for an team in milwaukee anytime soon. the 
are n't going to be forced out of the building and you wo n't see an club 
and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the 's 
milwaukee play there as well. 

yes , it is true that he refused to buy a from the for but 
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
less than that. he felt that no one would pay for an team , and 
that he would simply wait to buy an existing for less than that. but 
the market him , and 5 teams have been created for in the 
last three years , and even the existing teams ca n't be moved for less than 
and i doubt that he could get one for that little. 

and lost. now he 'll have to pay more.

actual cup stated new york . can anyone verify this i 
forgot the exact year that this supposedly occured .  . any die hard

in article , r . clark .  . writes 

so was giving up almost another goal a game while facing a proportional 
number of shots for the number of he played , and while i have t 
actually checked i believe that he a lower quality of opponent .  . 

make that less than half a goal a game. the lower quality of 
argument is as neither nor had any say in 
the matter. that was 's decision. 

so in other words , if out the and out 
the , that 's because it was the decision come on , 
joe , think about what you 're saying ! who they played is very significant .  . 
why they played them is what 's irrelevent .  . a low against good teams 
is better than a low against bad teams in the context of comparing two 
 . a low is better then a higher  . a low against good 
teams is much , much better than a higher against bad teams in the context 
of comparing two  . 

the fact of the matter is that , despite last nights , he does n't 
have what it takes .  . last night was due to an inept team much more 
than 's  . a 3 on 1 and they do n't get a shot away a 2 on none 
and one guy just passes and stops , the other guy into 's 

c mon , so the were inept .  . a is a  . during 
both of 's against , mike was quoted 
as saying he did n't think the had much offensive past their 
first line. does that make 's less impressive because of 
's lack of offense 

yes it does ! absolutely .  . in the context of comparing two . 
of course , at the end of the 2 points is 2 points no matter how you 
get them. and on the score sheets are  . but if you 're a 
between two , or a looking to make a trade , you 
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets .  . i did n't see the second 
game , but the first one was a masterpiece .  . there was nothing in 
that game to judge tommy on because he was n't tested .  . the same 
for in the game. two real chances , one he made a 
great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other  . if 
you were judging on that game alone , you have very little to go by. 

but if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the , you saw a 
stand on his head to get that  . that was a 1 in action. 
does n't have a game like that in him. 

well if you look back to when was the 1  ( soderstrom 
was being treated for his heart  . the flyers finished at 
6 3 1 and were 9 10 4 overall .  . and there 's no way of knowing where the flyers 
would have finished if was n't wearing the  n black .  . i'm glad 
we do n't have to find out anytime soon either because he is one hell of a 
 . i would take him over right now , but i still think has 
what it takes to be the 1 guy. he enough during the 
 91 to make flyers think that way too. 

do n't be so sure of that. flyers never says bad thing about 
, but they do n't say too much on the good side either. i 've seen 
at least two where every time was asked how happy he was 
to have two good , it was tommy this , tommy that , and oh , yeah , 
has played well too. 

by the way , what was the final card on monday night team picture by any 
chance 

flyers in the hall of fame .  . kinda dull , really. they handed out a 
team picture to everybody who walked in from pizza , but it was the 
same picture they sold in the programs in mid  . had names like , 
 .  .  . 

and how did the flyers choose the who received the shirts off our 
backs 's jersey after breaking the club 's single 
point record would have been nice. but knowing your luck you would have 
won 's ) ! 

mostly random , some were given out by having certain 
autographs on the team  . i do n't like that method since i 've seen 
guards help out people get things like pictures , surely if they 
got their hands on an picture they 'd hold 'em for their  .

not too low perhaps , but surely not as high as that of an european 
division .  . the finnish team , for example , would contain all currently on 
the national team plus a top class foreigner or two .  . they would be in an 
entirely different league than or , both of whom have perhaps a 
dozen of international class if even that. why for a minor 
league when you could have the best 

it is no matter what you call the teams , and , or 
and , the best in finland would eventually end up in 
those teams anyway , if they were in the big league .  . 


i 'd rather spend 150 marks to watch the play montreal , the ny 
or los than 50  ( marks ) for the privilege to see vs. 
or even if .  . there 's nothing like the , period. 

for now. maybe we should first just expand finnish league to 
allow teams from countries to entry ! then others will get interested 
in the idea , that maybe one should something bigger .  . the ultimate 
goal , as you want it , would be european division in  . btw. does that 
make a final with an team against american

locked away , waiting for the delay to start ... 

it 's nice that the are starting out their on network 
television ... too bad that their game has been on 
am for an early baseball game ! 

it 's a 12 2 win by the texas ... and they 're the 
delay by another half hour for the ! ! ! 

you think that 's bad i'm in green , oh , and we get abc from 
 . well , the co .  . decided to totally pre the game  ( no 
delay , no nothing ) for a stupid ! is very big around here , 
too. i had to listen to my win on my car radio out in the 
lot. i can just be for a strong radio because being 230 
from pittsburgh , the usually is n't good at all. i ca n't

the red wings put a lot of on ice with a 6 3 
of the  . all you have now seen the 
power of the mighty red offense .  . 's defense in no match for the 
offense .  . as for the defense , , and came out 

did they move back to defense why did i see him his ass 
in front of all night somebody is going to have to discipline 
if the want to win the series .  . perhaps a clark should 
hit the ice at the end of a long shift and him out for 
a while .  .  .  . 


during the regular , when the is down , not many teams 
have who will continually go and park themselves in front of 
the teams net .  .  . and . the of the defense in 
this regard thus did n't matter .  .  . however . , the are a different 
story .  .  . every . good team is going to have who are going to 
become plants in front of  .  . and . the relatively 
core will finally be exposed as weak an inept .  . 

hard work will go a long way during the regular  .  . almost . 
to 100 points .  .  . and . the credit for that .  .  . but . in the 
talent matters , because everyone begins working hard.

it was great to hear that is bringing back ! it reminded me that a 
couple of years ago there was talk that both (sp ) and state 
trying to their programs to  . 1 status .  . i also seem to remember 
that they had some trouble with new rule about just who was allowed to 
at the  . 1 level. was that ever also , i was just 
wondering if there is any college east of  ( alaska  . 
with the new popularity of on the west coast , i would expect there to 
be some interest building at the levels too. anyone heard anything

1. first a teams .  ( goals goals scored )

2. divide this number by 5 to take into account of the fact that there 
are 5 on the ice and each is 1 5 responsible for the team . 

3. a is  ( his raw )  ( team  . 

btw if anyone could and post it would be 
greatly appreciated. i might find the time to do so but do n't count on 
it. 

i have a filter set up for the  . when it is posted for 
the end of i 'll repost the team  . you do n't need to go through 
the complicated team you are using all you need is the team 
average by summing all the individual  and divide by the total 
number of on the team .  . this will be a little because the 
who have been recently will have come with scores based 
on their original teams .  . this should n't distort it too bad though. if you 
want to look at individual from this perspective then go ahead 
you 'll require the original though. 

question 
if a team uses 40 in a do you merely divide the total 
by 40 if so , a who plays in only 1 game is considered equally 
valuable as a who plays in all of them. 

another way of looking at the same thing is to compare the deviation from 
the mean for the team of the to the standard deviation for the team .  . 
i 'll post both. 

since the standard deviation for each team is different , i am how 
between teams that these are. should n't the average 
standard deviation in the league be used 

i am interested in seeing each method. 
but i still think that mine is the best. if for no other reason than  .

throughout a tough couple of  . honorable mention and 
mark  . probably more appropriate in the heroes category than 
, but  ( 17 goals , 320 pim ) has been the working on 
the team and is as a center and  . i guess 
i place a greater emphasis on hard work than when determining value. 

biggest surprise geoff  . he had 13 goals and 31 points last 
as a center , then moved to left and has so far put up 45 goals and 80 
points. he now has a new record 21 power play goals , most all coming 
from the right circle , his garden  . honorable mention andrew 
and  . the of , , , and 
have been the most attention , but is just 23 
and will score close to 90 points this  . he has quite nicely assumed the 
role of number one center on the team and works very well with  . 
around the for a number of but is still 24 and will put 
up about 20 goals and 50 points this  . , like , started 
better once he was converted from center to , 
although went to the left and went to the 
right side. 

biggest hands down , john  . had a 
point last year , his first full after the trade .  . started 
the off of summer back , and flat on his face  ( appropriate , 
since he spent all of his career flat on his ass , and about it) .  . 
just 9 point on 19 games , was a , commanded 
the to a 9 success percentage ( 21 with sanderson ) , and his 
way out of town .  . worst of all , his 4 year , contract had three years left 
to run , so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the 
offered to  . honorable mention steve , also 
after a 3 year , 2 . contract eric , who showed of 
, but overall has played poorly jim , who was a much better 
two ago than he is now and frank , who only 
seemed to play well when burke was out for an extended period and he got 
to make a number of starts in a row .  .

team biggest biggest 
team surprise 

philadelphia flyers 

sitting .  .  . look . at 's record with eric and without .  .  .  . 
there is no doubt. is probably the biggest surprise .  . 

re eric true , but fortunately we did n't get to find out what they would be 
like without for 30 games. 

absolutely .  . 4 in 39 games for a without a lot 
of defense in front of him. to and who are 
a over their career best. but thinks he 's paul  ( puts 
ahead of defending ) and has off big time. 

was a big question mark this year and was coming off  . 42 
points in 49 games is not bad at all , and recently he 's been a huge factor 
in the they 've gotten .  . has never had a point a game in 
his career , his is very typical for him. how does he qualify as 
a if anything he 's a surprise .  . 

my choice would be if i went strictly by what was expected of , 
but i never thought that he had what it takes to be a 1  . my biggest 
is bill  . i thought that he was going to be the perfect 
for this young team , instead he 's made too many bad and imho 
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the this year .  . any 
that thinks putting eric at the point on power plays is a 
bright idea needs to go back to school.

started the tradition of throwing an onto the ice with every win .  . after 
each victory , one would be before the found its way to the

the 18 game carries over to next  .

game , as carry over from one year to another. 

hmmmm , i'm not sure this is true. according to mike lang and good old 
, along with the rest of the tv in pittsburgh , they 
could have stopped because it is a regular mark. 
i would think this would also hold with an for regular 
games. 

however , you are right that the does carry over from 
last year .  . and with 1 more win , i believe they tie an record

i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they 
face them in the finals  ( which is what all the 
are  . although i think bryan is probably the best 
i have ever seen in 

how do you figure that when bryan took over the wings they were 
a pretty good team that was for the cup but looked 
unlikely to win it. now they are a pretty good team that is for 
the cup but looks unlikely to win it. a truly great would 
have been able to make the to push the team to the 
of the and maybe win the cup .  . a good  ( like murray ) can 
maintain the team 's success but ca n't push them to the next level. 

when brought the wings to the conference finals twice a 
few years back , he had everyone on the team giving 100 percent , but he 
had very little talent .  . he had , bob  ( who had drinking 
problems at the time) , and a couple of decent in and 
who got hot. that 's about it. can you name one on those 
earlier teams who even deserved to be in the all star game , much less 
actually got there , other than and like , 
give me a break ! when they in both of those conference 
finals , as hard as they played , it was clear they a team that simply 
had superior talent to the wings. that 's why they could not get to the 
finals .  . also , at that time the division was still the 
division in , and getting past chicago , and was not as 
impressive as it is today. 

has brought talent to the wings that they did not have a 
few years ago when was and was  . to name a few , 
, , and paul  ( who has made a definite positive impact on 
the power play  . 

has built one of the most teams in at the present , with 
the possible exception of the pittsburgh  . the wings have at least 
five 30 goal that i can think of , and a couple of with over 
100 games worth of experience. 's one failing is that unlike 
the other 's you mentioned  ( who are definitely also good , do n't get me 
wrong) , he has not found for himself a strong to motivate the team to 
go out and give 100 percent for the full 60 every night like they 
did the last time they made a cup run. when a team or loses , it 's a 
reflection of the and the , which was the point of my original 
post. if the team their opponent in terms of talent but loses 
anyway  ( which has been the case this year when the wings have struggled ) , 
that indicates that the has done his job in building up the team but the 
has failed to motivate them. if , as in the case of the last run the 
wings made in the before came , they gave opponents a hard 
time who should have them easily , that indicates good making 
up for a lack of talent .  . 

all of this is fine. i never said that was a bad  . i merely said 
that he is n't the best in or even a for that honor .  . 
if is as great as you claim the wings would have won the cup 
by now probably more than once. if he was as great a as you claim 
and he was as poor a as you claim he would have been intelligent 
enough to the to push the team to the next level of success. 
but is an average  ( unspectacular ) and a pretty good 
so none of this is true anyway.

if had been in position the would have never crossed the line. 

from this account , it does n't sound like you even saw the goal , mike .  . smith 
came out from behind his own net and fired a pass that hit in the 
back of the  . was backing up at the time and never saw what 
happened. the went straight off 's and into the net. never 
had a chance. there was no play back to the , in fact perry 
of had just it in and smith was it. 

it was unfortunate that it happened smith is a nice guy and was only a 
at the time , and on his birthday too. but all the blame lies with him. starting 
in tell never to make a cross ice pass in front of 
their own net. too much chance of having it , or hitting the 
, or whatever. 

and to the people who say that smith cost the the series , i can only 
say that he certainly did n't cause the team to lose the other three games. 
there was no reason for a team like to be late 
in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. everybody on the team

this game would have been great as part of a double on abc or 
the league would have been able to push back to back by 
and the great one. unfortunately , the only network 
that would have done that was , seen in few areas and hard to 
justify as a pay channel .  . )

not too low perhaps , but surely not as high as that of an european 
division .  . the finnish team , for example , would contain all currently 
on 
the national team plus a top class foreigner or two .  . they would be in an 
entirely different league than or , both of whom have perhaps a 
dozen of international class if even that. why for a minor 
league when you could have the best 

how many of international class an average team has .  . 6 10 
top just play more in smaller  . is the quality of european 
really poor , then recent years only few north american  ( usually good farm 
players ) have got place in finnish league or , while most 
have been back .  .

the flyers team that can any team on any night showed up at the spectrum 
sunday night , and dominated the thoroughly en route to a 4 0 
 . tommy will get credit for the , but he barely broke 
a until the third period as the flyers defense kept the from 
any serious attack .  . 



is day to day with a bruised  . 



jason was added to the for his first game. jason was the flyers 
second pick in the first round  ( 15th overall ) of the 1992 entry draft .  . 19 years 
old , 6 4 ,  . in 62 games with the tri city americans he had 10 goals , 
12 and  . he plays left and defense , he played defense in 
this game although bobby said that bill was planning to use him 
up front as well. 

was returned to  . he actually left after the second period 
of the kings game , flew to , got the game goal in a bears ot win , 
and played again for sunday night.

replaced in the 3rd period. 

game summary 

if the flyers played like this every night , they 'd be in the this 
year .  . the flyers hit everything that moved .  . they created chance after 
chance. they snuffed out everything that the tried to do. 

jason made a good play on his first shift that almost created a goal. 
he had the in the top of the left offensive circle all alone , but instead 
of taking the shot he found the net on the other side. 
a perfect pass and a good shot across 's body should have been a 
goal , but made a great save reading the play .  . 

gave the 7th power play the first chance when 
he doug at 4 25 .  . the flyers 21st penalty killing 
was almost the entire game , and set the tone on this kill .  . the 
got almost nothing but long shots , and the defense swept 
away every  . 

after the power play , the flyers got a goal on an play .  . 
gave the to greg at the right point , and he sent a drive at the 
net. made the save and kicked the right into the feet of josef 
and bob , who were in the  . was able to 
get his stick on the and push it out to who was into 
the from the right circle , and he lifted a over for 
a 1 0 flyers lead at 8 10. 

the flyers kept the pressure on , and was the only keeping the flyers 
from building on their lead for a while. eventually things down and 
defense  . each team got an occasional chance , but the 
were strong .  . started giving some like in his own  . 
then , who was looking to a hit gave him , thought he had 
a chance to even the score .  . he had up at center ice , into 
him , and him into the center ice  . the only problem was that 
was a little far from the , and mike felt that it 
a call at 15 38 

the could n't get anything going on the power play as the flyers were 
very aggressive  ( for a change ) on the kill .  . 

with time running out in the period , carried through the neutral 
and handed to as they approached the 's blue line. they were in 
a with clark and , tried a pass 
to through the feet of that connected to , but then clark 
checked off the  . then tried to clear , but it was weak and 
went right to who had the point. he it from just inside 
the blue line. got his stick on it and it past his own 
at 19 55 . 1 .  . shots were 13 8 flyers in the period. 

the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave 
up in his offensive  . during the power play , the 
flyers got a little when the up into the air and eric 
it down , but thought it hit his stick above his head. we 
could see from our at the other end of the ice that it only hit his 
and the confirmed , but the went to the other end. as time was 
running out in the advantage , found with a pass across the goal 
mouth but made the save .  . the kicked back to the right corner where 
picked it up , passed it out to eric through the right circle , 
and eric one past at 7 55 .  . with the assist , past 
bobby 's 74 75 , the second best one total for a flyer at 
117 .  . eric up to 4th all time in flyers with 67 points. 

mike took down al at 8 30 to give the flyers another chance on 
the power play .  . not much pressure before ended the power play with 
a at 9 19 .  . not much happened on the 4 on 4 , although the had most 
of the  . the flyers the short power play .  . 
a little at 13 14 .  . and got , keith 
got a bloody face. dave then took a and got greg a 
minor at 13 46 to set up a 4 on 3. the showed that 's 
stick stopped making contact with long before he around and  . 
again the flyers the power play , led by  . 
made a hit when he came out of the box on  . 
tried to everybody with his  . he had the at the point , 
and just a pass down the  . he made all the flyers look silly as 
nobody could get a stick on it , and it got to at the side of the net , 
but him. 

the flyers picked things up after the kill was over , but did n't 
get anything home. shots were 13 10 flyers .  . 

the flyers were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period , and they 
decided that if tommy wanted a , he was going to have to work for it a 
little. 

the flyers got most of the chances in the first 7 or so of the 
period , but could n't get past  . then the got tired of making 
road kill out of them , and  . 2 each for doug and 
 ( unsportsmanlike conduct ) and 2 each for glenn and  ( roughing ) 
all at 7 02 .  . then took a penalty at 7 51 on  . 

again the flyers the power play .  . 

at about the 12 minute mark , dave got a shot away from his left 
circle that got through  . the was on it 's side , and 
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards 
it  ( think of how a inevitably starts to one way or the 
 . seconds later up at 12 24 to give the 
another chance on the power play .  . on the advantage , after 
while lying down , got the through 
, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept 
away by one of his  . they kept the pressure on , but was 
equal and preserved the  . 

cross checked ken to get hot and start a 
at 16 01 .  . no thrown , got the initial minor , 
and each got  . at 17 02 and 
expressed their dislike for each other and got 2 each for to 
set up another 4 on 4. mike down ryan in the flyers 
as they were for the , and while was down he 
his stick across 's face. the flyers were not happy with that at all. 
5 8 al paired up with 6 1 , and started throwing  . 
upward .  . well , al held his own , much to the delight of the crowd. each got 
a couple in before going down in a head , and al got a standing o ! 
penalties 5  ( cross check ) game , clark , 10 each .  . 
and 5 each  ( fighting ) at 17 49 .  . 

so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers .  . the had no interest 
in on the lead .  . , and played until 
found all alone in the left circle , he controlled the and 
blasted it past at 18 39 .  . 

that was all the , tommy would not face another shot .  . 
did , but kept the flyers off the board. 4 0 flyers , shots were 9 8 flyers in the 
3rd. probably the strongest game i 've seen from the flyers since the all star 
break .  . number 4 for , all since 1 10. for 2nd most in 
the , but he 's played games than  ( 6 ) or the i ca n't 
remember that he 's with. 

next up it 's the tuesday night in  . the flyers cannot 
be eliminated if they win , but a loss coupled with an win that night 
in washington would be the official end. 

flyers up to points on the in 78 games. last year they had 75 points 
in 80 games  ( 5 under  . , so they need at least 8 points in their last 6 
games to improve on that only by percentage points  ( 5 under in is better 
than 5 under in  . 

tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. the tragic number for 
is 5 points , i watched the blow a 4 2 third period lead at home to 
lose 5 4 before i finished this up. why 5 points instead of 4 well , the flyers 
will win the tie if they them , whereas the win tie 
against the flyers and so need only a tie .  . the could 
down the stretch as they play the , the twice , the flyers , and 
finish up with 2 games against the caps .  . so i guess place could be the 
goal for the team to focus on.

 . he plays hard at all times , does n't disregard his 
and is a good leader. rewarded him be increasing his 
ice time. 

can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude. 
this the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time. 

throughout the year , francis recieved more ice time than 
 . i have never seen on this subject , i am pretty 
sure that had more points per minute played that francis .  . when 
you add to that 's better , i think it becomes evident 
that had a better not that francis had a bad one. 


actually , what i think has become more evident , is that you are determined to 
your ignorance at all cost .  . did not have a better than 
francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a of 
knowledge. save your almost devotion to the almighty 
plus ... it is the most stat available. 

until the a more useful statistic including ice 
time per game and some measure of its quality (i . e .  . , is the put out 
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he up 
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc ) , i would 
much rather see the disappear instead of having its dubious 
merits by those with little understanding of its implications .  .

had their own  ( sp ) pro team a couple of years ago.

the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will 
show up to see the play the times than see the

listen , , this is  . the , to be precise .  . and in the , 
there exist these things called ties . a tie occurs when a game ends 
with the score for each team equal .  . each team gets one point for a tie .  . 
there also these things called . a win is when one team has a 
higher score than the opponent .  .  ( oh yeah , only two teams play each other 
at a time , so i can say the opponent  . ) . a team gets two points for a 
win .  . so , let 's say that a team has a record of 38 , 36 losses , and 10 
ties .  . another team has a record of 40 , 38 losses and 6 ties .  . the 
first team has  ( 38 2 ) 10 86 points. the second team has  ( 40 2 ) 6 86 
points. wow ! they both have the same number of points , but the number 
of is different ! how did they do that ! ! ! ! that 's amazing .  . so , 
, when people talk about being the first , well , then 
that 's what it means. in our example , the second team would win the

had the same number of points. if you did n't understand this post , ,

paul is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the  .

the  penalty came in o . t .  . , being an ex himself , 
was looking to call penalties on the while letting the 
get away with murder .  .  . we . was robbed ! ! ! ! 

no. patrick roy is the reason the game was lost , and ron is the 
reason quebec won .  . everybody said it would come down to , that 
was the key , etc etc. well , the key does n't quite fit if you 're 
montreal .  . 

i do n't buy this at all. roy was the reason the game was  .  .  . and that 
would not have been the case had kept his cool. 
gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ... 
both 's and  shots were by , but just because 
his were early in the game , no one seems to care. roy stood on his head 
for the first 15 of the game when the were from 
end to end. 's break after the goal and the first shot by 
young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy .  . roy 
for most of the game , but roy becomes the and the hero 
because roy 's team did n't make full use of their opportunities .  . 

, on the other hand , had a lot of lucky ... he played very 
well , but the shot off the post in ot , the over 
 stick , the , the 3 chances for ... all 
those opportunities were not finished off by montreal , and it cost them. 
was n't particularly on those plays ... 

blaming is just an 
excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst 
goals he could possibly allow .  . he even saw the whole shot ,  . 

sure , no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. the , but against 
an explosive team like quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with 
a that was totally unnecessary .  . 

montreal played a solid game  ( although they still do n't know how to clear 
traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even  . 

i disagree. roy played well because he was n't the whole night. 
the defense , for the 1st time this , played , keeping , 
, and out of the most of the night. 

normally i would say that any team that a 2 goal lead with less than 
five , let alone two , to go in time in a game 
especially needs to be their collective heads .  . but i do n't 
think this was a team loss  ( although should have been able to clear 
the just prior to the first quebec  . 

this most certainly was a team loss .  .  .  . missed his opportunities , 
as did and  . took a bad penalty .  . and 
were silent . and were a step behind all night. roy gave 
up the bad goal. roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss. 

roy is paid big money to 
play .  . he looked like a in an industrial league on 's shot .  . 

and did n't on 's goal please. roy is paid big money because 
that is his value compared to other ... and he still is in the top 5 , 
when you consider the defense , or lack of one , that played in front of him 
for most of the  . 

should start in the next game. if not that , he should let 
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two .  .  .  . and . maybe this 
article , if possible. 

the montreal media is the to praise and then 
comments against the  . they are no better than uninformed  . why should 
they read the papers they played of to shut 
down quebec .  . all they need , and for the rest of the series is the 
extra 2. 

red light to face quebec .  .  . rubbish .  . that 's a guaranteed way to end the 
series 4 0. who would be taught a lesson by this 
the , the media , and , perhaps. certainly not the rest of the team .  . 

i did n't think the around was as bad as the second goal. i also did n't 
think scott young should have gotten around the  ( ca n't remember who ) 
in the first place. but you are correct , it should n't have gone in 
regardless .  . 

if you mean the goal should never have gone in , because there should never 
have been an ot , then i agree. but the goal itself was a great piece of work 
by young. roy had both the near and far posts covered , but young the 
up under roy 's as he wrapped around the net ... not a bad goal at all.

just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that 
montreal will send 4 15 million including 
and brian to , will send eric 
to ottawa , and ottawa will give it 's first round pick to montreal .  . 


obviously some reporter for the ottawa sun got taken by an april 
fools joke .  .  . probably . started by someone with the or the 
 . 

like for example .  .  . who . is going to the flyers for the 
15 million they paid to the  .  . like . the are 
going to get and 15 million .  . the flyers sent the 
equivalent of 6 or 7  ( when you include the draft choices ) 
to quebec , and they are going to get only four back .  . 

some reporter was had real and someone must be having a 
real good laugh seeing as how the so much of the sports media 
has chosen to this utter nonsense. 

if this is true , it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa 
gets to choose 1st overall .  . can ottawa afford  


can you think .  .  . it . cannot possibly be true .  .  . no . need for the if ! 

personally , i ca n't see giving up for anything. 
they did n't give away that much to quebec just to trade him away 
again. not to mention that seems to be a huge draw in 
and that he represents a successful future for the 
 . 

ottawa may be better off taking the 4 15 from montreal 
for the pick .  . 


i ca n't believe that anyone would consider giving such crap even 
the consideration .  .

about 4 or 5 weeks ago i read in the sun a quote from it 
went something like 
yep , 's the man. he 's responsible for the team 's success .  .  . i'm . a 
nobody around here. 

how can you assume it was a remark 
for someone whose first language is not english , i would interpret 
that comment to mean that he believes is the on the team and that 
he is just one of the other normal  . quite i might say. 

well , i do n't recall assuming anything , except perhaps that the 
who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the impression 
came from him  ( steve ) .  . besides , to my knowledge has a pretty 
fair grasp of the english language .  .  . and . his recent comment after the 
game would indicate that this remark is what i think it to be. very low.

to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious. your

just curious , roger , but since you have such a vast knowledge of the 
game and the league , how come you have n't made a living out of it 
there must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field .  . i'm sure 
you 'd be of great help to , say , the as an assistant or

a fine 26 year history came to a close , as the minnesota north stars , 
or norm 's stars  ( whichever you prefer ) lost to the red wings by a score of 
5 3. the stars goals were by mike and , who 
two including the final one in history , with less than a minute to 
play .  . 


yes , it 's a that the lost a fine team in one of the best 
in the country. being a north stars fan , it is sad to 
see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into 
at the hands of a truly owner. 

the will an in the cities 
within the next five years. even if this is the case , a lot has been 
lost in the north stars move .  .  .  .

game summary 

say , if anybody from buffalo is reading this , where did you people get that 
woman who the we had to turn down the volume ! 

the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have 
been teams out lately by holding the to only 8 shots in the 
first period. they then showed everybody why they will be playing sunday 
when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods .  . maybe tommy told them that 
he was getting bored back there .  .  .  . 

mark opened the so fast that if you you missed it. after 
buffalo won the and , tommy wrapped the around the 
to eric 1 2 way up on his left. eric dropped it to , and he sent it ahead 
to out of the  . mark into the center circle , passed 
the to himself through the legs of richard , around him and 
in on  . was at him all the way through the with his 
stick , right , back left , and the back to the 
right past for a 1 0 flyers lead at 0 18 .  . it was so beautiful eric and 
should turn down their ) .  . 

the flyers kept the pressure on for a while after that , but he was strong 
and kept the flyers from doing further damage. the game then became a 
struggle for a while. the got the first chance on the power play when 
took a minor at 10 26 for into 
the in the flyers  . got the only chance , and not 
a terribly good one , as the flyers the power play .  . got 
a post after it was over. the penalty kill for the flyers .  . 

keith took a holding penalty at 13 31 for taking down mark to 
give the flyers a power play .  . the best penalty killing team in the league 
did n't allow the flyers a shot on goal , although the flyers did create a 
good chance for who on his shot .  . towards 
the end of the period the play started going end to end , but everybody kept 
missing the net. greg took an interference penalty at 18 19 to give 
the another power play , but they could n't get anything going and the 
expressed their , particularly when they the  . shots 
were 8 6 buffalo after the flyers had led 6 2 at one point. 

mike flyers president between periods .  . was 
to not make the , but not discouraged .  . this was considered 
a year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the 
went .  . when asked if he over the trade he said that it was 
's trade and not his , that it only was an issue for him and ed 
as far as the money. but yes , there was some , and they 'd do 
it all over again. when asked how the situation would be for 
next year he said that it 's  call , and will things at the 
end of the  . he that they 're 3 years away from a shot at the cup .  . 
he expects to get into the next year , have a shot at a division title 
the following year , and a shot at the finals the year after that. this based 
on the current level of play and over the summer .  . 

he 's very happy with the re  ( he called it outstanding ) .  . happy with 
the current , that the talent pool is big enough with the 
of , but that they must make sure existing are stable .  . 
seemed to like the idea of playing in the  ( booo ) but said that there 
was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in 
four years if there was a consensus .  . 

the gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may 
took a tripping penalty at 0 51 of the second .  . the flyers had a little trouble 
getting started , but eventually did. took a pass as he was moving 
the neutral and handed the to just outside the 
blue line along the right  . carried into the passed 
across to who tried a one from between the blue line and the 
top of the left circle .  . he half on it , and sent the 
through the  . did n't know where it was , though , and won the 
race to it and it into essentially an open net at 2 15 .  . 

then on a  . he slipped through two flyers at the blue line 
and went in on  . he went with the , but was 
all over it. 

the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them. 
took a double minor for and high when 
got under his and one minor , then according to 
took a to get the other  ( there was no video ) at 4 22 .  . the n't 
get started .  . ryan at the just after a carried into the 
flyers , and after a bunch of people at it with it and 
headed the other way. it started out a 1 on 1 , but ahead to 
make it a 2 on 1 and back off the  . let it from the top 
of the right circle to make it 3 0 flyers at 5 40 .  . that was all for , john 
sent in to take over. 

but the still had lots of power play time. again they took some time to 
just get into the flyers , and when they finally did the flyers were all 
over them. began to through the building .  . but they finally got through 
on an goal. took a shot from the top of the that 
missed and kicked out to in the  . tried a as 
he towards the goal line to the right as down to block it. 
mistake 1 , he should have let handle the and worried 
about a ) the or b ) who was behind the goal line right 
next to the net. well , the dropped right next to , and 
mistake 2 , just laid there and watched get three at the 
before he finally pushed it through the  . he did n't even swing his 
stick out to try and knock the away. with the goal , at 7 48 , two 
end for the flyers .  . 150 28 of , and 27 straight penalty kills .  . 

put them right back on the power play at 8 36 with a high 
minor , i think it was again. this time the were able to get 
set up quickly , but could n't get too much quality on goal. the continued 
to keep the in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended .  . 
things down , but then the other very bad penalty .  . 
allowed to get under his and his stick just before a 
 . the were dropped , and started the crap out of 
him. but during the fight , he gave a head butt with his , and 
that meant a match penalty .  . 2 for , 5 fighting and 5 for the major , 
7 of power play time for the at 14 15 , only got 5. 

the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while , but there was only so long 
they could do that. after a couple of good chances , handed to 
at the point , and sent a drive that was knocked down by 
 . at the from the left side of 
the net , and knocked it over to wood at the right. had 
moved over to play , and since and were waving 
at the instead of picking up men , wood just it into the empty net 
at 17 34 to close the flyers lead to 3 2. was actually trying to 
put it on net , but half on it and got a break .  . 

the flyers then got some pressure in the , but 
was strong .  . finally it was keith passing ahead to into the 
neutral , and sent a good pass to at the flyers 
blue line. another for , he elected to shoot from the 
left circle , and he the to get it just inside the far post at 
18 56 for his of the  . , the youth between 
the 1st and second period was tommy talking about cutting off 
 .  .  . 

that was all in the 2nd , shots were 19 7  . 

into the 3rd period , and blew a golden opportunity to get the 
flyers the lead back .  . a 2 on 1 , with the , he dropped to in 
the , and held the as he through the left circle until 
he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. when he finally did shoot , he 
hit the far post. that was still during the power play time. 

than an incredible almost goal. wood around and 
into  . goes down , wood the under 
, and a black object the back of the net. red light comes on , 
sounds , cheers .  . but up to the video , for some strange 
reason , and in the meantime and try to figure out what they 
could be  . well , it turns out that it was the taped up stick 
that went into the net , not the  . mentions that one of the 
for a goal is that the must go into the net .  .  .  . 

dave then took out and got a holding minor at 2 35 .  . the flyers 
could not get anything going at all. they finally got set up 1 2 way through , 
but were kept on the  . as time out , the 
from a in the offensive along the right and passed it across 
to at the top of the left circle .  . saw heading at the net 
just inside the right circle and passed through to him. the pass , 
but twice directed it at , and in and the 
over the for his at 4 42 .  . 4 3 flyers .  . 

but the came right back .  . picked up the in his offensive 
left corner and it to bob behind the flyers net. started to 
out , but then just dropped the back to nobody behind the net. flew 
in , around , and it through 's 5 hole for his at 
5 24 to tie the game at 4. 

then took a penalty at 5 55 .  . the flyers set up 
in the , and stayed there. off a high in the in 
the middle .  . while for the , through the 
line and a perfect shot low to 's side at 6 44 .  . 

play started to go back and forth until took a penalty at 8 19 .  . 
the flyers the into the  . and went 
after it , and got the  . he backed away from the right , 
to the right , and passed between his legs to 
through the all by himself. waited and lifted it over 
the of for a 6 4 flyers lead at 8 39 .  . 3rd hat trick of the 
for , 7th of his career , 2nd goal of the game for him 
of the  . 

then took a tripping penalty at 9 02 to kill the rest of the 
power play .  . not much action on the 4 on 4 , and the got most of the 
chances on the flyers resulting power play .  . 

play went end to end for quite a while after that and both had to 
make some big saves .  . the were n't able to pull as time was running 
out as the flyers would n't allow any for the  . 
finally as time was running out ken the in his own left 
corner and it away from him. he away and found 
on the other side of the left circle , and found at the 
right of  . he the between two , and 
it back to the far side of for his of the at 19 48 
on his birthday .  . that was all the , shots were 18 13 buffalo , 
and the ice was with plastic drinking handed out before the 
game. 

so another strong game from tommy who had n't been tested much 
in his last couple of starts .  . kevin has a career high 6 point night 
 ( unless he had a better night earlier in the , but i do n't think  . 
the flyers longest in 3 years , 30 goals for only 11 against 
with three  . eric is in league with 33 even strength goals 
despite missing 23 games with injury .  . 4 points out of 4th , place 
since the lose the tie  . 

a couple misc notes 

forget the mike , there will be a press conference to 
announce that he will be head of the new york next year .  . 

in the last notes i mentioned that won the award , 
but i failed to mention that the award is for the best  . 

the times of has reported that a from 
has looked over tommy 's medical record and determined that no 
further are necessary in the near future. 

same paper had a blurb about bill being asked about whether or not he 
expected to be back next year .  . his response was that he wants to come back , 
he he did a good job this year , but that he would accept a 
role scouting if did n't want him back .  .

2 rob 4th 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade c c 

gave the every bit he 's got this year unfortunately , this still 
was n't enough to make him any more than a marginal , if that. he works 
hard , for sure , but is no better than average on defense , and is prone to 
penalties and at times , while being basically an 
offensive zero  ( 0 goal and 7 in  . he would be 
to make the team next year .  . 

3 david 2nd 
acquired  91 , free from new jersey 
grade c c 

imo , was the most valuable for the in  91 , 
playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 in 56 games ) and 
good defense .  . but he , playing the first part of this in kansas city , 
was good neither nor this year it , then , appears that 
 91 was a fluke .  . although he improved towards the end of the , he 
was prone to being out of position , and did not demonstrate the 
that made him the team 's among last 
year .  . he would also be to make the team next year .  . 

4 more 2nd 
acquired  91 , from montreal in draft 
grade b 

after being as the team 's top in training camp 
before  91 , more had a rather  91 , as he was not 
particularly good , and had just 17 points in 46 games. he , then , 
proceeded to improve his game this , becoming the team 's most 
reliable , whom the team can count on night in and night out to play 
defense and providing occasional  ( but only occasional ) offensive  . 
, he was even more than last year  ( 11 points in 73 
games ) , but his defense improved  . he is probably best as the 
part of a defense combination with an offensive  . 

5 neil 4th 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade b 

was probably the team 's top in  91  . however , 
because of , he was not the same this year , as he missed 25 
games total due to knee and back , and seemed to be 
even when playing .  . he , then , had often to be saved by his partners 
that is , if they are there at all. but he also had some solid games , and if 
he can be complete healthy , he can still be a force. 

6 1st 
acquired  91 , 2nd round pick in entry draft 
grade i  ( a ) 

at the time of his injury  ( december 30 , against the philadelphia flyers ) , 
was well on track to be , imo , the team 's  . a serious knee injury 
in that game , though , forced him to miss the rest of the  ( 47 games ) , 
but he still finished as the team 's top among  ( 23 points ) , 
which , of course , tells more about the lack of offense the had from 
their , but it also tells of 's abilities .  . at the time , he 
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still 
susceptible to so called mistakes , but was probably the who 
made the least of them on the team , or  . if he can come back 
from his , he is ready to be a star .  . 

19 doug 1st 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade b 

had basically a solid and year , being one of the only two 
to play in all games of the  . he was solid on defense , but 
after being as an offensive , he did n't show it  ( 15  . 
he was also prone to penalties , and his penalty was second on the 
team however , that was also an indication that he was when facing tough 
physical opponents , and he was at his best when playing physically .  . but to 
become a in this league , he needs to improve both and 
, and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents .  .

well , the patrick division got a little more interesting last night. 
the lost in ot and the the  . that means if the isles 
the on friday , the will meet the caps in the  . 

however , i have some more comments on the and in 
general that i need to get off my ) .  . first of all , with the 
back to back against the , one may think that 
the are out of shape .  . these guys always wind in the 2nd period , 
come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon. it is 
how many one goal games these guys have lost. anyway , the games was pretty 
wide open. the isles still have tons of trouble  . the played 
a in is 1st start , i think his name was (sp ) .  .  ( his 
was the tuesday tie against the  . like i mentioned before , this 
guy looked like the best on the planet for a while  ( until he a 
shot to go to  . i say it 's because the isles do n't shoot 
correctly. has anyone else noticed this 

also , i think it is really a for when i guy like 
gets as much ice time as he does. this guy has about as much 
talent as  ( who did play , i think) .  . anytime he gets the 
it gets stolen , and he always starts and gets penalties .  . 
richard is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap. and he 's a 
 . he 's got to be negative infinity for his plus  . 
this guy gets all the time. why the need for such not 
only do slow the game down alot , but it takes away from the guys who are 
really trying to play the game. i 'll be one of the few to admit , i do enjoy a 
good fight once in a while , but only when it 's called for . you know , when a 
guy the too hard. in other words , a violation of ethics 
might cause you to get  . but there is no need to start crap when you are 
or becuase you can get away with it ! ! does anyone agree that 
need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and ot i mean come on already. 
i'm sick of seeing teams guys down , holding guys etc. just becuase the 
does n't call it. ot and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy , 
not physical  . trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost .  . 
if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to 
pull a guy down to prevent it , you do n't to win in the first place. 

just my honest opinion ,

us who have newspapers with 
unsympathetic to pools , often do n't get 
from west coast games since they 
finish too late at night for the morning edition .  . 

i  ( and i'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate 
it if of west coast games 
could be posted to this group right away. 
basically , all we need are goal and , 
do n't bother with times , penalties , shots etc .  .  .  . 

this would make a lot of pool people very 
happy. 

i guess with the out now , the 
local papers have lost interest .  . ) 

thanks.

i think that you are incorrect , roger .  . patrick , 
and adams all played or in the league before becoming 
front office types .  . hence , they did help build the league , although 
they were not great themselves. 

's contributions as a and were far greater than 
those of the above combined .  . should we name a division or after 
him owner vs. contributions deleted .  .  .  . 
are we going to honour those who contributed to the league 's evolution 
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the 
itself 

stuff deleted .  .  .  . 

the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and 
that is it is the that are what make the game great and not the 
people who put them on the ice 

as i recall , the author of the original article that started the thread 
claimed that he the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. 
roger , on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his 
was a rant , but you also supported the name changing on the 
grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals 
they represent .  . , i do not think the flaming was , nor do i 
think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all. just an 
observation .  .  .  . 

however , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of 
changing the names based on the reasons given for it  ( making it easier for 
the  casual fan' ) , or whether you like the idea of unique names 
based on individuals who do the honour .  . imo , the latter is a nice 
and unique touch that differs from other sports .  . in addition , i do not 
think that changing names will have an effect on the number of 
people that are interested in , so it 's a pointless exercise anyway. 

if the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not 
central to the original article. something to consider is 
whether or not like who  contributed to the glory of the  
would have been able to do so without an organized league to 
play in. in this case , of the league as opposed to 
of the becomes a and egg type question.  ( although 
it was the  .  .  .  . ) . 

exactly true. divisions and after and the bunch 
is the same kind of that put stein in the hall of fame .  . i have 
always thought that this was nonsense. 

if the stein comparison is , since it does n't look as though 
his  acceptance  to the hall will hold up.

opened the as made a drop pass at the finnish 
blue line , picked it up and advanced towards the finnish goal and 
shot a nice hard shot in 's top corner .  . 's 
shot from the blue line on power play made it 1 1 , and 
a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal 
put the high over , 1 2 after the first period. 
the started the second period with really good pressure .  . 
made it 1 3 with another goal from close range high over  . then , 
during the finnish pressure , turned the game around in 1 47 .  . 
worked hard behind the finnish goal , and passed the to 
jan in front , who the low , 2 3. entered 
the finnish and passed to , and the finnish defense let 
in and take a shot that dropped into the goal , 3 3. 
next , roger behind the goal sent the back to the blue line 
where roger took a shot and did n't see the since 
there was traffic in front , 4 3. 
third period started with a nice goal by the  . 
and entered the finnish , passed the back to 
who alone with made no mistake , 5 3. 
then , show started .  . he reduce and the lead in only 
21 seconds ! first he the 5 4 goal , and after that he came in alone 
with but was by to get a penalty shot .  . 
made a nice penalty shot , showed and put in with a low shot .  . 
the seemed to head for a win when the 6 5 goal 
late in the game on a nice power play combination. waited in the , 
showed that he wanted the on the side , passed the 
and took a shot low in 's goal 's far side. 
but had other plans as he only 28 seconds later the 
game 's final goal to make it 6 6. took a shot from a narrow 
angle that maybe should have saved .  . 

all in all , a decent game where the defense was n't the best. 
both teams around the lines a bit in the second and third period 
to try no combinations .  . 

and plays well together in the team .  . 
best line overall again , it seems to be a working line. 
good on defense .  . 
some are n't good enough for the though.  ( faell

two goal and played well in the

's decision to stick in the stands rather than in the

the  . 

i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year , the most 
fun time of the year , and i'm not , said with some monday .  . i 
think i have worked hard enough for that. 

said he accepts 's choice of kelly as the teams top 
in their series with the flames .  . made 21 saves in sundays 
6 3 victory .  . 

but clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no. 3 man behind 
 . had a 4 1 2 record and 2 . goals against average down the 
stretch in the regular and nearly the no. 1 job from  . 

he won 2 of 3 decisions but had a 5 . 26 . average , twice was 
from games  ( once for stomach cramps ) and has n't played since march 29 .  . 

yet , when the series , will serve as 's 
again and will have to his by on 
popcorn .  . 

if i'm supposedly close to being the or could have been the  .  . i . 
dropped too. 3. what happened to no. 2 wondered .  . not that i 'd be 
happy with no. 2 , but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the 
 . 

perhaps eventually will get his chance , but apparently is not 
convinced the 25 year old is capable of handling pressure .  . 

while he is the kings  of the future , said 
all four of the big games he was asked to win this  . they were , 
according to a 7 2 loss to san jose on dec .  . 26 an 8 3 loss to the new 
york on jan .  . 23 a 6 6 tie with on feb .  . 11 an 8 6 loss to 
vancouver on thursday .  . 

four times this could have as the , he could 
have taken it away from kelly , and he did n't do it , said. an 
has to carry the ball when you give it to him. the mark of a 
great is that he is n't satisfied to be a  . 

i'm not blaming for the losses , but if you 're going to be no. 1 , you 've 
got to be able to walk your talk .  . you 've got to be able to play when everything 
is on the line. has a great deal of ability , but maybe i expect 
more from him than he does. 

 . that remark  . he began the 9 0 1 , when the 
team hit a mid , did n't play for a month after was signed 
off the san diego , then came on at the end. 

i expect more from myself than anybody , including , said , 
a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in 1989 , only 
to have his development by a string of serious  . 

what i 've been through the last four years two knee , a 
in my back , shoulder what more can i go through i obviously do 
expect a lot from myself , otherwise i would n't be here. 

anybody who would disagree with that does n't know me. i'm not saying 
does n't know me , but do n't say i 've been without expectations .  . if anything , i'm 
a  . 

acknowledged he played poorly in the four games mentioned. but 
even though i did n't play well , i get knocked down from maybe on to three it 's 
a bit of a jump , he said. you 're almost no. 1 , or if you play a good game 
you 're no. 1 and if you do n't you 're no. 3 why does jack shoot a 67 
and then a 75 can you explain that that 's what wanted me to explain 
to him , why i did n't come through when he counted on me. i do n't know. what i

charging 45 to cover the and  . 

i 've sold one , but i still have 2 left for sale .  . i also realize that 45 is 
alot of money , especially if you do n't normally cards. so if enough 
people are interested , i 'll break up the set into team sets .  . i'm not sure 
how much for each .  . it would be nice to just sell them for 3 each , but then 
the people who get the and  ( note , i'm not on these teams 
its just that they do n't have alot of good cards in this set ) would 
be the people who want chicago or pittsburgh .  . so i 'll have to make 
it  . but most of them should be about 2 or 3 dollars .  .

well , the rules , anyway. and , of course , since the is 
not entirely over , entry form. but who cares the real 
is starting ! ! ! ! ! 

here 's the deal you email  ( preferably ) or post your predictions , and the 
number of games you think each series will go. each round will be 
, so that the cup finals will be very important , but the 
early will still be important. here is the 

pick 1st round winner , way off on games 2 points 
pick 1st round winner , within one game 3 points 
pick 1st round winner , pick of games 5 points 

pick 2nd round winner , way off on games 3 points 
pick 2nd round winner , within one game 4 points 
pick 2nd round winner , pick of games 6 points 

pick conference , way off on games 5 points 
pick conference , within one game 6 points 
pick conference , pick of games 9 points 

pick cup , way off on games 8 points 
pick cup , within one game 10 points 
pick cup , pick of games 14 points 
pick in 7 , series goes 7 2 points 
pick in 7 , series decided in game 7 , ot 4 points 
 ( these last two are sympathy points , probably wo n't happen anyway ) 

obviously , picking the cup is important. i will do some 
to see if the format is fair , but probably i will be too lazy to 
it , so the will probably be like this. as for entry forms , 
well , this post is getting too long , so see next post.

acquired  93 , trade with pittsburgh for future 
grade i  ( b ) 

it is way too early to tell about , who was acquired probably because the 
that they would lose him in the draft .  . had 
only played 50 games this (i think it 's actually less the san jose 
news may be in err here ) , 20 of them with the  . in the games he 
has played , he appeared quite solid , although he has n't been

it 's even possible that the trade may be for future which turn 
out to be ... peter  .

acquired  91 , trade with chicago for and 
2nd round pick in  entry draft 
grade i  ( b ) 

i have often been accused of overly down on i may have had too high 
expectations for him , but his legs , , et al. , are giving out. 
nevertheless , when he was playing , he a strong shooting and 
abilities , even if he has lost a step on defense , which , 
unfortunately , he demonstrated this year as well , as at times he was slow to 
the opponent , and his offensive output was only good enough for 
2nd place on the team  ( 20 points in 42  . but next year , which may be 
's last , if he can stay healthy , he can still be a  . 

29 dean 2nd 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade i (c d ) 

it 's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge on just a of 
games  ( forgetting exact number , but no more than 15 ) , but at age 25 he 's 
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the  . in those games , 
he did not impress anyone after 7 shots in the first period of 
the first game he played , he just 2 points in his up here with 
the , and was even less impressive , as he appeared 
with his movement and was prone to  . he needs to make a leap in 
his level of to have any chance of making the team .  . 

38 2nd 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade i ( ) 

was on the a lot longer than , but it appears to my 
memory that he played less than , because the were reluctant to 
use him , but were even more reluctant to send him to the , that 
he would n't clear in fact , he has played the past 4 5 weeks with 
kansas city , but is still technically there on a rehabilitation , 
a that will include him playing in the turner cup  . 
since he has played so little , i ca n't even give a grade on him , but 
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive but terrible 
skills. 

41 tom 1st 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade i  ( b ) 

called up in the middle of the when the corps was 
by , impressed many fan here on net , including yours 
truly .  . he demonstrated very good offensive , 20 points in 
43 games. however , his size  ( 5' 9 , ) . is of concern , and soon after 
he began to offensive did teams begin to push him around physically , 
on both sides of the ice , although he had appeared in his approach. 
but to be successful , he probably needs to up to have a fighting chance 
on surviving against some of the bigger in the league .  . 

45 1st 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade i  ( d d ) 

he played all of 5 games in the league this year , but was thoroughly 
, just as he was at the end of last again , it may be a 
small , but just as in the case of , , at age 25 , is 
quickly running out of time. he was not a on either offense or 
defense in the games he played with the  . the only thing that 
will go down in 's entry of league is probably the fact that he 
was once for now capitals  .

no fan watching the , including me , knows where was at 
the end of the the appeared to still have his rights , but he 
was n't in san jose , he was n't in kansas city , and his name has n't appeared on 
the wire .  . and that kind of was for the most part 
for  . after being called up october 30 against the bay , 
had an excellent week , 5 points in 3 games while playing good 
defense .  . unfortunately , the 27 year old then disappeared the rest of 
the way , getting just 3 more points in 15 more games , and generally looked 
and on both ends of the ice .  . he then was sent down to 
kansas city , walked out from there , and was and later 
when it was revealed that he was injured he then disappeared from 
the watching eyes of  ( as the mailing list is now known to 
officials ) faithful , and neither the nor we miss him.

acquired  91 , trade with for d bob and round 
pick in  entry draft from vancouver 
grade a a 

after an early , was nothing short of the rest 
of the way , with 66 points in games , second highest total on the 
team , as he well with team kelly and right rob 
 . got most of the credit , but , second in 
the voting , clearly demonstrated his and , as he 
was seen making excellent passes as well as passes to him 
by putting the past , getting a club high 14 power 
play goals. contrary to his previous , also showed that despite 
his small size  ( 5' 11 , ) . , he was willing to himself around 
when necessary , not very successful yet. he also still needs to work 
on his defense , although he improved throughout the , and 
was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the  . he will 
be a major key to the offense next year .  . 

15 david bruce 
acquired  91 , from st. in draft 
grade i ( ) 

after a banner  91 , when he led the team in power play goals  ( 10 ) and 
was third in total  ( 38 points in 60 games ) , bruce was bothered 
virtually all of this with a injury , which kept him out of the 
for all by 17 games this  . of course , it is difficult to 
speculate how well he would have done this had he not been affected by 
the injury , but the 28 year old bruce was effective with a man up or a man 
short in the  first , and was expected to be a strong offensive 
leader this as well. the injury appears serious , which is a , 
because otherwise he may have a much future for now instead , his 
future with the next appears  . 

18 mark 3rd 
acquired  93 , trade with philadelphia for c dave 
grade i  ( b ) 

it is difficult for me to understand the flyers  decision to , 
after a very good offensive last  ( 40 points in games ) , but 
after riding the early in the , was sent to the 
in exchange of the minded , and he finished with 
41 games combined with the flyers and the  . he was also limited by 
this , and this limited his  ( 17  . but when 
healthy , appears impressive , with a good touch , good size 
 ( and the to it around , although he 's not considered a 
physical forward ) , and good speed .  . he also does not appear to be a 
on defense , but the probably have to wait until next to see how 
much , exactly , can do. 

20 john 4th 
acquired  91 , free from boston 
grade i  ( b b ) 

was definitely one of the workers on the team , and the hard 
work worked wonders , as at times he looked great on ice .  . however , although he 
did look great at times , the fact that he received just 16 points  ( in 55 
games ) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can 
do , and the confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about 
20 games left in the  . , who will turn 30 on may 6 , always 
, but as a result , was sometimes too deep within the offensive 
while , but he was generally a credit on the end , 
but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity , and he did not impress 
, although he was one of the best at drawing penalties .  . he 
is very unlikely to be back next  . 

28 jean 1st 
acquired  91 , from minnesota in draft 
grade i  ( b b ) 

i do n't understand why the did n't let play any more than the 
14 games he played this  . he was generally hard working and creating 
opportunities , and appeared , at age 23 , ready for regular 
duty , at least for a team like the , with 7 points in those 
14 games while not being a  . shoulder injury in training 
camp before the  91 limited , the team 's in 
games despite sitting out the final two , to just 29 games with the 
and the that , but he looked impressive. he should be a 
solid for regular duty next  .

acquired 2nd round pick in 1991 draft 
grade i ( ) 

after a all star at kansas city , got a cup of with the 
late in the when the knocked down a and the 
with , playing 5 games and a goal for his only 
point thus far. despite small size  ( 5' 9 , ) . , was not 
to himself around when necessary , and looked pretty good at times , 
although it 's too early to judge him based on 5 games , in which he played 
mostly left , away from his center position at northern michigan and 
kansas city.

grade i ( ) 

like , also played away from his normal position when he was 
up for his cup of tea  ( 7 games ) through the  . he was generally 
very much of a , and did not show much either , 
although that may be more of the lack of ice time he got in those 
7 games. he may need another to work on his defense , but once his 
defense is acceptable , he should be ready. 

44 1st 
acquired  93 , trade with for

the 23 year old , although he up the , seems to 
be close to being out of chances , for some reason , after being acquired by the 
but failing to impress the in 25 games , 4 goals for 
his only points , and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city. 
he was not particularly strong , and despite his offensive 
in the , he has failed thus far to score in the , although 
he has been given limited opportunities .  . he may be the  in the 
draft .  .

acquired 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft 
grade i  ( d d , although perhaps i should n't give a grade at all ) 

i have been accused of knocking on wood too much. ) then , it is probably 
no surprise to you that i am thoroughly by wood thus far , although 
13 games is a small example. he was generally a on offense , was 
not particularly good , and took too many silly penalties , 
many in the process and penalty in those 13 games , 
to to  ( 446 ! ) in an game  . he 's not ready , and needs at

nothing else. his relatively small size  ( 5' 11 , ) . does not give much

in other tv news , the yesterday that they will have 3

this is incorrect .  . this year the had 61 games on free tv and 6 
games on  . next year they will have 62 games on free tv and 22 on 
a basis. 

you actually get 1 more free game than last year , and there will be no 
more radio only games. 

yes , you 're right. after going home and reading the paper , i got the

francis i remember  ( who really plays tough , an

francis has , passing , face , and putting 
100 into every game , every night. just wanted to a 
little. 

i know what you mean ! i 's out on the ice .  . 
in fact , one of the things about seeing the in person 
is that i can key in on him instead of watching what i 'd probably 
be seeing on tv. he does so many subtle things behind the play .  . 

he said in an recently that when he was a kid his 
stressed the importance of playing two way that you have to 
learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took 
that advice to heart .  . he was a of air when he arrived 
in pittsburgh to the team whose , for the most part , could n't 
and would n't play a of defense .  . 

it 's really difficult to assess what the key were that brought 
all of this success to the  . you mention and he has 
certainly helped , and even ol' has been  . but looking at 
this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line up 
and replace them with an extremely and it 
would n't matter. 

if i had to pick the top three in recent years they would 
be 1 ) tom 2 ) ron francis 3) larry  . (i 'd love to put 
francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage

is a very team .  . there 's a lot of 
in which would make the game fast , so would have 
to slow the game down , which means drawing penalties , as a last 
resort anyway. will be a good team as soon as they get 
more good  . is just an average team , is n't 
when he was owner. everyone knows that. 
and it 's going to take time for to become a real force. 
i expect to be out next year .  . he ca n't pull the 
whole team forever.

does anyone email from roger whenever they post an 
article telling them to leave him and stop posting to the group 
these are filled with insults more than are usual in roger 's posts 
and have little if any info .  .

i am just wondering if i am special or roger to everyone who 
disagrees with him.

plus ... it is the most stat available. 

not necessarily the most , but you are right , it definitely 
needs to be taken in the proper perspective. a shining example is 
if you look at the individual , you will find very few  . 
that only makes common sense , since they did n't lose many games. 

until the a more useful statistic including ice 
time per game and some measure of its quality (i . e .  . , is the put out 
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he up 
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc ) , i would 
much rather see the disappear instead of having its dubious 
merits by those with little understanding of its implications .  . 

unfortunately , you will need to keep a ridiculous number of to 
really come up with a statistic which really shows a 's value. 
let 's just enjoy the game and not it.  ( like i'm doing now , 
excuse me ! )

i do n't see why more people do n't blame grant for the goal that smith 
put in his own net , it 's common to play the back to your own when 
deep in your own end and under little or no pressure from the offensive team .  . 
if had been in position the would have never crossed the line.

i have to disagree with you on this one. it is anything but common .  . in the 
4 or 5 years i have been watching i have never seen this happen ever.

the candidate main purpose on a shift is to

they are not  .

i watched him over his entire career. i have never seen a

up as many as bob  . and i will never 
forget the time caught with his head down. 
you have been sold a bill of on bob  . 

it was bryan , not  . it was a

i would take and off of the latter .  . 

i think would be to know that you 've included him 
on this list. i also think you have a relatively naive view 
about what a game .  .  . are an integral part of 
any team .  . the is designed to acknowledge their

if was taken completely by surprise , as was , then 
yeah , i would have to say that doug was n't playing 
technically smart  . in any case , to claim as greg did , 
that never made a technical mistake is absolutely 
ludicrous .  . 

later on , in your posting , you make reference to putting words 
into other people 's mouths  .  .  . i . would suggest that your last 
paragraph can only be interpreted in one way .  .  . namely . , that i , 
along with greg , claim that never made a technical 
mistake. if you actually read what i 've written , you will find 
that i make no such claim .  .  . , if logic serves me well , 
you 're contradicting yourself. 

nonsense. i quite clearly state that it was greg that made the claim 
that never made an error. and he made the claim .  . read below.

is the best forward ever. i stand by that  . 
he was a very good who belongs in the hall of fame .  . did you 
ever watch him play he never made a technical error. 

more nonsense deleted 

good for you. you 'd only be your ignorance of 
course , but to each his own .  .  .  . 

roger , i'm not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a 
function of a lack of knowledge and not an 
opinion  .  .  . but . hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by all 
means go ahead .  .  . that . 's if it makes you feel better. 

to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious. your 
education is not my responsibility .  . 

my word , such against poor ol' bob  . why does 
he bother you so much .  .  . he . was an effective for his style 
of play .  . 

he was just another  . to him as anything more i find 
 . i the  . i until i realized 
that he was likely the most to ever 
in my lifetime. why would anyone talk about 

go around. who would you rather have as your checking 
centre doug or doug for that matter i would 
take either or as my checking  . do you 
think could cover bob 

i'm really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here. 
why do n't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ , 
himself , in 

did he play at a high level was he any good if not , why 
would you bother to bring jc up i am talking about 
here. if you ca n't follow the conversation do n't follow up. as i 
said previously , it is not my responsibility to you. 

now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob with guy 
, you would have a balanced comparison .  . 

sure. two  . big deal. neither one of them is worth 
discussing .  . 

i'm wrong again .  .  . hmmm . , let 's see .  .  . where . was i wrong in the 

i would take and off of the latter .  . 

first place i'm only here , , but i have a feeling 
that you 've setup a you 're wrong again macro key on your 
machine .  . 

that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time 
responding to any of your , or greg 's , postings then i will be sure 
to implement that very macro .  . 

i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out 
of things to say about the stars on they start to 
the  . grant , , , bob 
, bob , doug , , wayne , 
bob , bob , ralph , richard , dick 
 .  . and . so on .  .  .  . demonstrates a blanket disregard for these 
individuals as contributors to the game .  .  . so . yes , 
down .  .  . nobody . has claimed that they are gods .  . 

claimed that was a god. and greg it up. 
and that is what this thread is all about. if you did n't know 
that then why are you responding 

and as for blanket disregard for these individuals , i can remember 
teams , purely populated by such individuals , four 
cups .  . teams .  . no one around telling us that george 
was the best in the world. 

, as always , 




james david 


you might consider developing your own style .  . after all , 
is the form of and i am quite sure 
that is not your intention .  . 

 .  . it . has a nice to it .  .  . and . admit it , you had a good 
laugh. 

right. i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were 
a complete joke. 

in the future , if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate 
it if you could present a argument supported by facts gleaned from a 
version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize .  . 

, as always ,

of course , penalties will have to be changed 

males being aggressive 
males 
fighting proof that males cannot with their feelings 


no no no ! since all the penalties fall into three classes , there should 
only be three penalties 

1. foul  ( any illegal contact with the other or his stick with your 
body or  . if you get 5 you are out for the game. 

2. contact .  .  ( an intentional  . this all the 
current flavours of , fighting and  . if you get two you 
are thrown out of the game , and fined .  . 

3. technical foul .  . bad the , by or  . penalty shot 
is awarded .  . two and you are thrown out of the game. 

besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties 
in a period , the team gets a penalty shot for every additional one , 
until the end of the period. the victim gets two shots if he she was in 
the act of shooting when the foul  . 

this works well for several reasons. first , penalty shots are the most 
thing in , right so , it follows that the more the better. 
next , when the is setting up for a penalty shot , the network can 
take a  . finally , with only three penalties , the network 
 ( don , dick , john , , and 
, among others ) will be able to tell the what happened before 
the pa says it. 

oh , one other rule. when a goal is  ( 10 20 times a period ) , the play 
cannot until the pa announces it. this way , the network 
can in a few more  . then , once the pa has told 
them who , the tv can tell you the , and even have a 
chance of his name right. 

seriously , though , i actually went to see a game last week , 
for the first time in my life. i was amazed how it was. the play is 
so slow they actually had come out for things like free shooting 
during the period ! . of course the  girls  get to do their 
routines at least 6 8 times during the game , and not just between periods 
either. there is a every 30 seconds on average , maybe less. the 
game is 48 , with 2 between 1 2 and 3 4 and a 
10 minute , and it still takes over 2 hours. 

the reason for this has to be tv. there is plenty of room to in 
, and have the while nothing else is happening. 
on tv , is fairly entertaining , imho .  . but , it is better to watch 
it on tv than to be there. if this is the road the is following , then 
it truly is a sad day. 

enough for now.

it up with you .  .  .  .  . 

nice try , but tough squad should have you in to the 
fact that my was tongue in  . 

if is any more intense than the regular variety then 
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 times

with the recent the key are actually

the second , is after all , merely an  . the true 
of the league are the division , the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the  . the cup merely 
victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot . the 
emphasis on the , with their sudden death appeal has been 
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind. even if pittsburgh

the had just the news from red wings 5 , stars 3. 
with the north stars  loss , the fourth place and the 
final in the division .  . good thing , because the quit 
playing .  . 

they held a 5 1 lead over bay when the minnesota final appeared 
with 3 52 remaining in the second period. they went to sleep 
and barely held on for a 6 5 victory that nearly slipped away at the  . 
's bob in a pass from , but 
john d and video goal judge rich ruled that the 
shot had gone into the net after time had  . 

m glad i did n't see it go in at the end , bob said. 

if the goal had counted , he 'd have been more upset than he was by the  
disappearance in the final 24 minutes. holding on for the victory and making 
the 's  . 

was n't pretty at the end , he said. played 36 , 37 great , as 
good as we played all year .  . it slipped away at the end. it should n't have , but 
it did. 

still , the won , another from the at game 's end. 
despite their effort in the third period and all the this 
, the still made the  . they 'll meet the chicago 
in a best of seven division , beginning at noon sunday at 
chicago  . 

the finished the regular with a record of 37 36 11 for 85 points , 
their fourth plus  .  . minnesota finished three points 
behind in place , with a record of 36 38 10 for points. bay , 
which played last week by the 2 2 at , ended its 
first with a record of 23 54 7 for 53 points. 

the poor finish cast an unnecessary over what should have been a 
room. instead , the mood was one of relief and some  . 

's a we let down , said kevin miller , one of three to score 
two goals. brendan and bob were the others. 
was no need for a  . if we 'd have kept working , it would have 
ended 6 2 and everyone would be happy. 

instead , a lot of were happy just to make the  . 
won , and that 's all that matters , said brett , and 3 
for the night. we got up 4 0 , it was really tough to play .  . 

some did n't have a problem. 

because the score was , our line did n't quit , said rich

ca n't allow five goals like we did , that 's not right. 

was to see what was going on.

he missed the announcement of minnesota 's loss. 

did n't know it was final , he said. was kind of looking around on the 
 . i did n't realize it was a final for some reason. we 're in the , 
and that 's great , but it 's a little to play like we did at the 
end. 

the was precisely the reason that had instructed the 
operators to keep the minnesota score off of the board. the score 
showed 0 0 until it first up with 4 2 in the third 
period. the already led 4 0 at the time. 

told them i did n't want to see the score , i did n't want to know the score , 
said. felt we had to win the game , and that 's the approach we took .  . 

if minnesota took a lead , , the pressure of having to win might 
bother the  . if led , he worried , the might quit .  . 

until the announcement , the played  . got the 
going at 10 44 of the first period , his of the  . then , 
miller and took charge late in the period. 

with the teams playing four on four , miller broke in on left , 
roman and former with the 
of his own shot with 21 . 6 . seconds remaining in the period. 

then , just 10 . 5 . seconds later , a long shot past 
after a pass in the neutral  . 

made it 4 0 just 14 seconds into the second period , on the 
of 's shot .  . the goal gave him his first two goal game of 
the and reminded him of a special friend. 

last year , young , who died of a rare form 
of at age 6 on feb .  . 23 .  . 

was thinking of my buddy , said. 's in heaven now , and 
i know he was watching .  . i know he 's happy. 

miller increased the lead to 5 0 on a break away goal set up by 
at 11 09 .  . then , steve broke joseph 's just 18 seconds 
later , making it 5 1. 

less than a minute after the north stars  final was , tim 
and cut the lead to 5 2. but his , converting a pass 
from with 21 . 3 . seconds remaining in the second period. 

then , it was all  . adam 40 seconds into the third 
period , to rest the overworked joseph .  . guy allowed goals 
to and in a of 1 21 through the third 
period. 

the goals by and made 's second goal stand up as the 
winner .  . were in there , said. game was over. we were in.

it is a long standing good luck 's tradition to an 
on the ice during a cup game. they say it dates back to  52 
at the when the wings became the 1st team (i think) to 
the cup in 8 games. a lot to one from joe

here 's the point there are far too many in the  . i am sick 
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team  ( let 's say , the 
red wings and the canucks ) and seeing names like and

and are particularly , but the numbers of on other 
teams is getting worse as well. 

gee , you 'd think would be on that list , what with 8 
being european .  . 



i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about , the 
rocket i will completely up. as it is now , every time i see 
the play i keep someone will cross check into the hard they have to carry him out on a  .  ( by the way , i'm not a 
fan to begin with ) .  . 

well , being a fan , i sometimes wish that would get knocked silly 
too.  ( nothing serious , just enough to keep him out of a game. ) 



okay , the remark was a little carried away. but the point is that 
i owners all these instead of  ( and 
some  . it denies young the opportunity to play in their 
north american league and instead gives it to , who are n't even 
better  . it 's all  . this european is , 
but until owners get over it , canadian and american will continue 
to have to fight harder to get into their own league .  . 

in most cases , the owners have very little to do with it. they give their 
general one order when it comes to the draft .  .  . find . me the best 
so that our team will win the cup .  . whether that is 
in , or , russia , if the believes him 
to be the better , the should be him. 

where do you get off calling the their league , when referring to canadian 
 . it does n't belong to them , it belongs to the owners .  . the owners 
can do what they want. while a  canadian content  rule might be enforcable 
here in canada , there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us 
that the  ( sorry for the reference ) did n't even try to push their 
import ratio rule on the  . 

increasing the competition for the   positions , in most cases , would 
make better anyways .  .  ( oh yeah , and how many play at the 
lower levels of in north america while there are some 
that play in the , or the where that 's an team 's primary farm 
club , you do n't hear of many playing in the , the , or on 
the secondary farm teams in the  .  . the do have a few 
in , but i do n't believe there are any in  . wayne .

with the numbers of in the , the problem is clearly 
only getting worse.

bill stopped 36 shots to lead canada to a 4 1 victory in a very well 
played game. 

the first period started with a give away from a canadian and 
came in alone on but could n't put the over a 
 . later on , kevin had a great opportunity but 
played very well too. had a couple of great and set up 
jan but again came up big .  . period ended but the 
to in creating more opportunities .  . 
second period action saw tommy making a great save .  . mark 
made a cross ice pass to , eric one the but 
was there to make a hand save .  . at the 7 minute mark , canada 
started applying pressure on the  . worked 
hard and kept the in the   . gave the to 
who around a , came in on and 
made a shot that went it by 's far post , 1 0 canada .  . 
the picked up their game after that , and peter had a shot 
that hit 's post  ( the inside ) , went parallel to the goal line and out. 
then got a penalty and the a power play .  . jan took 
a shot from the , gave a to who saw by 
the far post , passed the and was , 1 1. 
third period started as the other periods , having most of the pressure 
but the always dangerous once they were close to the goal. 
at 5 54 , canada created some great chances and was forced to 
cover the in the goal since lost sight of it. 
that resulted in a penalty shot , since a ca n't cover the in 
the goal  . geoff took the penalty shot  ( his first ever , he 
explained afterwards ) , and he put it low on 's stick side , close 
to the post. excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal. 
canada increased the lead on a very suspect , a 
past to make it 3 1. the out of gas 
then and could n't produce as good chances as they had for 2 , 5 periods .  . 
the 4 1 goal came with only 1 second left , on a 
from , where the defense already had their minds 
in the room. 

a very good game  ( the best in the so far ) , with both playing 
great .  . best in , but even played better 
than , that tells you something about  . probably the best 
in the world , were some comments after the game. 
canada played a very defense , pointed out that it is 
easy to play well with a good defense .  . played a lot and played well , 
naturally game hero with two goals. 

the line 's best along with 
 . defense played well , peter had the 
task of eric , and managed this very well. 
peter finally got to go to the , and considering 
that he in germany just a few hours before the game , he played very 
well. was after the game , partly because 
of the inability to score , and partly because of the 's mistake 
on the 1 3 goal.

well , since the did n't win a heck of a lot of games , i'm not sure 
they and ( ca n't win without him ) .  . however , i 'd suggest kelly 
instead of dave manson , who has had a brutal year , his pick for 
the all star game  . 

as for biggest surprise , i 'd say that had higher expectations 
this year due to his year  ( for him ) last year , so he did n't 
really raise his game. my suggestion would be , one of the 
from during the year .  . he was quite far down on the 
depth in the stable of , but made a big impact on 
the team .  . he has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only 1. those are decent 
numbers for a third line who was seemingly doomed to minor league

i can live with the other changes that have been made (e . g .  . the format 
change ) , but the change to the division and conference names really me. 
batman was on last night saying that changing the names would make the 
game easier for the occasional fan to follow . he should have said what he 
meant that changing the names will make the game easier for americans in 
non cities to follow. i do n't know of too many of my friends who had 
a hard time following which teams were in each division .  . even a minimal amount 
of exposure to the game allows a person to quickly pick up on this. 

there is nothing wrong with making the game easier for americans to 
follow. the more the and even if you dislike the occasional 
fan there is always the chance that these will become fanatics .  . 

i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason. the names 
patrick , , , adams and campbell are all the names of so called 
of the game. this is the same type of thinking that put stein 
in the hall of fame .  . this is absolute nonsense. the real of the 
game are richard , , , , , etc. if you are going to 
name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people 
who it. 

i think that you are incorrect , roger .  . patrick , 
and adams all played or in the league before becoming 
front office types .  . hence , they did help build the league , although 
they were not great themselves. 

i agree that a name is a name is a name , and if some people 
have trouble with names that are not easily by the , 
then changing them to names that are more easily seems like 
a reasonable idea. if we can get people in the  ( arena ) door by being 
, then let 's do so. once we have them , they will realize 
what a great game is , and we can then teach them something 
the history of the game. 

the history of the names can be put rather  . all of the 
used the game of to make money. can you imagine a 
division a division or how about a green division 

no , i would not want to see a division .  . but to say 
that these owners are , hence all people are 
would be fallacious .  . , for example , was a 
individual  ( from what i have  . 

also , is n't the point of to make money 
for all those involved , which would include the  . what i think 
you might be saying is that the have not made as much money as 
should have been their due , and it is the that are what make 
the game great not the people who put them on the ice , so 
division after people rather than is adding insult 
 ( in the form of lesser recognition ) to injury  ( less money than was

clark was tough enough for the wings tough guys .  . the wings only gave 
up three goals , a low total for what they say is a defense .  . 
all you better speak up now. you team will probable have its

there 's quite a few wings lurking about here , they just tend

however , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of 
changing the names based on the reasons given for it  ( making it easier for 
the  casual fan' ) , or whether you like the idea of unique names 
based on individuals who do the honour .  . imo , the latter is a nice 
and unique touch that differs from other sports .  . in addition , i do not 
think that changing names will have an effect on the number of 
people that are interested in , so it 's a pointless exercise anyway. 

there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the 
 . i feel that geographical names would enhance regional 
more than names  . and of course , they would not appear 
nearly as confusing to one the for the first time. 
another thing that bothers me is the points system. , as used in 
the other major sports are clearly more  . when i look at the 
the first thing i have to do is make a quick to 
account for games in hand  ( which is almost always the  . some will 
object to , claiming perhaps , that it is an 
of the but i feel that using is more and 
whether it is american or not is irrelevant .  . 

if the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not 
central to the original article. something to consider is 
whether or not like who  contributed to the glory of the  
would have been able to do so without an organized league to 
play in. in this case , of the league as opposed to 
of the becomes a and egg type question.  ( although 
it was the  .  .  .  . ) . 

even if could n't have contributed without the likes of , you would 
have to agree that could n't have contributed without the likes of  . 
and taking a of most would quickly tell you who the feel made 
the more meaningful  . 

exactly true. divisions and after and the bunch 
is the same kind of that put stein in the hall of fame .  . i have 
always thought that this was nonsense. 

if the stein comparison is , since it does n't look as though 
his  acceptance  to the hall will hold up. 

it does n't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it 




, as always , 
so many  .  .  .

ten years ago , the number of in the was roughly a

teams have to the following 

400 
americans 100 
100 


here 's the point there are far too many in the  . i am sick 

you know , you 're absolutely right. i think we should round up all those 
of european descent and 'em back to where they came from. let 's 
see , with whom should we start i , hmmm .  .  . sounds . like he 
has french blood in him ! ! ! hey ! france is part of europe ! send that 
boy back ! ! ! 

 . 

i'm all for the creation of a european league , and let the 
and of the world play on their own continent .  . 

i just do n't want them on mine. 

i do n't think it would be hard to find some native americans  ( or native 
, for that matter ) who would dispute your claim to this great 
continent of ours. see , if you believe the , we 're all 
immigrants of some sort .  . if you really do n't think that , ,

i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they 
face them in the finals  ( which is what all the 
are  . although i think bryan is probably the best 
i have ever seen in 

how do you figure that when bryan took over the wings they were 
a pretty good team that was for the cup but looked 
unlikely to win it. now they are a pretty good team that is for 
the cup but looks unlikely to win it. a truly great would 
have been able to make the to push the team to the 
of the and maybe win the cup .  . a good  ( like murray ) can 
maintain the team 's success but ca n't push them to the next level. 

in the history of there have been several better 's than 
way too many to name. is n't even the best in the league today. 
he fails in comparison to , , , , and 
in my  . 

i ca n't imagine how bryan can be the best anyone has ever seen 
in unless they have seen very few 's .  .

game 1. i'm sorry , mr. , you 're a great , but those cheap 
shots were nothing compared to what 's going to come. also , i guess you

i fear that within the next or so the only sports team 
left in pittsburgh will be the  . 

the thought .  .  . but . you know , you may be right , at least as far 
as major league sports teams go. they all seem to be 
becoming big money games , much more so than at any previous time. to 
think that if i am ever able to move back home several years from now , 
all that may be there is an team , at best .  .  . sigh .  . 

the interesting thing is that the is also expanding , at the same 
time as it is increasing the amount of money needed to 
operate a team .  . this would seem to indicate that there 's a big 
out about to occur in the next few years , unless 
can somehow be brought under control. frankly , i do n't see how the

operating conditions .  . if and a cap do n't come

can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude. 
this the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time. 

throughout the year , francis recieved more ice time than

sure that had more points per minute played that francis .  . when 
you add to that 's better , i think it becomes evident 
that had a better not that francis had a bad one.

i still am surprised that no one has tried giving away the at the end 
of the game. the two problems with that , of course , are that you would want 
to make sure the first people in the building would be assured of getting 
them  ( probably vouchers ) , and that the building want to 
avoid at all costs people as they leave the building , if , for 
instance , the are given to people as they  . 

i went to the new jersey ice cream night  ( tm ) last year to 
see the beloved play .  . the were given out at the end of the game. 
i could just imagine what would have happened late in the third if the 
were  .  .  .  . 

it , after i posted the first article , i found out that the are 
going to be using for the the on friday night. i believe that 
is is the some big corporation  ( probably a bank ) flying night. i think 
that we could all see the potential for danger here .  .  .  . 

all in all , i have seen a whole bunch of land on the ice , and it 
never ceases to me. i'm just for the that no one has 
yet to  lead night  at any  .  .  . 

that 's probably because they could n't find anyone to it .  .  .  . maybe 
could the pittsburgh us night close enough

what did the think when they signed him did they think he

good for you. you 'd only be your ignorance of 
course , but to each his own .  .  .  . 

roger , i'm not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a 
function of a lack of knowledge and not an 
opinion  .  .  . but . hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by 
all means go ahead .  .  . that . 's if it makes you feel better. 

to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious. 
your education is not my responsibility .  . 

my education what the f are you talking about i'm 
not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement. 

my word , such against poor ol' bob  . why does 
he bother you so much .  .  . he . was an effective for his 
style of play .  . 

he was just another  . to him as anything more i find 
 . i the  . i until i realized 
that he was likely the most to 
ever in my lifetime. why would anyone talk about 

i hate the  .  .  . you . sound like a 10 year old .  . this 
statement is just further your total inability to 
argue objectively about  . do n't give me this crap about 
arguments  .  .  . i . 've yet to read something of yours that is 
 . you argue with (1) (2) huge , 
sweeping statements 

frankly , you have a very unconvincing style .  . 

i'm not defending bob  .  . frankly . , i do n't care for him all 
that much. but your of him as something less than an 
effective is tiresome .  .  . it . has no basis in 
anything. how many did he win i think it was four  ( go 
ahead and my  . what about the was 
that a fluke yeah , not the makings of a , i 
know , but try to have a reason , any reason , to shoot him down. 

go around. who would you rather have as your checking 
centre doug or doug for that matter i would 
take either or as my checking  . do you 
think could cover bob 

i'm really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here. 
why do n't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ , 
himself , in 

did he play at a high level was he any good if not , 
why would you bother to bring jc up i am talking about 
here. if you ca n't follow the conversation do n't follow 
up. as i said previously , it is not my responsibility to 
you. 

hey ! you 're the expert who introduced the idiotic 
comparison of with and  .  . you . figure it 
out. 

now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob with 
guy , you would have a balanced comparison .  . 

sure. two  . big deal. neither one of them is worth 
discussing .  . 

how many individual between them eight .  .  . i . do n't remember 
 ( once again , please feel free to my memory .  .  . and . try to 
be as as possible about my education ) .  . 

i'm wrong again .  .  . hmmm . , let 's see .  .  . where . was i wrong in the 

i would take and off of the latter .  . 

oh my god ! ! ! did i say that roger .  .  . what . 's your point 
is a , 's do n't plug  .  .  . in . his prime , he was 
one of the best. was a  .  . if . you stick him on 
you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era. 

first place i'm only here , , but i have a feeling 
that you 've setup a you 're wrong again macro key on your 
machine .  . 

that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time 
responding to any of your , or greg 's , postings then i will be 
sure to implement that very macro .  . 

oh roger , you should n't .  .  . really .  . i do n't this .  .  . you . are 
far too already. 

i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out 
of things to say about the stars on they start to 
the  . grant , , , 
bob , bob , doug , , wayne 
, bob , bob , ralph , richard , 
dick  .  . and . so on .  .  .  . demonstrates a blanket disregard for 
these individuals as contributors to the game .  .  . so . yes , 
down .  .  . nobody . has claimed that they are gods .  . 

claimed that was a god. and greg 
it up. and that is what this thread is all about. if you did n't 
know that then why are you responding 

you seem to have allowed all of these other fall into 
your sweeping , vacuous statement .  .  . that . 's why. if you want to 
debate , go ahead .  .  . but . why bring up everybody else how 
does it support your argument do you have an argument , or do 
you just like to around a few names to impress us 


and as for blanket disregard for these individuals , i can 
remember teams , purely populated by such individuals , 
four cups .  . teams .  . no one around telling 
us that george was the best in the 
world. 

great .  . i could n't agree more. the flyers won two cups for the 
same reasons .  .  . so. so what i do n't get it. are you 
angry that the did n't get more recognition 

you seem to think these are  .  .  . i . do n't 
agree .  .  . plain . and simple. if you 're last statement is some sort 
of compromise , fair enough. 

you might consider developing your own style .  . after all , 
is the form of and i am quite 
sure that is not your intention .  . 

 .  . it . has a nice to it .  .  . and . admit it , you had a good 
laugh. 

right. i had to get to the end of your posting before i 
realized you were a complete joke. 

not a pleasant bone in your body , eh why are you so 
unhappy not getting invited to enough parties what 

in the future , if you are going to respond to my postings i 
would appreciate it if you could present a argument 
supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most 
of the rest of us would recognize .  . 

roger , why are you under the impression that responding to your 
posts is some great honour you really should stop .  .  . it . sounds 
a little bit pathetic .  . frankly , it 's about as as a 
good  . 

, as always ,

and think of where the majority of come from. from a farm out 
in , or ,  . 


the biggest advantage that kids from or have is the 
of ice .  . in the san jose area we have a population of , 000 
and that population is served by 2 ice  . in , , 
british has a population of about 50 , 000 and has 5 ! there 
are also , pools , etc that in the  . down here 
it 's hard to find a kid without a bicycle up there it 's hard to find a kid 
without a pair of  . and before you say what does he know he 's from 
california .  . let me say that i was born and raised in trail , british , 
a town of about 8 , 000 with lots of ice in the  . my father did radio 
play by play for the local team , the trail , who by the way , were 
the last canadian team to win the world  ( back in  . i was 
on almost as soon as i could walk , and have been playing 
for about 35 years. 

when was the last time you saw a league in the inner city. 
the alone is a big enough  . 

the inner city is n't the only place that is poor. 
i think the biggest to in the inner city is .  .  .  . no ice to play on. 


lack of ice is a big factor , but costs is a bigger factor .  . both my kids play for 
the santa association and this , which just ended , 
cost me 75 per kid for membership in usa , plus 750 per kid for club 
 . the usa cover excess medical , and the club 
cover ice time , , , etc. other areas have similar , unless 
the city government some of the costs , as does. 

by the way most ice are in what could be called the inner city 
areas .  . and are exceptions ... city 's is in an 
industrial area on bay , near , berkeley 's is near and martin luther 
king , 's is in oak park , 's is in an older section of 
(i forget the name of the street ) , 's is out on the of town , just west 
of  . santa rosa 's is a nice , but it 's in an older section of town .  . 
dublin 's is outside of town , off  . most of the are old , and expensive 
to run , with huge electric and  . if you want to buy ice 
time expect to pay around 100 per hour at any of these  . some of them 
give you a 60 minute hour for your money others give you a 50 minute hour and 
include the time in the fee .  .

way back in the early years ( 50 's ) it took 8 to the cup .  .

started the tradition of throwing an onto the ice with every win .  . after 
each victory , one would be before the found its way to the

should play well against jersey  . it 'll probably be another 1 goal 
game as the last 20 games been for the isles .  . i wish when the get a lead 
they could continue to pour it on instead of back into a

25 on each of the 24 teams .  . my source is the vancouver sun .  .

not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game and

at the end of last , the contracts of several veterans with somewhat

now what if the two teams were  ( this has been proposed in tampere

they rather see their teams out of the most of the time or even 
relegated than  . it 's not that difficult to understand , it 's just 
like here in  . you grow up being either a or fan .  . 
the other team is the last team in the world you would support .  . i'm not 
talking about  hate  but about extremely deeply  . 

deeply ahem , have been around since and joined 
the top only in the early '70s .  . have been around since 
but only started taking seriously in the 1960s so i think 
you 're here. 

however , it 's been proved that both fan groups can the same team 
that 's the finnish national team . maybe that 's how you could set up a 
huge in finland .  . no one has ever said that the team must be 
called after one city or play all its games on one  . just one team 
finland and team in the just would n't make any sense we have 
way more talent than 1 24th of the total of north american talent .  . after a 
couple of you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the 
 ( presuming that our teams would have the advantage in 
local talent , as  . 

that 's a rather bold claim , in the light of how successful the canadian 
american teams have been . . . and they 've had to play according to our 
set of rules and on international ice .  . the 1992 teams contained about 
as much talent as your average team .  . canada had eric , 
burke , joe and chris  . another four or five have been deep in 
the  . as for the , keith , scott , , 
, steve , , joe sacco and bill have been 
3rd 4th line in the , while has done well for the 
kings in goal. nothing more. in fact , i'm sure that an all star team assembled 
from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the than 
or bay currently are doing. 

but what happens if all top class finnish gradually end up 
with as the north american based ones gradually and 
no canadian american team is allowed to draft new from

this would be interesting. clearly , finland 's top five  ( winnipeg 's 
, vancouver 's , los  and new york 's 
tikkanen ) are right up there with any five man pittsburgh co .  . have. but 
i have my about the home based finnish the national team did 
well in the canada cup and world largely due to the efforts of 
 ( the goalie ) , 3 4 or the listed above and luck. there 's 
presumably a lot of decent in finland that would n't be at 
the highest level but still valuable role , however. my guess would be 
that the finnish canada cup team would be a  . team in the  . 

is easier to judge because they have more in north america .  . 
their points total  ( 16 players ) is 274 seven more than ottawa 's 22 top 
combined ! if we estimate there are more back home in 
, an all team would about points. 
some points from pittsburgh , ny and other teams that rely on 
, the team would finish in sixth place about as high 
as boston , vancouver , and montreal on paper ! so , the talk 
is n't completely unfounded here. an all finnish all team might have an 
advantage because the would be playing at home half of the time , 
wo n't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language , and presumably 
play the wide open european variant of rather than have to learn the 
north american checking game. however , if free agency becomes a factor the top 
still might end up playing for large market teams after a 
couple of years the same way 's in the late '80s .  . 
some fringe likely will be by other teams as having an 
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. i 'd for a 
compromise , all european teams from a north american during 
the first two but allow them to keep their top two  . after this , 
the amateur draft should be open to anyone.

it was a well played game by both teams (i thought ) but according to the

were  . well , i beg to differ .  .  .  .  . 

imho , clark deserved to be a first star as much as did. his

created reminded me of the clark of old .  .  ( but not to take any of the

well first look at their injury list which includes , , , 
,  . of course my question is this .  .  .  . how . will the

how long can the play short handed and still be expected to 
score they did some fine killing in the first  ( 2 men down 
for a couple of at one point ) but they just could n't keep it 
up. they spent virtually the entire game either short handed or 
just coming off a as soon as they 'd get re , they 're 
again ! 

like said after the 1st you ca n't go calling 
every little push an shove in a game like that. and if you 're going 
to , you have to do it for both teams .  . 

 ( one of my four favorite leafs ) played like a i 
saw him personally up at least 2 good opportunities , and 
then he got that 5 minute major high penalty .  . 

has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand full of 
games ago and he played a good game. if the other on his line 
can up , that line should do okay. clark 's got to get tough 
he 's got to intimidate and go for the net. send clark up the left 
over the blue line a couple times .  .  .  . his patented shot will 
put some numbers on the board .  .  .  . and  .  .  . heck , maybe he should 
be  . 

i hate to repeat , but where the heck was ca n't 
do all the checking himself and get on the move .  .  .  . we 
need some speed out there ! keep in net , he did okay 
considering .  .  .  . although  ( like i said a couple weeks ago ) 
up in a couple games in the last year he can 
easily do it again. 

my prediction last week was in 7 that the games 
will be blow and the game will be close i still stand 
by that. 

do n't , , in order to win in 7 , the other team has to 
win 3 ! ) 

is going to make some magic he 'll mix up some lines. match 
the wings line per line. he 'll have his team checking hard , and he 'll 
never let them get out in their own end. the will win 
night .  .  .  . and will take 1 or their home games  ( probably the

the line that plays against them is probably a one. that is 
why they are not  . 

2. when called bob the best in the world , it was 
assumed that he the best technical the one who knew 
every about playing and never made a technical error. 

and who was it that made this assumption all of your friends maybe 
sorry greg , but 2 people are n't enough .  .  . you . can assume all that you 
want to , but if you think was serious then you are an idiot .  . 

someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation 
 ( it was a few months  . whoever this was please repost it. 

i agree with this  . bob may have been the best technical 
ever. 

right greg .  . did you see this in the sun or something what did you think 
of was nothing more than a who 's 
outstanding abilities were entirely political .  . he might have had a 
of but he had absolutely no offensive at 
all. none. but perhaps you think that the abilities to pass the , shoot 
the and a or are not technical 

is the best forward ever. i stand by that  . 
he was a very good who belongs in the hall of fame .  . did you 
ever watch him play he never made a technical error.

gee greg , the were calling the best two way in the 
league way back when he was with st.  . i would have expected you to 
have picked up on that. 

who are these was good with but he was not the 
best two way in the game when he was with them. you have

in article  ( richard john rauser ) writes 
ten years ago , the number of in the was roughly a 
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 , the numbers of on 
teams have to the following 

400 
americans 100 
100 

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top 
25 on each of the 24 teams .  . my source is the vancouver sun .  . 

here 's the point there are far too many in the  . i am sick 
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team  ( let 's say , the 
red wings and the canucks ) and seeing names like and 
. is this north america or is n't it , , quebec , 
and are particularly , but the numbers of on other 
teams is getting worse as well. 


from where i come from in canada , sounds more canadian than 
smith ! ) 

anyways , back into the hole you out of .  .  . the . does n't 
care where they get from , major league baseball 
does n't give a damn where they get baseball from  ( except , 
that is) .  . 

canada is in no imminent danger of being as the primary 
of  .  . , finland , the , and 
are all relatively small countries , and cannot really produce 
at a greater rate than they are already producing them , and the 
potential from the former soviet union is severely 
because the system has been and is for and 
will take a or two , to and become a real threat , and 
the us will just maintain its slow increase .  . canada should continue 
to supply 60 plus of the top in the world for the 
future. 

besides we need the european market if is to take 
its place besides as the two predominant world 
sports .  .  . and . since is essentially , unlike  . 

i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about , the 
rocket i will completely up. as it is now , every time i see 
the play i keep someone will cross check into the hard they have to carry him out on a  .  ( by the way , i'm not a 
fan to begin with ) .  . 

okay , the remark was a little carried away. but the point is that 
i owners all these instead of  ( and 
some  . it denies young the opportunity to play in their 
north american league and instead gives it to , who are n't even 
better  . it 's all  . this european is , 
but until owners get over it , canadian and american will continue 
to have to fight harder to get into their own league .  . 

with the numbers of in the , the problem is clearly 
only getting worse. 


are under no threat .  .  . the . european numbers will soon , 
if they have n't already .  .  . and . by the time russia comes again , 
the should be a world league , and there will be many more teams 
to stock and many more jobs for canadian  . in the near 
team , the percentage of will mostly decline because of 
americans , not because of  . 

i'm all for the creation of a european league , and let the 
and of the world play on their own continent .  . 

i just do n't want them on mine.

obviously easier to score in , there are more 
opportunities .  . if a team scores 100 points , that 's 
at least fifty chances made. the average number of shots taken 
by each team in a game  ( and this is a total guess) is 
probably around 40 , and a team is lucky to on maybe 
5 of them. you have some good ideas concerning the other 
penalties , but i think that a should be awarded a 
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was 
with. 

also , later in the post , you talked about how the

would n't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a

philadelphia , 14 11 5  ( 30 shots 26 saves ) 
, , 1 1 1  ( 38 33 ) 

on the first goal , the at the flyers blue 
line and him and took off. 

the goal was a 2 on 1 with  . 

the goal was just a he threw at the net , got a good and it 
ended up behind the  . 

on the second goal he got three at the before it went in. 
this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense .  . take the body , and if 
they get one shot and you fine. do n't give them another chance. , 
and are all terrible about this , i 'll bet money at least one of 
them was the flyer to the play .  . 

that 's all i have , my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it 
was that , much less how. 

from what i heard , had a very strong game. after the game , gene hart 
asked bobby to pick the three stars of the rather than of the 
game. it was 3 for his career high point total  ( i'm surprised 
that a former would n't look closer at his play ) , tommy 
2 for his team record 5 in only about 1 2 a 
and , mark 1 for his all time high team single mark. 
but here 's the odd part. he could n't decide between and for 
number 1. if he as 1 after he had a hard time choosing between 
him and , does n't that make 2 

what you know my three stars of the well , since you asked .  .  .  . 

1 eric  . eric a game simply by out onto the ice .  . 
the difference between the team 's record with him and without him is no 
accident. i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without 
 . there is no question that this team is better with eric 
on it , and i think that he will wear the  c  on his jersey 
next  . 

2 tommy  . 5 was second in the league to only ed , 
and tommy did n't have a chris  ( booo ) in front of him. he also did n't 
play a complete due to heart problems  ( sentimental here , my family 
has a history of heart  . there 's no question in my mind that tommy 
is this teams of the future , and if complains again 
about being number 2 look for him to be within 2 years. 

3 mark  . again , you ca n't argue with an all time team high single 
mark. there are an awful lot of teams that did n't have a single 
get as many points. plus , mark is the only flyer to play the entire  . 
not a tough choice. 

honorable mentions his single high point total 
which he set last year .  . the difference was that he was n't on the top line 
this year and did n't get as much playing time. then again , he did n't get the 
attention that he got last year from the other team either. 

was the teams most consistent  . yes , he made 
mistakes , but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. i have a feeling 
that with his shot he 'll score a few more points next year without giving up 
anything in his own , and i suspect that he 'll be the teams top 
in years to come. 

was the team 's point leader from  . again , there are some 
things you just ca n't argue with. and he with , 
he certainly deserves for only missing one game , and that was against his 
wishes under doctors orders .  . but his play often his offensive 
 . a little more , and a little bit in his own end 
will make him a much more important part of the team next year .  . 

was the biggest improvement over last years point total .  . 
but consistency became a problem for him. 

a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members 

tom , a member of the mailing list , would like to exchange e mail 
addresses with any list members who want to keep in touch over the summer .  .

the flyers end the 1 game below  . in place , their best 
percentage since going  . in 1988 89 .  . 14 20 3 within the division  ( 4th in 
patrick ) , 23 14 5 at home. they finished 17th overall , will draft in 
next years entry draft  ( quebec had the 1st , though) .  . they as 
many goals as they allowed ,  . 

the 8 straight is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985 .  . 

i will be sending out final as soon as i get the issue of the 
news that contains them , since there are no more games for me to go to i have 
no other way of getting them.

a tie is worth one point (i know , i know. you 're not good at math .  . but bear

ten years ago , the number of in the was roughly a

americans 100 
100 

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top 
25 on each of the 24 teams .  . my source is the vancouver sun .  . 

here 's the point there are far too many in the  . i am sick

red wings and the canucks ) and seeing names like and 
. is this north america or is n't it , , quebec ,

teams is getting worse as well. 

that 's why we have to create more jobs .  . teams ca n't afford to 
import role from europe , they pick the stars but will continue to build 
their teams around local  . 

with the numbers of in the , the problem is clearly 
only getting worse. 

i'm all for the creation of a european league , and let the 
and of the world play on their own continent .  . 

i 'd love to see a european division but ca n't see it happen for some 
time. there 's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several 
crucial like germany , and france while and finland 
probably ca n't afford to shell out 20 30 for the way 
american canadian do. call it the minnesota north stars effect 
do love but we prefer to watch local , 
to the  . the national league should love the idea , though. 
european tv such as could bring in the millions the 
american likely never will pay .  . 

i just do n't want them on mine. 





richard j. you have no idea what you 're doing. 
oh , do n't worry about that. we 're 
outlaws we do this for a living. 

remember , no matter where you go , there you are. dr .

i saw yesterday on tv a game between team and team finland .  . 
most of us might know that it was played in and the result 
was 4 3 for the home team .  . that 's nothing very special .  .  .  . but i was 
very surprised of  . i must admit that he surprised me 
already in the finnish  . and now on team finland ! 

is a light weight , if we consider his size according 
to my he is only and ! and he is only 18 ! 11 .  . 
but he is a real two way ! well , can score , gives nice 
passes , does even ! ! he is really something to watch 
in the  . 

the size is n't always everything. maybe we remember  .  .  . 
and they say that is still growing up  ( 3cm during last  .  .  . 

is n't that small any longer i guess i heard he is at the 
moment and will still grow 6  .

this is a general question for us readers 

how extensive is the down there in canada , it is almost 
impossible not to watch a series on tv  ( ie the only two series i have not had 
an opportunity to watch this year are and , the latter because 
i'm in the wrong time ! ) .  . we  ( in canada ) are basically with 
, and i wonder how many series games are televised nationally or even 
in the us and how much precedence they take over , say , local news if 
the games go into double ot .  . 

email me so as not to waste bandwidth , please. my news feed is kind of slow 
anyways .  .

division 



vs in 7  ( this , like mon vs que , will be another intense 
 ( series to watch ! ) 

vs in 7  ( potvin will be in nicely by this point . ) . 



vancouver vs in 6  ( potvin will be series mvp ) 

this is what kills me 
cup finals 

vs montreal 
 ( the classic cup final ! ! ) also a dream come true ! 

montreal the cup in the 7th game 1 0 in double  . 
roy and are throughout the series and share series  ( if 
that is possible ) game winner from a pass by 
brian !  ( star ) watched his play from the 
owners box that splinter on his which has left him on the 
list since the first game of the  ( awww  . 

paul 
die hard fan living with 
3 die hard ! 

speaking of die hard , that 's what i did when i read this , died hard 
laughing ! 

, to the cup finals 

first of all , has anyone on the planet heard of the team from al 
 ( or however you the idiot 's name) must be from chicago , 
because on , he said it 's not even close chicago will win 
the division in the , no other team is close. everyone is 
picking chicago ! i do n't get it , he says it 's an easy choice 
god , chicago was 1 4 1 against the wings , and they won the division by a 
point or two , followed closely by , who is also a good team ! 
as for the beating doubt it , but even if they do , they 
are n't going to get by chicago .  . if  ( even more amazingly ) they get past the 
, they would probably face vancouver , and lose .  . 
as for the the finals , forget it. even i , as a devoted wings 
fan , will watch the easily three as cup  . , 
, , , and , its a done deal. sorry , wait 
next year .  . 
but hey , these were paul 's , and everyone has a right to their own 
, but the to the finals yeah. if they make it there , i 'll 
walk to to get some , and that 's a 700 walk ! 

ryan 

red wings the forgotten team ! go wings ! ! let 's hope the 
go out 
early ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

next , a clip was shown from an earlier , in which was 
proclaiming doug to be the best , not only in 
the , but in the world. what about like 
said that was the best , not point . 
its not like baseball , where you have a who 
can score runs but ca n't play defense .  . is a good two way  . 

this clip was shown on local news in pittsburgh last night  ( kdka ) , complete 
with sarcasm by the  . it 's the second time 
has been shown on local pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks. both 
times he was blasting  . 


his point remarks were not only meant for , 
but for , , etc. etc. .... and he made those particular 
remarks last december before was with 's , 
and as the started their second half roll , and before 
's great was being recognized by many people.

i can give you a couple. in ,  ( 760 ) will be broadcasting 
at least the first couple of games of the wings series , and 
since they at , you may be able to pick it up 
after dark where you are at. the pittsburgh games used to be 
on , but i do n't know whether they will be pre 
by baseball  ( and moved to another station ) or not. you can try those 
if the local baseball teams are n't playing at the same time , anyway. 

according to this morning 's post 

the will be carried by  ( radio(1020 am ) , unless the 
are playing .  . when the play , the games will be carried by 
5 .  . will carry 12 games , starting with 's 
game. 

in fact , after this , will no longer be the 
station for the  . the and have a new 
deal regarding the tv and radio rights to the games. it seems 
more than likely that will be the radio station next 
 . will carry 62 games on tv , with 17 of the games to be 
on tv. the remaining 22 games , as well as some of the 
early round games , will be available by tv only .  . 
to receive the games , you 'll have to pay a one time up fee , and 
then a monthly fee of 11 12 dollars .  . 

also , under the new deal , there will no longer be radio tv 
 . there will be a tv team , and a radio 
team .  . 

no word on who the will be. mike and paul 
are both under contract with , but their contracts at the 
end of this  . president bill craig said he 'd like to 
and  .
