any information on how to get a hold of the company which produces the 
card or know where any drivers are for it , please let me know ! 

as far as i can tell , it 's a card that is taking up 2 of my 16 bit

the 4  .  .  . at least 16 from what i can count .  .  . thanks !

hi ! everyone , 

because no one has the problem i posted last week , i guess 
my question was not so clear. now i 'd like to describe it in detail 

the offset of an is the of the center of a circle which 
rolls on the  . in other words , the distance between the 
and its offset is same everywhere. 

this problem comes from the measurement when a is used. 
the of the is a ball and the computer just the 
positions of the ball 's center .  . is the offset of an still 
an the answer is no ! , an american 
standard says it is  . so almost all the software which was 
implemented on the base of was wrong. the software was also sold 
 . imagine , how many people have or will suffer from this bug ! ! ! 
how many qualified parts with were will be discarded and most 
importantly , how many parts with are will be used 

i was employed as a by a company in los last year 
to solve this problem. i spent two months on analysis of this 
problem and months on programming .  . now my solution  ( nonlinear ) 
is not ideal because i can only an from its entire 
or half offset .  . it is very difficult to find the original from 
a or a segment of its offset because the method i used is not 
 . i am now wondering if i did n't touch the base and make things 
complicated .  . please give me a hint .  . 

i know you may argue this is not a problem. you are right , it is not. 
however , so many people involved in the problem from 4 . 
why not an and why not its offset 

please post here and let the others share our interests

hi all , 

in short looking for very fast assembly code for line circle drawing 
on  . 

complete 
i am thinking of a simple but fast molecular 
program to write on pc or clones .  .  ( ball and stick type ) 

reasons programs that i 've seen are far too slow for this purpose. 

class machine .  . 
16 or 16 
 ( speed is important , 16 color for non 
purpose is enough may stay at for 
speed reason . ) . 
 ( hope the code would be generic enough for different 
cards. my own card is based on , not ) 

what i'm looking for 
1 ) fast , very fast routines to draw lines circles simple shapes 
on above mentioned  . 
presumably in assembly  . 
yes , very fast please. 
2 ) related codes to help the on screen. 
for beginning , would be lines , circles mainly , think of 
text , else later. 
 ( you know , the way molecular , a molecule ) 
2 ) and any other codes  ( preferentially in c ) that can help the 
project .  . 

final remarks 
non profit .  . expected to become share , free  . 

any help is appreciated.

, i do n't want to get into a  war  by what i am going to say , 
but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the you are 
claiming on the , you 'll see why  ( please , no flames , i reserve 
those for c . s . m . a . ) ) 

i was in chicago in the last consumer show , and apple had 
a 
there. i walked by , and they were showing real time video capture 
using a  ( radious or ) card to and make right on the 

 . i think the they were using was the old one 
 . 

version 1 . 5 . of is , as has been stated , the current version of 
the software .  . the older version is 1.0 , and 1 . 6 . is on the in the 
not too distant future. 

they a guy talking there in something. it played 
back quite 
nicely and in real time. the guy then expanded the  ( resized ) to 
by 
 ( 320 in y i think) and the frame rate enough to notice 
that it 
was n't  ( or about 30fps ) anymore. it dropped to like 15  . then 
he 
increased it just a bit more , and it dropped to 10 12  . 

does a much better job of playing back at size than it 
does playing back  . apparently the process of expanding 
each frame 's image and the to the appropriate 
bit depth is pretty processor  . there are that work 
pretty well for showing at double size , but if you drop to 1 . 
size or increase to 2 . size , suffers  . 

then i asked him what mac he was using .  .  .  . he was using a 
 ( do n't know 
what model , ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the 

could play back at the same speed even on an  . 

he lied .  . ) is very dependent .  . he was probably confused by 
the fact that is locked to an internal , and will play in the 
same amount of time on any machine .  . however , an will drop in 
order to keep the sound and video up. 

the and have similar and will thus boast similar 
, though the will be a bit due to 
and somewhat different  . 

well , i spoiled his claim so to say , since a mac was 
having 
a little bit of trouble .  . and this was n't even from the ! this 
was 
from memory ! 

could it be that you saw either a newer version of , or some 
hardware assisted , or another software product running the 
 ( like supposedly 's ) 

i expect that the version of the software you saw was 1.0 i 
was using was 1 . 5 .  . one of the new in v1 . 5 . allows video at nearly 
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle .  . 
the i saw was a plain , with the exception of the nice 
speakers that were playing the sound , and the software was movie , 
the apple includes with the software .  . 

do n't misunderstand me , i just want to clarify this. 

no problem it still surprises me that is able to do the 
things it does as well as it can.

the good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move

since your viewpoint is always the same , the routines can be hard 
for a particular  . in my case , two 's has a slope 
of 1 4.  ( i'm also using mode x ,  . 

i 've run into two problems i'm sure that other readers have tried this 
before , and have perhaps formulated their own opinions 

1 ) the routines for drawing walls 1 2 were trivial , but when i a 
image through them , i was by the  . i'm 
now considered some anti routines  ( speed is not really necessary) .  . 
is it worth the effort to have the draw the already skewed , 
thus being assured of nice image , or is this too much of a burden 

2 ) 3 presents a problem the i used tends to overly distort 
the original .  . i tried to decide on paper what go where , and failed .  . 
has anyone come up with method for mapping a to 
shape 

currently i take 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

line 1 follows the slope .  . line 2 is directly under line 1. 
line 3 up a line and left 4  . line 4 is under line 3. 
this fills the shape exactly without any  . but 
it causes  . has anyone come up with a better way 
perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original 
already skewed 

are there any other particularly problems with this perspective 
i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z  .

for those of you who noticed , the top lines of 2  ( and 1 ) 
are parallel with its bottom lines. this is why there appears to 
be an illusion  . it appears to be either the inside or outside 
of a cube , depending on your  . there are no vanishing points. 
this the drawing code for objects  ( which do n't have to 
change size as they move about in the  . i 've decided that this 
approximation is , since small at a large enough 
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in

is a user friendly , state of the art image 
and analysis that runs across a spectrum of high 
computer operating unix and the x system. 

it was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists 
conducting using data and remote 
sensing techniques .  . 

intuitive interface 

features an interactive interface with pop up and 
point and click boxes which makes image and 
analysis simple and fast .  . 
this accessible you to build attractive image 
quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning 
to the main to conduct other image analysis and  . 

image format 

using smart read write functions , allows you to easily open 
and save image files in a variety of using bit , integer or real 
data values .  . also reads and writes the common and 
as well as and image to save space .  . 

image analysis 

for image and analysis , the includes an 
of tools that perform useful statistical and 
mathematical filtering , such as , 
product or principal component analyses .  . 
an interactive for both and images allows 
the user to and individual data  . 
standard is used for entry and for 
and transcendental functions .  . 

orbit analysis 

functions to simulate signal 
for various (e . g .  . , goes , , , etc . ) .  . 
the simulations are conducted for a selection of standard and 
surface conditions and instrument  . 
a geometry model the , , orbit , 
and 3 d image  . 

easy external program 

allows users the flexibility to 
developed software for and converting 
observations .  . and image files and image 
to external programs using special interface functions .  . 

quick quality 

rapidly , , and high resolution 
images and color  . using 8 bit image 
and one plane , the conveniently color images , 
and text to generate digital images for articles and reports .  . 
's 2 d and 3 d editor provides complete flexibility for 
and and analysis with images , such as 
and  . the color and gray scale 
output for standard and laser  . 
other capabilities also performs image , external

and , exactly fitting those points 

the equation of the through the 4 points  ( x1 , , z1 ) , ... ,  ( x4 , , z4 ) is 
x 2 y 2 z 2 2 2 2 ... 2 2 2 
x ...

when this 5 by 5 is expanded on its first you get the 
equation in the form 
 ( a(x 2 y 2 z 2 ) e 0 
if you need the center and , divide through by a  ( it cannot be 
zero if the 4 given points form a non tetrahedron ) and complete

please , note the newsgroups .  . 

recent discussion about 's problems were held in some newsgroup .  . 
here is some text users of might find interesting. 
i have added more to text to this collection article , so read on , even 
you so my articles a while ago. 

i hope author of those problems as best he can , so fine 
program is that it is worth of improving .  . 
(i have also minor ideas for , e mail me for them . ) . 

any of mine is understandable .  .

note that   saves only images that means that 
the saved are just like to to quality .  . 
also , there 's three kind of your final image quality 
depends on them too. 

this were the situation when i read faq a while ago. 

imho , it is design error of   there should not be such confusing 
errors in programs. 
there 's two errors 
allows the saving of image as even the 
original is saving image instead of 
original should be a special case 
allows saving the image made with any 
the main case should be that   the image with the 
best available before saving the image to a file 
should be just for purposes  ( and a special cases 
in saving the image , if at all )

 .  . deleted .  .  . 

it is limit of , but not limit of design. 
it is error in design. 
it is error that images are as 
is not designed to that. 

as matter of fact , i'm sure when were designed were 
known. it is not bad error to program a program for images only 
at that time , but when image are included to program the 
whole design should be changed to support images .  . 
that were not done and now we have 
the program violate design  ( and any image format ) 
the program has human interface errors. 

is to drop saving images as or any format without 
clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use. 

 .  . deleted .  .  . 

clip 

some new items follows .  . 

clip 

i have seen that the image sometimes poorly with 
option than with default option we have. 
the reason surely is the used as it is  ( surprise ) 
the same than used in  . 

if you remember , i have tested some  . in that test i found 
that  ( with default ) is best , then comes , , 
 ( our default ) in that order. in my test very poorly 
it actually gave image with bad artifacts .  . 

i do n't know is improved any , but i expect no. 
so , use of 's option is not very good idea. 

i suggest that author of changes the to the one used in 
i'm sure people gives permission .  . 
 ( another could be one used in i have not tested it , so i 
can say nothing about it . ) . 

clip 

clip 

some minor in human interface are 

key and goes to a often it happens 
that i make click errors or press keyboard when is in the wrong 
place. it is very when you have waited image to come about 
five and then it is gone away immediately .  . 
the should be cleaned when the image is complete. 

also , good idea is to wait few seconds before keyboard 
and for after the image is  . 
often it happens that image pops to the quickly , just when 
i'm writing something with editor or such. those key 
then go to and image has gone or something  . 

in the color editor , when i turn a color and release it , 
the images .  . it is impossible to change all values first 
and then get the updated image. it is wait image to be 
updated when the setting are not ready yet. 
i suggest of adding an  apply  to update the done.

image 

an image product for users who need to extract quantitative 
data from video images .  . image lets users 
sophisticated image and measurement routines without the 
necessity of knowing a programming language. it is designed for such 
at computing number and size of cells in images by video 
attached to , or and measuring in 
 . 

image provides users with an of field proven video 
analysis techniques that them to easily a sequence of 
instructions to enhance feature appearance count objects determine 
, shape , size , position , or movement perform object feature 
and conduct analysis automatically .  . image 
works with either a board and any standard video camera , or 
a image. 

within , without the need for programming , the image user 
can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image. 
measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi automatically 
generated from or files or from captured video images .  . 
image items in images based on their size , shape and 
position. the tool provides direct support for the data translation and 
frame  . a command allows for image capture from a 
video camera or other or devices .  . 

there are 2 types of files , the image itself and the related sequence 
file that holds the , measurements and analysis that the user 
defines .  . sequences are set up in regions of interest  ( roi ) 
represented by , boxes the image. inside a , the 
program can find the distance between two edges , the area of a shape , 
the of a , etc. image finds the center , and 
other positions automatically .  . the application also provides tools so 
that the user can work to find the of object. it also 
supports and a color look up table  ( clut ) tool.

, and line drawing , digital 
image and methods , generation , and image 
statistics  . over 150 such image transformation programs 
have been developed .  . as a result , almost any image task 
can be performed quickly and conveniently .  . , allows 
users to easily their own routines .  . new users 
become effective using on their first day. 

features images that are self  . each image in 
the system contains a history of the that have been 
applied to that image. includes a small set of

yes. 

does anyone have any other suggestions where the 42 came from

i 've implemented the ideas from the article above and i'm very satisfied 
with the results. i needed it for my curve approximation  . 
in some cases  ( generating offset curves ) loops can occur .  . i now have a 
fast method of the generation of a curve with a loop. although 
i did not follow the article above strictly .  . the check if the fourth control 
point lies in the the loop area , which is by two and 
one is too complicated .  . instead i the loop area and 
it by for straight lines. the check is now simple and fast and

what are the main of this method i have seen it described , and

requires that the points be in a counter order , and returns

in article  ( earl boebert ) writes 
let 's say you have a image of a line drawing in this case a 
, but it could be anything. on the drawing you have a set of 
reference points whose true x , y positions are known. 

now you the drawing  ( in this case , using 
's excellent  . that is , you use a program which 
converts positions to x , y and saves those values when you click 
the  . 

upon you notice that the reference point values that come 
out of the process differ in small but significant ways 
from the known true values .  . this is understandable because the 
drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are 
sources of such as and 
of paper , errors introduced in the printing process , 
errors and what have you. 

the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing , so 
such as over x or y , or 
the whole drawing , are not  . 

so the question is does any kind soul know of an for 
removing such in particular , if i have three sets of 
points 

 ( reference(x , y )  ( the known true values ) 

 ( distortedreference(x , y )  ( the same points , with known errors ) 

 ( distorteddata(x , y )  ( other points , with unknown errors ) 

what function of reference and could i apply to 
to remove the errors. 

i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the 
reference points as resulting from the of a 3d 
surface , for the surface and then it to remove 
the errors in the other data points. 

it helps to have some idea of the source of the or at least 
a reasonable model of the class of  . below is a very short 
description of the process which we use if you have further questions , 
feel free to me via e mail .  . 


assume 

0 ) the of your  ( x , y ) points. this 
defines the set of for each point. if your data are 
not naturally , you may have very long edges on the  . 
consider these edges .  . 

1 ) now , there are two goals 

a ) move the  ( distorteddata(x , y ) to the  ( reference(x , y ) 
b ) keep the  ( length(e )  ( as measured from the current  ( x , y ) 's ) 
as close as possible to the  ( digitizedlength(e )  ( as measured 
using the  ( x , y )  . 

2 ) for every point , a based on a ) and  . for 
example 

a ) for  ( x , y ) points for which you know the  ( reference(x , y ) , you 
can move  ( reference(x , y )  ( current(x ,  . this will 
move the  ( distortedreference(x , y ) towards the 
 ( reference(x ,  . 
b ) for all other points , examine the current length of each  . 
for each , a which would make that 
the correct length  ( where correct is the  . 
take the sum of these , and move the 
point  . this will keep the 
consistent with your  . 

3) 2 ) until you are happy  ( for example , no point very  . 

and need to be determined by  . consider 
how much you believe the  ( reference(x , y ) i.e. , do you absolutely insist 
on the final points exactly matching the references , or do you want to 
some error in matching the reference against changes in length 
of the edges .  . 

warning there are a couple of which must be 
observed  ( essentially , you ca n't allow the to change , and 
you ca n't allow to over  . both of 
these can be either by special case on the motion of 
individual points , or by periodically re the points  ( using 
the current positions but still from the 
original positions .  . when we first did this , the time was 
, so we only did it once. if i were motivated to try and 
change code that has been working in mode for 5 years , i 
might go back and re on every  . if you have more 
power than you know what to do with , you might consider having 
every point interact with every other point .  .  .  . but . first read up on 
solutions to the n body problem.

a 3d short description follows 

3d 1.21 now available. 

version 1.21 is mainly a for think c users. this version 
now runs with think c , i promise ! the now contain a chapter for 
c on how to use the  . if you have problems , feel free 
to contact me. 
the other change is that i removed the calls from 
the version to make it run  . 

those of you who do n't know what all this is about , read on. 



3d what it is 


did n't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three dimensional 

did n't you always want to write this program that the structure 
of three dimensional 

and did n't the task of writing your 3d routines keep you from 
actually doing it 

well if the answer to any of the above questions is  yes , but what has it to 
do with this ' , read on. 

is a think pascal c library that provides you with simple routines 
for building , saving ,  ( as resources ) , and 
 ( independent around arbitrary , and scaling ) 
three dimensional objects .  . objects , not just simple single line  . 

supports full 3d , and some  ( primitive ) hidden 
line hidden surface drawing with simple commands from within your program .  . 

also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel 
 ( if you ca n't understand a word , do n't worry , this is just showing 
off for those who know about it. the that come with it will try to explain 
what it all means later  . 

provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with 
data so you can use to do the 3d and your own routines 
to do the actual drawing .  .  ( note that also provides drawing routines so 
you do n't have to worry about that if you do n't want to) 

1 . 11 . comes in two versions. one for the and or above 
 . the other version uses fixed point arithmetic and runs on any mac .  . 
both versions are 100 source . 

comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the of 3d 
and how to use the  . 

if demand is big enough i will convert the to an object class library. 
however , i that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for 
a lot more people than the select   . 

is free for any non usage .  . read the documentation  . 


enjoy ,

hi everyone , 

i thought that some people may be interested in my 
software on these groups 

the release of 1 . 0 . 2 . 

is a user , non , x based virtual reality 
system , primarily on research .  . 

features 

server based model , using berkeley  . 
no limit to the number of users  ( apart from  . 
generic  . 
 . 
objects  ( allowing of and light  . 
multiple light sources  ( ambient , point and  . 
objects can have extension code , to handle unique , easily 
attached .  . 




the is built around a  fast  render loop. basically it changes things 
when told to by the server and then an image from the user 's 
viewpoint .  . it also provides the server with information about the user 's 
actions which can then be communicated to other and therefore to 
other users. 

the is designed to be generic in other words you do n't need to 
develop a new when you want to enter a new world. this means that 
resources can be spent on the software rather than adapting 
it. the , as will be explained in a moment , occur in the  . 

this release of the software supports the following 

o objects  ( with associated addressing ) 

o multiple light sources and types  ( ambient , point and spot ) 

o user interface 

o with  ( optional for 
frame rates ) 

o and keyboard 

 ( some people may be that this software does n't support the 
as an device this is not because it ca n't , but because 
i do n't have one ! this will , however , be one of the first ! ) 

 ( server(s ) 
this is where can take place. the following basic support is 
provided in this release for potential world server 

o 

o message handling 

this may not sound like much , but it takes away the headache of 
accepting and 
and receiving messages from them the 
application writer 
can work with the assumption that things are happening  . 

things get more interesting in the object extension  . this is 
what is provided to allow you to your objects 

o server extension 
what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended 
in your world. basically you call the extension 
you want. 

o event 
when you develop for an object you basically write 
functions for the events that you want the object to respond to. 
 ( current events supported , move , change , terminate ) 

o 
if you want your object to respond to events just provide 
some basic information to the software .  . 
your will be when a occurs .  . 

this software is kept separate from the applications because 
the application wants to build a library of extended objects 
from which to choose .  . 

the following is all you need to make a world server application 

o provide an function 
this is where you choose what object will be supported , plus 
any you want to do. 

o provide a function 
this is where you determine where to place a new  . 

o provide an function 
this is where you load the world ( . file for a new  . 

o provide a function 
this is where you tell a new what they should have. 

o provide an function 
this is where you can go wild ! at a minimum you should let the objects 
move  ( by calling a move function ) and let the server sleep for a bit 
 ( to avoid the  . 

that 's all there is to it ! and to prove it here are the line for the 
three world i 've provided 

generic lines 
lines  ( more complicated due to the 
! will probably be improved with future 
versions ) 
72 lines 



this software is at the following site 
ftp . u . washington . edu . 

directory 
pub virtual worlds 

file 
1 . 0 . 2 . z . 





o mapping .  . 

o more i.e. z  ( or similar ) ,

o physical modelling  ( gravity ,  . 

o enhanced object interaction

i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the 
software , 
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation , and i'm not sure 
whether that will ever be able to be ! ( 

i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our of 
the virtual universe i 've certainly found fascinating developing it , and i 
would love to add support for the  .  . and . an ) ! !

keywords p , , curve separation , theorem 
organization program of computer 

in article ...  ( timothy smith ) writes 

i need to find a to determine if a line 
a  . i would prefer a method that would do this in as little 
time as possible. i need this for use in a forward 
program .  . 

i think that this is a very difficult problem. to start with , lines and 
are semi sets which both contain number of 
points. here are a few off the cuff ideas. 

first , we need to check if the line and the are separated .  . now , the 
curve separation theorem says that the the plane into 
exactly two open  ( and thus non compact ) regions .  . thus , the line lies 
completely inside the , the line lies completely outside the , 
or possibly  ( but this will rarely happen ) the line the  . 

now , the phrasing of this question says if a line a , so 
this is a decision problem. one possibility  ( the decision model approach ) is 
to reduce the question to some other  ( well known ) problem q , and then try to 
solve q .  . an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem. 

in recent years , many problems have been successfully modeled in a 
new language called  .  ( see language , by systems 
incorporated , isbn 0 3 , co .  .  . 

so , given a line l and a p , we can write a program that 
the line l and the p , and then the answer. by 
output , we mean the program a command called , which 
actually a page of paper containing the line and the  . a quick 
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q , and thus 
the original problem. 

there are two small problems with this approach. 

(1) there is an infinite number of ways to l and p into the 
reduced problem q .  . so , we will be forced to invoke the axiom of 
choice  ( or equivalently , 's  . but the use of the axiom of 
choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days. 

(2) more importantly , the question as to whether or not the 
program q will actually output a piece of paper or in 
other words , will it 

now , is expressive enough to everything that a 
machine might do thus the problem  ( for postscript ) is 
undecidable .  . it is quite possible that the original problem will turn 
out to be undecidable .  . 


i wo n't even begin to go into other difficulties , such as , finite 
precision and running out of ink , paper or both.

why not use the c library for reading writing files it took me a

i certainly do use it whenever i have to do , and it usually works 
very well. that 's not my point. i'm philosophically opposed to it 
because of its complexity .  . 

this complexity has led to some programs  poor writers making 
some very bizarre files , other programs  inability to load 
images  ( though they 'll save them , of course) , and a general 
inability to images between different

as the saying goes , it 's not me i'm worried about it 's all the

unnecessary ) complexity of the format .  .

image applications out there now. 


if a program  ( or worse all applications ) ca n't read every

basically , there are two determining whether a point is inside , 
outside or on the  . the first one is ray  ( or half line ) method. in 
this method , you can draw any ray , if the number of the point 
of the ray and the is even , then it is outside .  . if the number is odd , 
then it is inside. of cause , you have to deal with the special cases which 
may make you headache. 

the second method is  . draw the lines between the point and 
all the on the  . and sum the of the 
lines. if the result is 2 , then it is inside. if , then 
it is on the  . otherwise it is outside .  . 

my experience tells the second method is  .

but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the you are 
claiming on the , you 'll see why  ( please , no flames , i reserve 
those for c . s . m . a . ) ) 

i was in chicago in the last consumer show , and apple had a 
there. i walked by , and they were showing real time video capture 
using a  ( radious or ) card to and make right on the 
 . i think the they were using was the old one 
 . 

they a guy talking there in something. it played back quite 
nicely and in real time. the guy then expanded the  ( resized ) to by 
 ( 320 in y i think) and the frame rate enough to notice that it 
was n't  ( or about 30fps ) anymore. it dropped to like 15  . then he 
increased it just a bit more , and it dropped to 10 12  . 

then i asked him what mac he was using .  .  .  . he was using a  ( do n't know 
what model , ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the 
could play back at the same speed even on an  . 

well , i spoiled his claim so to say , since a mac was having 
a little bit of trouble .  . and this was n't even from the ! this was 
from memory ! 

could it be that you saw either a newer version of , or some 
hardware assisted , or another software product running the 
 ( like supposedly 's ) 

do n't misunderstand me , i just want to clarify this. 

but for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not , i can 
claim (a more with overscan ) being done in 256 , 000 in 
my computer  ( not from the hardisk ) at with  .

about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to 
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult. i am wondering if 
anyone on the net has seen this problem and  ( hopefully ) some published 
solutions to it. 

the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two 
roughly parallel  . for the problem essentially 
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
of an object which we treat as two dimensional , i.e. only extant 
between the edges , but which exists in three dimensional space .  . to draw 
the object we 

1 ) fit a through the points. each is effectively 
as a sequence of line the 
curve .  . each has an equal number of  . we assume 
that the segment along each is roughly , but not 
exactly , the same distance along each by any reasonable 
measure. 
2 ) take each segment  ( n ) along each and match it to the segment 
of the  . use the pair of to form two 
which will be filled in to color the surface .  . 
3) depth sort the 
4 ) take each triangle in order , project onto a , draw 
and color the triangle .  . take the of the triangle that is 
along the of the surface and draw a line along that 
with a special color 

it is the in step 4 that is at the heart of the 
problem. the idea is to effectively outline the of the surface .  . 
the net result however generally has lots of breaks and in 
the of the surface .  . the reasons for this are fairly complicated .  . 
they involve both problems and problems resulting 
from the the  . if anything about this problem 
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this 
area.

in recent years , many problems have been successfully modeled in a 
new language called  .  ( see language , by systems

so , given a line l and a p , we can write a program that 
the line l and the p , and then the answer. by 
output , we mean the program a command called , which 
actually a page of paper containing the line and the  . a quick 
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q , and 
thus

be solved even more easily. to wit

this program will test whether a point is inside a given  . 
currently it uses the even odd rule , but that can be changed by 
replacing with  . these are level 2 operators , 
so if you 've only got level 1 you 're out of luck. 

the result will be printed on the output  . 

only accurate to device !

would n't this require a  . in 3 space , 4 points over

necessarily happen. 

correct me if i'm wrong  ( which i quite possibly am ! )

sorry ! ! ) 

call the four points a , b , c and d. any three of them must be 
non  ( otherwise all three could not lie on the surface 
of a sphere ) and all four must not be  ( otherwise either 
they cannot all lie on a or they define an infinity of them) .  . 

a , b and c define a circle .  . the of , 
and ca meet in a point  ( p , say ) which is the centre of this circle .  . 
this circle must lie on the surface of the desired  . 

consider the normal to the plane abc passing through p. all points 
on this normal are from a , b and c and its circle  ( in 
fact it is a of the desired  . take the plane 
containing this normal and d  ( if d lies on the normal any 
plane containing the normal will do ) this plane is at right 
to the abc one. 

let e be the point  ( there are normally two of them) on the 
of the abc circle which lies in this plane .  . we need a point q on the 
normal such that  . but the of the 
of ed and the normal is such a point  ( and it exists since d is 
not in the plane abc , and so ed is not at right to the  .

this results in all the ending in either 0 . 25 . or 0 . 75 .

hi steve , 

as the author of , i feel i had better respond to your 
questioning whether anyone had managed to this 
software the quick answer is yes ! the long answer is yes but a 
few have had a few problems with their not all unix 's are 
the same , you know ! as far as many go , it would probably be more 
useful to everyone  ( including you) if you were a bit more explicit ! ) 

it has compiled and run on are , dec 
sun so it is possible. 

the main problem is that i do n't have access to other than the 
, so if there are problems then the only way i hear 
about them is by people letting me know and giving me a clue as to 
how to fix it. 

as far as the software not doing anything , do you really think i would 
bother it , if that was the case perhaps you did n't read the 
few that are  . the world is made up of 
only , so if you 're in there on your own , then you 're not going to see 
anything ! the world has quite a lot of so if you do n't 
see anything there , then this is definitely a problem ! 

one final word if you 're not interested , do n't bother with it. 
if you are interested , then please remember that i'm not asking for 
any money ! so why not try a little patience and constructive criticism , 
maybe that will get results

in the case of software , i wo n't get any software mentioned in this

i would suggest to split the group. i do n't see the problem of cross posting. 
then you need to read just 2 with half the size.

2. notes 

 ( excerpted from the faq article ) 

please do not post or mail messages saying i ca n't ftp , could 
someone mail this to me there are a number of mail 
that will send you things like this in response to a message. 

there are a number of sites that archive the usenet sources newsgroups 
and make them available via an email system. you send a message 
to an server saying something like send sources . unix . , 
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail .  .

with and use the l option to the of 
rather than the default 40 the output is better , but still much less that 
acceptable .  . note , that we are starting with a image in image format 
and the image into  . 

we suspect that if we could use the interface we would get higher quality 
pictures .  . we have not purchased the software that drives the from the 
 . to my knowledge this software is and does not come with a

some that the product will work. 


here my questions 

if anybody on the net uses this are you using the or 
parallel what is the quality of the 

is there a way to create high quality what is the 
limiting component , the language or the on

the big question 

where can i get some software to drive the for this

i think you 're proposal would work to get an extra one , maybe two extra 
bits of color resolution .  . however , if you had a display that do only 
zero or full for each primary , i do n't think you 'd get great 
equivalent 24 bit  . 

i have not suggested to do so i wrote about problems , and the problem 
were clearly with 7 bit b w images not to mention 24 bit images .  . 

description of experiment deleted 

if the 1 bit images are viewed quickly and in with , 
then 100 could be better than we have i  . 

more deleted 

in any case , getting black color with slow machines is problem. 
i could try it on our 8 bit but i do n't know how to 
render with x in constant time. i recall our double 
has other image color and one b w that does n't help either. 
maybe i should dump to with low level code how 

a few years ago a friend and i took some 256 grey level from 
a 1 bit mac plus using this method. all 256 levels 
to the display took about 10 seconds .  . after 
with different and 
we found a range that worked well , giving respectable 
 . the quality of the images was pretty good. there were no 
 . 

to minimize the exposure time the display program built 
different 1 bit  . the first contained a only for 
that had value , the second only for that had value , 
etc. these were using a data structure that was 
very fast to  or  onto the in sequence .  . creating these 
sometimes took 5 10 on that old mac , but the camera 
was closed during that time anyway. and yes , we wrote 
directly to the memory. mea culpa .  . 

our biggest problem was that small images were in the 
top left corner of the instead of the center .  . it took 
an extra week to have the film developed and printed , because the 
took the trouble to move the all images into 
the center of the print .  . who 'd have guessed

not just use the letters

anyone know about the chip 
is selling it with their systems they rank them at 50  .  .  . 
any info would help .  .  .  . 
thanks. 

it 's supposedly a high chip based upon workstation 
 . it 's quite fast (i have 7 ) , but as usual with new 
the drivers are for  . as far as go , it depends upon 
the version. i think i got with version 3 . 11 .  . 2.5 the 
50 number .  . i 've also this with at over 65  ( from memory 
as  . 

as far as the low level stuff goes , it looks pretty nice. it 's got this 
fill command that requires just the four points. 

it 's very fast , but beware of drivers , and otherwise no non 
support .  .

summary some problems explained 
keywords stupid programming 
x newsreader tin version 1.1 

a very kind soul has me this reply for the in  . 
since he is n't in the position to post this himself , he asked me to post 
it for him , but to leave his name out. so here it comes 

has quite a number of  . the one you mention is perhaps the most 
, but not the most dangerous. as far as i can determine , it has to 
do with the files that creates .  . gives the user no control 
over where it places its files it just places them in its 
current directory . the problem you mention occurs  ( as far as i can tell ) 
when it runs out of space for its files. it seems as if 
does n't check properly for this situation. as a , it seems 
to write out a file with all the data with 24 bit 
information. then , for 8 bit , it does the , again writing 
another file with the 8 bit information. while it is writing this 
second file , it also writes the data to your card .  . then when it does 
the last of 8 bit data , it all the data from the 8 bit file to 
your again.  ( it does this last operation for its 
fit to feature , even when this feature is not enabled . ) . 

the result of this process is the following 

1 ) if it runs out of space when writing the first 24 bit file , all 
you ever see is as much data as it has room for , and the last bit of 
data is simply repeated over and over again because never 
the has filled up and writes reads are n't performed .  . 

2 ) if it has enough room for the 24 bit data , but runs out of room for 
the 8 bit data , you see almost all of the picture as it does the 
and writes to the card .  . 
however , then when it the and the data 
from the 8 bit file to  ( for whatever reason it does this) 
one again just gets a repetition of the last of data for which 
there was room on the  . 

this is just a guess , but probably fairly accurate. at least the general 
idea is on track i think , although i have probably made errors in details 
about file i o etc. the way around this is of course to clear up sufficient 
space .  . the files for large 's  ( 1200x900 and bigger ) can be 
very large (3 1 ) .  . on some of the largest i have needed in excess 
of 6 free space .  . 


has a much more serious bug if you are trying to display a file from 
a , and you change while has some file open on the 
, then in certain circumstances will write the directory  ( and fat 
table i ca n't remember ) for the removed onto the inserted 
, thus the new in a very serious , possibly 
way. so be careful ! it is incredibly poor programming for a 
program to do this. on the other hand , when choosing files in the open files 
, insists on doing a few reads every time one the 
hi square .  . incredibly when it could do them all at once 
when it gets the directory info .  . and really , how much effort does it take to 
sort a directory listing 


with much thanks to the originator of this article.

 ( extended terminal interface ) , now in it 's 2nd edition .  . it is 
isbn 0 13 7. 

paraphrased from the outside back cover 

is a high level programming tool for creating , forms , 
and text  . is a set of library 
that promote fast development of application programs 
for , , , and form  . 

the is a shell which reads ascii text files and produces 
for data entry and  . it consists of a 
shell like environment of the program and it 's 
files. it is section in the unix press manual .  . 

the are , part of the manual section , provide 
support for a capability on an ordinary ascii terminal 
with built on top of the library.

boy , this will be if it is trivial or an faq 

given 4 points  ( non coplanar ) , how does one find the , that is , 
center and , exactly fitting those points i know how to do it 
for a circle  ( from 3 points ) , but do not immediately see a 
straightforward way to do it in 3 d. i have checked some 
geometry books , , and , but am still at a loss 
please have mercy on me and provide the solution 

it 's not a bad question i do n't have any that list this 
either. but thinking about it a bit , it should n't be too hard. 

1 ) take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as 
the circle that they lie on  ( you say you have this already ) 

2 ) find the center of this circle .  . the line passing through this center 
to the plane of the three points passes through the center of 
the  . 

3) repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. this 
gives you two different lines that both pass through the 's 
origin .  . their is the center of the  . 

4 ) the is easy to , it 's just the distance from the center to 
any of the original points. 

i 'll leave the math to you , but this is a workable  . ) 

good i had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case 
with no solution that worried me. 

four points in the shape of a square have no unique 
that they are on the surface of. 
similarly 4 point have no finite that they are on the 
surface of. 

these being geometrical designed rather than design 
meet these problems  . 

when determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are 
the should or return infinite r. 
when the two lines there are 2 possibilities 
they are the same line  ( the 4 points were on a circle ) 
they are different lines but parallel .  . there is a of in  . 

this last case can be achieved with 3 points and any 4th point 
by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced 

it can also be achieved by 

if all 4 points are but are not on one circle .  . 

it seems to me that the only fails when the 4 points are  . 
the always fails when the points are  . 
 ( 4 points being coplanar ) 

if the 4th point is when the plane of the first 3 points 
has been found is trivial .  . 


an alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed 
by the of each line segment pair also contains the 
center of the  . three pairs will form three , 
at a point. this might be easier to implement .  .

ken 



here at lewis and clark college we have recently a digital film 
system  ( based on the mac quadra ) that does non , full digital editing .  . 

if you 're considering such a system , here are the pros and cons 

for the environment , this system is excellent .  . we use it to 
produce a variety of materials for on our local 
network. because this programming is going to be viewed on other , the 
image quality is not as important as the ability to directly the 
video to the net. 

we also use it to produce and video programs for 
use by the lewis clark community. since these programs are not meant for 
or use , image quality is not critical .  . 

the digital film system , for those of you who are , is an a b roll 
system on one card .  . it was as 
an editing system with quality .  . , the 
of the card , is trying to achieve this quality level , but as yet , has been 
unable to deliver .  . our system produces near quality at 30 fields per 
second  ( 640x480  . the card repeats every other field to get 60 
fields per second .  . this results in a kind of super 8 film look that some 
find  . 

if you can get past this problem , you 'll find the editing 
software quite with which to work. it produces thousands of 
different effects from to to color  . 

because of its non nature , editing is fast and easy .  . if you 've ever 
used  ( or seen used ) an or system , you 'll recognize the 
and the user interface .  . 

the total system with  ( 40megs of ram ) , 1 drive , 21 apple mon 
, panasonic edit , gear  ( cassette , , , , etc ) , 
, digital film card will set you back about 20 , 000 .  . 

for you video and girls , this system will not output at a quality 
that will most of your  . even though you can perform more 
effects than a can imagine , an based off line based system 
will look better. 

we use both and for our video work. each for what each does best !

sorry i missed you raymond , i was just out in last month .  .  .  . 

i'm the virtual reality market for silicon , so perhaps i 
can help a little. 

in article , 
wo . navy .  ( raymond chui ) writes 
, the real reality. our agency started to express interest in 
virtual  . so far , we do not know much about  . all we 
know about are the hollywood the 2 and 
man . we also know something about from abc news magazine and 
computer world magazine .  . 


unfortunately , while sgi systems were used to create the special effects 
for both 2 and man , those are film quality computer 
, in software and written to film a frame at a time. each 
frame of computer for those films took hours to render on 
high end parallel computer systems. thus , that level of 
would be difficult , if not impossible , to in real time  ( 30 
per  . 



we certainly want to know more about  . who are the 
, 
, universities what machines support (i . e .  . sgi , , 
, 6000 , etc . ) . 


it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is. 
true  ( vr ) , requires the of complex 
at anywhere from 20 to 60 per second .  . this 
is a similar requirement to that of traditional for 
training .  . if the frame rate is too low , the user the of 
the as they move their head rapidly around the , so the motion 
of the is not and  . thus the system 
must be powerful enough to high frame while complex 
data representations .  . 

, the frame rate must be constant .  . if the system 15 
per second at one point , then 60 per second the next  ( perhaps 
due to the in the new direction being simpler than what was 
before ) , the user can get by the medium  ( the 
computer ) rather than focusing on the data .  . to maintain a constant 
frame rate , the system must be able to run in real time. unix in general 
does not support real time operation , but silicon has modified the 
unix for its processor systems to be able to support real time 
operation , the usual unix process priority  . 
systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real time 
operation  ( not sun , not 700 series systems , not ibm rs 6000 , not 
even sgi 's systems like or  . only our 
and challenge systems support real time operation due 
to their  ( smp ) shared memory  . 

from a perspective , complex virtual 
requires advanced techniques like mapping and real time 
anti  . of all of the general purpose systems 
on the market today , only and 
systems fully support these capabilities .  . the anti is particularly 
important , as the edges of is an 
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment. 


what kind of are used with 
 ( gl , , , , , etc . ) . 

you can use the general purpose listed above to develop 
applications , but that is starting at a pretty low level. there are

another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets 
of 3 points , and the from there. this would also define 
the circle center .  . however , small would make the 
lines not  . supposedly 3 have to in a unique 
point if they are not parallel .  . 


having thought about this , why do n't you project the 2 lines onto the 
plane formed by the lines. do an in the plane in 
, where you 're guaranteed a unique solution  ( unless they 're parallel which 
wo n't happen in this case ) , and then use distance along the lines 
from the circle to determine the exact point of interest .  . this 
the error propogation required to do the in 3d .  . 

hope i have n't put my foot in it again !

the is a rather straightforward implementation of the 1 .

use a non separated direct multiply accumulate 
 ( sounds great , does n't it ) , which turned out to be than a  fast  
in this  ( quite common ) case. is pretty standard. main 
difference to the berkeley  ( except for the number of supported 
algorithms ) is the use of 256 instead of 128 , the  ( default ) option to 
use a restricted color space and the implementation of a color saturation 
dominant ordered  . this leads to a superior quality of 
the image (i claim , judge  . 

restricted color space means that the u and v components are to 
0 . 25 .  ( instead of 0 . and the display color space points are 
over this restricted space .  . since the distance between color space points 
is thus reduced by a factor of two , the color resolution is at the 
expense of not being able to represent fully  . 

saturation dominant ordered is a method by which a color , lying 
somewhere between the points of the display color space , is 
by primarily alternating between two points of constant instead of 
constant saturation .  . this better quality due to the 
lower of the human system to saturation changes than 
to changes  ( the same reasoning as used by the tv standard to improve 
on  . the improvement is particularly in dark brown or 
areas .  .

what i am about is the fact that we were led to believe that 
we would be able to to a version of the 
without the assistance of a lift  . 

it should have been made fairly clear that the most would 
ever get was a 150  ( 75 old style )  . certainly this 
was mentioned on sys . sgi . on more than one as being 
likely. if our sales folks were saying otherwise , they were either 
confused , or less than honest ethical , or somebody further up the 
inside sgi was them. 

i'm also about being sold several personal at a 
previous site on the understanding that would be around 
for a while , rather than being  . 

there were 4 versions  ( 20 , 25 , 30 , 35 ) , although admittedly the 30 came 
out at the same time as the 35 , over a period of 2 1 2 years. the 
simply could n't be pushed any further. i 'd say 4 years was 
a pretty good , myself , for a system design in this day and 
age. getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray in both the 
hardware and product design groups we would have been out of our 
minds to push it further , and i know that was made clear , almost 
from the day the 35 started  . we had one last in 
the form of the , which made 3 versions over 
its , which i also think is pretty good. 

now i understand that sgi is responsible to its and has to 
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line  ( odd that i found myself 
on at least two to get the business on the books 
just before the end of the quarter ) , but i'm just a little tired of 
getting in the process. 

please , by all means send a complaint letter through sgi support 
or sales on your concerns .  . there should be no reason for sales folks 
to misrepresent future to  ( sure , sometimes there 
will be confusion for a while , over whether an will be available , 
but that should n't last too long , and does n't seem to be what you 
are referring to) .  . 

yes , the sales folks do get 's at the end of some  ( all ) , 
but that is pretty common industry wide , and sometimes that can result 
in good deals for  ( sometimes it probably folks into 
systems that are n't what they need , i'm sure , but nobody is forcing 
you to buy at end of , after all .  .  . ) . 

maybe it 's because my lab buys in and , so we 
are n't entitled to a under the covers as the big kids  ( nasa , 
for instance ) are. this lab , and i suspect that a lot of other labs 

they do n't get all that long a lead time either although certainly 
they get on possible new products , and their opinions 
may well influence the end product , but that also is life in the 
industry .  . we ca n't design systems that meet just their needs , or we 
wo n't sell too many systems , after all  ( which is not to say that we 
do n't have some products , like reality  . 

and organizations , does n't have a load of money to spend on computers 
every year , so we ca n't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. 
the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the 
entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond .  . that 
means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i 
have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one 
previous poster 's words ,  to fill a  to with some other 
 . i'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. 
and every time i look at it , i'm going to think about sgi and how i 
could have better spent my money  ( actually your money , since we 're 
supported almost entirely by federal tax  . 

but surely you do n't expect a system you buy now for a five year 
period to be constantly over that entire five year 
period that 's a rather unreasonable expectation , in my experience 
 ( with workstations  . supported , and parts available , 
yes , but certainly not to the latest and greatest ! 

now you 'll have to pardon me while i go off and and in a 
corner somewhere and think dark , thoughts. 

i missed your first posting , but as i say , by all means share your 
with somebody at a level inside sgi where it might 
have an effect  ( not immediate , i'm sure , but are n't 
going to be ignored , and may affect future plans , if we 
hear similar things from more than one person  . 

all of the above is , as usual , my personal opinion , not sgi 's .  .

all the group routines that you can buy separate from the 3d 
require the use of 2 . 01 . or 2 .  . they are too slow with 2 . 00 .  .

if you want your image to be 4 wide , use 
scale 100 4 
prevents the image from being  ( if it is than it 
is high ) 
4 the paper  ( not the image see below) 
scale 100 is used because if the image is small , it may fit within a 
less than 4 , and will thus be printed smaller than 4 wide. 
if you first scale it up a lot , it will certainly not fit in 4 , and 
will be down by automatically to fit the 
paper  . 
in short will scale an image down to fit the paper size , 
but it will not blow it up automatically .  .

1 what is 

 ( pronounced ) is a image mechanism .  . 
stands for group , the original name of the 
that wrote the standard. is designed for either 
full color or gray scale digital images of natural , real world  . 
it does not work so well on non images , such as or line 
 . 

does not handle black and white  ( 1 bit per pixel ) images , nor does it 
handle motion picture  . standards for those types 
of images are being worked on by other , named and 
respectively .  . 

is , meaning that the image you get out of is n't 
quite identical to what you originally put in. the much 
of its by known of the human eye , notably 
the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details 
of light and dark .  . thus , is intended for images that will 
be looked at by humans. if you plan to machine analyze your images , the 
small errors introduced by may be a problem for you , even if they are 
invisible to the eye. 

a useful property of is that the degree of can be by 
 . this means that the image can trade 
off file size against output image quality .  . you can make extremely small 
files if you do n't mind poor quality this is useful for image 
archives , making views or , etc. etc. conversely , if you 
are n't happy with the output quality at the default setting , you 
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser  . 


2 why use 

there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller , and to 
24 bit per color data instead of 8 bit per data .  . 

making image files smaller is a big win for files across 
and for of images .  . being able to a 
2 full color file down to 100 or so makes a big difference in 
space and time !  ( if you are comparing and , the 
size ratio is more like four to one. more details below . ) . 

if your software does n't support directly , you 'll have to 
convert to some other format for or images .  . even 
with a capable , it takes longer to and view a image 
than to view an image of a simpler format  ( gif , for  . thus , using 
is essentially a time space you give up some time in order to 
or an image more  . 

it 's worth that when network or phone is involved , the 
time savings from a file can be much greater than the 
extra time to the file. i 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself. 

the other reason why will gradually replace as a standard usenet 
posting format is that can full color information 24 bits 
 ( 16 million colors ) instead of 8 or less  ( 256 or  . if you have 
only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage 
to you. within a couple of years , though , 8 bit will look as as 
black and white format does today. furthermore , for reasons detailed 
in section 7 , is far more useful than for images among 
people with widely color display hardware .  . hence is 
more appropriate than for use as a usenet posting standard. 


3 when should i use , and when should i stick with 

is not going to entirely for some types of images , 
is superior in image quality , file size , or both. one of the first 
things to learn about is which kinds of images to apply it to. 

as a rule of , is superior to for full color or 
gray scale images of that means and 
similar material. is superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display 
hardware , and it is a lot superior if you do.  ( see section 7 for details . ) . 

does better on images with only a few distinct , 
such as and line  . in particular , large areas of 
that are all exactly the same color are very indeed 
by  . ca n't these files as much as does without 
introducing  . this sort of image is best kept in form. 
 ( in particular , single color borders are quite cheap in files , but they 
should be avoided in files . ) . 

also has a hard time with very edges a row of pure black 
to a row of pure white , for example. edges tend to 
come out unless you use a very high quality setting .  . again , this 
sort of thing is not found in , but it shows up fairly 
often in files borders , text , etc. the is 
particularly with text that 's only a few high. 
if you have a with a lot of small size text , do n't it. 

computer drawn images  ( ray , for instance ) usually fall between 
images and in terms of complexity .  . the more complex and 
subtly the image , the more likely that will do well on it. 
the same goes for semi  ( fantasy and  . 

plain black and white  ( two level ) images should never be converted to  . 
you need at least about 16 gray levels before is useful for gray scale 
images .  . it should also be noted that is for gray scale images 
of up to 256 levels , while is not. 

if you have an existing library of images , you may wonder whether you 
should convert them to  . you will lose a little image quality if you do. 
 ( section 7 , which argues that image quality is superior to , only 
applies if both start from a full color original .  . if you start from 
a , you 've already lost a great deal of information 
can only make things worse . ) . however , the space savings may justify 
converting anyway. this is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself. 
if you do convert a library to , see section 14 for hints .  . be 
prepared to leave some images in format , since some will not 
convert well. 


4 how well does images 

pretty well. here are some file sizes for an image i have 
, a full color image of a in a harbor .  . the first three 
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free 
software described in section  . 

file size in comments 

original file in format  ( no 24 bits 
or 3 per , plus a few overhead ) 
z . file passed through unix 
does n't a lot , you 'll note. 
other text oriented give similar results. 
converted to with 256 
most of the savings is the result of color 
info saves 8 bits , not 24 .  .  ( see  . 7 . ) . 

q  ( highest useful quality setting ) 
this is from the 24 bit original , 
at least to my  . 
q 75  ( default setting ) 
you have to look mighty close to distinguish this 
from the original , even with both on at once. 
q 50 
this has slight if you know what to look 
for , you could tell it 's been without seeing 
the original .  . still as good image quality as many 
recent postings in usenet pictures groups. 
q 25 
's characteristic becomes apparent 
at this setting  ( djpeg helps  . 
still , i 've seen plenty of usenet postings that were 
of poorer image quality than this. 
q 5 ( cuts table overhead ) 
, but perfectly for or 
purposes. note that this file is tiny 
the ratio from the original is 1 ! 

in this case can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller 
than a of comparable quality  ( the q 75 file is every bit as good as the 
, better if you have a full color  . this seems to be a typical 
ratio for real world  . 


5 what are good quality for 

most let you pick a file size vs. image quality by 
a quality setting .  . there seems to be widespread confusion about 
the meaning of these  . quality does not mean keep of the 
information , as some have claimed .  . the quality scale is purely arbitrary 
it 's not a percentage of anything. 

the name of the game in using is to pick the lowest quality setting 
 ( smallest file size ) that into an image from 
the original .  . this setting will vary from one image to another and from one 
observer to another , but here are some rules of  . 

the default quality setting ( q 75 ) is very often the best choice. this 
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see in a 
typical image. try q 75 first if you see , then go up. except for 
experimental purposes , never go above q saying q 100 will produce a 
file two or three times as large as q , but of hardly any better quality .  . 

if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to 
go down to q 50 without  . on the other hand , you 
might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further  . 
the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting to  . 
the default q 75 is about right for 24 bit images , but q 85 to 
is usually better for converting  ( see section 14 for more  . 

if you want a very small file  ( say for or purposes ) and are 
prepared to tolerate large , a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is 
about right. q 2 or so may be amusing as art . 

 ( note the quality discussed in this article apply to the free 
software described in section , and to many programs based on it. other 
, such as image , may use a completely different 
quality scale. some programs do n't even provide a scale , just 
high medium low style choices . ) . 


6 where can i get software 

most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp .  . 
if you do n't know how to use ftp , see the faq article how to find sources . 
 ( if you do n't have direct access to ftp , read about in the 
same article . ) . that article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can 
get it by sending e mail to mail with 
send usenet news.answers finding sources in the body. the anonymous ftp 
list faq may also be helpful it 's usenet news.answers ftp list faq in 
the news.answers archive .  . 

note this list changes constantly .  . if you have a copy more than a couple 
months old , get the latest faq from the news.answers archive .  . 


if you are looking for software , , etc 

the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one 
kind of system. if you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out 
the software described at the end of the list. note that this 
list on free and programs that you can obtain over 
internet but some programs are listed too.

also available from mit . edu . , file z .  . 
this handles many image and conversion  . the 
handles 24 bit correctly for

basic free software .  . 

both of the above are large , complex  . if you just want a simple 
image , try or  . supports in its latest

release will fix this . ) . is also free and available from 
mit . edu . , file 1 . 14 . z .  . both programs are said 
to do the right thing with 24 bit  . 


dos 

this covers plain dos for or 2 programs , see the next headings .  . 

one good choice is eric 's free , which views and files. 
the current version , 2 . , is available by ftp from ca . 
50 . , file pub zip .  . this is a good basic 
that works on either or machines .  . the user interface is 
not , but it 's functional .  . 

another is mohammad 's  . the 
current version , 1.2 , is available from and sites  ( see note 
below) , file zip .  . requires a or better 
and a compatible memory  ( qemm386 and work and 
2 do  . is currently the for images that are no 
bigger than your screen. for larger images , it the image down to fit 
on the  ( rather than using as most  . 
you may or may not prefer this approach , but there 's no denying that it 
down of large images  . note is a 
bit tricky read the carefully ! 

a alternative is for dos (  . this is easier to 
than either of the two alternatives .  . its user interface is 
also much looking , although personally i find it harder to use 
more , inconsistent behavior. it is than but a 
little than , at least on my hardware .  .  ( for images larger than 
size , and seem to be about the same speed , and both 
are than ) . the current version is 2 . 1 . , available from 
and sites  ( see note below) , file zip .  . 
requires a if you do n't have one , look in zip . 
or zip . from the same directory .  .  ( many recent have a built in 
, so do n't try to load a unless complains 
that the is missing . ) . 

a second alternative is , which has been kicking around 
the net for a while , but i do n't know any stable archive for it. 
the current  ( rather old ) version is inferior to the above anyway. 
the author tells me that a new version of will be out shortly 
and it will be to the archives at that time. 

the well known  ( cshow ) supports in its latest 
revision , 8 .  . however , 's implementation is n't very good 
it 's slow  ( about half the speed of the above viewers ) and image quality is 
poor except on hi color  . too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a 
good capability in  . , 25 .  . available from and 
sites  ( see note below) , file zip .  . 

due to the remarkable variety of pc hardware , any one of these 
might not work on your particular machine .  . if you ca n't get any 
of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs 
to convert to , then view with your favorite  .  ( if you 
have hi color hardware , do n't use as the format try to 
find a capable instead. 0 . is to do the right 
thing with hi color ) . 

the independent group 's free are from 
and sites  ( see note below) , file zip .  ( or 
zip . if you have a and extended  . these files are dos 
of the free source code described in section they will 
convert to and from , , and  . 

software free conversion tools ,  . 
these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from format in 
particular , you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a  . the major 
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write 's 
format as well as the usenet standard format .  . since format 
files are rather widespread on , this is a useful capability .  . version 
2.0 of these tools is free  ( prior versions were  . get it from

formats ) to and from many other image  . it can also display images .  .

mac users should keep in mind that 's format , , is 
not the same as the usenet standard format .  .  ( see section 10 for

most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format .  . 

the first choice is probably , a free program for images

info mac art 232 .  . requires system 6 . 0 . 5 . or later. 
is not better than as a plain , but 
it has much more extensive image and format conversion 
capabilities , so you may find it worth its fee if you do a lot of 
playing around with images .  . also , the version of can 
load and save images without , so it is your best bet if 
your machine is too old to run  .  ( but it 's with ) .

and it has a relatively user interface .  . worse , is an

this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but 
it will run without system 7 or , so you may be forced to use it on 
older systems.  ( it does need 32 bit , so really old machines ca n't

7 what 's all this hoopla about color 

most people do n't have full color  ( 24 bit per pixel ) display hardware .  . 
typical display hardware stores 8 or bits per , so it can display 
256 or distinct at a time. to display a full color image , the 
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative 
 . this process is called color .  ( this is something 
of a misnomer , color selection would be a better term .  . we 're stuck with 
the standard usage though . ) . 

clearly , color is a process. it turns out that for most 
images , the details of the color have much more impact 
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by  ( except at 
the very lowest quality  . 

since is a full color format , converting a color image for display 
on 8 bit or less hardware requires color  . this is true for 
all color even if you feed a 256 or less color into , what 
comes out of the is not 256 , but thousands of  . 
this happens because 's each a little 
differently , so two that started with identical will probably 
come out with slightly different  . each original color gets 
into a group of nearby  . therefore is always required to 
display a color on a display , regardless of the image 
source. the only way to avoid is to ask for gray scale output .  . 

 ( incidentally , because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about 
the number of used by a image. even if you attempted to count 
the number of distinct values , different would give you 
different results because of error differences .  . i see 
posted images described as 256 color . this tells me that the poster 
 ( a ) has n't read this faq and  ( b ) probably converted the from a  . 
can be classified as color or gray scale  ( just like photographs ) , but 
number of just is n't a useful concept for ) . 

on the other hand , a image by definition has already been to 
256 or  . (a does have a definite number of in its 
, and the format does n't allow more than 256 ) . 
for purposes of usenet picture distribution , has the advantage that the 
sender the color , so do n't have to. 
this is also the of you 're stuck with the sender 's 
 . if the sender to a different number of than 
what you can display , you have to re , resulting in much poorer 
image quality than if you had once from a full color image. 
furthermore , if the sender did n't use a high quality color 
, you 're out of luck. 

for this reason , the promise of better image quality 
for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware .  . 
's full color image can be to precisely match the user 's display 
hardware .  . furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future 
in  ( there is a lot of active research in 
this area ) , or better display hardware , to get a better view of 
images you already have. with a , you 're stuck with what was 
sent .  . 

it 's also worth mentioning that many programs include rather 
routines .  . if you view a 256 color on a 16 color 
display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you 
need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color 
 ( one to create the , one to display it) , but often it 's 
also due to  . conversion programs will be forced to use 
high quality in order to get acceptable results at all , and in 
normal use they will directly to the number of to be 
 . thus , is likely to provide better results than the average 
program for low color resolution as well as high resolution ones ! 

finally , an ever growing number of people have better than 8 bit display 
hardware already 15 bit hi color pc , true 24 bit on 
workstations and , etc. for these people , is already 
, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their 
display .  . images can drive these much more effectively .  . 
thus , is an all around better choice than for images 
in a machine independent fashion .  . 


8 how does work 

the words to know are , discrete 
, , and or arithmetic entropy 
coding .  . this article 's long enough already , so i'm not going to say more 
than that here. for technical information , see the faq .  . 
this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files 
pub usenet news.answers faq part 1 3 . if you need help in 
using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article. 


9 what about 

there 's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the did 
define a truly , i.e. , one that the 
final output is bit for bit identical to the original input. however , this 
mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , 
, and it much less  . at present , very few 
of exist , and all of them are  . 

saying q 100 to the free software does not get you a image. 
what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the 
step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the 
color step.  ( with the free code , you can also say 
to turn off  . keep in mind that many 
cannot with the resulting file . ) . 

even with both and turned off , the regular 
is not , because it is subject to errors in 
various calculations .  . the error is a few in any one 
value it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye , 
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine of an image. 

at this minimum loss setting , regular produces files that are perhaps 
half the size of an 24 bit per image. true 
provides roughly the same amount of , but it 
bit for bit accuracy .  . 

if you have an application requiring of images with less 
than 6 bits per  ( per color component ) , you may want to look into the 
image standard. this performs better than 
on such images .  . is superior to on images with 
6 or more bits per furthermore , is public domain  ( at least with a 
back end ) , while the techniques are covered by  . 


10 why all the argument about file 

strictly speaking , refers only to a family of 
it does not refer to a specific image file format .  . the was 
prevented from defining a file format by wars within the international 
standards organizations .  . 

since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on 
a common file format , this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of 
official standards , a number of program writers have just gone off to 
do their own thing , and as a result their programs are n't compatible with 
anybody else 's .  . 

the thing we have to a de facto standard format is some work 
that 's been by people at c cube  . they have defined 
two based file 
 ( jpeg file format ) , a low end format that 
and not much else. 
, aka 6 . 0 . , an extension of the format .  . is 
a high end format that will let you record just about everything you 
ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides ) .  . is 
a lot more complex than , and may well prove less , 
because different have historically implemented slightly different 
and incompatible of  . it 's not likely that adding to the 
mix will do anything to improve this situation. 
both of these were developed with from all the major 
of related products it 's reasonably likely that future 
products will to one or both standards. 

i believe that usenet should adopt as the replacement for in 
picture postings .  . is simpler than and is available now the 
6 . 0 . has only recently been , and it is still 
vague on some crucial details. even when is well 
defined , the format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common 
denominator files may never be as  . 

a particular case that people may be interested in is apple 's 
software for the  . uses a compatible format wrapped 
inside the mac specific structure .  . conversion between and 
is pretty straightforward , and several mac programs are 
available to do it  ( see mac portion of section  . if you have an editor 
that handles files , you can strip a down to 
by hand see section 11 for details. 

another particular case is software 's programs  ( gif2jpg and 
image  . these programs are capable of reading and writing 
format .  . by default , though , they write a format developed by 
 . this format is not by any non programs and should not be 
used for usenet postings .  . use the j switch to get output .  .  ( this 
applies to old versions of these programs the current 
format by default. you still should be careful not to post format 
files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc ) . 


11 how do i recognize which file format i have , and what do i do about it 

if you have an alleged file that your software wo n't read , it 's likely 
to be format or some other based format .  . you can tell 
what you have by the first few of the file 

1. a standard file will start with the characters  ( hex ) , 
followed by two  ( often 00 10 ) , followed by  . 

2. if you see at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a 
raw file. this is probably as is by software 
it 's worth a try , anyway. 

3. files start with  . you 're out of luck unless you have 
software .  . portions of the file may look like plain data , but they 
wo n't properly with non programs. 

4. a file , if , will have a couple hundred 
of followed by a  ( scan for  . strip off 
everything before the and you should be able to read it. 

5. anything else it 's a format , or not at all. if you are 
lucky , the file may consist of a and a raw data  . 
if you can identify the start of the data  ( look for d8 ) , 
try off everything before that. 

in usenet postings , the characteristic pattern is 

begin line 
m c x ... 

whereas files will start with 

begin line 
m ' i ... 

if you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of 
non files. 


12 what about arithmetic coding 

the defines two different back end for the final output 
of data either coding or arithmetic coding is allowed .  . 
the choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually 
produces a smaller file. on typical images , arithmetic coding 
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than coding .  .  ( all the 
file size numbers previously cited are for coding . ) . 

unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding by the 
standard is subject to owned by ibm , at t , and  . 
thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain 
from these  .  ( the fair use doctrine allows people to implement 
and test the , but actually any images with it is dubious 
at best . ) . 

at least in the short run , i recommend that people not worry about 
arithmetic coding the space savings is n't great enough to justify the 
potential legal hassles .  . in particular , arithmetic coding should not 
be used for any images to be on usenet .  . 

there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the 
future. stay for further details. 


13 does loss accumulate with repeated 

it would be nice if , having an image with , you could 
it , it  ( crop off a border , say ) , and it 
without any further image beyond what you lost initially .  . 
unfortunately this is not the case. in general , an altered 
image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the 
first time around. 

the next best thing would be that if you an image and 
it without changing it then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an 
identical file. even this is not true at least , not with the current 
free software .  . it 's essentially a problem of of 
error. if you repeatedly and , the image will eventually 
degrade to where you can see changes from the first generation 
output .  .  ( it usually takes many such to get change . ) . 
one of the things on our to do list is to see if of error can 
be avoided or limited , but i am not about it. 

in any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that 
the full color output of , at the original 
quality setting , would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes 
as cropping off a border could cause further error  . 
 ( if you 're wondering why , it 's because the block move. 
if you cropped off only of 16 , you might be safe , but 
that 's a mighty limited capability ! ) 

the bottom line is that is a useful format for and 
of images , but you do n't want to use it as an 
format for sequences of image steps .  . use a format 
 ( ppm , , , etc ) while working on the image , then it when you are 
ready to file it away. aside from avoiding , you will save a lot 
of time this way ) .  . 


14 what are some rules of for converting images to 

as stated earlier , you will lose some amount of image information if you 
convert an existing image to  . if you can obtain the original 
full color data the was made from , it 's far better to make a from 
that. but if you need to save space and have only the to work from , 
here are some suggestions for getting space savings with minimum 
loss of quality .  . 

the first rule when converting a library is to look at each , to 
make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the 
that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality 
setting if necessary. some may be better left as , as explained in 
section 3 in particular , cartoon type with or 
do n't convert well. you may find that a file of reasonable quality 
will be larger than the  .  ( so check the sizes too . ) . 

experience to date suggests that large , high quality are the best 
for conversion to  . they up the most so offer 
the most potential savings , and they convert to with least  . 
do n't waste your time converting any much under 100  . also , do n't 
expect files converted from to be as small as those created 
directly from full color originals .  . to maintain image quality you may have 
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through 
files would be (i . e .  . , shoot for 1 2 or 1 3rd the size of the file , 
not 1 4th as suggested in earlier  . 

many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color 
border around a image. while useless , this was nearly free in terms of 
cost in files. it is not free in files , and the 
border can create artifacts ( ghost  . do yourself 
a favor and off any border before  .  ( if you are on an x 
system , 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless 
way to do this . ) . 

's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full color , but 
for , q of 85 to often seem to be necessary to avoid 
image  .  ( if you apply as suggested below , the higher 
q setting may not be necessary . ) . 

color of or complex are usually to fool 
your eye into seeing more than the 256 that can actually  . 
if you the image , you will see that are often of 
different at normal size the eye these 
together to produce the illusion of an color value. the 
trouble with is that , to , it looks like high 
color and ca n't very well. the resulting 
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have 
gotten from the original full color image  ( if you had it) .  . 
to get around this , you want to the image before  . 
together nearby , thus the color that 
you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the 
color changes that give trouble .  . appropriate use of will 
often let you avoid using a high q factor , thus further reducing the size of 
the file , while still obtaining a better looking output image 
than you 'd get without  . 

with the free software  ( or products based on it) , a simple 
capability is built in. try 10 or so when converting  . 
values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality  . heavy handed 
may require larger factors .  .  ( if you can see regular 
fine scale patterns on the image even without , then strong 
is definitely called for . ) . too large a factor will 
the output image , which you do n't want. if you are an image 
, you can also do with a separate filtering program , such as 
from the  . however , 's built in is 
a lot than  .  .  . 

the of all this is that quality 85 10 is probably a 
good starting point for converting  . but if you really care about the 
image , you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other  .

let 's say you have a image of a line drawing in this case a 
, but it could be anything. on the drawing you have a set of 
reference points whose true x , y positions are known. 

now you the drawing  ( in this case , using 
's excellent  . that is , you use a program which 
converts positions to x , y and saves those values when you click 
the  . 

upon you notice that the reference point values that come 
out of the process differ in small but significant ways 
from the known true values .  . this is understandable because the 
drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are 
sources of such as and 
of paper , errors introduced in the printing process , 
errors and what have you. 

the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing , so 
such as over x or y , or 
the whole drawing , are not  . 

so the question is does any kind soul know of an for 
removing such in particular , if i have three sets of 
points 

 ( reference(x , y )  ( the known true values ) 

 ( distortedreference(x , y )  ( the same points , with known errors ) 

 ( distorteddata(x , y )  ( other points , with unknown errors ) 

what function of reference and could i apply to 
to remove the errors. 

i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the 
reference points as resulting from the of a 3d 
surface , for the surface and then it to remove 
the errors in the other data points. 

any kind and informed soul out there have any ideas , or better yet , 
to of the same or similar problems

i think one  ( not ideal ) solution is to use the

included in the draw s w pack .  . it can convert 
to art format .  . these can then be 
into a drawing rather than the  . 
result the file is completely in format and 
can be ed no problem ! 

but the slight problem with this , which makes the 
solution less than idea , is that the trace utility 
out many more points than are necessary to 
define the shapes being  . straight lines and 
are both as many short  . 

so .  .  .  . the taking much longer to

the obvious solution is time

for a circle  ( from 3 points ) , but do not immediately see a

please have mercy on me and provide the solution 

it 's not a bad question i do n't have any that list this

1 ) take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as 
the circle that they lie on  ( you say you have this already ) 

2 ) find the center of this circle .  . the line passing through this center 
to the plane of the three points passes through the center of 
the  . 

3) repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. this 
gives you two different lines that both pass through the 's 
origin .  . their is the center of the  . 

4 ) the is easy to , it 's just the distance from the center to 
any of the original points. 

i 'll leave the math to you , but this is a workable  . ) 


an alternate method would be to take pairs of points the plane formed 
by the of each line segment pair also contains the 
center of the  . three pairs will form three , 
at a point. this might be easier to implement .  .

can you please offer some 

it 's really not that hard to do. there are books out there which explain 
everything , and the basic 3d functions , translation , , , and 
hidden line removal are pretty easy .  . i wrote a program in a few weeks 
he help of a book , and would be happy to give you my source. 

i think he wanted to avoid the wheel .  . 

yes , i want to concentrate on other development issues i 've created 
before , it 's too time  .  .  . life 's too short ! 

also , has a lot of 3d functions built in , and think pascal 
can access them , and i would expect that think c could as well. if you can 
find out how to use the library , it would be an excellent 
choice , since it has a lot of stuff , and is built into the mac , so should be 
fast .  . 

just to clarify , the 3d routines that are mentioned in various places 
on the mac are in a , not the of the mac .  . a few years ago before 
i knew anything about , i came across a of the 
apple library and it actually did a lot. however , it is quite 
limited in the sense that it 's a low level 3d library your code still has 
to plot individual points , draw each line , etc ad nauseum .  . it has nothing 
on , for example , where you can handle objects .  . 

thanks for the clarification .  .  .  . before posting my original request i had looked 
into the mac 's 3d capabilities and dismissed them as low grade .  .

hi there , 

i 've made a mode library available via ftp .  . i originally 
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself , but perhaps someone 
here will find them useful. they are certainly as they are , but 
are missing some higher level  . they 're intended more as an 
intro to mode programming , a starting point. 

the library assumes a processor , but it is trivial to it 
for a  . if enough people ask , i 'll make the and re post it as a 
different version. 

the routines are written in assembly  ( tasm ) and are from c. they 
are fairly simple , but i 've found them to be very fast  ( for my purposes , 
 . routines are included to enter and mode , define a 
virtual , put and get , put a  ( rectangular image with 
no spots ) , put a  ( image with see thru areas ) , copy 
areas of the virtual into video memory , etc. i 've also included a 
simple c to draw a line , as well as a c to load a 256 
color image into a  . i also wrote a quick n  ( 'dirty(tm ) program 
that a bunch of around behind three . 

the whole is available on ca . in pub dos zip . 
it is with 2 . 

it is completely in the public domain , as far as i'm concerned. do with 
it whatever you like. however , it 'd be nice to get credit where it 's due , 
and maybe an e mail telling me you like it  ( if you do n't like it do n't bother )

subject re sgi sales practices  ( was  ( was announcement  ) 
organization silicon , inc. 
lines 123 
nntp posting host sgi . com . 

my 
comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other 

that supported , rather than deal further with sgi .  . 

is a programming library and as such is a great , 
interface for the development of interactive 3d applications .  . it 
is not , however , an of , as that will vary strongly 
from machine to machine and to  . sgi is committed to high 
interactive systems and software tools , so 
means that you can easily from sgi to other , there is no 
that your would be comparable .  . 


what i am about is the fact that we were led to believe that 
we would be able to to a version of the 
without the assistance of a lift  . 

if your sales representative truly you , then you should have a 
valid against us which you should carry up to your local sgi 
sales team .  . feel free to contact the local branch  .  . we . 
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied , so give it a 
shot .  . 


i'm also about being sold several personal at a 
previous site on the understanding that would be around 
for a while , rather than being  . 

as one of the previous posts stated , the personal was introduced in 
1988 and grew to include the 20 , 25 , 30 and 35 as 
up over time. as a rule of , sgi live for about 4 5 
years. this was true of the motorola based 3000 series  ( '85 '89 ) , the 
 ( '88 '93 ) , the series  ( the early 's  86 '90 ) , the power 
series parallel systems  ( '88  . individual running at a 
particular rate usually live for about 2 years. new 
at the high end  ( gt , , realityengine ) are released every 
18 months to 2 years. 

these are the facts of life. if we look at these machines , they become 
almost after four years , and we have to come out with a new 
 ( like , , challenge ) which has higher , 
, and i o , and larger  . if we 
do n't , we become  . 

from the user perspective , you have to buy a machine that your 
current needs and makes economic sense today. you ca n't wait to buy , but 
if you need a guaranteed path for the machine , ask the sales 
for one in writing. if it 's , they should be able to do that. some 
of our have specific programs associated with them , such as 
the protection program for older based power series 
systems which allowed of those systems to obtain 
a guaranteed price for moving to the new or challenge 
based 64 bit systems. 


now i understand that sgi is responsible to its and has to 
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line  ( odd that i found myself 
on at least two to get the business on the books 
just before the end of the quarter ) , but i'm just a little tired of 
getting in the process. 


if that 's happening , it 's of or 
mis , not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our 
customer base .  . 

maybe it 's because my lab buys in and , so we 
are n't entitled to a under the covers as the big kids  ( nasa , 
for instance ) are. this lab , and i suspect that a lot of other labs 
and organizations , does n't have a load of money to spend on computers 
every year , so we ca n't be out buying new systems on a regular basis. 

most sgi are types , but regardless , we rarely give a 
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because 
again , like a previous post stated , if we pre and the 
slipped , we would mess up our potential  ( when they were 
counting on the of the new systems on a particular date ) and 
would also look awfully bad to both our and the financial 
who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our 
 . 

the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the 
entire grant period of five years and , in some case , beyond .  . that 
means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i 
have the money , not some product that was built , to paraphrase one 
previous poster 's words ,  to fill a  to with some other 
 . i'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years. 
and every time i look at it , i'm going to think about sgi and how i 
could have better spent my money  ( actually your money , since we 're 
supported almost entirely by federal tax  . 


five years is an awfully long time in computer years. new processor 
are arriving every 1 2 years , making a 5 year old computer at 
least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. the nature 
of the market is demanding that rate of development , so if your is 
really 5 years between , you have to accept the limited 
of whatever you buy into from any  . 

there are some realities about the computer that we all have to live 
with , but keeping happy is the most important , so do n't give up , 
we know it.

, the to which lawrence was referring in an 
earlier post is plain old 1 . 5 . with the video  . 
i 've seen video  ( some of apple 's early , to be 
precise ) running on a at about very nicely  ( 16 bit 
color  . i would expect that using the same , a risc 
processor should be able to approach full full motion , 
though as you 've implied , the processor will be more with highly 
material. 


, i do n't want to get into a  war  by what i am going to say , 
but i have to be a little bit skeptic about the you are 
claiming on the , you 'll see why  ( please , no flames , i reserve 
those for c . s . m . a . ) ) 

i was in chicago in the last consumer show , and apple had a 
there. i walked by , and they were showing real time video capture 
using a  ( radious or ) card to and make right on the

 . 

that is in fact the current version  ( it only came out in  . 

they a guy talking there in something. it played back quite 
nicely and in real time. the guy then expanded the  ( resized ) to by 
 ( 320 in y i think) and the frame rate enough to notice that it 
was n't  ( or about 30fps ) anymore. it dropped to like 15  . then he 
increased it just a bit more , and it dropped to 10 12  . 

then i asked him what mac he was using .  .  .  . he was using a  ( do n't know 
what model , ) to do it , and he was telling the guys there that the 
could play back at the same speed even on an  . 

well , i spoiled his claim so to say , since a mac was having 
a little bit of trouble .  . and this was n't even from the ! this was 
from memory ! 

my test movie was created at 320 240 resolution , it was n't being up. 
was a very operation with the original 
the current version has for like 4 1  ( 160 120 320 240 ) , 
but even so , i'm prepared to believe that the is n't as good as 
with playing back an actual 320 240 movie .  . i have n't done any 
measurements for  .

the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the

i do n't , but on the other hand i do n't support the idea of having 
one newsgroup for every aspect of programming as proposed by brian , 
in his reply to my original posting. 
i would suggest a structure more like a programmer . ,

the reason for making as few groups as possible is for the same reason you 
say we should n't up , not to get to few postings every day. 
i takes to much time to through all postings just to find two or

i understand and agree when you say you want all aspects of in one 
meeting. i agree to some extension .  . i see news as a forum to exchange ideas , 
help others or to be helped. i think this is difficult to if there 
are so many different things in one meeting.

there is another useful method based on least of the equation  . 

the points  ( x , y , z ) on a surface with r and center (a , b , c ) can be written as 

 ( x a ) 2  ( y b ) 2  ( z c ) 2 r 2 

this equation can be into the following form 

r 2 a 2 b 2 c 2 x 2 y 2 z 2 

approximate the left hand part by  ( f(x , y , z ) x . x . z . 1 . 

for all , i . c .  . 4 , determine the 4  . which minimise the average error  ( f(x , y , z ) x 2 y 2 z 2 2.

our group recently bought a video and i could use some 
help with it. we bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data in 
addition to the usual video signal and (2) claimed to print 256 gray 
level images .  . however , the manual that came with it only describes how to 
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit images .  . after some initial 
problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a 
parallel of an workstation and i can print 1 and 4 
bit images just fine. i called the people and asked about the 
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video 
signal  . this was not mentioned in the sales literature .  . however they 
did say the can do 6 bit  ( 64 level ) images in parallel mode , but 
they did n't have any information about how to program it to do so , and they 
would call japan , etc. 

frankly , i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit images 
from the video source , it ca n't 8 bits in the memory. it 's not 
like memory is that expensive any more. if anybody has any information on 
getting 6 bit  ( or even 8 bit pixel ) images out of this thing , i would 
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

detailed description 


, , scientists , and share the 
problem of moving information from one mind to another. 
traditionally , they have used pictures , words , , 
music and dance to communicate imagery .  . however , expressing 
complex notions such as god and infinity or a seemingly well 
defined concept such as a can present challenges which far 
their technical skills. 

the explosive use of computers as and 
tools has this problem. in , and 
virtual reality systems vast of information confront the 
observer or participant .  . through a multitude of 
images and sounds in possibly 
, a user asks what does it all mean 

since image construction , , , and 
ultimate understanding are complex , strongly by 
, education and culture and , since electronic media 
each step , then we , as electronic 
, must determine the fundamental for 
imagery for understanding. 

therefore , the purpose of this conference is to bring together a 
of , including , but not limited to , the 
physical , biological and sciences , technology , art , 
psychology , philosophy , and education , in order to define and 
discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the

little and it seems that the points are in the order

does the format have a way of indicating which order the

some of the books that the faq contains .  . for ray , i would 
suggest 
an introduction to ray , andrew ) . , academic press

using his book. an list was posted in by eric

a lot of people are using with a called  . this was 
developed at the university of  ( boulder ) by some people working 
for  . you might try them if you already have 
or would be willing to buy it. it 's a few thousand dollars  ( american ) i 
expect for and the other should be free. those are the general 
purpose i 've heard of , besides what has .  . 
was written for imagery .  . i'm not sure how general purpose 
it is. you would have to contact or one of his people and ask. i 
have another piece of software  ( pcw ) that does pc and 
with and and limited image 
 ( you can an image using  . i 've 
used it on 70 megabyte images without problems , but for the best 
speed you need an external card .  . it will work without it , but large 
images take quite a while  ( 50 70 times as long) to process. that 's a 
if you want it 

my favorite is  ( interactive data language ) from research systems , 
inc. is in my opinion , much better and infinitely easier. its 
programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like. it 
handles the number very well , also. personally , i like doing 
the number with on the vax  ( or , , or even 
on the mac if it 's not too hairy ) , then bringing it over to 
image for the part. i have yet to any situation which 
that combination could n't handle , and the speed and of use 
 ( compared to iraf ) was incredible .  . by the way , it 's mostly 
image which i 've been doing. this means image , 
cleaning up bad lines , and some other traditional image 
routines .  . then , for example , taking a of 
versus position along a line i choose with the , then doing a curve 
fit to that line  ( which i might do like in ) . 

for call research systems , for wave call precision and 
for call university of @ boulder . from what i can 
understand , you can get programs from research systems , though

insight ii 

from inc. 



the program has been published in j. molecular 10 
 ( 1992 ) 33 .  . the program can analyze and display , discover , 
and  . the program contains also software for 
the generation of ,

grass 

 ( geographic resource analysis support system ) of the us army 
construction engineering research lab  . it is a popular and 
remote sensing image  . many may think of grass as a 
information system rather than an image , 
although it is reported to have significant image 
capabilities .  . 

feature descriptions 

i use grass because it 's public domain and can be obtained through the 
internet for free. grass runs in unix and is written in c. the source 
code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass 
 . you then the source code for your machine , using 
provided with grass .  . i would recommend grass for someone who 
already has a workstation and is on a limited  . grass is not very 
user friendly , compared to software .  . a first review of 
overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some 
functions not in other plus good general purpose 
image routines  . kelly maurice at corp .  . in 
boulder , co is a primary user of grass . this has used the 
grass software and developed  ( 238 )

interface .  . corp .  . currently has a contract to map part of 
and convert the data into  . you can call them 
at  ( 303 ) or email care of 90 . 

host requirements 

if you are willing to run a you could grass on a 
which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for 
data .  . grass is public domain , and can run on a high end pc 
under unix .  . it is based , has some image capability , 
and can display data  ( but analysis must be done in the 
 . i have used grass v . 3 . on a sun workstation and found it 
easy to use. it is best , of course , for data that are well represented 
in  ( grid cell ) form.

 ( based in alabama ) a wide range of 
software hardware .  . is a base that 
on top of. is basically an image with a 
heavy remote sensing flavor .  .

and reverse .  . high pass , low pass , , , 
generic .  . complex control. manages 
up to 64 images at a time user can extract single from a 3 
image or create color images by various individual , etc. 

the is designed for a remote sensing application  ( it can handle 
very large images ) and there is all kinds of other software available 
for applications .  . 
host requirements 

it runs on workstations (a unix machine similar to a sun ) 
though there were  ( there are always rumors ) that the software 
would be to pc and possibly a sun environment. 



a company called , inc. , out of hill , ontario , canada , makes 
an of software for , , and use of 
remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard 
, , , and a couple of others whose titles i 
forget .  . the software is available in versions for dos , unix 
workstations  ( among them , sun , and ibm ) , and vms , and quite possibly 
other by now. i use the vms version. 

the software consists of several classes groups of 
, by function but all operating on a common 
file. the i o is a set of utility 
programs which read from the various remote sensing industry 
into , or write those out from , the file 
this is the only i use or know much about. other can 
display data from the to one or another of several 
supported third party color , output or 
representation of image data to an attached , e.g. an type 
 . you might be more 
interested in the mathematical and 
analysis , , user (e . g .  . 
multiply channel 1 by 3 , add channel 2 , and as channel 5 ) , and 
god only knows what all else there 's a lot. i do n't have and do n't 
use these , so ca n't say much about them you only buy the your 
particular application interest calls for. 

each utility is controlled by from one to eight , read from 
a common file which must be  ( in vms anyway ) in your default 
directory .  . some will share and use the same 
for a different purpose , so it can get a bit confusing setting 
up a series of  . the standard environment contains a 
language very similar to ibm pc basic , but which allows you to 
the process of setting up for a common , complicated , 
lengthy or difficult series of utility executions .  .  ( in vms i can also 
invoke independently from a command procedure . ) . there 's 
also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled 
language programs which can interface with  ( read from write to) the 
data structures  ( database file ,  . 

the software is designed specifically for remote sensing images , but 
requires such a level of operator expertise that , once you reach the 
level where you can handle r s images , you can figure out ways to handle 
a few other things as well. for instance , the i o a 
utility for reading  ( what on the 
calls raw ) data from , in a number of different 
orders .  . this turns out to be ideal for the 
arts industry 's format , would probably (i have n't tried ) 
handle , and so on. above all , however , you have to know what 
you re doing or you can up to the degree and have to start 
over. it 's worth that the file is designed to 
contain not only  ( image ) data , but  ( for map 
information entered via table ) , land use , and all manner of 
other information (i observe that a remote sensing image often 
contains all manner of information about the , , 
, time , date , etc. of the original pass all of this 
can go into the ) .  . 

i believe that on workstations the built in display is used. on vax 
systems other than workstations supports only a couple of specific 
third party display systems  ( the name seems to come to 
 . one of my personal was a display program which would 
display directly from a file to a q (q 
24 bit directcolor ) display  . software could be 
in your case it seems designed for the very high end 
applications users , i.e. those for whom a mac pc largely does n't suffice 
 ( although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time) .  . it 's 
probably no coincidence that is in canada , a country which 
does a lot of its land resource via remote sensing i believe 
the canadian government uses software for some of its work in these 
areas .  . 

 ( spectral analysis manager ) 

back in 1985 jpl developed something called  ( spectral analysis 
manager ) which got a fair amount of use at the time. that was designed 
for imagery  ( byte data , 256 
across by lines by 256 bands ) a modified version has since 
been developed for  ( airborne and 
spectrometer ) which uses much larger images .  . 

does none of these things  ( rectification , , pc and 
, filtering , ,  . 
actually , it does limited filtering and 
 . is aimed at and  . 

the original uses x or to display .  . the version may 
require , an based on , and may also require a frame 
 . i can refer you to people if you 're interested .  . requires x 
for display .  .

can you please offer some 

it 's really not that hard to do. there are books out there which explain

hidden line removal are pretty easy .  . i wrote a program in a few weeks

also , has a lot of 3d functions built in , and think pascal 
can access them , and i would expect that think c could as well. if you can 
find out how to use the library , it would be an excellent 
choice , since it has a lot of stuff , and is built into the mac , so should be 
fast .  . 

just to clarify , the 3d routines that are mentioned in various places 
on the mac are in a , not the of the mac .  . a few years ago before 
i knew anything about , i came across a of the 
apple library and it actually did a lot. however , it is quite 
limited in the sense that it 's a low level 3d library your code still has 
to plot individual points , draw each line , etc ad nauseum .  . it has nothing 
on , for example , where you can handle objects .  . 

other things to consider when talking about apple 's old 3d library 

never was and no plans exist to do so in the future 

unless you call files documentation .  .  .  . 

if one knows something about , you could probably figure it out , 
but i 'd assume there 's better software available that gives better 
output and is , at the same time , (i . e .  . easier to

how do you contribute 

what happens is .  .  . you . draw a pretty picture or take a 
photo , get it into an image file , then either ftp put 
it in the directory or use to send it to me 
 ( email addresses at eof ) in email. after the image is received ,

are also welcome. 

 house two types of image files , and  . 
and files require , enough , a or to

most large ftp sites around internet .  . are a bit 
to find .  . if you ca n't find one , but do have a , 
you can obtain a to conversion program which will change 
files to a standard format .  . 

also accepts files. 

when you submit image files , please send me email at the same time 
stating information about what you and whether it is to be 
used  ( in or other projects ) or if it is merely for people 
to view. also , include some biographical information on yourself , we 'll 
be having info files on each contributing and their works. you 
can also just a text file of info about yourself  ( instead of

if you have pictures , but no , there is hope. merely send

get a o  . 

as of 04 21 93 , we 're at about 18 of files , and growing .  . 
email me for current archive size and directory .  . 



distribution 

the images by the project may be freely 
on the condition that the original is kept and that it is 
not altered in any way  ( save to convert from one image format to 
 . in fact , we encourage files to be to local 
and such. if you could , please transport the 
appropriate text files along with the images .  . 

it would also be nice if you 'd send me a note when you did post images 
from to your local bbs .  . i just want to keep track of them so 
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is. 

it 's the purpose of to get these images spread out as much as 
possible. if you have the time , please a few to your favorite 
bbs system .  .  .  . or . even just post this info file there. it would be 
of you. 



use 

if you want to use any of the works you find on the directory , 
you 'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
of the permission  ( such as free copy of publication , or 
full address  . you will either find this in the  . file for 
the image or series of images .  .  . or . in the directory under the 
name. if permission is n't explicitly given , then you 'll have 
to contact the to ask for it. if no info is available , email 
me , and i 'll get in contact with the for 
you , or give you their contact information. 

when you do use work , it 's always courteous to let the 
know about it , perhaps even send them a free copy or some such 
for their files. 



images 

please keep the names of your files in dos format .  . that means , keep 
the  ( before  . or  . to eight characters or less. the way 
i usually do it is to use the of the , plus a three or 
four code for the series of images , plus the series number .  . 
thus , 's drawing would be something

keeping the names under 8 characters that the will 
remain on all systems. 




creating image files 

when creating image files , be sure to at least include your name 
somewhere on or below the picture .  . this gives people a reference in 
case they 'd like to contact you. you may also want to include a title , 
address or other information you 'd like people to know.

i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a type 1 or 
outline into that can be subsequently converted 
by a 3d  . 

i have been studying the problem of conversion for a few years but 
have never had the need to implement such a system. well , i now have the 
opportunity to write some software so i would like to have 
some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end. 

the main problem i face is how to use the even odd or non rules to 
turn the into a single outline  ( my can handle 
complex so there is no need to reduce the to simple 
 . for example , in the letter o there are two 

1 ) the outside outline which is  ( truetype font ) 
2 ) the inside outline which is  . 

one common solution used by a number of is to simply 
connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the 
two are  . this is equivalent to a with 
holes . the will then make the appropriate hole since the 
edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges .  . 

i do not want to use this simplistic system since 

1 ) it will not handle all outline properly  ( it is not a simple 
matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for 
some fancy  . 
2 ) it does not properly handle the even odd or non rules. 

from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a 
to convert the into  ( as 
is done by the and  . these 
can then be easily and properly by the 3d  . 

my question is are there any better solutions to turning the into 
other than the i am not of this solution 
since it creates excess number of  . 

another question , for those in the know what is the best to create 
and or offset for i have a dozen papers on these 
subjects but i ca n't tell which method is the best to implement .  . 

thanks for any  .

hi all ! 
i 've just recently become seriously on , but there are a few 
thing that i want to do that wo n't do  ( penumbral , 
etc . ) .  . i was just wondering what other are 
out there , and what can they do i 've heard of and and 
and so on , but i 'd rather no wade through several hundred pages of 
manual for each trying to work out what their capabilities are. can anyone 
help a comparison of speed between each program would also be 
useful.

i was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine ! ) ) and he made a reference to a 
48 bit computer image system. i seem to remember it being called image or 
something akin to that. anyway , he claimed it had 48 bit color a 12 bit channel .  . that 's 
60 bits of info what could that possibly be for specifically the 48 bit color that 's 
, many more than the human eye can resolve .  . is this an anti thing or 
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor .  . 

also , to a bet with my , what are sgi 's products i know of 
, , and , but what are the other ones , and which is their top of the line 
 ( sadly , i have access to none of them. just a dec 25 .  . sigh . ) .

organization university of , dept. of math sciences

hi , 

i have a problem , i hope some of the   can help me solve .  . 

background of the problem 
i have a rectangular in the domain , i.e the is a 
mapping of a 3d patch into  . the area in this domain 
which is inside a trimming loop had to be  . the trimming 
loop is a set of curve  . 
for the sake of the is made up of cells .  . 

my problem is this 
the trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller 
cells by the trimming curve  . if a cell 
is wholly inside the area .  .  . then . it is output as a whole , 
else it is trivially rejected .  . 

does any body know how can be done , or is there any  . 
somewhere for doing this. 

any help would be appreciated. 

thanks ,
