i wrote in response to  ( darius lecointe ) 

it 's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq .  . i 
think paul 's comments on one day over another  ( rom 14 ) is 
probably all that needs to be said. 

was paul a god too is an interpretation of the words of paul of higher 
priority than the direct word of jesus in 14 19 paul begins 
romans 14 with if someone is weak in the faith ... do you count 
yourself as one who is weak in the faith 

i accept that is doing 
what he does in honor of the lord .  . i just wish he might equally 
accept that those who all days alike are similarly doing 
their best to honor the lord .  . 

yes , but what does the bible have to say what did jesus say paul 
closes romans 14 with , on the other hand , the person with about 
something who eats it anyway is guilty , because he is n't acting on his 
faith , and any failure to act on faith is a sin .  . , isbn 0 2 
have you read the ten commandments which are a portion of the law have 
you read jesus  word in 14 19 is there any doubt in your mind 
about what is right and what is sin  ( greek missing the mark) 

however i 'd like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous 
proof that regular christian worship was on the first day. as i 
indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited .  . 

whereas , the ten commandments and jesus  words in 14 19 are fairly 
clear , are they not 

the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually 
about something else. they both look like they are talking about 
christian meetings , but neither explicitly says and they 
gathered every sunday for worship . we get various pieces of 
information , but nothing aimed at answering this question. 

14 19 does n't answer your question 

what day christians met in their houses .  . acts 20 7 , despite  
confusion , is described by acts as on sunday .  . ... it does n't 
say they gathered to 
see paul off , but that when they were gathered for breaking bread , 

breaking bread roughly with eating .  . 

so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day 
of every week simply means every time they gather for worship .  . 

how do you unite this concept of yours with the ten commandments and 
jesus 's word in 14 19 

i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements 
is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian 
worship was. 


or , they assumed that the ten commandments and jesus  word in 
14 19 actually stood for something perhaps they were strong in 
the faith 



no , i do n't believe that paul can god. however paul was 
writing for a largely gentile audience .  . the law was regarded by jews 
at the time  ( and now ) as binding on jews , but not on gentiles .  . there 
are rules that were binding on all human beings  ( the so called 
laws ) , but they are quite minimal .  . the issue that the church had to 
face after jesus  death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to 
follow christ .  . the decision not to impose the law on them did n't say 
that the law was abolished .  . it simply acknowledged that fact that it 
did n't apply to gentiles .  . thus there is no contradiction with 5. 
as far as i can tell , both paul and other jewish christians did 
continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath .  . thus they 
continued to obey the law. the issue was  ( and is) with gentile 
christians , who are not covered by the law  ( or at least not by the 
aspects of it) .  . 

jesus dealt mostly with jews .  . i think we can reasonably assume that 
5 was directed to a jewish audience .  . he did interact with 
gentiles a few times (e . g .  . the whose slave was healed and a 
couple of  . the terms used to describe the  ( see luke 
7 ) suggest that he was a god , i.e. a gentile who followed 
god , but had not the whole jewish law. he was by 
jewish as a worthy person , and jesus accepted him as such. 
this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view 
that gentiles need not accept the law. 

however there 's more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on 
the law. in order to get a full picture of the role of the law , we 
have to come to with paul 's apparent rejection of the law , and 
how that relates to jesus  of the law. at least as i 
read paul , he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a 
certain sense  . again , this issue is n't one of the 
of the law. in the middle of his discussion , paul notes 
that he might be understood this way , and us that that 's not 
what he intends to say. rather , he sees the law as primarily being 
present to convict people of their  . but ultimately it 's an 
impossible standard , and one that has been by christ .  . 
paul 's comments are not the world 's here , and not everyone 
agrees with my reading. but the interesting thing to notice is that 
even this radical position does not an of the law. 
it still remains as an standard , from which not an 
or may be removed. for its purpose of of sin , it 's 
important that it not be  . however for christians , it 's not 
the end ultimately we live in faith , not law. 

while the categories they use are rather different , in the 
end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion .  . the 
quoted passage from 5 should be taken in the context of the rest 
of the on the mount , where jesus shows us how he interprets the 
law. the not an or would suggest a rather literal reading , 
but in fact that 's not jesus  approach. jesus  interpretations 
the intent of the law , and stay away from the 
details. indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude 
towards the sabbath and laws .  . some scholars claim that 
5 17 20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st  . jewish 
discussions .  . jesus his opponents of about giving a 
tenth of even the most minor , but the things that 
really matter justice , mercy and faith , and about how cups and 
plates are cleaned , but not about the fact that inside the people who 
use them are full of and  .  ( mat 23 23 25 ) this , and 
the discussion later in 5 , suggest that jesus has a very specific 
view of the law in mind , and that when he talks about maintaining the 
law in its full strength , he is thinking of these aspects of it. 
paul 's conclusion is similar. while he talks about the law being 
, all of the specific examples he gives involve the 
law , such as and the sabbath .  . he is quite 
concerned about maintaining moral standards. 

the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being 
, and jesus talks about the law being , i believe 
they are talking about different aspects of the law. paul is 
in arguments about  . as is natural in letters 
responding to specific situations , he 's looking at the aspect of the 
law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish 
ceremonies .  . he certainly does not intend to divine standards 
of conduct .  . on the other hand , when jesus the law , he seems 
to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and 
human relationships , and those aspects that were later 
to give paul so much trouble .  . 

it 's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways , but 
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts .  . look at the 
way terms like family values take on special meaning from the 
current context. imagine some poor historian of the future trying to 
figure out why family values should be used as a code word for 
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u.s. i 
think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was 
involved in. paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values 
that go along with the term law , any more than people who concerned 
about the family values movement are really opposed to family 
values .  .

a new christian wrote that he was new to the faith and 
learning about it by reading the bible , of course . i am not 
at all sure this is the best path to follow. 
while the bible is , for christians , the word of god , the 
revelation of god is jesus christ and the chief of this 
is the church. i am not any one 
, but i do recommend finding a comfortable christian 
in which to develop your faith , rather than just 
reading the bible .  . 
this does not mean that the bible should not be read , although 
i would stick to the gospels , epistles , and psalms and avoid the 
book of revelation until you are with friends you are 
comfortable with . i am sure that mistakenly to 
read the entire bible have frequently down with a remarkable 
lack of somewhere in the middle of , or for the really 
, somewhere in  . 
the point is that the bible is their to illustrate the faith 
of christians , but does not provide the of that faith. vital 
beliefs of virtually all christians are simply not mentioned 
the trinity , the of in christ , types of church 
organization .  . all these beliefs and practices have developed from the 
lived experience of the christian people , an experience lived one 
hopes in the spirit .  . as such the bible , i think , is better studies 
in the context of a , and the context of other reading. 
following up on a suggestion of an old of mine , i 
would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the 
christian life. most novels of any are actually discussing 
the nature of good and evil in the human heart . my own induction into 
the christian faith was brought about after through reading 
graham the power and the glory and the of 
hopkins .  . i would also recommend graham 's 
and any novel by  . the last is not even a christian , 
but such is her on the need for the good life , that , frankly , 
i often am more and god directed after reading her than after 
reading many parts of the bible .  . and that after all is what being 
a christian is all about letting your soul and your life be , in 
some way , directed towards the infinite , represented to us by 
the person of jesus christ .  .

my brother has been from my parents and me since shortly after 
his marriage to a and woman , about twelve years ago. 
we 've kept things on a polite , christmas card sort of level 
for most of this time. attempts to see each other end , with 
his wife throwing a screaming fit and out over either our imagined 
to her , or his or to her (i mean , this 'll 
happen by the end of a single  . he seems , from what i 've 
seen , to live in a state of anxiety , to keep 
the next storm from breaking .  . he has sacrificed not only meaningful contact 
with us but also other friends and outside interests .  . now , this is his 
choice , and i need to accept it even if i it. but it 's hard. 
from time to time i 've wanted to drop the that we have a 
relationship by cutting off contact or trying to have a real if painful 
relationship , by talking honestly with him , but i 've always thought , why 
be and you know he 'll only get and then find some excuse 
to get off the phone. just leave the door open , in case he ever decides to 
come back .  . it 's been an choice , to allow us to go on 
with the superficial of a relationship , but it was the best i 
could think of. 
now , this , my mother finally decided that she was n't going 
to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. this was the 
outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister in law and 
at my mother , blaming her for everything wrong in their lives , and 
in which my brother , , claimed the situation was 
beyond his control , and as always expected my mother to make all the 
and  . mom said she would not , that she would not 
take abuse any more , and that if these were the terms of their 
relationship , she did n't want to talk to or see them any more. and she 
up. (i have never seem my mother lose her , and i think that this is 
the first time she 's ever up on someone . ) . mom says she as if 
she 's my brother , and that it 's a relief in some ways to have the 
break out in the open and done with. 

i have feelings. i'm proud of mom for up for herself 
angry at my brother and sister in law for her , for being , for 
in such a life , which us all and is their 
children angry at my sister in law for being so , and angry at my 
brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us 
that he 's willing to us aside and use up all his energy trying to 
an , 
emotionally woman for their children , who are a mess 
scared for the future , since this marks the time when either things will 
change and improve or the break will become self 
righteous over this bit of proof that they ca n't get away with treating 
us or each other this way , and then with myself for even 
beginning to over others  misery and finally , mostly , sad , sad , 
sad , to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister in law in 
a horrible , destructive situation that they ca n't see a way out of or 
they ca n't bear to take whatever they do see. and i'm 
because i do n't know what if anything to do , and doing nothing drives me 
up the wall. i try to pray , about my own feelings of rage , , 
and , and about their situation , but i am not 
free of the desire to do something concrete .  .  ( the desire to do 
something , to define a problem and fix it , is one of my 
i'm having a terrible time down my internal 
mental enough to listen for god . ) . 
do you and kind people on the net have advice for me is 
this a time to reach out to my brother to let things be how can i 
conquer my rage at him enough to be there for him 

here 's the big question i 've been throughout this long , long 
post is it ok , as a christian and a of faith , hope , and 
charity , to accept the destruction of a relationship to give up on 
my own brother , or at least to accept that i am powerless to help him

a question for you can you give me the name of an organization or a

evil done in its name you 're missing a central teaching of christianity

i also have a problem with the inconsistancies in the bible , and 
how it seems to me that too many people have edited the original

well , it 's really a you feel this way. no one can you

you further away. you need to ask yourself some difficult questions 
1 ) is there an afterlife , and if so , does man require salvation to 
it. if the answer is yes , the next question is 2 ) how does man this 
salvation can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain 
modern like the new age movement teach or does he require god 's 
help 3) if the latter , in what form does indeed , in what form can such 
help come to say , this discussion could take a lifetime , and for 
some people it did their life 's writings , so i am hardly in a

this is certainly a valid objection to religion as explanation of 
nature. 

fortunately for the convenience of us believers , there is a class of 
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science. for 
example why does the universe exist at all 

must there be a why to this i ask because of what you also 
assume about god namely , that he just exists , with no why 
to his existence .  . so the question is reversed , why ca n't 
we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to 
just exist why must there be a why to the universe 

after all , the time space 
world did n't have to exist. why does anything exist and is it 
possible for persons (e . g .  . man ) to come into being out of a purely

life the creation of the world and of persons provide a permanent

it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also 
create man. now , i do n't see this happening in my lifetime , 
nor do i assert it is probable .  . but the possibility is there , 
given scientists are working hard at out genetic

when you say that man is only an animal , i have to think that you are 
presenting an statement a dogma , if you will. and one 
the requires a kind of faith too. by taking such a hard line in 
your atheism , you may have into a religion of your own. 

as far as we can tell , man falls into the  . now ,

it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian

able to serve justice to all. do n't worry if a jew , or is 
going to heaven or hell , for that is god to judge  ( although truly

i hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a

out the weakness of logical  . 

terms are being used in a loaded way here. 

logical proof is an extremely thing to apply to real 
life. if you think otherwise , try to construct a proof that 
yesterday happened. obviously it did anyone old enough to be 
reading this was there for it and that it happened. 
but proof a proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. 
you need axioms to talk about logical proof. you can say that 
you remember yesterday , and that you take as axiom that anything 
you clearly remember happened. i could that you 
the whole thing. 

to talk about of historical events , you have to relax the 
terms a bit. you can show , not  . of the 
resurrected jesus exist. do not. 

i think christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is 
ever disproved .  . i also think that this will not happen , as 
the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things 
go. it is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take 
the resurrection on faith. there are reasons to believe it

i do n't see what the problem is ! to christians , hell is , by definition , 
eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die. 

this is the problem. this is not hell , this is permanent death. it is 
indeed what atheists  ( generally ) expect and it is neither fair nor 
unfair , it just is. you might as well argue about whether being made 
mostly of carbon and water is fair . 

however , the atheists who claim that hell is unfair are talking about 
the fire and place of endless suffering , which necessarily 
includes eternal existance  ( life , i , but some sort of continuation ) 
not at all the same thing.

major views of the trinity 

second century 

the writers of the 2nd  . are important , because they set up much 
of the context for the later discussions .  . , , 
, , and of are known as the 
apologists . their theology has often been described as 
theology . based strongly on wording in john , they took more or less 
a two approach. through eternity , the was with the 
father , as his mind or thought. this word became 
expressed as god revealed himself in history , ultimately in jesus .  . 
thus jesus  full distinction from the father only became in 
history , though the had been present in god from eternity .  . 
regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the 
final orthodox position , but in a form which is less sophisticated , 
because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with 
the eternal in the  . 

held views somewhat similar to the apologists .  . however he 
was uncomfortable with the two stage approach. he still viewed god as 
one , with distinctions that did not become fully 
except through his process of self revelation  ( the economy ) .  . the 
distinctions are present in his essential nature. emphasized 
the holy spirit more than the apologists .  .  views should 
probably be called economic , though that term is 
normally used  ( as below) to refer to later developments .  .

and of person. the son and the holy spirit therefore are

sense of the word. 
perception of god 's the notion of a god is a

as simply names for the man jesus and the of god active in the 
church.

mentioned above. as with them , the is primarily in 
the various ways that god revealed himself in history. however they 
did say that this is a manifestation of a that is somehow 
present in the from the beginning. talks of 
the father , son , and holy spirit as being three that are one in 
substance .  . many people regard this view as being essentially 
orthodox , but with less developed philosophical categories .  . 

origen , developing further an approach started by , attempted 
to apply to christian thought. he set many of the terms

hold it. i said that all of scripture is true. however , 
exactly what jesus , paul and company were trying to say is not always so 
easy .  . i do n't believe that paul was trying to say that all women should 
behave that way. rather , he was trying to say that under the circumstances 
at the time , the women he was speaking to would best avoid and 
cover their heads .  . this has to do with maintaining a proper witness 
others. remember that any number of statements can be derived 
from absolutes .  . for instance , it is absolutely right for christians to 
for peace. however , this does not rule out trying to maintain world 
peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  ( yes , my opinion . ) . 

i agree that there is truth in scripture .  . there are principles to be 
learned from it. claiming that that truth is absolute , though , seems 
to imply a literal reading of the bible .  . if it were absolute truth 
 ( constant across time , culture , etc . ) . then no interpretation would be 
necessary. 

i strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation .  . 
that 's because truth may be absolute , but it may not be obvious. like 
so many things , the truth is always subject to  . 

i strongly suspect that we are an here , which is why i 
from commenting much further. 

sure. the bible preaches absolute truths .  . however , exactly what those 
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion. as i said , the bible does 
preach absolute truths .  . sometimes those fundamental principles are 
clear  ( at least to  . 

this is where the arrogance comes in to play .  . since these principles 
are clear to , maybe the rest of us should just take 
their word for it maybe it is n't at all clear to me that 
their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles .  . 

now hold it. i never said that christians cannot be arrogant .  . indeed , as 
many other christians on have stressed before , this is a trap that 
christians must always be wary about. however , this does not mean that if 
you believe in the absolutes established by the bible , you are necessarily 
being arrogant .  . a christian can believe that the word of god is absolute , 
but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone. 

so , i think that your position is 
the bible is absolute truth , but as we are prone to error in our 
interpretation , we cannot determine if we have out 
what that truth is. 
did i get that right 

not quite .  . you say that according to my stance , we cannot 
determine what is true. that is not what i said. i say that as fallible 
human beings , we cannot the truth with 100 certainty .  . the 
distinction is subtle yet important. 

when a scientist performs an experiment , he can claim that his results 
are reliable , without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could 
have been made. in other words , he can admit that he could be mistaken , 
without sacrificing his convictions .  . 

nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100 certainty .  . 
throughout the centuries , philosophers have argued about what we can know 
with complete certainty and what we cannot .  . descartes made a step in the 
right direction when he uttered , , ergo sum , yet we have not advanced 
much beyond that. 

do you believe that other people aside from you exist do you believe that 
the computer terminal you are using exists if so , can you be absolutely 
certain about that are you sure it is not some grand illusion of course , 
you have no such  . this does not mean , however , that for all 
practical purposes , you can be certain that they exist. so it is with 
christianity .  . the most christians i know have deep convictions about 
absolute morality , yet they acknowledge that there is a non zero probability 
that they are wrong. this does not , however , mean that they should  ( or do ) 
these absolutes .  . 

what 's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending 
absolute truth , when we can never know what those truths are , and we 
can never  ( or at least should n't ) act upon them what practical 
difference can this make 

as i said , we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct. this does 
not mean that we cannot be certain enough , in light of the evidence , to 
render all unreasonable .  .

i 'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of 
christians and look forward to any responses. in my 
with christians , i find myself by their 
belief that their faith is total truth. according to them , 
their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of 
god and god is truth thus they know the truth. this stance 
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own 
about christianity because they see no other way. 
their way is the ' . 

but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe 
a particular way. that choice is part faith and part reason , 
but it seems to me a choice. 

i'm sort of about how a christian might respond to this. 

i 'll start with a parable .  . 

a christian woman a to build her a  . when he comes 
over , they begin talking about religion. so you believe that you understand 
god he asks .  . yes , i do , she replies .  . then have him build you the 
 . 

i do n't think that is complaining about the basis of christian 
belief .  . however , there is a tendency among christians to say , i have all the 
answers because god gave them to me. this is simply not the case. 
i believe that the bible is inerrant .  . however , our human interpretations of 
the bible are necessarily in error , because we are human and imperfect .  . we 
have to remember that we all make mistakes in faith , and that because we are 
human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of god. to 
claim , as so many people do , that the existence of the bible allows us to 
determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully 
understand god 's will. this is  .

i think you are oversimplifying things. we know that early christians 
suffered because of their witness to christ .  . for example 

act 5 40 his speech persuaded them. they called the apostles in and had 
them  . then they ordered them not to speak in the name of 
jesus , and let them go.

the idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different 
forms in the religions of antiquity .  . the problem was not the resurrection 
which was a issue for a tiny of the jewish population 

the problem was that if one believed in the resurrection , then one 
must believe in jesus as truly being the son of god and what he 
stood for and preached during his ministry on earth. that would 
have been extremely difficult for some people , especially those 
that had to kill him.

i 've just read 's response and i just had to get into this. i 've 
got some verses which are not subject to interpretation because they say 

what they say. 

joe , just  cause you say they are n't subject to interpretation does n't 
make it so. that 's your interpretation of these texts .  . 

they are 2 peter 1 20 21 , 2 timothy 3 16 17 , and 
1 11 12. 

2 peter 1 20 21 
but know this first of all , that no prophecy of scripture is a matter 
of one 's own interpretation , for no prophecy was ever made by an act of 
human will , but men moved by the holy spirit spoke from god. 

the study notes in my bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20 .  . 
it 's not as clear to charles as it is to you. 

2 timothy 3 16 17 
all scripture is inspired by god and for teaching , for 
, for correction , for training in that the man of 
god may be adequate , for every good work. 

1 11 12 
for i would have you know , , that the gospel which was preached 
by me is not according to man. for i neither received it from man , 
nor was i taught it , but i it through a revelation of jesus 
christ .  . 

when i read these passages , it was not immediately clear to me what 
every phrase meant. i had stop and think about the possible 
of words , what the intent of the author may have been , 
wonder if the translator used the correct english word to convey the 
same meaning i had to interpret .  . if you want to believe that your 
are not interpreting scripture as you read , there 's probably nothing 
i can say to change your mind. but i think it 's naive to think that 
our culture , experiences , education , do not affect everything we read. 

also , based on the fact that jesus is the word and he judges 
people if they follow him  ( see acts 17 29 31 and john 5 21 27 ) and that 
those who reject jesus  teachings are judged by the very words he spoke 
 ( see john 12 47 50 ) , then jesus  words are true and do not need 
interpretation , nor would it be just of god to judge based on his word 
if it had to be interpreted .  . 

in college , i took an entire course in biblical interpretation .  . go to 
any christian bookstore , there are scores of books on interpreting and 
understanding scripture .  . if interpretation is unnecessary , there are 
an awful lot of misguided christians out there wasting a lot of time 
and energy on it.

hate to step on toes .  . 
thanks 

an interesting interpretation of revelation 17 and 18 has been given by 
david  . i am not saying that i totally agree with his 
interpretation , but it is certainly and good food for thought. he 
interprets the of revelation 17 18 as being none other than the good 
old u. s. of a. that 's right , america .  . he supports his claim in several ways. 
the of revelation is the world leader in trade and commerce , and the 
whole world when  . the american dollar , despite the japanese 
success of the 20th century , is still the most sought after currency in the 
world. if the u.s. were , would n't the whole world mourn the bible 
also talks about being a home of , sin , and adultery (i am 
, of course) .  . 's sin affected , or should i say , , 
the whole world. it does n't take much looking to see that the u.s. is in a 
state of moral  . has n't the american culture and hollywood spread the do 
it if it good all over the world. i think , though , that what 
mr. uses as his strongest argument is the fact that revelation calls 
the great and it as the most powerful nation on 
earth. no matter how you are with the state of our country , i 
do n't think you would have too much trouble that the u.s. is still the 
most powerful nation on earth. 

again , this interpretation is not necessarily my own , but i do find it worthy 
of consideration .  .

adopt ideas that are opposed to christianity , 
we can our faith. when we clearly recognize when we 
it we have the opportunity to embrace what is consistent with 
christianity and reject what is n't .  . 

we need to be alert , always thinking and questioning .  . we must examine 
the underlying assumptions of every book we read , tv program we watch 
and socio political movement we participate in. ideas are important. 
and doctrines are what give form to the events of our 
lives. they are the basis from which we live our lives of love and 
service .  . the command to love god with all one 's mind means no fuzzy 
headed from idea to idea. 

and that and our style of living 
are so rarely called by their appropriate name greed .  . 

one christian who this is the pope .  . it is a frequent theme 
in his writings .  . indeed , christians from most traditions 
recognize that has no place in the lives of christians .  . it 
too is a perversion and dangerous to our faith. thank you , jack , for 
pointing out the parallel .  .

well the argument usually stops right there. in the end , 
are n't we all just kids , for the truth if so , do we have 
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as 
false 


if i do n't think my belief is right and everyone else 's belief is wrong , 
then i do n't have a belief .  . this is simply what belief means. where does 
the authority for a belief come from nowhere , for a belief is itself 
 . if i produce authority for a belief , where will i find 
authority for my belief in the legitimacy of the authority .  . in short , 
the mind has to start somewhere.  ( by the way , the majority of christians , 
i.e. catholics , believe in the authority of the church , and derive the 
authority of the bible from its acceptance by the church . ) .

for those he ca n't bless in the next life , he in this one. and 
those he will not punish in the next life , will be chastised in this one

need not point out the idea of punishment because of god 's judgement is

if jesus stopped the stoning of an woman  ( perhaps this is 
not a good parallel , but i'm going to go with it anyway ) , why should we 
not stop the murder and violation of people who may  ( or may not ) be more 
innocent 

we should stop the slaughter of the innocent  ( cf 24 . 11 . 12 ) , but 
does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the 
u.s. or even the u . n .  . involved i do not think so , but i am an

the case of bosnia , i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily

the so called creed of , however , has always been a western 
creed , and has always had the  . the orthodox have said that 
they accept all that it says , with the exception of the , but 
it is not in use. 

which is exactly what i pointed out.  ( though i was wrong about your use 
of the creed , the catholic in which i read about it 
said the orthodox do use the creed the  . apparently that 
has changed . ) . the creed has always had the , the 
nicene did not. 
of course the orthodox did not delete the from the nicene 
creed  ( it was n't there to begin with ) , but they certainly did from the 
creed , which did have it from the beginning. 
i might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in 
ways of explaining the generation of the trinity , the east 
the idea of the holy spirit proceeding from the father 
through the son , and the west using proceeding from the father and the 
son. in fact , some , such as , used both  ( see 
below) 

following , therefore , the form of these examples , i profess that i do 
call god and his word , the father and and his son , two .  . for the 
root and the are two things , but the fountain and the 
river are two kinds , but the sun and the ray are two forms , 
but ones. anything which proceeds from another must 
necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds but it is not on 
that account separated from it. where there is second , however , there 
are two and where is third , there are three. the spirit , then , is 
third from god and the son , just as the third from the root is the fruit 
of the , and third from the fountain is the from the river , 
and from the sun is the of the ray .  . 
, against , 8 , 5  ( about ad ) 

and 

i believe that the spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the father 
through the son 
, against , 4 , 1  ( about ad ) 

and as st. thomas showed in his part 1 , question 36 , 
articles 2 and 3 , there is no contradiction between the two methods of 
generation , and in fact , the two methods of the 
what st. , among others taught , that the holy spirit 
proceeds from the father and the son , but he proceeds from the father in 
a more way. 

for whatever the son has , he has from the father , certainly he has it 
from the father that the holy spirit proceeds from him ... for the 
father alone is not from another , for which reason he alone is called 
, not , indeed , in the scriptures , but in the practice of 
theologians , and of those who such terms as they are able in a 
matter so great .  . the son , however , is born of the father and the holy 
spirit proceeds from the father , and since the father gives 
to the son all that he has without any of time , the holy spirit 
proceeds from both father and son. he would be called son of 
the father and of the son if , which is to everyone of sound 
mind , they had both him. the spirit was not by each , 
however , but proceeds from each and both. 
st. of , the trinity , 15 , 26 , 47  ( 400 to ad ) 

so , in a sense , all of the are correct  ( to the west at 
least ) , because the holy spirit proceeds from both father and son , but 
in proceeding from the son , the of that is the 
from the father , so the holy spirit is proceeding from the 
father through the son , but as all that the son has is from the father , 
the holy spirit can be said to proceed from the father , without any 
mention of the son being necessary. 
in any case , i am happy to know that i follow in the beliefs of pope 
st. i , st. of , st. of , pope st. 
i , st. of , st. of , st. 
of , st. of , , and others among the 
fathers , who all have very quotes supporting the catholic 
position , which i above. 
as for the issue of the of another creed being forbidden , i 
will point out that the holy fathers of and both spoke 
of the creed of in their statement anyone to produce , 
write , or a of faith other than the one defined by 
the fathers of  . that creed is a different creed than that of 
, which is commonly called the nicene creed .  . not of 
course in that they were condemning the of the 
creed , which is but an upon the creed of 
, but that they were condemning the opinions of , 
who had a different creed from the one used by the 
church , which among other things denied the of the holy 
spirit form the son. thus , the additions of the 
creed were not thought to be in violation of this , and as the council 
also affirmed the doctrine of the of the holy 
spirit from the son , which denied , they could hardly have been 
against explaining in a fuller way the creed , for they themselves 
approved of previous additions to it. and if the further explanations 
of the creed made in were not of the work 
done by the holy fathers of or in any way heretical , it follows 
that the council of was fully able to add what was not disputed 
by the faithful to the creed so as to combat the of the 
in spain , because the was not in dispute in the church until 
many years later under and others. and that the was 
not disputed , i provide more quotes below. 

since the holy spirit when he is in us effects our being to 
god , and he actually proceeds from the father and son , it is abundantly 
clear that he is of the divine essence , in it in essence and proceeding 
from it. 
st. of , the treasury of the holy and 
trinity , thesis 34 ,  ( 423 ad ) 

the holy spirit is not of the father only , or of the son only , but he 
is the spirit of the father and the son. for it is written anyone 
loves the world , the spirit of the father is not in him  and again it 
is written anyone , however , does not have the spirit of christ , he 
is none of his . ' . when the father and the son are named in this way , the 
holy spirit is understood , of whom the son himself says in the gospel , 
that the holy spirit from the father , ' and that shall 
receive of mine and shall announce it to you . ' . 
pope st. i , the decree of , 1  ( 382 ad ) 

the only holy spirit has neither the name of the son nor the 
of father , but is called holy spirit , and is not foreign to 
the father .  . for the only himself calls him spirit of the 
father , ' and says of him the proceeds from the father , ' and 
receive of mine , ' so that he is reckoned as not being foreign to the 
son , but is of their same substance , of the same he is spirit 
divine , ... of god , and he is god. for he is spirit of god , spirit of 
the father , and spirit of the son , not by some kind of , like 
soul and body in us , but in the midst of father and son of the father 
and of the son , a third by  .  .  .  . 
the father always existed and the son always existed , and the spirit 
from the father and the son and neither is the son created nor 
is the spirit created. 
st. of  ( which is on cyprus ) , the man well , 
8 and 75  ( 374 ad ) 

concerning the holy spirit , i ought not to remain silent , nor yet is 
it necessary to speak. still , on account of those who do not know him , 
it is not possible for me to be silent .  . however it is necessary to 
speak of him who must be acknowledged , who is from the father and the 
son , his sources. 
st. of , the , 2 , 29  ( 356 to ad ) 

thus , as i have pointed out before , , spain , , africa , egypt , 
, and the lands of the greeks , all of at that time , 
all have fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine 
expressed by the  . i suggest to those of the orthodox church 
that they come up with some of the fathers , besides st. john of 
who all will admit denied the , to support their views. it is 
not enough to bring up the proceeds from the father line of the creed 
or the gospel of john , for that says what we believe also. but it does 
not say the holy spirit does not proceed from the son , only that he does 
proceed from the father .  .

larry l. writes , responding to simon 

i may be interesting to see some brief posted to the 
net. my understanding is that does not consider itself in 
or legitimately excommunicated .  . but that 's really beside 
the point. what does the roman catholic church say 
can be real apart from formal , as 
provided for in law. 

here 's some of the theology involved for the interested .  . 

there is confusion over this issue of the 's often the 
basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between 

true obedience 
false obedience 



take the various of obedience first. there are 2 
important elements involved here for my purposes 

1 ) a command 
2 ) the response made to the command 

as far as the command goes , commands can be legitimate , such as the 
pope catholics to not eat meat on  . or they can be 
illegitimate , such as the pope catholics to worship the god 
when every other full moon comes around. 

as far as the response to a command goes , it can be to refuse to do 
what is commanded , or to comply .  . 

making a table , there are thus 4 

command response name 

legitimate comply true obedience 
illegitimate refuse true obedience 
legitimate refuse 
illegitimate comply false obedience 

so now you see where my 3 of obedience come from. 

obedience is not solely a matter of refusal .  . the nature of 
the commands must also be taken into account it is not enough to 
consider someone 's or refusal and then say whether they are 
obedient or . you also have to take into consideration 
whether the commands are good or bad. 

in my example , if the pope commands all catholics to worship the god 
, and they all refuse , they are n't being at all ! 

as far as the society of saint x goes , they are certainly 
refusing to comply with certain things the pope desires .  . but that 
alone is insufficient to allow one to label them . you 
also have to consider the nature of the papal desires .  . 

and there 's the rub says the since vatican ii have been 
certain very bad things for the church. the have of 
course  . 

so where are we are we in another heresy , complete with weak 
or are the priests modern martin well , the only 
way to answer that is to examine who is saying what , and what the 
traditional teaching of the church is. 

the problem here is that very few catholics have much of an idea of 
what is really going on , and what the issues are. the religion of 
american catholics is especially in intellectual depth .  . you 
will never read about the issues being discussed in the catholic press 
in this country.  ( on the other hand , one italian catholic magazine i 
get 30 days has had with the superior general of the 
society of saint x . ) . 

many catholics will decide to side with the pope .  . there is some 
soundness in this , because the is infallible , so eventually 
some pope will straighten all this out. but , on the other hand , 
there is also in this , in that , in the short term , the 
may indeed be wrong , and such catholics are doing nothing to 
help the situation by obeying them where they 're wrong. in fact , if 
the situation is grave enough , they sin in obeying him. at the very 
least , they 're wasting a great opportunity , because they are failing 
to love christ in a way at the very time that he needs this 
 . 

 .  .  . let 's move on to  . what is it 

is a of  ( refusal to obey a legitimate 
 . all are  . but it 's a , so 
it does n't work the other way around not all are 
 . the mere fact that the priests do n't comply with 
the holy father 's desires does n't make them  . 

so what is it that must be added to to constitute a 
maybe this something else makes the priests  . 

you must add this the rejection of the right to command. look in any 
decent reference on catholic theology , and that 's what you 'll find 
the criterion of is rejection of the right to 
command. 

here 's what the catholic encyclopedia says , for example 

... not every is a in order to this 
character it must include besides the of the commands 
of , denial of their divine right to command. 
 ( from the ce article ) 

is the society of saint x then the answer is a clear 
no they say that the pope is their boss .  . they pray for him every 
day. and that 's all that matters as far as goes. 

what all this boils down to is this if we leave aside the 
consideration of the exact nature of their objections , their position 
is a legitimate one , as far as the catholic theology of obedience and 
goes. they are certain papal policies because they 
think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of 
the , and the best interests of the church.  ( in fact , someone 
who finds himself in this situation has a duty to resist . ) . 

now , what is the stance of rome on all this well , if you read the 
holy father 's , you can find out. it 's the 
definitive document on the subject. a is a specifically 
papal act. it 's not the product of a roman , a letter 
that the pope has possibly never even read. it 's from the pope 
himself. his boss is god .  .  .  . there 's no one else to complain to. 

in this document , the holy father says , among other things 

1 ) the performed by 
constituted a act. 

2 ) 's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature 
of  . 

both are confusing i fail to see the logic of the pope 's points. 

as far as the go , i read an interesting 
article in a translation of the italian magazine no no . it 
all gets back to the question of jurisdiction .  . if 
imply rejection of the pope 's jurisdiction , then they 
would truly constitute a act , justifying 
under the current code of law. but my problem with this is 
this according to the traditional theology of holy orders , 
does not jurisdiction .  . it only the power 
of order the ability to the  . jurisdiction must be 
by someone else with the power to it  ( such as the 
 . the society , knowing the traditional theology quite 
well , take great pains to avoid any of jurisdiction over 
anyone. they simply those that require a  . 

the no no article was interesting in that it that the 
reason that the pope said what he did is that he has a novel , 
post vatican ii idea of holy orders .  . according to this idea , 
does jurisdiction .  . i the article 
to a friend , unfortunately , so ca n't tell you more. i believe they 
quoted the new code of law in support of this idea. 

the pope 's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. 
there 's no way there is a , according to traditional catholic 
theology .  . so why does the pope think this 

as far as the points regarding the nature of tradition goes , here 's 
the passage in question 

the root of this act can be in an incomplete 
and contradictory notion of  . incomplete , because it does 
not take sufficiently into the account the living character of 
tradition , which , as the second vatican council clearly taught , 

comes from the apostles and in the church with the 
help of the holy spirit .  . there is a growth in insight into 
the realities and words that are being passed on. this comes 
about in various ways. it comes through the and 
study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts .  . 
it comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which 
they experience. and it comes from the preaching of those who 
have received , along with their right of in the 
, the sure of truth. 

but especially contradictory is a notion of tradition which 
the universal of the church by the 
of rome and the body of  . it is impossible to 
remain faithful to the tradition while breaking the bond 
with him to whom , in the person of the peter , christ 
himself the ministry of unity in his church. 

 ( papal , 2 1988 ) 

it seems to me that the holy father is making two points here that can 
be to the following 

vatican council ii has happened. 
i am the pope .  . 

the argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that 
must be wrong , because he disagrees with them. 
this is weak , to say the least ! 

it would have helped clarify things more if the pope had addressed 
's concerns in detail. what is john paul ii 's 
stand on the social kingship of christ , as taught by , 
, , xi and , for example are we supposed to 
ignore what all these said on the subject 

i do n't know what the future will hold , but the powers that be in the 
are still talking with rome and trying to straighten things out. 



many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey 
justified or even obeying god rather than man . 
calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of alice in 
world where words mean whatever we want them to mean. 

similarly , indicates a formal break in the church. if the pope 
says that a exists , it seems to me that by definition it 
exists. it may be that the pope is on the wrong side of the break , 
that there is no good reason for the break to exist , and that it will 
shortly be healed .  . but how can one deny that it does in fact exist 

it seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing 
you are trying to reform the power of the  . what good will it 
do you if you become to the the pope in the future , but in 
the process , you have his ability to use the tools of church 
discipline it 's one thing to hold that the pope has misused his 
powers , and excommunicated someone wrongly .  . it 's something else to 
say that his did not take effect , and the is 
all in his imagination. that means that acts of church discipline are 
not legal tools , but acts whose validity is open to debate. generally 
it has been liberal catholics who have had problems with the pope .  . 
while they have often to church sanctions , generally they 
have admitted that the sanctions exist. you are now the door 
to people simply ignoring papal decisions , claiming to be truly 
obeying by disobeying , and to be in while excommunicated .  . 
this would seem to be precisely the denial of divine right to command 
that you say defines  .

this is not true. the 's position is that there is no proof of the

you have n't fully explained the atheist position. many theists believe that 
there is no proof of the existence of god but choose to believe in him 
anyway. i have n't yet found an argument for atheism that ca n't quickly be 
broken down to assumptions .  . this is n't a problem with me  ( everybody 
needs to have a faith ) but if you believe that you can provide a purely 
logical argument for the nonexistence of god , i 'd really like to see it. 

are you asking us to believe blindly you are trying to deny that part of 
us that makes us ask the question does god exist i.e. self awareness and 
reason. if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant 
as the other animals on this earth. does god want us to be like that 

you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything. however , if 
we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone. and since 
we can only use faith , why is one picture of god (e . g .  . hinduism ) any less 
valid than another (e . g .  . christianity ) 

 .  . but . when you use science and reason , you have faith in certain beliefs 
of the scientific method for example 

the physical laws of the universe are stable .  . 
our observations of reality are a valid basis for a determination of truth. 
objective reality exists. 
logical argument is a valid way to answer all questions.

subject re christianity and repeated lives

 .  .  . there . is nothing in christianity that the idea of 
repeated lives on earth. 

the paul  ( romans 9 11 ) points out that god chose 
rather than to be the ancestor of the covenant people and 
ultimately of the messiah , and that he made this choice while the 
two were still in their mother 's womb , and therefore could not 
possibly have done anything good or evil to their 
 . if we admit the possibility that they had lived previous 
lives , and that  ( in accordance with the asiatic idea of ) 
their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour , 
this makes nonsense of paul 's whole point. 


the existence of repeated earth lives and  ( karma ) does not 
mean that everything that happens is by past deeds .  . 
there is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction , but i 
did not subscribe to that view. god may choose one individual over 
another as the fit instrument for his plans , but that does not 
preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in 
this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development .  . 

i do not , and did not , subscribe to the oriental view 
of an , determining everything that 
one. this is a kind of of a much greater 
law in the context of which the deed of christ on and the 
ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of 
christ can be seen as the master theme and , indeed , a new that 
was completely free of  . christ only once in the 
flesh , and in that he had no debt of or sin .  . the oriental 
concepts of and , which are even more 
and in some new age teachings , incorrectly assume jesus 
christ to have been the of a master .  . , etc. 
their teaching of and also has no concept the 
continuing individuality from one life to the next (e . g .  .  . 
more important , they have no concept of the resurrection of the body , 
the ultimate of the whole human being to ultimate 
resurrection and judgement on the last day. 

there is another biblical passage that also has a bearing .  . it is the 
tenth chapter of john , devoted almost entirely to the man born blind .  . 
clearly here , jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past 
or that of his parents that led to his , but rather that a 
new is to be revealed through him. but note that he does not 
refute the disciples  question. in fact , they ask it as a matter of 
course , the question being stated as if it were self evident that only 
one of two possibilities existed it was either the sins of the man 
himself , obviously not in this , or the sins of his 
parents .  . the fact that they even asked about the first possibility at 
all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of 
christ 's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it. 

there is also matthew 11 14 , where jesus says straight out about john 
the baptist , 

if you care to accept it , he himself is , who was to come. 

this also emphasizes that the gospels do not have a positive teaching 
either way about or , in fact , about what happens to 
the human being at all between death and the last day. even jesus did 
not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it ( if 
you care to accept it ) .  . so i took care to point out , not that the 
bible teaches but that it does not deny it either , and 
that much in both scripture and fundamental christian doctrine becomes 
understandable if is understood in the right way. i 
used repeated earth lives to distinguish a little from the 
oriental doctrines usually associated with the word . 
the phrase is 's  ( wiederholte  . he noted too 
that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west , completely 
free from eastern tradition .  . it did in the and 
centuries , the most important of it being 's the 
education of the human race . 

to return to your original point , paul 's statement about and 
does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and  . 
and both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the 
, death , and resurrection , and return of jesus 
christ , in my view.

subject quality of catholic 
organization the ohio state university 
lines 37 

i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my 
wife and me lately , in particular , catholic  . in the last few 
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass .  . it 's 
driving me crazy ! the most filled aspect of a tradition is 
that what happens is something we all do together , because we all know how to 
do it. led by the priest , of course , which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to god. but the best masses i 've been to were participatory prayers .  . 

lately , i think the of participation has fallen , and the 
of sitting there and watching , or listening , or generally being told what to do 
 ( which is necessary because no one knows what 's happening next ) is growing .  . 
example. last sunday  ( palm sunday ) we went to the local church. usually 
on sunday , the in reading the passion , taking 
the role of the  . the theology behind this seems profound when we say 
him we mean it. we did it , and if he came back today we 'd do it 
again. it always gives me  . but last week we were invited to sit 
during the gospel ( passion ) and listen . besides the invitation , 
i was really to have my  ( and our ) little role taken away. this seems 
typical of a shift of participation away from the people , and the 
, readers , and so on. new things are introduced in the course of the 
and since no one knows what 's happening , the new things have to be 
explained , and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we 're just 
sitting there listening  ( or out , in my case ) to how the mass is about 
to be done. in my mind , i the blame on made up of 
, but that may not be just .  . i do think that a has a 
bias doing something rather than nothing that 's just a fact of 
life even though a simpler may in fact make it easier for 
people to be aware of the lord 's presence .  . 

so we 've been wondering are we the , or is the quality of the mass 
going down i do n't mean that  . we go to mass every thursday or 
friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple to make us aware 
of god 's presence .  . but as far as the sunday masses .  .  . maybe . i should 
just offer it up ) has anyone else noticed 
participation in catholic masses lately

yes , i suppose it is true that people make mistakes .  . it is interesting to 
note that in those long ago ot days , if you were n't 100 correct in 
your prophecies , people got very mad and you were no longer believed , 
even put to death. 

this is one of the differences between ot prophecy and nt prophecy .  . in the 
nt , it is expected that when believers gather , 
people will prophesy 
the prophecy must be judged  ( 1 14 29 ) 
there is nothing about killing someone who makes a mistake. 

to say that we make mistakes is true. to say that we make mistakes 
while filled with the spirit is not true. were that true , the entire 
bible , having been written by men inspired by god would be subject also 
to those errors , for what is prophecy but like those revelations given 
in scripture 

scripture is scripture there is no gift of scripture . and i do n't know 
about you , but i know that i have made mistakes while filled with the 
spirit .  . if you do n't give to allow people to make mistakes , they 
will never grow in the use of the spiritual ! 

when we in my small group , i encourage people to speak out any 
or images they think might be from the lord .  . only by trying 
will they know whether they were right or wrong and in either case , 
they 'll have a better handle on it the next time. 

did n't you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle but you kept on 
trying , and you learned both from your failures and your  . 
spiritual are no different you get better with experience. 

which brings me around to asking an open question. is the bible a closed 
book of scripture is it okay for us to go around saying god told 
me this and jesus told me that would n't that imply that god is still 
out new revelation to us i know that some people will feel 
that is okay , and some will not. the concept of a closed would 
certainly cast a on contemporary prophets .  . on the other hand , 
an open seems to be indicated sometimes. 

the of scripture is complete. does this mean that god no longer 
speaks i have heard his voice not  ( though some have ) , but 
clearly nonetheless .  . is what i heard equivalent to scripture no. i have 
never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the 
lord is on the same level as scripture on the contrary , those who are 
obey the scriptures by their prophecies to fellow 
believers for judgement .  . and the most reliable for judging 
prophecies is , certainly , the scriptures themselves. the is closed 
but god is not silent ! 

also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new 
but rather an inspired translation of scripture .  . is it right to call 
that prophecy would n't that be more having to do with 
knowledge i know , the gift of knowledge may not be as to 
talk about , but should n't we call a horse a horse 

does it matter what it is called the question is not how to label it , but 
how to receive it. words of knowledge , , are similar to 
prophecy  ( and sometimes the two overlap ) , but generally it is supernatural 
knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise.

arrogance is arrogance .  . it is not the result of religion , it is the result 
of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one 's desire to show 
others of one 's  . i assume that god decided to be judge for our 
sake as much as his own , if we allow him who is kind and be the 
judge , we 'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged 
ourselves. 

1 11 31 32 but if we judged ourselves , we would not come under judgment .  . 
when we are judged by the lord , we are being so 
that we will not be condemned with the world. 

1 5 3 even though i am not physically present , i am with you in spirit .  . 
and i have already passed judgment on the one who did this , just as if i were 
present. 

1 2 15 16 the spiritual man makes judgments about all things , but he 
himself is not subject to any man 's judgement  for 
who has known the mind of the lord that he may him ' but we have the 
mind of christ .  . 

14 15 , the seventh from adam , about these men  see , 
the lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge 
everyone , and to convict all the of all 
the acts they have done in the way , and of all the harsh words 
sinners have spoken against him . ' . 

arrogance is a sin .  . although a desire to show others of one 's may 
be a sign of arrogance in some cases , it may be only a sign that they are 
following the bible in others 

22 23 be to those who doubt others from the fire and 
save them to others show mercy , with fear hating even 
the clothing by corrupted flesh .  .

another answer is that god is the source of all existence .  .

always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings

the genius of science is that it discovered that enormous progress

is , attempt to disprove the hypothesis , if you fail , 
publish , if others fail to disprove your hypothesis , accept it 
as a working theory and move on. this method is suitable only

science does not progress via but by  . one 
aim of experiments is to investigate the validity of the

the arrogance of science is the assumption many advocates of 
science make that the scientific method is the only method of 
serious study , the only one to knowledge rather than 
belief .  . 

science has one advantage of all other approaches to explaining the world. 
it is objective .  . 

its further arrogance , is the assumption which 
that , since science is the only valid method of thought , everything 
which exists must be the sort of thing which the scientific 
method can study , and that if the scientific method cannot 
study it it either does not exist or cannot in any way be known. 

anything which the physical world can be studied .  . for example , 
since we are part of the physical world , anything  ( including spirits ) which 
our behaviour can be observed .  . science does not make any claims 
about the existence or non existence of objects which do not affect the 
physical world. 

since these about the nature of the world cannot 
themselves be made the subject of experiment , it is bad science 
to believe them , as well as arrogance , , and just plain 
thinking. 

the purpose of science is to produce a model of the physical world. the 
model must be able to explain all past observations and the outcome 
of future observations .  . one of the of experiments is to carry out 
well defined observations which are objective .  . 

ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world , and 
the model which on the minimal number of assumptions .  . at the 
moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some spiritual world 
existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a

correct ones , whereas many religions claim to represent the truth. the

like to ask is can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological

i wo n't even recommend books from my  . what you ask sounds 
attractive but it is dangerous. as a new christian you do n't want to be

scripture , and discuss with other christians .  . read if your must but 
remember that what other people write is their interpretation .  . god has 
promised to give you light , so ask for it. 

i have another question i would like to ask. i am not yet

do n't wait too long before attaching yourself to church. just remember to

i have stated before that i do not consider myself an atheist , but 
definitely do not believe in the christian god. the recent discussion 
about atheists and hell , combined with a post to another group  ( to the 
effect of  you will all go to hell' ) has me interested in the consensus 
as to how a god might judge men. as a catholic , i was told that a jew , 
buddhist , etc. might go to heaven , but obviously some people do not 
believe this. even more see atheists and pagans (i assume i would be 
into this category ) to be  . i know you believe only 
god can judge , and i do not ask you to , just for your opinions. 

this is probably too simplistic for some , but john 3 16 , 
for god so loved the world that he gave his only son , that 
whoever believes in him should not but have eternal life . 

genesis 15 6 , and he  ( abram ) believed the lord and he reckoned 
it to him as . 

i do n't find anywhere that god heaven to particular 
ethnic groups or religious or any other category 
that we humans like to drop people into. but he does require 
that we believe and trust him. in hebrews it says that god spoke 
of old by the prophets  ( the old testament ) , but in these last days 
he has spoken to us by his son jesus christ .  . and we learn of 
him through the pages of the new testament .  . the bible tells us 
what we need to believe. for those who have never heard , i leave 
them in god 's capable care , he will make himself known as he 
desires .  . it each one of us to act upon the knowledge 
we have. if you reject the claims of jesus , and still go to 
heaven , then the joke 's on me. if you reject him and go to hell , 
that 's no joke , but it will be final .  .

that argument would be more compelling if it were not for the

worship of the of with biblical belief what 
would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word easter and 
replace all such with resurrection sunday would you not 
show up for services if they were called resurrection sunday services 
rather than easter services 

there is another way to view this. the true is easter , 
the resurrection of our lord .  . this has been true from the foundation 
of the world. practices are then either 

1. of the true of the resurrection , 
in which dim light was forth so that people would 
recognize the full truth when it was , or 

2. satanic intended to us so that we would not 
recognize the truth when it was  . 

i do n't believe the second argument , because i believe in the power 
of the resurrection , the fulfillment of the , and our hope. 
earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of 
the truth of the resurrection .  . as paul states , we see through a glass 
 . so do others. it serves no purpose arguing about who has 
the or glass. the are not perfect. 
so what our of god is today imperfect , for we are not

i would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response  ( be 
it a positive or negative one) .  . i read every letter and thought about 
each one ! ! 

i got all sorts of responses , from marry her to have nothing ever to 
do with her again 

through reading the bible and through a lot of prayer , here is what i have 
decided to do. 

i sent her a letter today. first , i told her that if she was really serious 
about moving away from home to another state that i would do anything to 
get you here in nc .  . i told her that i tried to find out if there were 
any new stores planning to be built but they would n't tell me. 

about her comment  ( i'm not gonna call it a proposal , cause 
i still do n't know if it was a total joke or not ) i more or less said 
that marry me well , get transferred to nc first and then we 'll talk ) ) 

, what i said could be interpreted either way. 

to say , there has been a lot of praying over this .  .  . i . 
have done a lot of reading about from the bible .  . if 
she was dead serious about getting married i would n't do it 
yet simply b c she is not  ( as far as i know to this point ) a christian .  . 
it just would n't work w o god in the as well. i figure 
that if god this to go through he 's kept us in touch for 10 
years now he can handle one more. if god wants it to happen , it 
will happen ! 

she will be in nc in june some relatives so i 'll get to 
see her .  .  . and . i 'll get a letter from her then so i know 
more of what to look forward to. 

i guess all i can do now is wait and pray .  . i have decided not to tell 
my folks until i'm totally sure what is going on. 

i do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation 
in your prayers .  .  .

actually a response from my , who has 5 kids , since i have none yet. 

hi i am a student and i am currently researching into 
young offenders .  . i am looking at the way various groups of 
children are raised at home. at the moment i am 
information on discipline within the christian home. 

please , if you are a parent in this can you email me 
your response to the following  . all responses 
will be treated and will only be used to prepare 
 . 
i'm posting this for a good christian relative who does not have e mail 
access. since this and have 5 kids i felt they would be more 
relevant than i , who have none (yet) .  . 

1. ages of children 
13 year old  ( 13yo ) , boy , 6 . boy , girl 

2. do you spank your kids 
i do n't call it , but they do , so yes , very rarely .  . 

3. if so how often 
i do n't call it because it 's more of a reaction to something 
very dangerous , such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running 
into the road. maybe 3 4 times for each except for the girl , who has 
not been yet. 
they call it that because it does hurt their feelings , and of course 
i give all the and stuff to ensure they know they 're still loved .  . 

4. do you use an implement to spank with 
no , that would be too painful. if it 's too they never recall 
why they were punished .  . besides , it must be immediate , and taking the time 
to go get a you 're not doing it right away , and that the 
impact .  . it 's very emotional for a child as it is which is evidenced by the 
fact that a little on the which for perhaps 5 seconds 
is called a  . 

5. if you do not spank , what method of discipline do you use 
lots of logical consequences for instance , when matthew 
a good friend to jump out of his or he would push him out , i made 
sure they did n't play together for 5 days so he 'd know that would make him 
lose friends very quickly .  . he 's never done anything like that since. 
we also use time out in their i use a so they do n't keep 
arguing with me over leaving , since it 's hard to argue with a  . 
i will go to the closed door and tell them wo n't be over until they 
calm down if they 're too  . i use the top of the when they 're 
really young. 

6. your age 
40 

7. your 
, ohio .  . it 's right outside of , in the northeast part of ohio .  . 

8. while under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal 

no , and none of my kids would dream of it. i hope you can use this to 
teach all parents that physical punishment is n't always required parents use 
that as an excuse to hit too hard. 

9. how you as a kid 
lots of , same as i use. our family and my husband 's have never 
used  . in fact , my in law was one of 11 kids , and they 
were almost never  . this was around the turn of the century. and , 
none of us has ever been afoul of the law man made or god 's law. 
jesus says , referring to a small child whom he is holding , that what 
do to the least of these , do also to me. the bible also says in all 
things to be kind , and , and especially loving .  .  ( colossians 3 12 15 . ) . 
there is no room for selfish , which i 'll admit i 've been tempted with 
at times. when i 've felt like hard in , maybe the kid deserved 
a little on the , but what i would have given would have been the 
devil 's work. i could feel the , and just ordered the kid 
to his her room and went to my room myself. after praying and asking god 's 
forgiveness , i was much , and did not feel like , but felt that 
what i had done was enough punishment .  . 

doug me , age 4 now and other 
ever wonder if , after relatives have to give lots of love

for that matter , stay biblical and call it  ( the of 
first  . torah commands that this be observed on the day following 
the sabbath of week.  ( sunday by any other name in modern

on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured why jump it all 
over the the way easter does why not just go with the sunday 
following the way the bible has it why seek after 
methods 

in fact , that is the reason easter all over the 
itself is a holiday , not a one , and thus falls over a wide 
possible of times. the few times that easter does not fall during or 
after are because easter is further linked to the 
the beginning of spring .  .

so what does this question have to do with easter  ( the 
goddess ) i am all for the resurrection .  . just keep that 
out of the discussion. 

your with the term your argument. is 
a value judgement , not a descriptive term .  . 

more deletions 

overall , this argument is an of the fallacy 
 ( see j . p .  . semantics of nt greek ) .  . that is the idea that the true 
meaning of a word lies in its origins and form. in fact , our 
own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with 
how it is used , not where it came from. very few modern people would 
make any connection whatsoever between easter and  . if daniel 
does , then for him it has that meaning. but that is a highly 
meaning , and not one that needs much refutation .  .

8 for by are saved through faith and that not of yourselves it 
is the gift of god 
9 not of works , lest any man should boast .  . 
 ( ephesians 2 8  . 

yes , it is by god 's and our faith that we are saved .  . we are not 
saved by what we do. however , 

15 if love me , keep my commandments .  . 
 ( john 14  . 

keeping christ 's commandments is a work per , and a of 
our love for him. also , 

6 he also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his 
and he came and sought fruit , and found none. 
7 then said he unto the of his , behold , these three years 
i come seeking fruit on this fig tree , and find none cut it down why 
it the ground 
8 and he answering said unto him , lord , let it alone this year also , till i 
shall dig about it , and it 
9 and if it bear fruit , well and if not , then after that thou shalt cut it 
down. 
 ( luke 13 6  . 

again , 

16 have not chosen me , but i have chosen you , and you , that 
should go and bring forth fruit , and that your fruit should remain that 
whatsoever shall ask of the father in my name , he may give it you. 
 ( john 15  . 

it is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit .  . 
what is that fruit .  . well , paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being 
love , joy , peace , patience , etc. all of these are things that are 
in the actions that we carry out. 

if a person claims to believe in jesus christ , but does not do the things 
christ commanded , i dare say , that they really do n't have any faith. 
asking which is more important , faith or works , is like asking which 
on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which of your 
pants is more important. 

good works should come out of and be a result of our faith. to have faith , 
true faith in christ requires you to do what he commands .  . the parable 
above speaks of a person who does bear no fruit .  . 
commands are actions , and if we do n't do those actions and produce fruit , 
then we shall be just like the tree. 

it is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it. actions 
prove our faith and show the of it. i can sit and talk for 
days about the fact that i have so much faith in my ability to jump off a 
building and not hit the ground. in other words , i can sit and tell you 
all day long that i have faith in my ability to fly. i really do n't have 
that faith though unless i am willing to jump off the roof and take the 
test. words and talk mean nothing. 

i could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to i will , but 
this should be sufficient .  . 

hope it helped.

at any rate , i need some support .  .  ( much thanks to k who is 
already supporting me with kind words and prayers ! ) 

i 've been working at this company for eight years in various 
engineering jobs .  . i'm female .  . yesterday i counted and realized that 
on seven different i 've been at this 
company .  . seven times. eight years. yesterday was the most recent one 
someone left an x rated photo of a woman in my  . 

i'm really upset by this. i suppose it could have been worse it 
could have been a man having sex with a or something. 

there was no note. i do not know if it was 

someone 's idea of an innocent joke , that went 
someone 's sick idea of 
an act of emotional terrorism  ( that worked ! ) 

i coming back to work today. what if my boss comes in to ask 
me some kind of question , i do n't know the answer so i take a military 
down off from my shelf to look up the answer , and out 
falls a picture of a man having sex with a i generally have a 
bible on my for occasional inspiration what if i open it up to 
and find a picture a la the north american man boy love 
association i want to up just thinking about this stuff. 

i can lock up my , but i ca n't lock up every book i have in the 
office. i ca n't trust that someone wo n't shove something into my 
or my coat when i'm not looking so that i go home to 
find such a picture , or a threat , or a note about what someone 
wants to do to my body. 

to make it worse , the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to 
treat our to lunch .  . the hour for 
leaving was 11 30 .  . i was working in another building but wanted to go 
to the lunch .  . so i returned at 11 25 , only to find that ever single 
person had already left for lunch .  . they left at 11 15 or so. no one 
could be bothered to call me at the other building , even though my 
number was posted. so , i came back to a department that looked like a 
bomb had gone off and i was the sole  . this , despite 
the fact that everyone knew how bad i felt about this woman being 
left in my  . 

i need some prayers i ca n't stop  . i am so deeply 
that it 's ridiculous .  . 

i feel like i'm some kind of sub human piece of garbage for people to 
reduce me and my sisters to simply sex and the sex act. i feel 
like i'm a sub human piece of garbage that 's not worthy of a simple 
phone call saying we 're leaving for mary 's lunch a little early so 
that bob can get back for a big 1 00 meeting .  .  .  . 

please pray that my will either go away , or be 
turned into something positive .  . please pray that whoever is 
me so will stop , and find some healing for him or herself .  . please pray 
for my being healed from this latest wound  ( which falls on top of a

in a place where the culture does its best to prevent such 
from happening in the first place , and acts 
when something occurs despite its best  .  ( this 
company , in my opinion , has pretty words about how sexual 
is n't tolerated but when you get right down to it , how is it that one 
female engineer can be , left or 
threatening notes , left pictures , spoken to , etc , seven 
times in eight years in the same place pretty words from the company 
do me no good when i'm or healing from the latest assault . ) . 

and please pray that i do n't turn into an because of this. 
that 's my bad habit ignore it and it will go away , you 're not worth 
anyone 's time so do n't go talking to anyone about this , you 're right , 
you are a sub human piece of garbage and to be treated this 
way , you are just an object , you prostitute your mind to this 
company so why ca n't others expect you to prostitute your body there as 
well , what makes you think women are n't just possessions , and 
nothing more than sex and their ability to perform the sex act 
this is the kind of thinking that can one into a major

please pray that this latest trauma does n't come between me and god. 
in a way , a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to 
god , and it 's also a possible for a spiritual crisis that can 
separate one mentally from god. (i know god does n't drop me from his 
loving hand , but it 's awfully easy for me to walk to the of the 
hand , look down , think i'm falling and forget that god 's still holding 
on to me . ) . 

although this probably is n't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup , 
i really can use the kind of loving support you all provide .  . for this

i made sure i used the word public . public revelation contains 
god 's truth intended for everyone to believe. the revelation contained

believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed .  . 
practices may be based on reported private revelations , 
but doctrines can not. 

when an alleged private revelation sufficient attention , the 
church may investigate it. if the investigation indicates a likelihood 
that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god , it will be 
approved .  . that means that it can be preached in the church. however , 
it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from 
god. a catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most 
well and strongly approved private revelations , such as those 
at and  . (i suspect that few if any catholics do reject

but what if the are wrong and these people are warning of a 
non existent danger analogies can only push an argument so far  ( on both 
 . both 's and yours assume the premises used to set up your 
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise .  . 

the important point to note is the different both sides come from. 
christians believe they know the truth and thus believe they have the right 
 ( and duty ) to tell the truth to all. 

christians can get offended if others do not believe  ( what is self evidently 
to them) the truth. non christians do not believe this is the truth and get 
offended at them because they  ( christians ) claim to know the truth. 

the analogy does not depend on the being true , because the 
question under discussion is not truth but arrogance .  . 

a similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood 
is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are 
jehovah 's witnesses and so have objections to blood 
 . the doctor 's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood 
could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as 
christians could be perceived to be arrogant .  . 

the truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood is necessary 
to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. what matters is that the 
doctor believes it to be true , and could be seen to be trying to his 
beliefs on the parents , and this could well be perceived as arrogance .  .

my point was to distinguish between

many people who are doing (2) are being accused of (1) .  . 

it would be illogical to claim that one is really worshipping a

one cannot worship without knowing that one is doing so.

literal of the bible will have a problem with this view , since 
the bible talks about the of hell and such. 

this is something i 've always found confusing. if all your 
die with your physical body , why would flame hurt you how can one 
and with no and no 

one can feel physical pain by having a body , which , if you know the 
doctrine of the resurrection of the body , is what people will have after 
the great judgement .  . we look for the resurrection of the dead , and the 
life of the world to come. nicene creed .  . you 
will have both body and soul in hell eventually. 

now this is getting interesting ! 

i was raised roman catholic before becoming an atheist , so i have stated 
this creed you quote nearly every sunday until i was about 18 .  . for some 
reason , i always took the  resurrection  in this statement to mean the 
resurrection of the soul , but i guess resurrection does strictly mean 
the of the physical body. i have some questions on this point 

1. i always thought that christians believe the descent into hell was 
pretty much immediate , and that there are people burning in hell right 
now. you seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the 
great judgement  ( which i read as meaning the judgment  . 
i was always a little confused on this point , even when i was with the 
church maybe someone can clear it up for me. where will my soul 
 ( which , by the way , i do n't believe in ) exist until that time 

2. will the new body i will have be created out of the same atoms 
that my body now is made of , or will it be built from my 
physical body now is susceptible to , etc. so i guess my 
new body will have to be different in order to be immortal 
so it can be tortured for all eternity 

3. since i will have a physical body , i assume it will need a physical 
place to exist in where is this hell in the center of the earth 
do you think we could find it if we dig 

mark 

univ .  . of central florida 

there is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife .  . i 
think the most common view is that final does not occur 
until a final judgement , which is still in the future. in the 
meantime , some believe that people sleep until the final 
resurrection  ( or because god is above time , pass directly from death 
to the future time when the resurrection occurs ) , while others believe 
that souls have a , pre resurrection existence until then. 
there are probably other alternatives that i'm  . 

the new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a 
different technology than the current one , one which is not  . 
 ( paul talks about the being raised to immortality , and jesus  
resurrected body which is the first example clearly was not 
subject to the same kind of as ours . ) . it is assumed that 
there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other , 
but i do n't think most people claim to know the details. i do n't 
think i 'd say it 's the same atoms .  . i 'd assume there would be some 
of a physical place , but i would n't expect to find it under the 
earth or up in the sky .  . i 'd suspect that it 's in another dimension , 
outside this physical world , or whatever. but again , we have little 
in the way of details.

dean quoted a letter from james m , president of 
bible institute 

we affirm the absolutes of scripture , not because we are arrogant 
moralists , but because we believe in god who is truth , who has revealed 
his truth in his word , and therefore we hold as precious the strategic 
importance of those absolutes .  . 

there has been a lot of discussion , but so far nobody seems to have hit on 
exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at. 

lots of stuff deleted 

this is where the arrogance of christians many people believe 
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the 
doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are 
infallible , and that there is no possibility of mistake. 

claiming that you cannot have made a mistake , and that your thinking has led 
you to a conclusion , is pretty arrogant .  . 

i agree with what has to say here , but would like to add a 
personal observation .  . what i see as arrogance and the problem i have 
with it is not a sense of personal certainty , but a lack of respect for 
others who come to conclusions .  . clearly , this is not just 
christian vs. non christian there is a whole spectrum of belief systems 
within christianity .  . i do not tend to argue with others about matters 
of personal faith because , like aesthetics , it is not by 
objective means. 

choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
 . what bothers me is when others suggest that , in these 
matters of faith , their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
but are absolute and should be binding on others. it follows from this 
that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth , and thus 
anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing 
the wrong path .  . this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the 
honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god. 
even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others. it is 
those matters of personal faith , coupled by a proud 
notion that one 's relationship with god is superior to other 's , that 
leads to arrogance .  . in my honest  ( and nonuniversal ) opinion. ) 


f 
at the core of all well founded belief , lies belief that is unfounded .  .

it is certainly reasonable to ask for some about our own 
ability to know the truth. there are also different in some 
areas of practice. but i 'd like to see more clarification about what 
you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs 
are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on 
others. if something is true , it is true for everyone , assuming that 
the belief is something about god , history , etc. of course something 
of the form i believe that it 's best for me not to could be true 
for some people and not others. i have suggested in the past that god 
may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are. 
but that does n't mean i doubt that there is a difference between 
true and false , nor that i think there is no benefit in finding out 
what is true.

in article ,  ( richard j. szanto ) writes 
in a previous article ,  ( robert anderson ) says 

i would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged 
couple become married in god 's eyes some say that if the two have 
publically their plans to marry , have made their to god , and 
are committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective 
qualifier ) they are married joined in god 's sight. 

i have discussed this with my often. i consider myself married , 
though legally i am not. neither of us have been with other people , 
although we have been with each other. we did not have sexual relations 
until we decided to marry eventually. for financial and distance reasons , 
we will not be legally married for another year and a half .  . until then , 
i consider myself married for life in god 's eyes. i have faith that we 
have a strong relationship , and have had for over 4 years , and will be 
full of joy when we marry in a church. first , however , we must find a 
 ( church we will be living in a new area when we marry , and will need to 
find a new church  . 

anyway , i feel that if two people commit to marriage before god , they are 
married and are bound by that commitment .  . 





has nailed the problem down pretty well. 

as i can find no scripture  ( have i missed it ) that details 
when you are married , i have to make some assumptions based 
on the principles of scripture .  . 

it seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage 
husband to be , wife to be , and god. if you promise before 
each other and god that you will together to be 
married , then .  .  . you . are (imo) .  . 

so why do we have the part that seems to be 
there for in the body of christ .  . my brothers 
and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some 
accountability on both our parts. that 's part of the concept 
from hebrews about not the of yourselves 
together as is the of some. we need each other because 
lone christians and lone marriages smack of a 
self that the i do n't see in the nt .  . does anyone 
see the paul simon i am a , i am an island .  .  .  . model anywhere 
in christianity .  .  ( song show your age ) ) 

further , since marriage is a legal matter institution in the usa 
and many other places , and such laws do not specifically go 
to the clear teachings of scripture , we ought to 
obey them to avoid even the appearance of evil (i 5 22 ) 

so this would imply at least a civil before marriage , 
but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the 
conscience of others because back to the beginning .  .  . you . are 
married when you and your intended promise each other and god 
to be in  . (imo) 

what all think 

bobby ! 

in some states , the kind of commitment described in richard 's 
posting can create a common law marriage. indeed his posting itself 
might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists , 
should the issue ever end up in court. he might want to consult a 
lawyer who is familiar with common law marriage in his state.

a . 
posting deleted. the replies 
i think you 're talking about the assumption of the virgin 
mary . it says that the mother of god , the ever virgin 
mary , having the course of her earthly life , was assumed 
body and soul into heavenly glory. this was defined by a papal 
statement in 1950 , though it had certainly been believed by some 
before that. like the conception , this is primarily a 
roman catholic doctrine , and like it , it has no direct biblical 
support .  . note that catholics do not believe in . 
that is , they do not believe that the bible is the only source of 
christian knowledge. thus the fact that a doctrine has little 
biblical support is not necessarily significant to them. they believe 
that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church , and also 
that it can be revealed to the church. i'm not interested in yet 
another catholic protestant argument , but if any catholics can tell us 
the basis for these beliefs , i think it would be appropriate. 

that is generally , but contains one serious error. we catholics 
do believe that god 's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in 
the bible can be and is passed on through the tradition of the church. 
it should be noted that the tradition of the church , otherwise known as 
sacred tradition , is not the same as ordinary human traditions .  . 
however , we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to 
the church. public revelation , which is the basis of catholic doctrine , 
ended with the death of st. john , the last  . nothing new can 
be added .  . theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications 
that were not recognized previously , so that the council of could 
define statements about the theology of the trinity and the 
that were not explicitly stated in the bible and had been disputed 
before the council , but there was no new revelation at or at 
any subsequent council .  . 

newman 's an on the development of christian doctrine , 
written while he was still an anglican , is an excellent discussion of 
of this point. it was recently as a image books 
paperback with some related works under the title conscience ,

does that mean that if science can over ride god 's decision

through intelligence experiment , and draw no similar conclusions 
about god us for scientific inquiry the use of the 
technology that it produces .  . how is it that one ability is obviously 
from god , and the other not 

i cannot draw a solid line regarding where i 
would approve of scientific study , and where i would not , 
but i will say this before one experiments with the 
universe to find out all its , one should ask 
why they want this knowledge. 

i want to know the truth , and hold the truth as the most 
basic of all ethical values , because correct moral judgement 
relies on knowing the truth , not vice  . moralities that 
assert that to a belief is a moral choice , and not 
compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon .  . 
falsification of evidence , conscious and , follows 
both the and the heart .  . 

i will say that each person should pray for 
when trying to the mysteries of the universe , and 
should cease their if they have reason to 
believe their search is to god. 



if there is a god , he has nothing to fear from truth. 
as to imaginary gods and there followers be afraid .  . be very 
afraid .  .

fortunately for the convenience of us believers , there is a class of

must there be a why to this i ask because of what you also 
assume about god namely , that he just exists , with no why 
to his existence .  . so the question is reversed , why ca n't 
we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to 
just exist why must there be a why to the universe 
remainder of message deleted 

pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message ) 

the reason we can say god just exists and ca n't say the universe just 
exists is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural 
laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular .  . that is , we 
observe in nature that every cause has an effect , and every effect was produced 
by a cause. the existence of the natural realm , as an effect itself , cannot be 
its own cause it must therefore have a supernatural cause. 

god , on the other hand , is a supernatural being , and is therefore not subject 
to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect. as a supernatural being , 
god 's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence 
of a physical , natural does. thus , those who believe in the 
supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of 
phenomena such as the eternal god , whereas those who deny the existence of the 
supernatural are with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very 
nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence .  . 

this is , of course , an oversimplification of a complex topic , but i just wanted 
to clarify some important differences between the supernatural  ( god ) and the 
natural  ( the universe ) , since you seem to mistake them as being 
interchangeable .  .

one thing i do n't understand is why being sacred should make the 
temple rituals secret. 

the so sacred it 's secret explanation is a bit  . while 
there is a profound for the temple , there is no 
against discussing the itself in public. but 
since public discussion is often , most mormons would rather 
keep silent than have a cherished practice  . 

but there are certain elements of the which participants 
explicitly covenant not to reveal except in with the 
itself. 

granted , the gnostic christians 
had their secret rituals , but these seem to have been taken entirely 
from pre christian mystery religions .  . 

there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter. 
one must recall that most of what we know about the was 
written by their enemies .  . claims that jesus secret 
information to peter , james , and john after his resurrection , and that 
those apostles that information to the rest of the twelve 
 ( eusebius , ii 1 3  . 

claims this information was passed on to the priests and 
( against 33 8 ) , but disagrees .  . he 
claims the secret ceremonies of the christian church with the 
apostles .  . interestingly enough , refers to the groups which 
we today call as of a false  ( eusebius , 
 .  . , iii , 32 7  . his was not that a 
, but that they had the wrong one. 

writings dealing with jesus  post resurrection teachings 
secrecy not so much a as a policy of not teaching 
certain things  . in one story , simon a 
with peter on the nature of god. peter 's response is you seem 
to me not to know what a father and a god is but i could tell you 
both souls are , and when and how they were made but it is not 
to me now to these things to you ( 
ii ,  . if any one theme the 
it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be taught , but 
can be had after a certain level of spiritual is reached .  . 

now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways. i 
do n't intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do , but i 
believe that evidence exists  ( favorably interpreted , of course) of 
early christian analogous to those practiced by mormons today. 

neither new testament 
christianity nor biblical judaism made a secret of their practices .  . 

but if judaism and christianity had such ceremonies , would you expect 
to read about them in public documents one can search the book of 
mormon and other mormon scripture and find almost no information on 
temple worship .  . yes , you could establish that mormons worship in 
temples , but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that 
worship .  . on that basis , can we conclude that the bible explains all 
practices which might have taken place , and that absence of such 
descriptions proves they did not exist

which i have taken a few 

1. it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of 
heaven , but to them it is not given  . 13  .

again , these can also be interpreted many different ways. i believe 
they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught 
were actually taught openly .  .

practice (i . e .  . both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual )

information on whether or not this claim is true 

historically , joseph smith had been the temple

my with  ( with respect to temple

for 

in most , the of the resurrection of our lord is 
known as the , or , or some thereof , a word 
which comes from the hebrew , meaning  . in english , 
german , and a few related , however , it is known as easter , 
or some thereof , and questions have been asked about the 
origin of this term .  . 

one explanation is that given by the in his de 
1 5 , where he the word from the name of an 
of spring called  . is a great 
scholar , and it is natural to take his word for it. but he lived 
, and began preaching in kent in  . the use of 
the word easter to describe the would have been well 
established before the birth of and probably before the birth 
of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. it seems likely 
that his is just a guess , based on his awareness that 
there had been an of spring bearing that name , 
and the resemblance of the words. thus , if the said resemblance 
 ( surely it is not surprising that a of spring should 
have a name similar to the word for dawn ) is not in 
convincing , the testimony  ( or rather the conjecture ) by does 
not make it more so. 

assuming that was right , that would not justify saying that the 
christian  ( which , after all , had been going on for some 
centuries before the name easter was applied to it) has roots .  . 
it would simply mean that the , upon becoming christians 
and beginning to celebrate the resurrection by a every 
spring , called it by the name that to them meant simply spring 
 . 

however , 's is not the only theory that has been proposed .  . j 
, in die , 5 
 ( vienna , 1959 ) 27 45 , the following 

among speaking christians , the week beginning with the 
of the resurrection was known as  ( white week ) , 
since the christians were to wear their 
white robes throughout that week. sometimes the week was 
referred to simply as  . this into 
german it for the of , meaning dawn .  . they 
it as , which is old high german for 
dawn .  . this gave rise to the form easter in english.

organization university of texas at san 
lines 74 

i 'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of arrogance of 
christians and look forward to any responses. in my 
with christians , i find myself by their 
belief that their faith is total truth. according to them , 
their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of 
god and god is truth thus they know the truth. this stance 
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own 
about christianity because they see no other way. 
their way is the ' . 

but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe 
a particular way. that choice is part faith and part reason , 
but it seems to me a choice. 

my discussions with some christians me of 
discussions when i was in grade school 

a kid would say , all policemen are ! i 'd ask , how do 
you know because my daddy told me so ! how do you know 
you 're daddy is right he says he 's always right ! 

well the argument usually stops right there. in the end , 
are n't we all just kids , for the truth if so , do we have 
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as 
false

i'm sort of about how a christian might respond to this. i 
can understand of christianity that say there 's not enough 
evidence to believe it , or that there 's just as good evidence for 
other religions .  . i do n't agree , but clearly there are plenty of 
intelligent people who do n't find the evidence convincing .  . but that 
does n't seem to be your point. rather , you seem upset that people who 
believe christianity is true also believe that things which contradict 
it are false .  . 

this suggests a model of spiritual things that 's rather different than 
the christian one. it sounds more like an view , where 
people choose what value to follow , but there 's no actual independent 
spiritual reality , and so no way to say that a specific choice is in 
some unique sense right. this sort of model with of 
one sort or another may be appropriate for some religions .  . but 
christianity is in its a historical religion. that is , it 's 
based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out 
there , that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways , 
and that we see evidence of that in history. in the mundane world , 
we are not free to choose how things work. when we drop something , it 
falls  ( aside from well defined situations where it does  . the 
christian concept is that spiritual matters , there is also an actual 
external reality. i hope we 're all honest enough not to claim that we 
have perfect understanding. but while we may not think we know 
everything , we are confident that we know some things. and that 
implies that we think things that contradict them are false .  . i do n't 
see how else we could proceed .  . 

this need n't result in arrogance .  . i'm certainly interested in talking 
with people of other religions .  . they may have things to teach me , and 
even if they do n't , i respect them as fellow human beings .  . but it 's 
got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some 
matters they are wrong. maybe even wrong.

hi everyone , 
i'm a commited christian that is with a problem. i 
know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our 
deeds , yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless , 
saying  you fools , do you still think that just believing is enough ' 

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by 
themselves and not by god , according to romans that person is still 
saved by there faith. 

my  . 02 . yes and no. i do not believe the above scenario is not possible. 
either they are believing and living  ( in at least some part ) led by god , else 
they are not. believing  ( intellectually , but  ( waiting  ) is not enough. 
especially important to remember is that no one can judge whether you are 
so committed , nor can you judge someone else. i guess the we can 
come to know someone 's situation is listening to their own statements .  . this 
can be fallible , as is our sense of one with another. 

but then there is the bit which says that god 
someone who is cold to him (i . e .  . does n't know him condemned ) 
so a christian someone who knows and believes in god but  
t make any attempt to live by the bible .  . 

regarding this passage , we need to remember that this is a letter to a church 
 ( at laodicea ) , people who are of the body of christ .  . 3 . 14 16 ) he talks 
about their works. a translation could say that he says their lack of 
concern makes him sick  ( to the point of throwing  . 

now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone  ( not what 
you do ) as taught in romans , but how can i square up in my mind the 
teachings of james in with the christian being ' 
out  
right , saving is by faith alone , except that faith does not come alone , if 
you the two meanings .  . 
i can offer the explanation that jesus would that we were either on fire 
for him or so cold we knew we were not in his will and thus could be made 
aware of our separation .  . this is for his children , not eternal 
damnation .  .

why do you assume that jesus 's plea to his father to let this cup

as that hour approached , he felt abandoned by his father , his

was brought more and more to jesus 's attention  ( the betrayal of 
judas was probably a big impact ) that his suffering would be to no 
avail for many people , especially those who would reject him , not 
only then but in the future. i truly believe that the majority of 
jesus 's suffering was mental and spiritual , while the physical 
portion was only the of the  . 

btw , we know from john 's account that jesus an earthly

this does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an

i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my 
wife and me lately , in particular , catholic  . in the last few 
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass .  . it 's 
driving me crazy ! the most filled aspect of a tradition is 
that what happens is something we all do together , because we all know how 
to do it. led by the priest , of course , which makes it a kind of dialogue we 
present to god. but the best masses i 've been to were participatory prayers .  . 

. . . 

having lived through the kicking and screaming in the and as the 
catholics were invited to participate in the instead of counting 
their during mass , i find this comment interesting. there 
is a longer tradition for proclaiming the passion accounts 
without active participation .  . if you know the , one really 
beautiful way to hear the passion is it 's being chanted by three 
the in the middle range , jesus 
in the bass , and others directly quoted are by a high  . 
this is actually the basis for the common of the passion 
that john would prefer .  . 

but there is always a judgement call based on  . 
each makes his own decisions  ( it is n't a church wide conspiracy 
against  . the sunday , with its initial 
blessing and distribution of the palms and , is already 
getting long before you get to the passion some pastors feel that they 
should not make the people stand through that long  . also , the 
with multiple readers and public participation 
in the quotations runs longer than the single reader 
in churches with multiple masses for the sunday , it might be 
necessary to go with the options just to get 'em in and get 'em 
out . 

each is different. catholics are no longer to 
their  . it is possible that another catholic 
in the area  ( based on the ohio state address ) has a 
closer to your preferences .  . or talk to some of your fellow 
and see how common your preferences are pastors 
generally are willing to listen to non requests .  . though 
you probably should bring along a in case he too strongly 
to the of people asked for a longer sunday mass .  . 

perhaps the problem is that recent development has n't follow 
the continuous evolution model  ( the of small changes , no 
single one of which is too hard to take ) but rather the 
model  ( things stay the same and we get to them , 
then the mutation  . my apologies if i am mis remembering

all , 
i have a question about satan .  . i was taught a long time ago 
that satan was really an angel of god and was kicked out of heaven 
because he challenged god 's authority .  . the problem is , i cannot 
find this in the bible .  . is it in the bible if not , where did it 
originate 

i did a on this for an student a 
couple months ago because i wanted to know the answer too. as far as 
i could tell , although that story was never specifically told in the 
bible , many references are made to it , primarily in the new testament .  . 
in the old testament there is actually an entirely different view of 
satan as a  ( excuse the pun ) devil 's advocate for yahweh .  . see the 
book of job. getting back to the fallen angel story , there are no 
references to lucifer in the bible except for a mistranslation of 
the morning star in the king james version  ( isaiah 14 12 ) , which 
probably referred to a much in the same was as the 
sun king referred to  . 

all in all , i do n't know where the story came from it may have been 
around for a long time , or ( paradise lost ) may have 
invented it. sorry for the of the rest of this , but i am 
in a and need to eat lunch ! feel free to email me about the 
other stuff i found out .  .  .  .  .  ( although a lot of it is just the result

oh mon ! there is a way. certainly it is not by human reason. 
certainly it is not by human experience.  ( and yet it is both ! ) to paraphrase 
, the particular is absurd unless it has an infinite reference point. it 
is only because of god 's own revelation that we can be absolute about a thing.

ah , now it is clear. was a of russell .  . 's fame is often 
explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in 
contemporary philosophy .  . both around 
 ( '21 ) and philosophical investigation  . many of 's comments and 
conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of 
language he  . according to some of the suggestions of 's 
thought , ordinary language is an resource , offering a necessary 
for the conduct of daily life. however , though its formal features 
remain the same , its content does not and it is always capable of being 
as our experience changes and our understanding is , giving 
us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say. on 's own 
account , there is a of language. it is for this reason that 
any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to 
talking about its , where a is understood not as a but 
a  . 
's comment that 's sentences have a content that often lies 
deep beneath the surface of language. on the surface , talks of the 
position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing 
ourselves to accept it without question. at the same time , we are with 
's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes 
in our traditional modes of understanding. philosophy , then , through more 
speech , seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it 
is already  . yes the most of scientists are unable to 
offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject christianity ! in his 
we have the well perfect of the nature of the 
of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of reality by man. 
perfect language does not exist for fallen man , therefore we must get on about 
our of truth via ordinary language. 

this is why john 's gospel is so dear to most christians .  . it is so simple in 
it of the of god , yet so full of depth of 
understanding. he viewed christ from the ot concept of as a man , so 
he is. john looked at the as only an of what was inside , 
that is the consciousness of christ .  . and so must we .  . words are only vehicals 
of truth. he is truth. the scriptures are plain in their that 
there is a truth and that it is  . there are absolutes , and they too 
are  . however , they are only when he reveals them to the 
individual .  . there is , and we should n't from this , a to 
christianity .  . paul in 8 says there are 3 men in the world. there is the 
one who does not have the spirit and therefore can not know the things of the 
spirit  ( the spirit of truth) and there is the one who has the spirit and has 
the capacity to know of the truth , but there is the third .  . the one who not 
only has the spirit , but that the spirit has him ! who can know the deep things 
of god and reveal them to us other than the spirit .  . and it is only the deep 
things of god that are absolute and true. 
there is such a thing as true truth and it is real , it can be experienced 
and it is verifiable .  . i disagree with dr nancy 's 's conclusion because 
if it is taken to it leads to relativism which leads to  .

subject re unity

lines 

in article  ( maarten van loon ) writes 
fellow netters and fellow christians , 
about the subject of unity between christians and christian churches. 
to a bible study group. i do have a personal opinion on this 
issue , i thought it would be nice to hear opinions of fellow christian 
brothers and sisters from different countries and in different situations .  . 

my background member of a  ( orthodox ) church. let us say a little 
the only unity i 've found which is true is when all parties involved are 
disciples .  . i came out of a church in which even the different 
were always competing and arguing about which one was 
better and who had the better messages  ( while none of them put anything 
into practice from those  . since becoming a disciple , i 've 
found that when i travel to another church in the same movement , they 
are just as accepting there as any other. we had a back in 
when some of the from , came up  ( this 
was for college students ) and it was as though i had known even 
the people from for years  ( and i had only become a disciple 
the previous april and had never been to the church in  . one 
of the to unity is love and self sacrifice .  . that is only 
one area in which disciples stand out from christians . also , another 
part of unity is a common depth of conviction .  . i 've also been a part of 
some christian campus who were on unity between 
churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of 
conviction about everything they believed .  . that was why they could be 
, they did n't care about the truth but in getting along 
together. 

the problem here in the is that there are two other churches 
 ( denominations ) with the same characteristics .  . both have the same 
there are only some differences with respect to for 
example the matter of of salvation and how to use 
our creeds .  . in essence a lot of people of these three churches have to 
same faith and feel that they should become one church. but how , that is 
the question. 

creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly 
better 

so , here is a first question 
can the of christ be separated by walls of different 
or is this definitely an situation 
according to the scriptures 

according to the scriptures , and differences of opinion are going 
to be there. as per a previous note , i mentioned that there are those 
who teach falsely by many means. there are also differences of opinion 
and belief .  . however , scripture states 
in the following i have no praise for you , for your 
meetings do more harm than good. in the first place , i hear that when 
you come together as a church , there re divisions among you , and to some 
extent i believe it. no doubt there have to be differences among you to 
show which of you have god 's approval  ( 1 11 17  . 

how will god show his approval by  ( see acts 2 47 ) , but 
before that , there are these qualities 
devotion to the apostles teaching 
fellowship 

filling with for god 
all having everything in common .  . 
glad and sincere hearts 
god 
the favor of the people 
all these are mentioned in acts 2 42 47 .  . god also shows that those who 
have these qualities are persecuted .  . look at stephen , a man full of 
faith and of the holy spirit  ( acts 6 5 ) who was later  ( acts 
7 54  . 

can one say that only one of these three churches is the 
true church of jesus christ 

one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is 
perfect not only in the but as a movement .  . i 
have yet to find that , but the one i 've found is the boston 
church of christ movement , which constantly to have errors 
pointed out and  . it is also the only one i 've seen which is 
totally sold out to god. 


a problem closely related to these question is 
can we with other christians from these two churches 
before there is a unity this question is especially important 
for those who think that only one church can be the true one . 

as for , that can always occur .  . unity , on the other hand may 
never occur .  . as for those who think about only one church being the 
true one , i them that mark 9 38 41 states that there are 
disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with , but they 
will not lose their reward .  . as with the boston movement , i 've heard 
numerous times this exact same thing , that there are disciples out there 
that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them 
any less disciples .  . of course , few people admit that they 've ever run 
into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement .  . 
i know i have n't .  . 

maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you. 
for your information we have a lot of organizations here which 
are founded by people of one specific church and whose members 
are all members of that church. this has been considered as 
correct for years. only a few years ago people started to 
discuss about this and now we are in the middle of this process. 
some organizations are their doors for people from 
other churches etc. 

i must warn that this sounds to me. a is a group which 
runs around together to some extent exclusively .  . this causes problems 
in fellowship and causes divisions .  . i would not say at all that this is 
something correct for a church group to do for any reason. in one of 
the churches i attended , for example , there was an internal of 
people who were on the 14 different groups 
heads of the  . they rarely talked to anyone else outside of 
the and seldom were voted out of office without another 
office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in. 
their degree of exclusion was such that when the new came , he 
nearly had to wipe out everything and start from (i wish he 
would 've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a 
 . anyway , this rigidity in the is beginning to be 
broken down , but is still there. so , i must warn against such division 
within .  . there 's enough division without .  . 

thanks for your opinions in advance !

here 's a topic to get things started .  . my daughter 's christian school sends

something very interesting. it was an article written by the leader of a

working on a project to the temple at jerusalem .  . the article 
included of the many that have already been made in 
for the temple according to the 
given in the bible .  . 

what was even more is the fact that the plans for the temple are 
complete and the group is only permission from the israeli 
government before beginning the building .  . the other fact is the 
very recent that the original site of the temple is 
and available for building .  . previously it has been thought that 
the original site was what is now a mosque , making 
impossible without a holy war. 

now it appears that nothing stands in the way of and 
sacrifices , as the scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. 
although the israeli government will give the permission to start , i think 
it is the hand of god holding the project until he is ready to let it 
happen. brothers and sisters , the time is at hand. our is

again , in the normal protestant interpretation , sunday is not a law , 
and worshipping on another day is not a sin .  . churches are free to 
decide on the day they will meet , just as they are free to decide on 
the hour .  . it would not be a sin to worship on some other day , but if 
you belong to a church that worships on sunday and you show up on 
monday , you will probably worship alone .  .  .  . 

i totally agree with that  . but why do you have to go further 
and advocate violating what god has set up that is the question which 
you have not answered from scripture .  . you can worship on every day , as

in article  ( william hargreaves ) writes 

i'm a commited christian that is with a problem. i know 
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds , yet 
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless , saying  you fools , 
do you still think that just believing is enough ' 

actually i do n't think there is any conflict if we really understand 
what these passages say. first , what is faith if you study the 
meaning of the greek and hebrew words so translated i think you will 
come to the conclusion that the word means a lot more than mere 
belief .  . faith means both trust and action. if you do not put your 
belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith. i think this 
is what james means when he says that faith without works is dead 
and , i will show you my faith by my works. remember james was 
writing to the twelve tribes which are  . this 
probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much 
later and would n't understand the meaning of the original greek .  . 
 ( indeed i suspect james was writing to us , today , among others he 
intended to reach . ) . paul , on the other hand wrote mostly to the 
people of the roman empire who generally understood the meaning of 
the greek .  . 

another key to why there is no conflict is to look at paul 's 
statements in their context. i think you will find that when paul 
faith and works it is in the context of comparing the 
gospel with the law , meaning the law of moses .  . this was the great 
burden of paul 's life. as the to the gentiles he would go 
convert a bunch of people , then the would come along and 
try to convince them that they also had to obey the law of moses  ( cf 
acts chapter  . in this context paul condemns the idea of being 
saved by the works of the law , saying that we are saved by the blood 
of jesus and our faith in him. i believe that a better translation 
for today would be that we are saved by . i think 
today has a meaning closer to what the original 
writers intended .  . 

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves 
and not by god , according to romans that person is still saved by there faith. 

i think you misunderstand romans .  . what paul is really saying is 
that god prefers a faithful gentile who does not keep to a 
jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters 
of following the lord and having charity his  . 

but then there is the bit which says that god someone who is cold to 
him (i . e .  . does n't know him condemned ) so a christian someone who 
knows and believes in god but does n't make any attempt to live by the bible .  . 

in the sense of faith described above , you cannot have real faith and 
be  . if you know god but are  ( unfaithful ) , you are 
worse off than the person who never heard of him. remember , jesus in 
the parable of the of great price  ( mat 13 45 46 ) and again in 
the one on the hidden in the field  ( mat 13 44 ) indicates that 
the price of the kingdom of god is all we have. 

i agree with you in general , including the fact that has 
some of the force of faithful . however if you take that too far , 
you can end up with something that paul definitely would not have 
intended .  . being faithful means following god in all things. to say 
that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we 
are saved by commiting no sins .  . i assume that 's not what you meant. 

i have almost given up on finding a specific verbal that 
completely this. however i think paul is describing what i 'd 
call a basic orientation , including aspects such as trust and 
commitment .  . jesus speaks of it as , which implies a basic 
change .  . we may still do things that are sinful , and may fail to show 
the new life in christ in many situations where we should .  . but in any 
christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that 
jesus calls being born again.

in a previous article ,  ( michael covington ) says 

in article  ( terrance heath ) writes 
that is not necessarily  . when christians call god  father  , 
we are using a metaphor .  . the bible in one place refers to god as being 
like a mother. god is neither a father nor a mother in the literal 
sense god has some of the of both the father metaphor is 
usually used because  ( for most people at most times ) it is the less 
of the two possibilities .  . 

i do n't know which passage you are refering to , but the passage i have 
often seen cited as an example of a mother image of god is isaiah 49 15 
can a woman forget her sucking child that she should have no 
compassion on the son of her womb even these may forget , 
yet i will not forget you. 

this passage is not a mother image of god at all. the mother here 
is the image of the best human can show , and it is 
contrasted with the of god. the mother figure here represents 
mankind , not god.

the problems with catholic are likely to continue for 
some time. the problem is , in a nutshell , this the is a 
action in other words catholics do or should believe that 
the signs during the mass water , , , altar , 
, etc are real. that is the of water real , 
almost , , the are a real indication of real 
sacred time. the point of a symbol is that it is understood by all 
to be connected to an underlying real  . this kind of thinking 
analysis holy water is not holy because of anything , it 
simply is holy .  . 

but , modern westerners find it extremely difficult , especially if 
well , to think of the mass as a symbol .  . we are more likely 
to see it as a sign , ie an action that represents , but which 
could be replaced with other signs .  . in concrete terms , this means the 
mass has become a for god 's rather than the real 
thing. you can mess around with a in a way you would n't 
dare with the real thing ask coca co .  . ! . these attitudes have 
been encouraged by , etc. which instead of focusing 
on how to do do , have on how to create a meaning in 
 . you can only create signs , symbols have to come from god or 
the heart , or somewhere deeper than analysis. the most 
example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of 
the sacred species the host and wine . now , with 
bread etc , it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered 
in particles .  . if the host is a sign of , this and issue but 
catholics in the past would have been at this real 
of the real symbol of jesus  body. 

modern catholic is caught in this epistemological shift .  . we 
try to the old , but then we have some 
priest get up and  explain  what we are doing so we stop doing it and 
start to do it. this is not a soul filling experience. 
it does n't help btw that we have got stuck huge amount of two and 
three folk music again a result of mis analysis complicated 
are in fact easier to remember than simple ones this was the 
genius of and the anglican writers .  is only 
slightly better. 

what are we to do well i suggest rejecting the system if it 
does n't work for you. search out a church where the is well 
prepared not well explained .  . they exist in every city. this is not btw 
a matter of particular style the music might be old or new. it is 
the attitude of the church that  . also , note that a conservative

the church will be socially conservative .  .

jason smith wrote 

the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all 

one of the laws of nature , specifying cause and effect seems to 
 ( at least to this 's mind ) there must be a event. no 
reasonable alternative exists. 

i would argue that causality is actually a property of 
causes their effects .  . but if you claim that there must be 
an answer to how did the universe  ( our spacetime ) emerge from 
nothing , science has some good for an answer. 

i have always wondered why christians use the there are questions 
science  ( or atheism) cannot answer argument i hope this is the 
appropriate group to ask this question. 

the most popular question is the question of origins .  . why does the 
universe exist , or anything , for that matter 

i think this question should actually be split into two parts , namely 

1 ) why is there existence why anything exists 

and 

2 ) how did the universe emerge from nothing 

it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. however , 
is it a meaningful question , after all 

i would say it is n't .  . consider the following 

a die hard skeptic being  ( be it human or whatever ) attempts to doubt 
one 's very existence .  . since it is so easy to doubt everything else 
i cannot be sure the world exists , it may be my mind me 
can i ever be sure i exist 

however , it is only possible to exist or not to exist.  ( someone 
insert an appropriate quote here ) ) 

a being that does not exist cannot doubt one 's existence .  . 
a being that does exist can doubt one 's existence , but this would be 
pointless the being would exist anyway. 

let us return to the original question why a being that does not 
exist does not need any reasons for its non existence .  . this being 
is not sure whether anything else exists but his mind , but let 
us assume that the world exists independent of the mind  ( the objectivity 
 . the question why anything exists can be countered by 
demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in , 
or in non existence . actually , both questions turn out to be 
of meaning. things that exist do , and things that do n't exist 
do n't exist. tautology at its best. 

i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question. 

some christians i have talked to have said that actually , god is 
himself the existence .  . however , i see several problems with this 
answer. first , it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is 
actually all existence , good and evil , and angels , us and 
them. this is , not christianity .  . 

another answer is that god is the source of all existence .  . 
this sounds much better , but i am tempted to ask does god 
himself exist , then if god is the source of his own existence , 
it can only mean that he has , in terms of human time , always 
existed .  . but this is not the same as the source of all existence .  . 
this argument sounds like god does not exist , but meta exists , 
and from his meta existent perspective , he created existence .  . 
i think this is actually a , a mere twist of words. 

the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable 
of understanding such questions. being an atheist myself , i do not 
accept such answers , since i do not have any other methods .  . 

the second question how did the universe emerge from nothing 
belongs to the domain of science , and i , for one , do not doubt the 
question can be answered by its methods .  . many have 
suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge 
from  ( this possibility has been suggested in a recent 
hawking see also creation of the universe , 
world scientific ,  . however , i think the sci groups are more 
appropriate for discussions like this. 

as far as i can tell , the very laws of nature demand a why . that is n't 
true of something outside of nature (i . e .  . , super  . 

this is not true. science is a collection of models telling us how , 
not why , something happens. i cannot see any good reason why the why 
questions would be bound only to natural things , assuming that the 
supernatural domain exists. if supernatural beings exist , it is 
as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. 

i believe the genetic code will be entirely in our lifetimes , 
but we will not see man convert entirely material into self , 
life , ever . (i 've never been much of a prophet , though. i 
ca n't even picture new york in my mind 8 ) .  . i do n't believe any 
technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life , despite 
having all of the parts available. just my opinion. 

this opinion is also called namely , that living systems are 
somehow fundamentally different from inanimate systems. do christians 
in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce 
they have created primitive life  ( say , small bacteria ) in a lab 

there is a problem with your prophecy artificial life has been created , 
although not yet in a chemical form. computer simulations of evolution 
contain systems that are as much alive as any , although 
their code is electronic , as well as their  . see a recent book 

artificial life the quest for a new creation. jonathan 
, london 1992 .  . 

artificial chemical life is just around the corner after all , no 
spark of life has been found to be necessary living systems do not 
violate any physical laws as we know them. 

you do n't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your 
research , do you after all , if we of christ are ourselves , you 
really have nothing to worry about , eh 

exactly. this is why i think atheists should not post any evangelical 
atheist arguments to soc . religion . groups , since people who seek to 
find peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. i would 
normally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk . religion . misc . , 
but it seems many christians do not read these groups.

stronger than his wife but is not to use this to dominate her. 
he must honor her as his sister in christ .  . this would therefore be an

i can see , however , how our prayer life might be by our

!  ( gerry palo ) writes between adam and eve and 
the whole process of the fall of man 
occurred .  . this involved a gradual of consciousness of the spiritual 
world. 

this was precisely my point. from a theological , those who lived 
immediately after the flood , such as , ham , his son , and his son 
had a much stronger of divine wrath .  . they also had a 
stronger understanding of the true god. in fact , this was a cause of 
for some , so much so that , who is seen with heavens on 
his  . but this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting .  . 
it is to put god and the strict spirituality of his law at a distance , and 
thus he became the of the heavens .  . this god made men able to 
feel as if heaven were off and as if either the god of heaven could not 
see through the dark cloud , or did not regard with the of 
his laws .  . it is interesting to see that it was that was titled 
or or  . it was who invaded the system 
and the liberties of mankind , yet was worship for having given many 
benefits. he was a all right but not as we think of christ as a 
 . one from a conscious feeling of god 's wrath , the other 
actually performed a from gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it 
as true. 

the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is 
an ever present one with christians .  . i am not ready to adam 
or abraham , or even cain to eternal damnation .  . 

i do n't see the problem. from the time of adam , those who looked forward to 
the coming one and put their faith in the fact that it was god who 
was to do the , were accounted as righteous .  . but up to the 
crucifixion , their sins were only covered , not taken away. therefore , the 
of the church views the accountability of sin the same , but see it 
as a action. 's makes it clear that it has always been salvation 
via faith and nothing else. 

it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment .  . the 
relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely 
extended conditions of mean time. 

i understand what you 're trying to convey , but i do n't think i 'd hold of it 
because the scriptures do equate the of the second death with the 
of , say the church ruling with christ .  . jn 17 tells us what eternal 
life is exactly , as you are correct that it is much more than non of 
consciousness .  . 

it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous 
were lost. 

it depends upon your of lost. the elect were lost only in time as 
outside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. 
we were all born lost , but the righteous were in christ and 
therefore never lost. 

it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient 
people 's ideas of life after death. 

maybe this summer i could find time to put together a paper on it. i simply 
have to buy more books for myself , and these older books are very expensive .  . 
either that or countless trips to the oriental  . 

mankind into and , and at the turning point of 
time a new light entered into the world. the light still grows , and 
we are developing the eyes with which to see by it. much new 
revelation and growth in under standing lies before us. our new 
vision and understanding is still very feeble , but it contains 
something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and 
much more as well. 


could n't agree with you more. our understanding , of say , is 
clearly clearer than that of , say isaiah .  . but that is not what i was referring 
to. 

 ( at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of 
, founder of , for many insights that have led me to my 
views on this subject) .  . 

the way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual 
on it. i think it was much less abstract and much more real and 
concrete , a teaching that much closer to home than our doctrines or 
teachings today can be received .  . 

no , i understand it as you have said. this was my point. 


i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to 
simple from an original source. even if they were passed 
on , the question is , to what extent did they reflect real perception 
and experience 

ah ! this is it. this is the big question. however , i would say , again i 
think , that the best lie is one that has an amount of truth to it. 
look at satan 's twist of god 's word when he eve .  . that is a very 
interesting study .  . 

the similarity in the midst of great variety of 
of the different people 's ideas of the time immediately 
after death to the presence of an underlying reality. 

yes , that is my point. but it is a two sword .  . for some do not want the 
underlying reality to be revealed .  . they were not known as mystery religions 
for no reason. there was the public side of them and there was the private 
side , that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they 
revealed that private side. that is why it is so hard to bring their teachings 
to light. the mystery of that we find in the bible , to 
this i think. the primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately , 
little by little , under the of secrecy and of oath , what it would 
not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion. case in point 
today might be the  .  ( just a note , that they too worshipped in 
egypt , who can be to , the husband son. ) 

on the other hand , there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity 
that originated most definitely in a source. the idea that the 
human being consists essentially of soul only , and that the soul is 
created at birth , was from aristotle , whose ideas 
dominated christian thought for hundred years and still does 
today. 

no , i disagree with you here  . i know what you 're alluding to in that the 
church , primarily the , did philosophy into their 
, but i would disagree with you that it originated in  . if you 
are a student of history , you will come to see that much of what came to 
to the world as their original , was just an of that which 
they had taken from conquered countries. the soul is clearly mentioned and 
discussed at length in the egyptian religions .  . as was the unity of god and also 
the trinity of god. see if you can find 's egyptians .  . he really 
does a number on what the greeks did to what they from the 
egyptians .  . 

he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same 
time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our 
eternal spiritual being had grown dim .  . 

i'm not knocking aristotle or or any other greek thinker .  . its just that 
there is nothing new under the sun .  . 


indeed. i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal 
damnation is a real possibility .  . but the narrow range in 
which we conceive of the decisive moment , i.e. after the end of a 
single earthly life , is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the 
reality , and i think that is why the early creeds were in 
terms that did not try to it out. 

each age has its own focus of theology .  . the early church with the 
 . the reformation dealt with authority .  . today , 
has had much study .  . the early creeds do not these things out 
in detail because , 1 ) they were n't the topic of concern , 2 ) there was 
insufficient wisdom , 3) they did n't have the tools that 
we have today. also , each age seems to have an air of revelation to it. one 
age has a well tended and garden in which a particular doctrine is 
given growth .  . it would be natural for the end of times to have the garden

the other hand , do say that the bible is opposed to the values 
held by our secular society. anyhow members of that church are involved in 
out of country missionary work. also , the has talked of spiritual 
warfare and of bringing christ to the people of our area.

bosnia in my mind , i felt uncomfortable about the saying that 
the massacre  ( the one in joshua ) was right. but what really bothered

bosnia .  . certainly , my sympathies should n't be with the  . 
considering that the bosnian muslims are descendants of christians 
who , under turkish rule , converted to islam could the serbs be doing 
god 's work 

the example of god 's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest 
has always been in discussions here. i personally question 
whether they were right even at the time. but those who believe they 
were consider that the wars were justified only because they were 
specifically commanded by god. somehow i do n't see the serbs behaving 
like a group that is led by god in this matter.

i do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person

already like christ .  . jesus never lost his  . i 
do. jesus was perfect. i'm not.

i must have missed the postings about , david koresh , and the second 
coming .  . how does one tell if a second coming is the real thing , unless the 
person claiming to be it is obviously insane 

i'm not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ .  . how could 
somebody who breaks his word be the second coming koresh did promise that 
he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio 
 . he did n't .  . still it seems to me that he did fool some people. 

and , from my knowledge of the bible , it seems that christians have 
been hard on the jews of christ 's day for being about accepting 
somebody that their religious authorities did n't accept as the messiah .  . 

so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be 
early to recognize the second coming while , at the same time , not wanting to 
be believing just anybody who claims to be god. 

mark 13 21 and then if any one says to you ,  look , here is the christ ! ' 
or  look , there he is ! ' do not believe it. 
mark 13 22 false and false prophets will arise and show signs and 
wonders , to lead astray , if possible , the elect .  . 
mark 13 23 but take i have told you all things  . 
mark 13 24 but in those days , after that tribulation , the sun will be 
darkened , and the moon will not give its light , 
mark 13 25 and the stars will be falling from heaven , and the powers in 
the heavens will be  . 
mark 13 26 and then they will see the son of man coming in with 
great power and glory. 

my understanding of jesus  answer is that , unlike his first coming , 
which was veiled , the second coming will be quite  . he 's 
telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen 
before his second coming the actual second coming will make his 
power openly  . 

by the way , from koresh 's public statement it 's not so clear to me 
that he is claiming to be christ .  .

he found in the viewpoint of the christians he came in contact with. 
thus i was free to choose how to live my life , and he supported the 
decision i made to join the church , although he emphasized 
to me that his respect for my beliefs should result in my not

is his decision.  ( please , no flames or advice on how to convert him ! )

the basic problem with your argument is your total and complete on

my experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (i imagine 1 and 2

a 14 15 year old living in a community with this attitude , on 
that they were more attracted to members of the same sex , 
would not feel the love of the community , but would rather feel the

there may be some misunderstanding over terms here. i believe jesus 
only originally was in the context of baptism .  . these are folks who 
believe that baptism should be done with a mentioning only 
jesus , rather than father , son , and holy spirit .  . this may have 
doctrinal implications , but as far as i know it does not mean that 
these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father .  . i'm not the 
right one to describe this theology , and in fact i think there may be 
several , including what would be called or

that are probably consistent with standards , but who wo n't

in article  ( cardinal ximenez ) writes 

religious people are threatened by science because it has been systematically 
removing the physical of god 's existence .  . as time goes on we have to 
rely more and more on faith and the spiritual world to relate to god becuase 
science is removing our  . i do n't think this is a bad thing. 

first of all , i your assumption that you know why i 
am threatened by science , or even that i am threatened at all , 
although i admit the latter .  . the reason i am threatened by science 
has nothing to do with my need for proof of my lord 's existence 
god reveals himself in many ways , including , to some degree , 
science. 

my problem with science is that often it allows us to 
assume we know what is best for ourselves. god us 
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations , 
for example , but he did not make that to everyone. 
does that mean that if science can over ride god 's decision 
through , that god for us to have the power 
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children should men be allowed to have babies , if that 
is made possible. 

people have always had the ability to end lives 
, and soon may have the ability to bring lives 
into the world  . the thing to 
created life is created death , and as god 
has judgement about when people should die to 
himself , i believe we should rely on god 's wisdom about how 
people should be brought in to the world. 

this is not to say that i reject all forms of 
medical treatment , however. treatment that 
pain , or prevents pain from , is perfectly 
acceptable , i believe , as it was acceptable for jesus 
to the sick .  . however , treatment that merely 
life for no reason , or makes unnecessary 
to the body for mere aesthetic purposes , 
go too far. are we not happy with the beauty god 
gave us 

i cannot draw a solid line regarding where i 
would approve of scientific study , and where i would not , 
but i will say this before one experiments with the 
universe to find out all its , one should ask 
why they want this knowledge. before one alters the body 
they have been given , they should ask why their 
body is not too them as it is. i cannot 
make any general rules that will cover all the cases , but 
i will say that each person should pray for 
when trying to the mysteries of the universe , and 
should cease their if they have reason to 
believe their search is to god.

yours , 
pixie 
p.s. if you do sincerely believe that a god exists , why do you follow 
it blindly 
do the words question authority mean anything to you 
i any theist to reply. 

dear  ( or or pixie ) 

i will take up the challenge to reply , as i am a theist .  . 

the foundation for faith in god is reason , without which the existence 
of god could not be proven .  . that his existence can be proven by reason 
is  . my short , traditional for the 
existence of god , and  . 

now , given that god exists , and that his existence can be proven by reason , 
i assert that his commands must be followed blindly , although in our fallen 
condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith. why 

because god is the first cause of all things , the first mover of matter , 
the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence , the 
measure of all that is perfect , and the essential being who gives order 
to the universe  . 

i next assert that god is all good. if this is so , then that which is 
contrary to the will of god is evil i.e. , the absence of the good. and , 
since god can never contradict himself , then by his promise of a savior 
as early as the of genesis 3 5 , god that because 
a human  ( adam ) was first responsible for man 's from the source 
of all good , a man would be required to act to the friendship .  . 
thus god became in the person of the messiah .  . 

now this messiah claimed that he is the truth  ( john 14  . if this claim 
is true , then we are bound by reason to follow him , who is truth  . 

you next seem to have a problem with authority .  . have you tried the united 
states corps yet i can tell you first hand that it is an excellent 
in authority .  . if you have not yet had the privilege , i will 
reply that the authority which is truth may never be questioned , 
and thus must be followed blindly .  . one may not deny the truth. for 
example , when the apple on isaac newton 's head , he could 
have denied that it happened , but he did not. the laws of physics must 
be whether a human likes them or not. they are true. 

therefore , the authority which is truth may not be denied .  .

if i do n't think my belief is right and everyone else 's belief is wrong , 
then i do n't have a belief .  . this is simply what belief means. 

, this seems to be how christians are taught to think when 
it comes to their religion. some take it to the extreme and say that 
their religion is the only one and if you do n't accept their teachings 
then you wo n't be saved . it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim 
to know what god thinks wants. especially when it 's based upon your 
interpretation of a book. the logic in the above statement is faulty 
in that it assumes two people with beliefs ca n't both be 
correct. it 's all about perception .  . no two people are exactly alike. 
no two people perceive everything in the same way. i believe that 
there is one truth. call it god 's truth , a universal truth , or call it 
what you will. i do n't believe god presents this truth. i think it is 
just there and it 's up to you to look for and see it , through prayer , 
, , dreams or whatever. just because people may 
perceive this truth differently , it does n't mean one is wrong and the 
other is right. as an example , take the question , is the glass half 
empty or half full you can have two different answers which are 
contradictory and yet both are correct. so , for your belief to be 
true , does not require everyone else 's belief to be wrong. 

if a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that god 
will save only christians , it 's hard to see how you can criticize them 
for arrogance for saying so. it could be that they 're wrong. but i 
hardly see that it 's arrogance .  . let 's look at this a bit closer .  . 
suppose we had some combination of prophets and that taught 
us things , but did n't say anything about  . if we believe 
them , and then add and anybody who believes anything else is damned , 
then you could well criticize us for arrogance .  . but in this case the 
is in the message as it comes from the prophets , etc. so 
we could be wrong in believing it , but i do n't see how we can be 
called arrogant .  . maybe the world is n't a soft place. maybe certain 
choices actually do have eternal consequences .  . i can see calling the 
christian message arrogant , in a certain sense  ( though only in the 
same sense as calling the law of arrogant because it 
does n't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a 
 . but not christians for passing it on , given that they 
believe it. the i can see making are (1) that christians 
are wrong , or (2) that god is arrogant .  .

subject re ancient books 
organization tektronix inc. , beaverton , or. 
lines 

i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the 
accident the described .  . this is an improved 
version anyway so no loss the first time. 

the standard work on of ancient documents 
is probably the writing of friedrich , und 
, und , 1 of 
der  ( noerdlingen 
,  . portions of this are described in , the 
prophetic book mormon ,  ( slc book ,  . 
 ( if you want to attempt reading this be  . 
describes as a typical german scholar who claims little 
knowledge of his subject , then proceeds to both the subject 
and the reader . ) . 's extract from 's work is in the form 
of rules for  . it makes interesting reading. 

i confess that i have not read 's work , only 's extract 
thereof .  . my german falls far short of what would be required and 
as far as i know there is no english translation available. however , 
i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that 
any classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient 
document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one 
would expect of a genuine document of that time frame .  . we will not 
be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to 
determine with reasonable if it is from that time and 
culture or is a later  . 

actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents 

1. alleged actual or early copies thereof .  . for example 
the dead sea  . these can be tested by various scientific 
means to determine the age of the paper , , and objects found 
with them. this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual 
physical objects .  . 

2. documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the 
copy itself may be much more recent .  . for example we might find a 
document which monks in a claim is a copy of something 
from centuries ago  ( perhaps even having been through several 
generations of  . this is more of a problem but can still 
be tested  ( although the test is not likely to be  . we cannot 
expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so 
we must our to the text itself. 

it is important to remember that none of these can tell us if 
the document is really what it claims to be. they can only date the 
document and identify its culture of origin .  . for example i 've heard 
of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king 
in what is now iraq .  . if this document were to actually turn up 
scholars could date the paper and ink  ( assuming they have the 
 . they could check the language , content and writing 
style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a 
jew of that time. however even if all test results were 
positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually 
wrote it. we would know what time and culture it came from but 
 ( barring a known of jesus or other clues for 
comparison ) must stop there. there is seldom any way to 
determine who the actual author was. 

as i say , i'm no expert on 's work. i do remember some of the 
which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works. 
specifically we might ask 

1. is the document internally consistent does it contradict 
itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to 
maintain internal consistency , even if it is a  . the 
longer the the more difficult it is to maintain consistency .  . 
for this reason most successful stick to short documents .  . 

2. is it consistent with the history and of the time 
again a short , non specific work might not be but if the 
writing is of any significant length no latter day would be 
able to escape  . here we look for the minor , 
things which someone from that culture would get right without even 
thinking about it but which a later would find too numerous 
and trivial to check .  . the devil is in the details. 

3. what about the style of the work , of speech 
etc. any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that 
seem strange to us. are there any such odd phrases in this book 
if so do they fit in with the culture 

of course there are if the document has been 
translated , or possibly even if somebody just updated language 
when he copied it. a few cases of language not from the culture 
claimed may be allowed in recent copies .  . they cause problems and 
reduce certainty to be sure but do n't necessarily prove  . 

these can be quite effective  ( given enough material to work 
with ) but they are not easy .  . they require the of the 
historian , the linguist , the etc. the questions to 
ask are , is every aspect of this document consistent with what we 
know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things 
which do n't fit how significant are they are problem areas due to 
our lack of knowledge , later changes by or are they really 
significant there will often be some since we never 
know everything about the culture .  . 

the end result of any such is certain 
 ( particularly in the case of or other ancient  . 
however often it may just be a probability or an indication that 
the document  ( or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic  ( or 
sometimes maybe other parts are later  . this is often 
to a generation raised on tv where all problems are 
solved in 30 to 60 with time out for  . it is , 
however , the real world and what has to offer .  .

the author of 1 timothy told what he thought was the 
truth , based on his belief in god , his faith in jesus

testament .  . but again , what had been revealed to him 
was based on  ( at best ) second hand information , given 
by friends and authors who may not have given the

first of all , the original poster  . the reference is from 2 tim 3 16. 
the author was paul , and his revelations were anything but  ( at best ) 
second hand . 

and is came about that as , he was

he to the ground , and heard a voice saying to him , , , 
why are you me and he said , who art thou , lord and 
he said , i am jesus whom you are , . . .

paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus !  ( pretty cool , eh ) he

, what he has written is 
again second hand info if it were given by the spirit , 
and still carries the chance it is not true. 

the spirit is part of god. how much closer to the source can you get 
the greek in 2 timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god , 
literally means god . in other words , god spoke the actual words 
into the scriptures .  . many theologians and bible scholars  . james is 
one that i can remember off hand ) get quite by the and 
incompleteness of inspired by god . 

the only way you would be able to escape this notion of 
second hand info is to have had the entire bible 
written by god himself. and to tell the truth , i 've 
studied the bible , and have yet to 
hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence 
showing god as the first author of this collection of 
books. 

that 's what the verse taken from 2 timothy was all about. the of a 
book written over a of years by more than 40 authors from all walks 
of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god. 

and as for reason , read what it says in 1 1 18 31 about 
human wisdom .  . basically it says that human wisdom is useless when 
compared with what god has written for our learning. 

if you knew of jesus as well as you know the bible , you 'd 
realize he reasoned out the law and the prophets for 
the common man. 

what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior 
to the bible certainly not josephus  writings , or the writings 
of the which were third century , at the earliest .  . 

and though some claim jesus was 
he was human , with all of the human wisdom the 
paul set out to criticize .  . yet , would you not 
embrace the idea that jesus was wise 

jesus was fully god as well. that 's why i 'd assert that he is wise .  . 

i realise that you may not accept the authority of the bible .  . this is 
unfortunate to say the least , because there is no other way of learning 
about god and christ and god 's purpose with the earth than reading the 
bible and searching out its truth for yourself. 

for your information , i was raised without any knowledge of 
god. by the time some of the faithful came to show me 
the word and share with me its truth , i was living 
happily and morally without the existence 
of a supreme being. i have , though , read the bible 
several times over in its and have studied it 
thoroughly .  . it contains truth in it , and i consider 
jesus to be one of the most moral of human beings to 
have lived  ( in fact , i near the guy . ) . but 
there 's no rational reason for me to except god 's 
existence .  . 

please this last paragraph .  . if there is no god , which seems to be your 
current belief , then jesus was either a liar or a complete because not 
only did he assert that god exists , but he claimed to be god himself !  ( regards 
to c.s. lewis ) how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus 
in conclusion , be careful about logically unfounded based 
on gut feelings about the text and other scholars  claims .  . 
the bible that we take it in its or the whole book out. 
about your reading of the bible , not only does the spirit inspire the 
writers , but he the reader as well. we cannot understand it in the 
least without the spirit 's 

for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit 
searches all things , even the depths of god.  ( 1 2 10 , nas ) 

peace and may god guide us in wisdom .  .

after going through several study bibles , i'm towards the 
assertion that  ( 'the wisdom of ben  or 'ecclesiasticus' ) 
is directly referenced by james in fact , i think 
is more directly referenced by james than job or ruth is 
referenced in any nt verse i 've seen. 

good point. the new testament does not quote , , esther , 
ruth , job , , or song of , just as it does not quote 
from the  . but if the non quotation of the former does not 
them , neither does the non quotation of the later. and the 
of solomon was quite clearly an influence on st. paul , especially 
in the letter to the romans  ( cf especially romans 1 . 18 . 32 and wisdom

i think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be 
applied are not very useful as principles .  . 
so , if we are to exclude them  ( not them the authority of 
scripture ) we would appear to require other reasons. what might these 
reasons be tradition  ( always a  . with ) . tradition is 
on this subject. , i believe , is in 
i do n't know if it is listed in the 
 ( the oldest list i know  .  ( and the others ) are discussed 
by the fathers , as scripture , but not  . 

true. not all accepted them as scripture , though niether were all the 
books of the new testament so accepted , which puts to the lie the whole 
argument of the books being excluded because they were and not 
universally accepted. hebrews , the , 2 peter , esther , and 
others were at various times , but eventually  . as for 
the you mention , both and include the 
, of the new and old , and (i 
think) 1 , the of , and the of 
 . as for the , it deals with the new testament 
only , though it is very valuable in its witness to those books. 

my conclusion is that protestant exclusion of 
 ( at least one of ) these writings is one of those  traditions 
of men  one hears of so often. they were excluded during the 
reformation , and that appears to be the reason many people 
continue to exclude them. 

any i can be reasonable .  .  ( if all else fails ) 
show me where i'm wrong. 

you 're not wrong ! it is a of men  to them , as i 
will explain below. 

that nothing be read in the church under the of divine scripture , 
except the scriptures , and the scriptures are 
genesis , exodus , , numbers , deuteronomy , joshua , judges , ruth , 
four books of being 1 2 and 1 2 kings , two books of 
being 1 2 , job , the of david , the five 
books of solomon being , , song of , wisdom of 
solomon , and to him the wisdom of jesus son of , 
the books of the twelve  ( minor ) prophets , isaiah , jeremiah being 
jeremiah , the , , and the letter , all of which were 
counted as one , ezekiel , daniel , , , esther , two 
books of being and , two books of  . and of 
the new testament four books of the gospel , one book of the acts of the 
apostles , letters of paul the , one letter of the same 
to the hebrews , two of peter the , three of john , one of the 
, one of the james , one book of the of 
john .  . 
council of , 36 ,  ( 393 ad ) 

this same list was again at the third council of 
 ( 397 ad ) , and at the sixth council of  ( 419 ad ) at which 
council the same list was with the words because we have 
recieved from the fathers that these are the books to be read in the 
church. which ought to quiet those who assert in the name of holy 
scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was 
never any doubt in the church , as the church does in removing 
the from the realm of scripture .  .  ( though the 
hold them in high regard and read them in the church , they are not 
counted as scripture by them , and may not be used to prove dogma .  . the 
hold out similarly . ) . 
earlier mention of the so called apocrypha as divine scripture can also 
be found , and below i only a portion of the quotes calling it 
divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the fathers .  . 

and this is the reason why the law of the old testament is reckoned as 
consisting of twenty two books so that they may correspond to the 
number of letters in the hebrew .... it is to be noted also 
that by adding to these and , there are twenty four books , 
to the number of letters used by the greeks .  . 
st. hillary of , commentaries on the psalms , , 15  ( 365 ad ) 

the twenty two books according to the hebrews are .... jeremiah , with 
and the letter , reckoned as one .... and also there is

origen , commentaries on the psalms , psalm 1  ( 245 ad ) 

divine scripture , addressing itself to those who love themselves and to

it is likewise decreed now , indeed , we must treat of the divine 
scriptures what the universal catholic church accepts and what she must 
 . the list of the old testament .... wisdom , one book 
, one book .... , one book .... , one book of 
, two books. 
st. i , pope , the decree of , section 2  ( 382 ad ) 

i would think this enough , though more can be shown , that the church 
has always accepted the , though parts have been disputed 
by various persons .  . for if involving the new testament 
does not those books (i . e .  . hebrews , james , 2 
peter , 2 3 john , , revelation ) in protestant eyes , than neither 
should it the old testament books. and i must point out that 
the jews only up their in 90 ad , 60 years after the founding

many christians believe in abstinence , but in a moment will be overcome 
by desire .  . we all compromise and poor choices  . last 
week i was guilty of , , and whole mess of other stuff , 
yet i am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with aids .  . to even 
suggest that aids is deserved is ludicrous .  . 

some rules are made because at some point man is too stupid 
to know better. yet , eventually man learns .  . but only after 
getting a lesson from experience. 

yes , it 's important to realize that all actions have consequences , 
and that rules were made for our own good. but to suggest that a 
disease is a punishment for certain types of sin i think is 
taking things much too far. if we got some kind of mouth disease 
for lying , would any of us have mouths left what if we developed 
every time we after someone or something i dare 
say all of us would be walking into walls .  . 

i wonder if aids would be a problem now if people did n't get 
involved in deviant sexual behaviour .  . certainly , people who 
received tainted blood are not to blame .  . but it just goes 
to show that all mankind is affected by the actions of a few. 

yes , sin can have terrible consequences , but we need to be real 
careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for 
sin .  . the jews of jesus 's time believed that all sickness was the 
result of a sin .  . then jesus healed a blind man and said that man was 
blind to show the glory of god , not because of sin .  . if aids , or any 
other is a punishment for sexual sin , what do we do with 
diseases like , or multiple , which are just as 
and terrible as aids , yet are not usually linked to a 
specific behavior or lifestyle 

in addition , imho forgiveness is not the end of things. 
there is still the matter of atonement .  . is it aids 
i do n't know. 

atonement is extremely important , but i think you 've missed the mark 
about as far as you can by suggesting that aids is an atonement for sin .  . 
the atonement for sin is jesus christ period. this is the central 
message of the gospel .  . a perfect sacrifice was required for our sins , 
and was made in the lamb of god. his sacrifice for all of 
our sins , past present and future. god does not require for 
our sins , nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement .  . he 
has already done that for us. to suggest that aids or 
some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally 
on the sacrifice that jesus made. 

in case you could n't tell , i get extremely angry and upset when 
i see things like this. instead of rationalizing our own and 
, we need to be out to people with aids and other 
socially unacceptable diseases .  . whether they got the disease through 
their own actions or not is irrelevant .  . they still need jesus christ , 
no more and no less than we do. i 've said this before , but i think 
it 's a good analogy .  . people with aids are modern day  . jesus 
healed many  . he can also heal people with aids , maybe not on 
this earth , but in an ultimate sense. my next door neighbor has aids .  . 
she has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed 
relationship with god. her theology is n't what i would want it to be , 
but god 's covers her. the amazing thing is that she is 
weight  ( she 's had the disease for over 2 years ) and her health is 
excellent apart from and such. she 
her improvement in her health to god 's intervention in her life. who 
are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment it 
seems to me that god is being through her disease. 

paul , the country , has a good song title that i 
think applies to all of us but for the of god , there go i

the empty can we trust it 

by the late m. smith , d . d .  . 
 ( 1894 1977 ) 

when jesus was on earth , he made an amazing prediction about 
himself , and frequently repeated it. let me quote it for you 

behold , we go up to jerusalem and the son 
of man shall be betrayed unto the chief 
priests and unto the scribes , and they shall 
condemn him to death , and shall deliver him 
to the gentiles to mock , and to , and 
to him and the third day he shall 
rise again  ( matthew 20 18  . 

wholly different from the normal experience of men , jesus , 
who had never done anything worthy of death , even 
, knew he would die before he was 40 years of age. he 
knew the very city where he would die. he knew that the religious 
leaders of his own race would condemn him to death. he knew that 
one of his own would him. he knew that before his actual 
death took place he would be and  . he knew exactly 
how he would die by crucifixion .  . 

all this is in itself remarkable .  . but more amazing than the 
minute particulars of his was what he predicted 
would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise 
again. he even the time on the third day. 

but since it is on this central fact the death and 
of jesus christ that the whole truth or of chris 
turns , let us examine it more closely .  . 

the body of jesus was in long sheets of cloth 
between the layers of which a great abundance of and 
was  . the body was placed in a which 
had never before been used , and a great was rolled against 
the  . the jewish authorities , fully aware that jesus had 
predicted he would rise again , had the and 
on saturday placed a guard before the to prevent the 
disciples from carrying away the body. early sunday morning some 
of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the 
to further the body. to their utter , 
they found the rolled away , the body gone. they back 
to tell the disciples .  . shortly two of jesus  friends , peter and 
john , utterly skeptical about the whole affair , came and found the 
empty , just as the women had said. even the guards came 
into the city to tell the that had them 
to guard the that the body was gone  ( matthew 28  . 

how did this become empty 

one of the most famous new testament scholars in america 
professor of new testament literature in a large theological 
wrote to the author in answer to my question of how 
the became empty , and wrote it in a letter not by 
or sarcasm , that he could no more explain how the 
became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the 
at christmas time. 

but he did n't realize that santa clause never did come down 
any at christmas time , because there never was a santa 
claus !  .  .  . and . there is a jesus .  . he died he was buried in the 
of joseph of , and on sunday the body was gone. 

those are facts of history. no one can escape the 
of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by 
mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old .  . 

another professor , dr. of university , 
tried to explain the empty by saying  ( what no other scholar 
in the field of new testament criticism has to adopt ) 
that the women went to the wrong  . 

the facts are these 

first , so far as we know , there was no other nearby to 
which by mistake they could have gone. 

second , it is contrary to all similar experience for three or 
more people to forget the place where they have buried their 
loved one within less than three days. even if the women 
did miss the , when peter and john came , did they too go to 
the wrong 

third , were the soldiers guarding the wrong 

there is , of course , a record of an attempt to escape the 
evidence of the empty in the new testament itself. 

now when they were going , behold , some 
of the watch came into the city and showed 
unto the chief priests all the things that 
were done. and when they were assembled 
with the leaders and had taken counsel , they 
gave large money unto the soldiers , saying , 
say , his disciples came by night , and stole 
him away while we  . and if this come to 
the 's ears , we will persuade him , and 
secure you. so they took the money , and did 
as they were taught and this saying is com 
reported among the jews until this day 
 ( matthew 28 11  . 

this is a good of many later attempts to escape the 
fact that the was empty .  . 

you will notice at once that the chief priests and the never 
questioned but that the was empty .  . they never even went out to 
see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true. 

another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that 
the was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus  disciples 
came and stole the body away while they  ( the soldiers ) were ! 

how could they know what was going on while they were 
obviously , such testimony would be in any court. 

even aside from the and that make us reject 
the explanation , the very character and the later history of the 
disciples us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away 
the body of jesus .  . 

first , as professor points out , the leaders of judaism in 
jerusalem , who had put the lord jesus to death , had nothing to offer to 
contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his 
resurrection because all jerusalem knew the was empty .  . if there 
had been here , sooner or later it would have been suspected , 
then proved .  . 

second , surely one of the disciples , even most of them , would 
have the fraud under the persecution they  . 
it may be possible to live a lie , but men seldom die for a lie and most 
of these men did. 

the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ 
had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it 
would have lost it power. instead , this truth swept the world , closed 
temples , won millions of disciples , brought hope to a 
humanity , was the very foundation truth of the early church , and is today 
as and as glorious as ever. 

but not only did jesus come alive again , he did not disappear to 
leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to 
what had happened to him. 

instead , he appeared to them literally , , frequently .  . 

he appeared to the women at the on resurrection morning 
 ( matthew 28 1 10 ) later that day to mary alone  ( john 20 11 
18 ) and to simon peter , also alone  ( luke 24  . in the afternoon he 
walked with two of his followers  ( luke 24 13 35 ) and that 
night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an 
room at jerusalem  ( mark 16 14 16 luke 24 36 40 etc . ) .  . 

a week later he appeared to all of the apostles , probably at 
the same place  ( john 20 26  . once he was seen by above 
on a in (i 15 6 ) and finally to the 
apostles just before his  ( mark 16 19 luke 24 50 52 acts 1 3 
 . 

as with the fact of the empty , so in regard to these 
recorded , all kinds of theories have been proposed 
attempting to deny their  . but these theories are 
unreasonable , without supporting evidence. none has ever won the 
approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the 
 . 

moreover , while it is true we are living in an age when may of our 
scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are 
, let us not forget that some of the greatest 
of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle .  . 
increase , president of timothy , president of yale 
lord , president of edward , president of 
amherst mark hopkins , president of john , president 
of princeton these men and countless others have believed it. 

but suppose christ did rise from the dead , what of it what has 
it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this 
it seals with the teachings of christ .  . 

jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself. he 
claimed to have come down from god. 

he said he was the way to god. 

he said he was the son of god , who alone knew god perfectly .  . 

he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life , and no one 
else had it. 

he said that whatever we ask god in his name , he would grant it to 
us. 

thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day , he revealed 
that in these amazing , predictions , he spoke the truth ! 

do you know any reason , any good reason , why we should not believe 
that his words are all true 

the point is , does not the truth of the resurrection convince us 
that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god 

and then , of course , the fact that christ rose from the dead 
that he has broken the power of death , and that he will some 
day raise us also up from the grave , as he promised .  . 

in other words , if this person , jesus christ , the son of god , in all 
this , he should be the of the foundation of your life. for 
he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins , his 
and help , a joy that no circumstances can ever take away , and a 
hope that more and more unto a perfect day. 

those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been 
many have given their testimony .  . and we today who believe also know.

you say that you were a catholic , but if you do not believe in the christian 
god (i suppose that means the god of the bible ) and publicly state this , 
you are in all probability not a roman catholic .  . public heretics , even 
those who err in good faith  ( material heretics ) , do not belong to the body 
of the church  ( fundamentals of catholic dogma , , , p.  . 

all is not lost , however , as you still might belong to the 
church by your desire to belong to it. as you said , only god can judge 
the condition of a man 's soul .  . about judgment , on the other hand , st. paul 
1 5 12 ) christians to judge their fellow christians .  . 
following the 's teaching , i judge that you should reconsider 
returning to the christian and embrace the god of abraham , isaac , 
and  . he is the god who lives. 

concerning what you were told about non believers when you were a catholic , 
that is true. as i have posted before , vatican ii  ( lumen , ii , 
n .  . 16 ) teaches those who , through no fault of their own , do not know 
the gospel of christ or his , but who nevertheless seek god with a 
sincere heart , and moved by , try in their actions to do his will 
as they know it through the of their conscience those too may 
achieve eternal salvation .  . 

responding to your for opinions on the thinking processes 
of god , the best i can do is refer you to scripture .  . scripture is one 
of the best sources for learning what can be known about god. 

stick with the best.

for putting him on the cross with our sin , yet his prayer was forgive

i do n't know why it is so obvious. we are not speaking of acts of the

moral or immoral , good or bad. emotions just are. the first step is 
not to label his as good or bad or to ourselves so that 
we hide our true feelings , it is to accept ourselves as we are , as god 
accepts us. it seems that paul 's he has accepted and

the people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too , 
too arrogant , or too to discuss this issue since i have yet to

interest to the african american community , everyone has something to gain 
from discussing it. as any knowledgable person should know , christianity 
has been used in this country to the spiritual , emotional , mental 
hold slavery placed on the minds , souls hearts of african americans .  . 
this was most effectively done by the display of white of jesus in

p.s. i expect at least this type of response it does n't matter what

this is true i am not questioning this. but he walked the earth for 3

the general attack on the members of this group seems  . 
there has been discussion of this issue in the past. we ca n't discuss 
everything at once , so the fact that some specific thing has n't been 
discussed recently should n't be taken as a sign of general , 
arrogance or  . in past discussions no one has been by 
suggestions that jesus could be black  ( and it has been suggested by a 
few scholars ) , but the concensus is that he was most likely semitic .  . 
as you probably know , there is a tradition that of jesus in 
art tends to show him as one of the people. thus you would n't be 
surprised to find african art showing him as black , and oriental art 
showing him as oriental .  . there are good reasons to christian 
devotion to think of him in such a way. it 's also good now and then

on sunday at our , we were invited to take the role of

therefore it is appropriate that we the role of the , but 
to no avail. 

, readers , and so on. new things are introduced in the course of the 
and since no one knows what 's happening , the new things have to be 
explained , and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we 're just 
sitting there listening  ( or out , in my case ) to how the mass is about 
to be done. in my mind , i the blame on made up of 
people to be aware of the lord 's presence .  . 

as a former catholic and now as a very active lutheran it is some of the 
of the mass which made me leave the catholic church and return 
to the more traditional catholic the  . 

i spent many years as a reading the passion parts as appropriate in 
the catholic church and i found it very meaningful .  . our lutheran just 
instituted the service for good friday and i was the for 
a paraphrased passion which was exceptional .  . i heard and learned things 
that i have previously in the gospels yet those facts were 
always there. as a matter of interest , the and i were talking about 
the differences between the rc and lutheran church during holy week over 
easter sunday .  . 

as a member of a , i can tell you that the problem 
is certain people , who want to try out all kinds of 
 . the priests do n't seem even to want to make any 
decisions of their own in many cases. i guess it 's easier to try 
something new than it is to refuse to allow it. 

my wife is the member of the in the family  ( called music

but very carefully to the 's suggestions .  . it needs a strong 
hand to lead and guide , to keep the intent and the message clear and strong 
as it should be through and the rest of the year .  . additional 
reason for my leaving the catholic faith lack of any spiritual 
by priests in my  . aka wishy washy . 

as you may gather from my comments , i feel that it is very important , 
regardless of , to have a service mass which promotes 
the true reason that we are gathered there. i am quite comfortable in a 
traditional mass , with receiving holy on the tongue , the 
of  ( not reconciliation ) , of the cross , so on and so forth .  . 
the reason other types of masses and exist is because these feelings 
are not shared by everyone. 

i want more people to church and to find the lord , but i do n't want 
them a show. it 's not. my church works hard to have a meaningful 
service during on , but follow traditional lutheran book of 
worship  . where things are changed or during  ( such 
as the of praise ) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it 
is not there. 

quite frankly , it is very hard for a non catholic to go to a mass and fit in . 
my dear wife never could  ( former  . and holy week masses and 
would intimidate the out of a non catholic .  . those catholics who 
have with me this far understand what i mean. 

please keep in mind why we are there to gather together in worship .  . not 
to worry about how something is done or not done. if there is something 
wrong that you feel needs addressing , by all means talk to your priest or

being religious is a better crutch than being a drug , but 
still maintain that both are escapism .  .  ( and i suspect that there 
are some atheists who would find the substance abuse preferable to

necessarily see themselves as self sufficient .  . if the atheists are 
right , christians are guilty of being morally weak , and too

b. 1 1 10 13 says that there should be no divisions in

another verse which is helpful is hebrews 3 12 15 .  . the church should be 
encouraging daily , as it is their duty to do. 

of course , more standards apply 
1 timothy 4 16 people in the church should be watching their lives 
and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the word entirely  ( ie , 
 . 
acts 17 10 12 the does not come close to the paul 
 ( natural conclusion since the paul talked with jesus directly 
face to face ) , so if the , who were considered noble , did n't take 
paul at his word but checked out what he said with scripture to verify 
his statements , then church members are to do the same and verify the 
's statements .  . if they are not verifiable or valid in light of 
other verses , then that group should be avoided as a church  ( would 've

mean anything to christians other than  the day of the resurrection

the meaning of a word is only what people understand it to mean.

i would beg to differ with you here. the properly formed conscience can 
be trusted virtually all the time. i am not so sure , though , about something 
so as the human brain .  . does that mass of tissue 
anything trustworthy your observation would probably be valid if we were 
discussing the mind of an animal , but the human being is only half animal , 
as it were and half spiritual .  . 

at the moment he stops speaking , and people start interpreting , the 
possibility of error appears .  . did he mean that literally or not we do 
not have any record that he elaborated on the words. was he thinking of 
or con he did n't say. we interpret this passage 
using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions .  . but we know 
that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong.  ( this 
is something that most of us have direct experience of. 8 ) 

now you have hit on the purpose of the church. it is by necessity the 
infallible of divine revelation .  . without the church , 
christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little sects .  . 

unless you are infallible , there are very few things you can be certain 
of. to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking , they 
cannot be certain .  . 

this argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a 
conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience. it reminds me 
of the physicist who said that you can never be certain of 
a because the with the field you are trying 
to measure. now , the experimental physicist will reply that although the 
measurement can never be made with absolute certainty , he is able to 
determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made , and this 
knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough 
to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation .  . 
therefore , although our minds are finite and susceptible to error , our 
in arriving at inductive insights gives in our 
ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true , even in areas 
not subject to the experimental method.

no , imo , mr. missed the point. 

we affirm the absolutes of scripture , not because we are arrogant

i am asking you to believe in things not  . i do n't know if this is 
blindly or not. i'm not sure how comes into it. i do not 
deny reason , indeed i insist upon it , but reason only conclusions from 
evidence. if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the 
evidence of the five physical senses , then you cut reason off from any 
possibility of a conclusion outside the physical  ( beyond the 
rather , if inconclusive , conclusion that the physical is 
not self  . 

so your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences  ( since 
this is the only other source of information left to  . 
how can you then convince somebody that your feelings and experiences 
are the correct ones then if you ca n't show somebody and 
measurable effects if my experiences say that there exists no god 
and yours says there does , where does that leave us since we are only 
going on experiences , then both of us are correct within our own personal 
realities .  . 

furthermore , the trouble with feelings and experiences is that they 
can lead you astray , as the tragic outcome of  . i 
am sure that many of koresh 's followers really believed in him but 
i think that you and i will agree that they were being misled .  . 

finally , how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical 
is not self when you only rely on the five senses 

christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence , 
which they call faith , and which is a gift of god. that is , this evidence 
is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. the 
evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a exists. reasoning 
on the evidence of the senses wo n't help either. but christians do reason 
of the evidence of faith , and do claim that this evidence is wholly 
consistent with the evidence of the other senses , and indeed , that the 
evidence of these other senses is part of god 's revelation of himself 
to us. 

you must be using a definition of evidence that i am not familiar with. 
to me , evidence is something you can show others unambiguously that 
what you are saying is true. 

however , i agree with you that belief in a is a matter of faith. 
it is not something you can share around others must experience it 
 . unfortunately , as i have explained above , this puts 
belief down to a matter of experience. my impression is that christians 
do not have the monopoly on reason , evidence and faith as far as any of 
these things can go. 

in a previous article , () says 

you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything. however , if 
we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone. and since 
we can only use faith , why is one picture of god (e . g .  . hinduism ) any less 
valid than another (e . g .  . christianity ) 

faith , as i have said , is not opposed to reason , it is simply a new source 
of evidence on which reason may operate .  . it is clear that human beings 
have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses , and 
similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by 
faith. religious believers in general , and christians in particular , use 
reason to help through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding 
of the evidence provided by faith. science claims , with good reason , to be 
the most valid system for explaining the physical universe , and christianity 
claims , also with good reason , to be the most valid system , of the 
best evidence , for explaining gods revelations of himself to man. 

at the risk of repeating my argument as i have explained previously , 
the trouble is that moslems , buddhists , jews , etc will all say that they 
claim , with good reason , to be a valid system , of the best 
evidence , for explaining gods revelations to man  ( for buddhists it 
should read for explaining the non existence of god ) .  . so not only 
must you prove your own case , you have to disprove theirs .  . 

messianic . is a good place to see people strong in the belief 
of their own faiths ... and with their own good reasons ) 

if you doubt that christians use reason , read this newsgroup for a while 
and you will see rational debate  . 

i know that all people can use reason ... i never claimed that they do n't .  . 
i just wish to make sure that their arguments are well founded .  . it goes 
without saying that if i make a that i expect people to correct 
me. once we have all gone through this process of removing the 
non essential and contradictory bits , we should  ( hopefully ) have made

i would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged 
couple become married in god 's eyes some say that if the two have 
publically their plans to marry , have made their to god , and 
are committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective 
qualifier ) they are married joined in god 's sight. 

the way i read scripture , a couple becomes married when they are physically 
married , i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse .  . 

some years ago an anglican was discussing the marriage and 
there was some debate on what actually constituted a marriage. 

the of , whose wife of many years had died , and who had recently 
, it must be and looked like that cat that 
got the cream .  . 

so i suppose he at least would agree with you.

another issue of importance .  . was the the will of god or 
a tragic mistake. i believe it was a tragic mistake. god 's will can 
never be accomplished through the disbelief of man. 

i finished reading a very good book , the will of god ,  . 
this was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the 
will of god. 

broke the will of god into three distinct parts 
intentional will , circumstancial will , and ultimate will. he 
 ( weatherhead ) also refuted the last statement  ( above ) by michael 
above quite nicely .  . 

summarizing despite the failures of humankind , god 's ultimate will 
is never to be  . god 's intentions may be with , 
even temporarily by the will of humankind , brought down by 
 . his ultimate will  ( the of all 
humankind ) will never be stopped .  . 

time after time , used the cross as the best description of 
this process at work. his points , paraphrased , were 1 ) god 's 
intentional will was for jesus , the christ , to live out a full life 
and perform the work of the living god. 2 ) the failures , sins , and 
of humankind god 's intent for his son. 3) 
despite the , god 's ultimate will was revealed in the 
cross , as jesus willingly ( not my will , lord , but yours ) died for 
the of all humankind .  . the cross was utterly triumphant , 
even the most cruel of circumstances .  . 

this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth. he 
wanted the jewish people to accept him as the messiah .  . if 
the was the will of god how could jesus pray that this 
cup pass from him. was this out of weakness .  . never .  . many men and 
women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes .  . 
is jesus less than these. no he is not. he knew the 
was not the will of god. 

it was not the intentional will of god. it was the circumstancial 
will , thus the victory of the ultimate will. 


god 's will was that the jewish people accept 
jesus as the messiah and that the kingdom of heaven be established on 
the earth with jesus as it 's head. 

right , intentional will. 

 ( just like the jewish people 
 . if this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what 
kind of world we would live in today. it would be a very different 
world. and that is eactly what god wanted .  . men and women of that age 
could have been saved by following the living messiah while he was on 
the earth. jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would 
have continued his reign after his to the spiritual world to 
live with god. now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to 
wait for christ 's return. but when he returns will he be recognized 
and will he find faith on this earth. is n't it about time for his 
return. it 's been almost 2000 years. 

we know neither the time nor the place. he will return as a in the night. 

peace.

this may be a really one , but i 'll ask it anyways 
christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of 
god , right (i may be wrong , but that is my understanding ) but they still 
try to do it. does n't it seem like we are spending all of our lives 
trying to reach a goal we can never achieve i know that we are saved by 
faith and not by works , but does that mean that once we are saved we do n't 
have to do anything i think james tells us that faith without works is 
dead  . how does this work 

so long as we think that good things are what we have to do rather than 
what we come to want to do , we miss the point. the more we love god the 
more we come to love what and whom he loves .  . 

when i find that what i am doing is not good , it is not a sign to try 
even harder  ( romans 7 14 8 2 ) it is a sign to seek god. when i am aware 
of jesus  presence , i usually want what he wants. it is his , his love 
that my weakness .  . 

stan  . religious studies dept , saint mary 's university , , n . s .  . 
! clyde ! ! water ! ! 

i apologize to the , but the first quote was deleted and i 
would like to respond to both. 

as for the goal we can never achieve , the reward comes from the 
trying .  . paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue for 
the prize over in 3 10 16. only by not living out the 
commands do we and become , to be out by jesus .  . 
as it says in 1 john 5 3 this is love for god to obey his  . 
that obedience is our to achieve for god. of course , this 
requires work on our part. 

as for the quote in james , satan does n't care what we believe. what 
matters is the results of our belief  . if one truly has faith in 
what one believes , one will either act on that faith or be lying to 
oneself about believing in the first place. 

stan , as for your first line , you have a very good point. obedience by 
 ( grudgery ) is not what god desires .  . instead , look at how 
many times the bible talks about being in all situations and when 
doing god 's work. being by the work has no value. also , we 
should do the work necessary whenever we can , not just when we feel 
jesus  presence .  . feelings can us. however , as paul states to 
timothy in 2 timothy 4 2 preach the word be prepared in and 
out of correct , and encourage with great patience and 
careful  . also , remember that paul tells timothy in 1 
timothy 4 16 watch your life and doctrine closely .  . persevere in 
them , because if you do , you will save both yourself and your  . 
so , in order to do the work necessary , we need to be sure that we are 
correct first. remember jesus  warning in matthew 7 3 5 not to be 
about what we do. the best way to this is to be 
a disciple completely in both thought and deed .  .

i that the sinners had gathered for judgment 
before the white  . 
oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate .  . 
they cried for the and the mountains .  . 
they prayed , but their prayers were too late. 
the soul that had put off salvation , 
not i 'll get saved by and by. 
no time now to think of  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . religion , 
, he had found time to die. 
and i saw a great white  . 

now , some have by saying that the fear of hell is not good for 
motivation , yet jesus thought it was. paul thought it was. paul said , 
knowing therefore , the of the lord , we persuade men. 

today , too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft and some of 
it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship .  . we do n't tell people anymore , that 
there 's such a thing as sin or that there 's such a place as hell. 

as has said , this does n't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit 
people over the head with a baseball  . yet the fact remains , there is a 
place called hell. a place so that god died to save us from having to 
experience it. whatever you or i , as christians , do , we should do whatever we 
can to win people to the lord , if for no other reason , to keep them from going 
to outer  . . 

jesus , in mt. 25 , tells us that he did n't prepare hell for people. he prepared 
it for the devil and his angels .  . no where in the bible do i read anywhere , 
that god anybody to go to hell. d . l .  . use to say that the 
elect are the will and the are the wont 's .  . 
whether or not that 's theologically sound , i could n't defend , but its 
practical .  . jesus said to the people of israel , would not. 

now , some of you may not be students of the bible , heck some of you may not be 
christians .  . have you ever said to somebody , i do n't believe in hell. i 
believe in the religion of jesus .  . but did you know that jesus talked more 
about hell than he did about heaven ! oh i believe in the religion of the 
on the mount .  . you find hell taught by jesus in the on the 
mount .  . you 'll read that jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire .  . 
several times he talks about hell and about judgment .  . in fact , over and over 
in the , matthew , mark and luke , jesus talks about hell. not isaiah .  . 
not moses .  . not john the baptist , though he did , but jesus , the son of god. 
the great beloved one preached about hell because he loved people and did n't 
want to see them go there. 

now , if there is no hell then jesus preached in  . it was our lord jesus , 
not some angry baptist preacher , that said , where the worm never dies , and 
where the fire never goes out. jesus said that. it was jesus who called hell 
a of fire .  . it was jesus that used the word , condemnation .  . and 
this is the condemnation , that men love rather than light because 
their deeds are evil. jesus said that. 

how can we get it across to you that a loving , dying jesus preached about hell 
not only that , but he went through hell. that 's what was all about. 
when my lord was on the cross ,  . he called hell , outer 
 . 

do you have this idea that hell is a place where the are over 
here , the are getting over there , and the are 
their bodies over there that 's not what hell is. hell 's not a 
party. there 's no fellowship there. he called it outer  . outer 
away from god. god is light. 

no when he was on the cross , he was made sin for you and for me. god treated 
jesus the way sinners have to be treated .  . that 's is a thought. as my 
son would say , an awesome thought. 

my god , my god why hast thou forsaken me hell is isolation .  . there 's no 
fellowship in hell. there 's no friendship in hell. there 's no loving embrace 
in hell. there 's no hand in hell. there 's no word of in 
hell. 

i thirst .  . it goes much deeper than physical thirst .  . hell is eternal 
with no  . the man whose life was lived for drugs , will it 
 . the man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman 's body , will 
it and not be satisfied .  . one theologian has put it this way 
and i think it deserves merit .  . what is hell hell is just the kind of 
environment that the internal condition of the lost. 

in a recent post , i was trying to remember the founder of the word of life 
 . i 've his name , jack , and found that the 
that i gave was n't his. his was that he was talking 
to his and his 's wife and daughter had just recently been saved 
and he was commenting about it to jack .  . they these and read bible 
verses , and their this and that i ca n't stand it ! jack , do you think 
god would send me to hell jack answered by saying , yes i think he would ! 
of course the said , what do you mean by that. well if you ca n't 
stand living at home with your wife and daughter who and praises to 
god now , what would you do in heaven where they 'll do it for eternity you 'd 
be miserable .  . because god loves you , he 'd put you where it would match what 
you really are. it makes a man think. 

the crucifixion of jesus christ is a fact that the eternal 
existence of hell because on the cross he performed an eternal act. do n't ask 
me how , i do n't know. but he is god and he is the infinite eternal and when he 
died , he died an infinite eternal death. it is by that eternal act that he 
purchased eternal life for the  . he suffered eternal 
judgment .  . 

a lot of people would like to around hell by saying everybody is going 
to be saved eventually.  . my bible says no , he 'll separate 
them. the from the  .  . after . you die there 's a period 
in which god you for heaven. no , my bible says that it is 
unto men once to die and then comes judgment .  . some of the believe in 
 . after you die ,  . just like a you 're 
out. no , in rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as 
there is in heaven. 

i do n't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you do n't enjoy 
listening to them , but we have to preach the entire word of god. there is a 
place called hell. if i could give one verse of scripture that could give any 
hope that people are n't going there , i 'd give it to you , but i have n't found 
it. that fact that there is a place called hell , the fact that our god is a 
god of and must judge sin , the fact that he has made us the kind of 
creatures we are and therefore we 're responsible , the fact that he has placed 
us in a uni verse that has purpose and design behind it , the fact that sin is 
such an awful thing and the fact that god himself went through hell to save us 
from hell leads us to two applications .  . 

1 ) as i 've already mentioned. if you are a christian , you must others. 
its not good enough to stop and fix their flat and not tell them that just 
around the the is out. knowing therefore the of lord , we 
persuade men. 

2 ) if you have n't accepted jesus are your savior , you 're taking an awful 
chance. as i say to the jehovah witnesses  ( who no longer frequent my door ) , if 
you are right and i am wrong , then i will have lived a good life and will die 
and cease to exist , but if i am right and you are wrong , then you will die and 
suffer eternal damnation .  . i do n't mean to make fun at this point , but its like 
said , you 've got to ask yourself ,  do i feel lucky ' well do 
you a man 's got to know his  . do n't be one of the 
wont 's .  . 

because while i was yet a , he died for me. 
there 's no greater love than this , that a man down his life for another.

priority than the direct word of jesus in 14 19 paul begins 
romans 14 with if someone is weak in the faith ... do you count 
yourself as one who is weak in the faith 

do you count yourself as one who is weak in the faith 

you read jesus  word in 14 19 is there any doubt in your mind 
about what is right and what is sin  ( greek missing the mark) 

is there any doubt in your mind about what is right and what is missing 
the mark 

however i 'd like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous 
proof that regular christian worship was on the first day. as i 
indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited .  . 
whereas , the ten commandments and jesus  words in 14 19 are fairly 
clear , are they not 

are they clear or do you have 

no , i do n't believe that paul can god. 

an important first step the that paul was human. 

however paul was writing for a largely gentile audience .  . 

yes , and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best , 
very weak in the faith most could not read , most were with 
the hebrew scriptures in even the septuagint form. paul adapted the 
message of the bible to a largely uneducated market .  . granted , this 
market still exists today , but do you count yourself as part of it to 
be weak in the faith is not missing the mark  ( hamartia ) if you do the 
best that your education allows .  . are you doing the best 

the law was regarded by jews 
at the time  ( and now ) as binding on jews , but not on gentiles .  . there 
are rules that were binding on all human beings  ( the so called 
laws ) , but they are quite minimal .  . 

let me make clear that the law is none other than the of 
genesis , exodus , , numbers , deuteronomy .  . what did jesus say 
about the law in 14 19 where did jesus say that the law only 
applies to jews and that gentiles are above the law 

the issue that the church had to 
face after jesus  death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to 
follow christ .  . the decision not to impose the law on them did n't say 
that the law was abolished .  . it simply acknowledged that fact that it 
did n't apply to gentiles .  . 

who acknowledged this fact on what basis are we extra biblical at this 
point why not also acknowledge that the is the only 
relevant text for gentiles , after all we see in the bible that it was 
from the east who observed the star signs of jesus why bother 
with any texts at all why not just follow whatever the church has to 
say 

thus there is no contradiction with 5. 

i do n't see how you can say this with a straight face. are you a 
follower of christ , or do you follow someone else are you saying that 
the words of jesus only apply to jews 

as far as i can tell , both paul and other jewish christians did 
continue to participate in jewish worship on the sabbath .  . thus they 
continued to obey the law. 

how jewish was paul after he changed his name from 

the issue was  ( and is) with gentile 
christians , who are not covered by the law  ( or at least not by the 
aspects of it) .  . 

who says gentile christians are not covered by the first five books who 
says that gentile christians are above the ten commandments 

jesus dealt mostly with jews .  . i think we can reasonably assume that 
5 was directed to a jewish audience .  . 

you 're implying that jesus  words are valid only for jews .  . is this 
really what you mean to say you do realize that you are rather 
large portions of the bible when you read jesus  words , did you ever 
consider that maybe , just maybe jesus is talking to you , no matter what 
your race or sex if the hebrew scriptures and the gospel accounts of 
jesus are only directed to jews , why were they translated into english 

he did interact with 
gentiles a few times (e . g .  . the whose slave was healed and a 
couple of  . the terms used to describe the  ( see luke 
7 ) suggest that he was a god , i.e. a gentile who followed 
god , but had not the whole jewish law. 

as paul would call him , one who was weak in the faith. 

he was by 
jewish as a worthy person , and jesus accepted him as such. 
this seems to me to indicate that jesus accepted the prevailing view 
that gentiles need not accept the law. 

which is more important 1 ) the recorded word of jesus or 2 ) 
that you can deduce from the bible was jesus god only of the jews , or 
god of all humankind of all race and sex 

however there 's more involved if you want to compare jesus and paul on 
the law. in order to get a full picture of the role of the law , we 
have to come to with paul 's apparent rejection of the law , and 
how that relates to jesus  of the law. at least as i 
read paul , he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a 
certain sense  . 

this is your understanding of paul .  . compare this to the word of jesus .  . 
are you christian or 

again , this issue is n't one of the 
of the law. in the middle of his discussion , paul notes 
that he might be understood this way , and us that that 's not 
what he intends to say. rather , he sees the law as primarily being 
present to convict people of their  . but ultimately it 's an 
impossible standard , and one that has been by christ .  . 

again , this is your understanding of paul .  . did jesus say that the law 
was an impossible standard did jesus say that he the law 
are you christian or 

paul 's comments are not the world 's here , and not everyone 
agrees with my reading. 

you acknowledge that it is your reading of paul .  . what did jesus say 
can you deny that 14 19 is quite clear in its meaning are you 
christian or 

but the interesting thing to notice is that 
even this radical position does not an of the law. 
it still remains as an standard , from which not an 
or may be removed. for its purpose of of sin , it 's 
important that it not be  . 

when did jesus say that the purpose of the law was conviction of sin 

however for christians , it 's not 
the end ultimately we live in faith , not law. 

please reread 14 19 .  . are you christian or 

jesus  interpretations 
the intent of the law , and stay away from the 
details. 

are you saying that the ten commandments are details 

paul 's conclusion is similar. while he talks about the law being 
, all of the specific examples he gives involve the 
law , such as and the sabbath .  . he is quite 
concerned about maintaining moral standards. 

you call of the sabbath , the day on which the lord , 
has been for christians 

.... 

are you christian or 

both. there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is 
not , at least not in this case. jesus did not deal explicitly with 
the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles .  . that 's why i 
have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the  . 

as to general jewish views on this , i am dependent largely on studies 
of theology , one by h . j .  . , and one whose author i ca n't 
come up with at the moment .  . both authors are jews .  . also , various 
christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in 
other newsgroups .  . 

5 19 is clear that the law is still valid .  . it does not say that 
it applies to gentiles .  . 

and yes , i say that the specific requirement for worship on the 
sabbath in the ten commandments is a detail , when you 're 
looking at the of gentiles .  . similarly  . 

i'm not sure quite what else i can say on this subject. again , it 's 
unfortunate the jesus did n't answer the question directly .  . however we 
do know (1) what the 1st  . jewish approach was , (2) how jesus 
dealt with at least one gentile , and  ( 3 ) how jesus  disciples dealt 
with the issue when it became more  ( i'm referring to acts 15 
more than  . given that these are all in agreement , i do n't see 
that there 's a big problem.

what i was asking is this 

please show me that the most effective substance 
programs involve peoples  spiritual needs , rather than 
merely attempting to fill peoples  spiritual needs as 
by the people , a.a , s . r . c .  . , or  . 

you are asking me to provide objective proof for the existence of 
god. i never claimed to be able to do this in fact i do not believe 
that it is possible to do so. i consider the existence of god to 
be a premise or assumption that my philosophy of life. 
it comes down to a matter of faith. if i were n't a christian , i 
would be an agnostic , but i have sufficient subjective evidence to 
justify and my relationship with god. again this is a matter 
of premises and assumptions .  . i assume that there is more to life , the 
universe and everything than ie that spirituality exists. 
this assumption answers the question about why i have apparent spiritual 
needs. i find this assumption consistent with my subsequent 
 . i then find that god fills these spiritual needs. but i cannot 
objectively prove the difference between apparent filling of imagined 
spiritual needs and real filling of real spiritual needs. nor can i 
prove to another person that they have spiritual needs.

more stuff deleted 

this seems to be a pretty definition of belief .  . my beliefs 
are those things which i find to be true based on my experience of the 
world. this experience includes study of things that i may not have 
experienced directly .  . but even then , i can only understand the 
studies to the extent to which i can relate what i study back to what 
i have experienced .  . 

which means that by beliefs about god are directly related to my 
experience of god. having experienced god , i try to make sense of 
that experience. i study religion and read the bible .  . i find things 
that what i have already experienced .  . out of this i build my 
beliefs .  . i also find things that do n't match my experience. that 
does n't make them false .  . they just do n't match my experience. maybe 
i will understand that stuff later. i do n't know. maybe all of my 
beliefs are wrong. i can change my beliefs .  . 

if someone else has beliefs that are different from mine , so what. 
neither of us are necessarily wrong. someone else is making sense out 
of a different set of experiences. even though we have different 
explanations and beliefs , if we talk we might even discover that the 
underlying experiences are similar. 

some people approach religion as a truth that can only exist in one 
form , and usually has a single revelation .  . the more dogmatic and 
the belief system , the more arrogant it will appear to an 
outsider .  . there is another approach possible , however. god is a 
mystery .  . i am trying to solve the mystery , so i look at the evidence 
available to me. i try to arrive at the best understanding that i can 
based on the evidence. new evidence may cause me to change my 
understanding. when i someone with a different belief than

something new about this mystery i can never fully comprehend .  .

any such cases. i doubt it. in the medieval period (esp .  .  . 
when flourished ) argument was a useful tool because everyone 
knew the rules. today , when you ca n't count on people knowing even 
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric , a good argument is 
often from a poor one. 

the last sentence is ironic , since so many readers of 
soc . religion . christian . seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as 
and c.s. lewis .  . 

i have n't followed whatever discussion there may have been on these 
people , but i feel that c. s. lewis is an excellent and i 
see no reason for embarrassment .  . if you think that errors and flawed 
arguments are a reason for dismissing a thinker , you must dismiss 
nearly every thinker from descartes to kant any philosophy course 
will introduce you to their weaknesses .  . 

the above also expresses a rather odd sense 
of history. what makes you think the masses in  day , who were 
mostly illiterate , knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people 
today if writings from the period seem consider that only the 
cream of the , so to speak , could read and write .  . if everyone in 
the medieval period knew the rules it was a matter of uncritically 
accepting what they were told .  . 

i said nothing about the masses .  . however comparing the masses in 
our day and in  day really is odd. read y on 
this. 

i'm talking about the familiar experience of arguing all night and 
on logic and evidence , only to discover your opponent to be 
, even , of things like  ( let alone 
 . (i am assuming that both parties are college 
or better .  .  . ) . myself , i do n't bother any more.

 ( peter white ) relates a story about a person who 
gives a message in which consists entirely of the words  
 . he was asked to from doing that. 


well , brother controlled himself for a while , but a few weeks 
later , the church had invited a missionary in to speak. at the time of 
the meeting where and interpretation were appropriate , who 
should arise to speak but brother  . and off he went as before , 
all the words were  . the was about to apologize for this 
embarrassment when the missionary to speak saying that he 
was sorry that he did not have the interpretation but that he could 
give the translation. in a tribe where he had worked , they only had 
one word in the language ,  . meaning was derived from the 
and other voice qualities .  . brother had given a perfectly 
and reasonable message. 

nice story but it sets off my legend  ( or is it 
legend )  . can the on the net identify the language 
from the description or can they even that such a language 
exists. it seems to be odd enough  ( at least by the standards of 
european languages ) that if it exists , it should be reasonably well 
known to as an extreme case of something or other.

in response to some of the discussions on the sabbath , andrew 
commented that if we really followed we would worship 
on saturday the change to sunday was a law made by the church , and 
we do n't acknowledge its authority to make laws .  . i noted that 
protestants do not consider sunday worship a law. 

he was not referring to the faq but to the five sabbath posted 
on the bible study group. this is what prompted someone to send the faq 
to me. 

the argument against the sabbath is 
that it is part of the law , and like the rest of the 
n law is not binding on christians .  . 

you cannot show , from scripture , that the weekly sabbath is part of the 
laws .  . before you post a text in reply investigate its context. 

if you accept that 
the sabbath is not binding on christians , then the day of worship 
falls into the category of items on which individual christians or 
 ( since worship is by its nature a group activity ) churches are free to 
decide. 

can the churches also decide what is and is not sin interesting. where 
there is no divine imperative of course we must establish rules of 
operation. but we cannot be as creative with what god has explicitly 
spoken on. 



again , in the normal protestant interpretation , sunday is not a law , 
and worshipping on another day is not a sin .  . churches are free to 
decide on the day they will meet , just as they are free to decide on 
the hour .  . it would not be a sin to worship on some other day , but if 
you belong to a church that worships on sunday and you show up on 
monday , you will probably worship alone .  .  .  .

biblical basis for the conception

your head and you shall bruise her or his heel .  . 
genesis 3 . 15 . 

2 ) he who sin is of the devil ...

3) , full of greek , the lord is with thee ...

from the above , we prove the doctrine of the conception .  . 
first , god has given the in genesis 3 . 15 . , which is the 
first promise of a savior , who will mankind from the of 
satan .  . satan was a murderer from the beginning , and has not stood in 
the truth because there is no truth in him. john 8 . 44 .  . now the 
promises several things , enmity between satan and the 
woman , and enmity between satan and her seed .  . now the woman is both 
eve  ( who is the immediate point of reference ) and mary , the second eve .  . 
her seed is jesus christ , and he is also at enmity with satan in the 
same way as mary is said to be at enmity with satan .  . thus , knowing as 
we do that jesus christ is sinless  ( hebrews 7 . , we can conclude that 
mary is also sinless because if she was n't she would 1 ) not be at enmity 
with the devil , as 1 john 3.8 tells us , and 2 ) the relation of her 
to christ 's would be called into question , as 
would god 's veracity .  . for god promised an enmity between mary and the 
, and it is not possible for god to lie or be  . 
second , we have the where mary is called by the 
full of  . as i pointed out above this is from 
the greek word which means not just full of , but a 
or of  . the sense of it is best by 
the to the jerusalem bible , you who have been and 
filled with  . but that is a little to long to say , so it is 
reduced to full of  . and as it says , you who have been mary had 
always been filled with , from the moment of her conception , which 
was also the moment of her salvation , until her death some years later. 
it must be admitted that it is possible that god could have done 
what the doctrine of the conception says he did do. and if 
god could keep himself free from any contact with sin , through his 
mother , he would have , and the bible records this fact , to which the 
fathers of the church such as st. john , st. of

me but since there is n't a heaven , you 're not going there , are you 
him no. 

the point is that heaven is based on faith if you do n't believe in heaven , 
there 's no way you 're going to be in it. 
of course , the next step is , i do n't believe in hell either , so why will i 
be there it seems to me that hell is eternal death and from god. 
most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever , and never 
see god so they do , in fact , believe that they 're going to hell. 
hell does n't have to be worse than earth to be hell because it 's eternal , 
and it 's a lot worse than heaven. that 's the only comparison that matters.

i see no wisdom whatsoever in your words 

i'm not surprised that you see no wisdom in them. that is because your 
premises are wrong from the word go . you claim that christianity is 
based on blind faith , but this simply is not so. just look at the 
current thread on the evidence for jesus  resurrection for evidence 
that jesus was real and that he over death. 

furthermore , you say that christians hold to their beliefs regardless of 
any evidence that you may find to the contrary .  . without any evidence 
to support your claim , this statement is little more than an ad hominem 
argument. 

mind you , i do n't mean this as a personal attack .  . i'm merely pointing out 
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning christianity in this fashion .  . 
it would make much more sense if you could prove that all christians do 
base their belief on empty , and that they do ignore all evidence to 
the contrary .  . only then can you expect your attack to make sense.

hi everyone , 
i'm a commited christian that is with a problem. i know 
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds , yet 
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless , saying  you fools , 
do you still think that just believing is enough ' 

some deleted 

now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone  ( not what you do ) 
as taught in romans , but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james 
in with the christian being  out  

can anyone help me , this really bothers me. 

dear will , 

i 've never replied on this thing before so i hope it gets thru ok. 
i had a few thoughts ! 

faith on its own , if not accompanied by action is dead james 2 17 

faith is both belief and action. 
if i say that i am a great but i never go swimming , am i really a 
and will people believe that i am 
likewise if i say i'm a christian but i never talk to god , am i really a 
christian my faith is demonstrated by my action. the fact that we talk to 
god proves we have faith. satan believes in god but does not follow him ! 

in a similar vein , i have recently been challenged by 3 6 
says we know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands 
i find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that  if we have 
come to know him , then we 'll obey his commands  cos he lives within us and 
we cannot help but obey what he says .  . 
i tend to feel that as we daily submit to god he will keep changing 
us into the of jesus and his fruit and works will be automatically 
produced in our lives. 

hope this helps .  .

the idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a creator

please forgive all the  . i suppose they are to follow 
the argument. 

my point is that if life has meaning or importance then we should try 
to find that meaning or importance which is almost a tautology .  . (i hope 
i'm not being too patronizing . ) . one term for that meaning is creator , 
though that is not obvious from my above argument. 

and the logic is also appalling god must exist because i want him to. 

 ( it 's more like i think , therefore i am , therefore god is. ) 

i have heard this line of reasoning before and wonder how 
it is. certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is 
hopeless  ( or so the and state ) , but i do n't see 
where this is a good reason to become religious .  . if you want  meaning  
why not just join a cult , such as in the leaders will give you 
the security blanket you desire .  . 

unfortunately the term religious is ambiguous to me in this context. 
i could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being 
religious .  . i could say cult followers by definition have given up on 
the search .  . 

if you want meaning why not search for the truth 

so far , my understanding of christianity is congruent with my understanding 
of truth. there have been many before me who have come to conclusions 
that are in ways that make sense to me. by no means does that imply 
that i understand everything.

subject re question about virgin mary 
organization  . , 
lines 74 

i think you 're talking about the assumption of the virgin 
mary . it says that the mother of god , the ever virgin 
mary , having the course of her earthly life , was assumed 
body and soul into heavenly glory. this was defined by a papal 
statement in 1950 , though it had certainly been believed by some 
before that. like the conception , this is primarily a 
roman catholic doctrine , and like it , it has no direct biblical 
support .  . note that catholics do not believe in . 
that is , they do not believe that the bible is the only source of 
christian knowledge. thus the fact that a doctrine has little 
biblical support is not necessarily significant to them. they believe 
that truth can be passed on through traditions of the church , and also 
that it can be revealed to the church. i'm not interested in yet 
another catholic protestant argument , but if any catholics can tell us 
the basis for these beliefs , i think it would be appropriate. 

in the bible , there are a lot of instances where god speaks 
to people , where a person just came to know some piece 
of information , where a person walks off into the desert 
for 40 days , etc. with all of god 's power he certainly can 
do whatever he wants when he wants it. the bible ends 
with the book of revelations .  . but does god 's reign end there no. 
so who can say for sure that god 's messages are either no longer 
happening or still happening 

i can now hear the for proof. 8 ) 
with the cold response i 've gotten from the past from this 
group , it 's very hard to get the point across .  . i 'll only 
go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look 
at documents somewhere. i 've cited the 
bodies of before. they 're still there. 8 ) 
the at , in a miracle 
specifically granted to show god 's existence .  . that was 
the of the sun .  . it was seen in several 
countries. that event is approved by the pope .  . currently , 
images of mary in japan , korea , yugoslavia , , africa 
are showing  ( natural or  . these are still under 
investigation by the church. but realize that 
take decades to finish .  . and if the message is christ will come 
in ten days , that 's a bit too late , is n't it 8 ) .  . 
other events under investigation are inner ( coming 
to know ) ,  ( the person christ 's  . and 
they do n't heal .  . and doctor 's do n't know  . 
non believers are welcome to through documents , i'm sure. 

this stuff is not like koresh .  . or oral  ( give me 
or god will call me  . it 's free. find out why they 're 
happening  ( as we ourselves are studying  . if anybody 
can figure this out , tell us ! you can be of any religion. 
if you have the resources , go to one of the countries i mentioned. 
these are not members only events. god and mary invites 
everybody .  . 

so in conclusion  ( finally ) ... 
we rc 's believe in the modern day manifestations of god and mary .  . 
we are scared to death sometimes although we 're told not to. 
there are more and events. and that is why not everything 
is in the bible . although in a lot of the , we are told 
to read the bible .  . 

as far as the protestant vs. catholics issue is concerned .  .  .  . 
in the end , god 's churches will unite .  . i'm not sure how. 
i have some idea. but the point is we should n't worry 
about the versus part. just do god 's work. that 's all 
that matters. unity will come.

the discussion begins why does the universe exist at all 

one of the laws of nature , specifying cause and effect seems to

i would argue that causality is actually a property of 
causes their effects .  . 

and i must concede here. cause before effect , implies time , time is part 
of  . , the argument would be valid .  . i could return and say 
that this does not infer the cause and effect relationship being unique 
to this , but i wo n't 8 ) , because the point is  . does n't

i also concede that i was , as i asserted no reasonable 
alternative exists , an entirely subjective statement on my part  ( and one 
that could be , given time and further by the 
 . i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily 
that this is how it happened , but a likely description of 
the phenomena in question. am i mistaken with this understanding 

but if you claim that there must be 
an answer to how did the universe  ( our spacetime ) emerge from 
nothing , science has some good for an answer. 

all of which require something we christians readily admit to  . 

the fact that there are several that none are conclusive .  . 
with out conclusive evidence , we are left with faith. 

it could even be argued that one of these may one day be proven  ( as 
best as a non event can be proven ) .  . but i ask , what holds 
someone today to the belief that any or all of them are correct , except by 
faith 

a couple of deleted. summary we ask why does the 
universe exist 

i think this question should actually be split into two parts , namely 

1 ) why is there existence why anything exists 

and 

2 ) how did the universe emerge from nothing 

it is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. however , 
is it a meaningful question , after all 

i would say it is n't .  . consider the following 

apparently it is for many persons .  . hence , we have religions .  . 

the question why anything exists can be countered by 
demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in , 
or in non existence . actually , both questions turn out to be 
of meaning. things that exist do , and things that do n't exist 
do n't exist. tautology at its best. 

carefully examine the original question , and then the counter question . 
the first asks why , while the second is a request for definition .  . it 
does n't address why something does or does not exist , but asks to define 
the lack of existence .  . the second question is indeed , for 
how do we identify something as nothing  ( are n't they mutually exclusive 
terms ) . how do we identify a state of non existence  ( again , this is 
the limits of this simple 's ability to comprehend , and i 
would appreciate an  . 

i might add , the of things that exist do , and things that 
do n't .  .  . do . n't is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable , 
as does the theist 's belief in god. it is based on the assumption 
that there is not a reason for being , something as ultimately 
 ( un)supportable ) as the position of there being a reason. its very 
foundation exists in the same as that of one who claims there is a 
reason. 

we come to this. either i am , therefore i am .  . , or i am for a reason. 
if the former is a answer , then you are done , for you are 
satisfied , and need not a doctor .  . if the latter , your search is just 
beginning. 

i seriously doubt god could have an answer to this question. 

time will tell. 8 ) 


some christians i have talked to have said that actually , god is 
himself the existence .  . however , i see several problems with this 
answer. first , it inevitably leads to the conclusion that god is 
actually all existence , good and evil , and angels , us and 
them. this is , not christianity .  . 

agreed. it would lead me to question their definition of christianity as 
well. 

another answer is that god is the source of all existence .  . 
this sounds much better , but i am tempted to ask does god 
himself exist , then if god is the source of his own existence , 
it can only mean that he has , in terms of human time , always 
existed .  . but this is not the same as the source of all existence .  . 

this does not preclude his existence .  . it only seeks to identify his 
qualities  ( implying he exists to have qualities , btw) .  . 

the best answer i have heard is that human reasoning is incapable 
of understanding such questions. being an atheist myself , i do not 
accept such answers , since i do not have any other methods .  . 

like the theist , we come to a statement of faith , for this position assumes 
that the evidence at hand is conclusive .  . note , i am not arguing against 
scientific , for science is useful for understanding the universe in 
which we exist. but i differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective. i 
seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the 
creator .  . 

i also have discovered science is an tool to answer why . it 
appears that m. pihko agrees  ( as we shall  . but because a tool is 
to answer a question does not preclude the question. asserting 
that  why  is an invalid question does not provide an answer. 

as far as i can tell , the very laws of nature demand a why . that is n't 
true of something outside of nature (i . e .  . , super  . 

this is not true. science is a collection of models telling us how , 
not why , something happens. i cannot see any good reason why the why 
questions would be bound only to natural things , assuming that the 
supernatural domain exists. if supernatural beings exist , it is 
as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. 

my apologies .  . i was using why as why did this come to be . why did 
pre existence become existence .  . why did pre become  . 

but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why . because 
it ca n't be answered in the realm of modern science , does that make the 
question invalid 
i do n't believe any 
technology would be able to produce that necessary spark of life , despite 
having all of the parts available. just my opinion. 

this opinion is also called namely , that living systems are 
somehow fundamentally different from inanimate systems. do christians 
in general adopt this position what would happen when scientists announce 
they have created primitive life  ( say , small bacteria ) in a lab 

i suppose we would do the same thing as when or was 
 ( before someone starts jumping up and down screaming 
inquisition ! , note i said . i certainly hope we 've gotten 
beyond the shooting the messenger  . 

m. pihko does present a good point though. we may need to ask what do i 
as an individual christian base my faith on will it be by the 
of evidence that our sacred or will we seek to 
understand if a new truly disagrees with what god said  ( and 
continues to say ) in his word 

why do i ask why  ( apologies to and company 8 ) .  .

churches. non churches seem to view the use as a sign 
as merely optional , but recommended .  . 

, 

just a couple of minor corrections here .  .  .  . 

1 ) the churches of christ do not usually believe in speaking in 
, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to 
teaching .  . you are probably thinking of church of god in 
christ , the largest african american denomination .  . 

2 ) i'm not sure what you mean by believers but it 
should be pointed out that the of god does not now , nor has it 
ever , held that speaking in is the sign that one is a christian .  . 
the doctrine that traditional  ( including the a g ) maintain is 
that speaking in is the sign of a second experience after becoming 
a christian in which one is in the holy spirit that may be 
what you were referring to , but i point this out because are 
frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in in order 
to be a christian .  . such a position is only held by some groups and not the 
majority of  . many will quote the passage in 
mark 16 about these signs following them that believe but they generally 
do not interpret this as meaning if you do n't the signs you are n't 
saved . 

3) i know it 's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that 
has such diversity , but i think you 've made some pretty big 
here. do only believe in as a 
sign and as prayer but not as with a message 
i 've never heard of that before. in fact i would have characterized them 
as believing the same as except less likely to see as 
a sign of spirit baptism .  . also , while may not be 
inclined to speak in in the non churches they , 
they do have their own meetings and , in many cases , a whole church will be

of time. anyway .  .  . ) . 

the basis for our  ( the catholic church 's ) belief in the assumption of 
mary , body and soul , into heaven is that , to put it simply , the apostles 
and all the early generation christians believed it. in fact , throughout their 
ministry the apostles kept in close contact with mary , and 11 of the 12 were 
present when she died. only thomas was missing when he arrived several days 
later , he asked to be shown her body , and moved with pity , peter and several of 
the other apostles brought him to her  . when they arrived the was 
still  . they broke the , entered , and the body was missing .  . there 
was no sign that anyone had entered , forcibly or otherwise , and everything else 
was laid out exactly as it had been left. the apostles present all believed 
that mary was assumed into heaven and the apostles taught this in their 
preaching  ( of course , this does not appear in any of the texts currently 
considered part of the bible , but it does appear in other writings left behind 
by several of them . ) . , as an church  . founded by the 
apostles ) , we believe that the teachings of the apostles , whether written down 
in the bible or written down in other sources , is true , providing that the 
authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed .  . at least in the case of 
the assumption of mary , the authenticity is quite clear. 

hope this helps i would welcome anyone who has more information to 
add to what i 've said.

i think it 's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere 
man , even if he did claim to be the son of god , and or a prophet .  . 

i 'll pose a question here that 's got me thinking what distinguishes 
true religion from cults  ( i'm speaking generally here , not 
about christianity ) jerry was on good morning america on 
tuesday to answer this question. basically , he said that 
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. 
but , then , christianity is a cult because the message of christianity 
is the person of jesus .  . so what distinguishes , for example , the 
branch cult from the church doctrinal 
differences do n't answer the question , imho , so do n't use them as 
an answer. 


as far as i can see , one of the big differences between and 
christians is in who they follow. i have sometimes tried to put myself 
in the feet of one of jesus 's disciples .  . basically , they gave up a 
lot career , possibly family , and well , a whole bunch , to follow 
jesus .  . 

so what is the difference it is quite plain .  . jesus was good and 
david koresh was not. 

the problem is , i think , is that we try to legislate what is good 
and what is bad in terms of principles .  . for instance , there are thousands of 
laws in the u.s. governing what is legal and what is not. often , it is hard 
to bring people to justice , because it is not possible to find 
a legal way to do it. if only we could trust judges to be just , 
then we could tell them to administer justice fairly , and justice 
would be followed .  . but since judges do n't always get it right , 
we have a complicated system involving precedent and 
of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect  ( the justice 
of man ) into something perfect. but what i hear about the justice 
system in the u.s. tells me that quite the opposite is true. 

there is also a problem that we tend to judge the 
more than the material being presented .  . so we might consider 
a christian to be bad , but an eloquent person from another 
religion to be good. this goes along with the american desire 
to protect the constitution at all costs , even if it allows 
people to do bad things. 

i think that it is the message that is important. if a man is 
presenting a false message , even if he is ever ever so mild , 
then that man is a  . 

i know that i am rambling here. i guess that what i am trying to 
say is that we should n't be looking for principles that tell us 
why the got it wrong. it is not wrong to follow and 
worship a person. but it is important to choose the right person. 
it is simple. choose jesus , and you got it right. choose 
anyone else , and you got it wrong. why because jesus is the 
son of god , and nobody else is. jesus was without sin , and 
nobody else was.

as the noted , i think you mean the assumption .  . catholics 
believe that the virgin mary went to heaven body and soul at 
the end of her life. this is unusual because the normal course of 
events is for your body to in the grave and stay that way until 
the resurrection of the dead. 

well , it was n't that way for and , both of whom were 
translated directly into heaven. it 's beyond my grasp why some object 
that mary , who was far greater than either or , should not 
benefit from the same they recieved .  . she was after all ,

the concept of god as a teacher is indeed interesting. does he grade on 
a curve , does he cheat that is interesting. not to mention thought 
provoking .  . my own concept is that he is a father and we are his 
children. in that he loves us , with a love that we can never understand 
until we are with him. the bible says that he looks on the heart as the 
final measure. from that perspective , in a context , the heart is 
the final test. 
specifically , most christians would agree that there is only one heaven 
and one hell. from that perspective , it is heaven or hell. you either go 
to one or the other. the on a pass fail basis is done by god 
the father with intervention by jesus the son. not by others. for only 
god sees the heart .  . the bible says of the heart ,  .  .  . who . can know it. i 
would say there has always been , and always be , an method. 
that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure .  . in an 
and ever changing landscape he is always the same. yesterday , today and 
tomorrow .  . concerning whether or not our are as part 
of the test , my own conviction is no. were that the case i certainly 
would n't be going to heaven. the bible speaks very plainly about the 
love and care jesus had for and about children. the reality is that we 
are all children. some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair .  . but 
the father , our father is always there. like most fathers he wants only 
the best for his own. there maybe , but there is more love. 
it 's sometimes looks like christianity is a test , to see who makes it 
and who does n't .  . those who do pass heaven , and those who do n't go to the 
other place. but it is really much more than that .  .  .  . 
there are few  . most of us are just looking for the 
light and the way home. praying that we can bring others with us.

subject re certainty and arrogance 
organization uh dept of math 
lines 162 

dr nancy 's writes 

in an earlier article , i explained that what many people find 
arrogant about christians is that some christians profess 
absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines .  . 

and 

in short , the problem is that no matter how good your sources 
are , if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own 
thinking and reasoning , then those doctrines are suspect .  . 

the point that raises is a very lutheran viewpoint .  . 
while reason is a gift from god , it is also by sin .  . 
yet we do not reject reason entirely and neither , i think , 
does  . we need reason , as himself has pointed 
out , to comprehend god 's revelation of himself in the bible .  . 
but reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe 
the word. we need , first and foremost , faith. for the sinful 
mind is hostile to god. it does not submit to god 's law , 
nor can it do so  ( romans 8  . 

luther accepted scripture as the sole means of revelation 
( ) , but accepted the necessity of the use 
of reason  ( with faith ) in that revelation .  . 
yet luther also said , regarding baptism , but mad reason 
forth , and , because baptism is not like 
the works which we do , regards it as worthless .  .  ( large 
, fourth part ,  . to make matters more 
complicated , luther was the sort of theologian that many 
people would describe as an  . i 've seen him 
described as a no prisoners  theologian .  . 

we might conclude , given these observations , that luther 
was inconsistent or mad. and surely at least some have 
come to that conclusion .  . but it might be useful to 
recall that jesus was also called mad. and peter felt 
compelled to defend himself and the apostles against 
a charge of on  . so we as christians 
ought to be careful about rejecting luther  ( or others ) 
as mad. rather , we should imitate the , who 
examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul 
said was true  ( acts 17  . 

the basis for the with which luther , peter , paul , and many 
others preached the gospel was not just reason , but faith and the holy 
spirit .  . this is not faith from reason , but a faith that 
, , and uses reason. the spirit us to know the 
truth and to proclaim it  . god does not want us to preach the 
message that i think that jesus might have risen from the dead but 
rather i know that my lives !  ( job 19  . the christian 
does not side with in saying what is truth but rather 
follows christ , who said , in fact , for this reason i was born , and 
for this i came into the world , to testify to the truth. everyone on 
the side of truth to me  ( john 18  . 

we can know the truth because god has promised us that we can 
know the truth. jesus said , if you hold to my teachings , 
you are really my disciples .  . then you will know the truth , 
and the truth will set you free  ( john 8 31 ,  . the 
urge us buy the truth , and do not sell it.  ( pr 23  . 
the prayed do not to word of truth from my mouth 
 ( ps 119  . evidently he believed that the word of truth 
was in fact his  . 

yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth 
is motivated by self  . but if we present the 
truth as the teachings of scripture , revealed by the 
spirit , and not our own invention , and if we stand ready 
to be proved wrong on the basis of scripture , as luther 
did , then we are not arrogant , but humble .  . we should humbly 
trust in god 's promise of truth , just as we trust in his 
promise of forgiveness .  . 

it is only because of god 's own revelation that we can be 
absolute about a thing. 

but how far does that get you once god 's revelation stops , 
and your own reasoning begins , possibility for error appears .  . 

i agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings 
of scripture , and the products of our own reason even when such 
reasoning is based on scripture .  . however i think i would draw 
the line of distinction more  ) and less  
than you would. 

for example , let 's suppose that our modern bible translations 
include a perfect of jesus words at the last , 
and that jesus said , exactly , this is my body. 

we 'll presume that what he said was totally without error and 
absolutely true. what can we be certain of not much. 

at the moment he stops speaking , and people start 
interpreting , the possibility of error appears .  . did he mean 
that literally or not we do not have any record that he 
elaborated on the words. was he thinking of or con 
he did n't say. 

is almost at the point of making a very lutheran statement 
about the lord 's  . the lutheran approach is to say 
that if jesus said , this is my body , then that is what we 
should believe. other interpretations are rejected simply because 
they are not taught in scripture .  . 

recall that jesus  words do not stand alone on this subject. we also 
have paul 's words in 1 11 17 34 , in which he passed on to 
us , what he received from the lord .  . in particular he said , for 
whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup , you proclaim the 
lord 's death until he comes .  . by these words we should believe that 
the bread that we eat in the lord 's really is bread  ( as well as 
the lord 's body ) as our senses in fact tell us. does this prove 
that is false i suppose someone could say that 
paul spoke metaphorically of the lord 's body as bread , simply because 
that is the way the body appears when we eat it. but this thought is 
found nowhere in scripture .  . so we reject it. thus the primary 
reason for rejecting is not that we can 
prove it false , but that it is simply not found in scripture .  . 

side remark 
i 've been told that the lutheran doctrine on real presence is 
con  . but it has been non who have told 
me this. we tend not to use the word. i almost think that this 
is used more by of comparative religion , who need 
to compare catholic , lutheran and teachings on the lord 's 
 . but almost every church wants to call their own teaching 
real presence because that was the traditional teaching of 
the church. 
end side remark 

when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning 
can never lead them astray when we implicitly claim that we 
are infallible the non christians around us rarely believe 
that claim .  . is hardly going to work when 
the person you are talking to believes that you are either too 
foolish to recognise your own limits , or intentionally trying 
to cover them up. 

this is precisely why christians should not rely on rationalizations 
in their  . it is far better to take the approach , 
i 'd like to show you what scripture says .  . you decide for 
yourself whether to believe it or not. 

 suggested that people read he is there and he is not 
silent , by francis  . i did n't think very highly of 
it , but i think that mr is grossly by many 
evangelical christians .  . somebody else might like it , though , 
so do n't let my opinion stop you from reading it. 

if someone is interested in my opinion , i 'd suggest on 
certainty , by  .

army , for instance and the nt is full of military  . 

b. on the side 

(1) apparently many early christians refused to fight in the roman army , 
or stated that one should refuse if given a choice. but it 's not clear 
whether they were objecting to war per , or objecting to roman policies .  . 

(2) in modern warfare , it seems to be impossible to direct attacks only at 
combatants .  . bombing , both conventional and nuclear , kills lots of civilians .  .

i 've been thinking about the idea that was raised  ( by michael , 
i think) that words mean what we think they mean , regardless of

i grew up in a home where christ was a bad word. people who were very 
angry said it. the word christian meant someone who was not a jew .  . it 
carried of , of threat , of enemy .  . it took some 
time to figure out that there was a connection between  and

they were it was a that i would grow out of. by the time 
they had decided it was n't a , they were sort of used to it. they 
did n't me but they did n't completely accept the situation either. 
for example , they did n't come to my because it was in a church. 
when i visited my in the hospital a few days before her 
death , she said to me , as far as i'm concerned , you still are a jew .  . 
what she meant was that she loved me and me. but i am not a

do consider themselves jews .  . it is not these rules that make people 
jews it is the from the past. i gave up the past. 

this is why i find it hard to relate to messianic jews .  . their 
experience is unlike mine. they still consider themselves jews while 
following jesus .  . some would even say that i must do so , too.

that it is rich in tradition .  . it gives me a feeling of , once again , 
being in the past. 

this is probably one of the reasons why i do n't like it when people mess

teachings .  . further , most people argue that scripture shows worship 
on sunday , and paul it. i understand that these 
points are disputed , and do not want to go around the dispute one more 
time. the point i'm making here is not that these arguments are 
right , but that the backing they claim is scripture .  . 

accepting the principle of does not commit us to 
obeying the entire jewish law. acts 15 and paul 's letters are quite 
clear on that. i think even the sda 's accept it. the disagreement is 
on where the bible would have us place the line. 

by the way , protestants do give authority to the church , in matters 
that are not by god. that 's why churches are free to 
determine their own , church , etc. if you accept that 
the sabbath is not binding on christians , then the day of worship 
falls into the category of items on which individual christians or 
 ( since worship is by its nature a group activity ) churches are free to 
decide.

god has one set of rules for all his people. paul was never against the

never be used as an instrument of salvation .  . and please do not

in matt 5 14 19 christ plainly says what he came to do and you say he was

not so learned christ .  . forget all the theology , just do what jesus says .  . 
your excuses will not hold up in a court of law on earth , far less in

pardon me for being a little confused , but at the beginning of your second

end of the same paragraph you declare , please do not the 
and moral laws in one. not only do i not understand where in the bible you 
find the declaration that there are 2 laws  ( ceremonial and moral ) , but i am 
also on whether you think it is bad to have 2 sets of laws in the first 
place. if it 's bad to have 2 sets of laws , how can there be a law 
that is different from the moral law  ( and vice versa ) 

i would also be interested in your comments on the passage in i  . 10 1 16 , 
where paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying 
depending on whether you are a man or a woman. do you think the apostles can 
different sets of rules for men and women if so , then why not for 
jews and gentiles also , why did paul , who was so opposed to 
gentiles , voluntarily timothy

i 've been working at this company for eight years in various 
engineering jobs .  . i'm female .  . yesterday i counted and realized that 
on seven different i 've been at this 
company .  . 

i coming back to work today. what if my boss comes in to ask 
me some kind of question .  .  .  . 

your boss should be the person bring these problems to. if he she 
does not seem to take any action , keep going up higher and higher. 
sexual does not need to be tolerated , and it can be an 
enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that 
they are trying to do something about it. if you feel you can not 
discuss this with your boss , perhaps your company has a 
department that can work for you while your  . most 
will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety 
does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs .  . 

it is from your letter if you have done this or not. it is 
not inconceivable that remains ignorant of 
problems strife even after eight years  ( it 's a miracle if they do 
 . perhaps your did not bring to the attention of 
higher if the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the 
entire problem , there may be a state agency willing to fight with 
you.  ( check with a lawyer , a women 's resource center , etc to find out ) 

you may also want to discuss this with your , priest , husband , 
etc. that is , someone you know will not be and that is 
, comforting , etc. this will bring a lot of healing .  . 

so i returned at 11 25 , only to find that ever single 
person had already left for lunch .  . they left at 11 15 or so. no one 
could be bothered to call me at the other building , even though my 
number was posted. 

this happens to a lot of people. honest .  . i believe it may seem 
to be due to gross because of the feelings you are 
going through. people in offices tend to be more while 
working than they normally are  ( maybe it 's the or or .  .  . ) . 
i 've had this happen to me a lot , often because they did n't realize 
my car was broken , etc. then they will come back and wonder why i 
did n't want to go  ( this would tend to make me stop being angry at 
being ignored and make me  . once , we went off without our 
boss , who was paying for the lunch ) 

for this 
reason i hope good mr. allows me this latest  . 

well , if you ca n't turn to the computer for support , what would 
we do  ( signs of the computer age ) 

in , please do n't let the actions of a single person 
harm you. they are doing it because they are still the 
and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause. and you should not 
accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless much

you ask where we are. i would that question. i'm not trying to be 
contentious .  . but assuming that the pope has universal jurisdiction 
and authority , what authority do you rely upon for your decisions 
what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that 
papal disagreement is an error that will be in time 
this is especially true , since of have basically 
stood by the pope .  . 

the ultimate question is the traditional theology of the church. this 
is the only thing that it is possible to resist a pope for his 
from the traditional doctrine of the church. if commands 
from any authority conflict with tradition , the commands must be 
 . 

my own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major 
way. god would never allow a hair situation to develop it 
would be too complex for people to figure out. i do n't view the 
present situation in the church as anything extremely complicated .  . 
run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the 
catholic church , and any observer will be  . 

it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is 
over what is tradition and tradition , and also over 
authority and discipline .  . 

the problems from a general widespread ignorance of the catholic 
faith , in my opinion. most catholics know about about the 
catholic faith this leaves them wide open for destruction by 
 . it 's basically the reformation part ii. 

there is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the 
of the catholic church are currently being upon by the 
catholic  . i could go on listing things for an 
hour , probably .  . 

take the situation in , , for example. i'm reading a book 
on what happened there after vatican council ii. the , 
de , never introduced all the changes that followed in the 
wake of vatican ii. he kept the traditional mass , the same old 
, etc. he made sure the people knew their faith , the 
catholic theology of obedience , what modernism was , etc. he 
the people against what was coming .  . 

well , one day the order came from rome for his  . it came 
when the pope was sick .  . de waited until the pope 
, then whether this command was what the pope really 
wanted , or something that some liberal had commanded in his absence .  . 
the pope confirmed the decision. so the good  . 

the that followed was completely incredible .  . a new 
was  . he proceeded to most of de 's 
clergy from their churches , because they refused to celebrate the new 
mass .  . the new would visit a , and celebrate a new mass .  . 
the people would walk out of the church en  . the 
was enraged by this. he usually resorted to the help of 
the secular authorities to the priest from the church. the 
priests would just start building new churches the people were 
completely behind them. the old had the new mass , as the 
desired and virtually no  . 

the prime motivation for all this was completely illegal , according to 
law. no priest can be in any way for saying the 
traditional mass , because of legislation by pope saint v. 
nor is there any to say the new mass .  . 

during all this process , the people of , not just private 
individuals , but including civil authorities , were constantly sending 
and letters to rome to do something about the new 
 . nothing was ever done no help ever arrived from rome .  . 
eventually 37 priests were kicked out , and about 40 , 000 people. 

my question to the of is this 

is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms 
could change and be to those of the pope  ( assuming that 
the pope 's position does not change and that the leaders of 
do n't make such choice . ) . 

if not , this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority .  . 
if i adopt the view that i'm not wrong , i can t be wrong , and 
there 's no way i 'll change my mind , you must change yours , that 
i 've either left the catholic church or it has left me. 

if the pope defines certain things ex cathedra , that would be the end 
of the controversy .  . that process is all very well understood in 
catholic theology , and anyone who does n't go along with it is an 
instant non catholic .  . 

the problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in 
the catholic world. if they knew the faith , and what our are 
doing , they would be shocked ! 

we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real 
traditional teaching of the church is. if this were a simple matter 
east and west would not have been separated for over years. 

this is n't the case in the catholic church. there is a massive body 
of traditional teaching .  . the of the last 150 years are 
especially relevant .  . there is no question at all what the traditional 
doctrine is. 

i thought that the teaching of the church did not allow 
error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term . ` . 
i may be wrong here , i'm not roman catholic .  . ) 

that 's heresy , more or less. although they have done a great job 
since the reformation , the last 30 years have seen so many errors 
spread that it 's  . 

rests in the pope , and in the church as a whole .  . in the 
short term , a pope , or large sections of the church can go astray .  . in 
fact , that 's what usually happens during a major heresy large 
sections of the church go astray .  .  ( the pope historically has been 
much more reliable . ) . everything will always come back in the long 
run. 

what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement 
regarding the situation would it be if not , how 
do you get around the formal doctrine of 
again , i'm not trying to be , i'm trying to understand. 
since i'm orthodox , i 've got no real vested interest in the outcome , 
one way or the other. 

yes , it would be  . is  . but what 
is he going to define that the new mass is a better of 
the catholic faith than the old that sex education in the catholic 
schools is wonderful that all religions are wonderful except for 
that by the prior to vatican ii 

it does if the command was legitimate .  . does not view the 
pope 's commands as legitimate .  . why this is a very slippery slope .  . 

not really start studying the major catholic theologians of the last 
years. everything is very well spelled out. the west at 
critical thought , remember that 's what catholic theologians have 
been busy at for centuries .  .

perceived need 4 ) the biological aspect of humans is  ( that 
is , all aspects of human life can be categorized in a 
structure with biology at the  . 

to say , i disagree with your strong opinion 1 and the 
underlying  . 

christianity is an infectious cult .  . the reasons it flourishes are 
because 1 ) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life 
a safety blanked to hide behind. oh wow .  . all . i have to do is 
follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness. 
for all of you found , how many of you were on the 

i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult . it has 
certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system , in 
spite of various throughout the past two  . 
that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is 
infectious in a sense it may be that it provides 
a workable system for its adherents  ( and i would argue that this 
is the  . 

i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which 
hope and purpose. rather , it points an individual to the one 
source of hope and purpose. there is nothing hidden about a 
christian 's source for hope and purpose. of what usefulness to 
you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose 
and given hope and purpose is the  ( apparent ) loss of 
control over one 's own life the problem or is it something else 

finally , one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following 
christian moral standards. indeed , the sole reason for the existance 
of christianity is because standards are to save people 
from their  . moral standards are merely to the 
christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian 
in the person of god 's spirit .  . 

heaven is one of two final states that 
christian doctrine postulates .  . however , christians are generally 
not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this 
promised future reward rather , they are motivated by the perceived 
benefits to them in the here and now. 

but i digress .  .  .  . the other reason christianity flourishes is its 
infectious nature. a best friend of mine entered a christian 
group and within months , they set ministry for him which 
said this priority 1 spread the word. 

many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a 
priority , and so  ( for it was jesus himself who gave this 
as a priority for his  . however , it is not the penultimate 
priority as evangelism is normally understood (i . e .  . preach the word , 
convert at nearly any cost , repeat with new convert ad  . 
rather , such evangelism is generally best done through respecting 
the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits 
of a christian lifestyle .  . this should be so powerful 
that it the non christian to seek out the christian to ask 
why to say , such a is not easily 
 ( it takes a radical to the person of jesus ) , it 
does not happen quickly  ( so on the part of the christian 
is required ) , and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of 
friendship exist  ( it is ineffective with strangers who cannot 
the over time , and it is easy to or 
harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a 
 . 

as a long time christian  ( nearly 20 years ) , i view with some 
all evangelism programs which incorporate a up 
attitude. may ultimately be worse than no 
conversion at all  ( because the convert s he was 
and christianity when they would have been open 
to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of  . 
the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings 
conviction of wrong doing to people. i am content to do my part 
 ( witness ) and let the spirit do the rest. 

we are just animals .  . we need sleep , food , and we reproduce .  . and we 
die. 

we are far more than animals .  . we sleep , eat , reproduce , and die 
just as other animals do true. but , we are also capable of more 
than this. if your personal vision of humanity  ( or of yourself ) is 
so limited , i can only hope and pray ) that you will someday find 
a more view. 

 ( for reflection , what animals have the wide variety of 
arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language 
of other humans  ( or animals ) but that other animals cannot do so 
how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social 
structures whereas other animals have only one structure ) 

religion  ( especially christianity ) is nothing more than a drug .  . 

blatant assertion .  . christianity is not physically  . 
christianity is not psychologically  . christianity is not 
a thing which one up it is a relationship 
with a living being. you might as validly characterize any close 
relationship with this  . 

some people use drugs as an escape from reality. christians 
themselves with and live with that high. 

there are jesus who let the emotional aspects of worship 
and christian living gain  ( and retain ) the hand. even so , 
this does not by itself the foundation from which these 
things flow. 

it me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious 
wars , of which christianity has had no small part. 

guilty by association that christianity which forces itself 
upon another is not christianity at all. 

when christians see a non believer , they say that person is blind 
to the truth , but they cannot realize that it is they who live 
with this of each day. jesus was just prophet 
who happened to have a large influence because at that time the romans 
were  ( circa 69ad ) the jewish population and communities 
needed some sort of element to keep them strong in that time 
of need. 

you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened 
2000 years ago. how did you come by it 

i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus  influence was a sole 
result of the roman of jerusalem in  . he was 30 years 
gone by this time. it the bounds of to assert 
that nothing about jesus  life was noteworthy until the  . 

i must go. these are but a few of my thoughts on christianity .  . 

christianity is having a relationship with jesus christ himself.

reply to

i have another question i would like to ask. i am not yet 
with any one  . aside from matters of taste , what 
should one use in choosing a church i do n't really know the difference 
between the various protestant  . 

here in america people tend to think of choosing a church much like they 
think of choosing a car or a country club. what i mean is that our 
culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather 
than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer 
an initial and primary part of the decision process. people tend to 
treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to 
their liking , off they go to another one. 

i think that scripture presents the idea that god takes a different 
perspective on the church choosing process . it seems to me from 12 
that god does n't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all 
but that he places us in the body as he wants us. so , i think a better 
question is not how do i choose a church but how do i figure out where 
god is trying to place me. 

if a person was in you to christ , the church they 
go to is a logical first choice. you have been born into the family of 
god. people should hop around from church to church as often as they 
hop from natural family to family. 

if you met the lord on your own  ( so to speak ) there may not be an 
easily church to try for starters .  . here you are more 
like an orphan .  . go and leave yourself on a few 
and see if like home. 

i would n't expect that god want to place you in a church where you 
have difficulty fitting in with the people , but on the other hand 
there are no perfect churches. if you have an attitude of looking 
for problems you will both find them and make them. on the other hand 
if you have an attitude of love and , you will spread that 
wherever you go. 

in general , i think that god will try to place you in a church that 
talks about the lord in the way that you have come to know him and is 
expanding on that base .  .

if the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the 
bible , i have to disagree. various aspects of marriage are discussed 
in some of paul 's letters , 5 sees marriage as a symbol of 
god 's relationship with the church. if it means specifically that the 
marriage is n't described , then that seems to be true. but i 
think what most people mean by christian marriage is not so much that 
it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various 
to each other that are associated with marriage in the 
bible .  .

satan has  ( for some people ) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something 
other than god 's intricate , something other than that on which the 
health of future generations is based .  . it is being treated with respect. you 
think he 's going to happily leave it at that no. when one error is rejected , 
it is his style to push people to the opposite error. therefore the earth is 
not god 's intricate , not because it is rubbish , but because it is 
god. mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve .  . 

i see two of a response to it 

1 care for the environment. treat it with proper respect , both because it is 
god 's intricate and the health of future generation , and because 
showing the of one who is of such things does not 
constitute what the paul called becoming all things to all men so 
that by all possible means i might save some. 

do n't say forget the environment , i 've got important things to spend my time 
on. putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your 
credibility in expressing the things that are more important.

creator .  . show that its beauty and glory points to a greater beauty and

subject re when are two people married in god 's eyes 
organization ai programs , university of ,

to a bit 

the essence of marriage is two people 's commitment to each other. 

if two people claim to be married in their hearts but are not 
willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state , that 's 
prima facie evidence that the commitment is n't really there. 

there are obvious situations in which christian marriage is possible 
without a civil or church if you 're on a desert 
island , or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason 
(e . g .  . , laws against  . 

the legal concept of common law marriage is meant to ensure that 
the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the 
usual and record keeping .  . 

, i'm concerned that people should not use being married 
in god 's eyes as an excuse for living together without a formal  . 
one has a duty to have one 's marriage properly recorded and witnessed .  . 

but there are also people who have been through a 
without making a genuine commitment , and therefore are not married 
in god 's eyes. right

i think the last statement is dangerous. i believe as long as 
someone has formally the responsibility of marriage , they 
have a moral , even if their intention was not right. other 
people are involved in the marriage covenant .  . if they believed in 
good faith that a marriage occurred , then i think there are 
created to them. of course there are situations where 
intent can cause a marriage not to exist. the classic example is when 
it 's done as part of a play .  . but these are exceptions , and should be 
clear to all parties .  .

paul writes 
yes , it 's important to realize that all actions have consequences , 
and that rules were made for our own good. but to suggest that a 
disease is a punishment for certain types of sin i think is 
taking things much too far. 
text deleted 
yes , sin can have terrible consequences , but we need to be real 
careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for 
sin .  . 

i wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions .  . 
i have n't seen anybody write that aids was a punishment for certain 
types of sin  ( this includes mark who you were responding to 
 . i myself wrote that when you do n't do things god 's way that 
will come on you and others. although one definition of  curse  
is   , i only meant  harm or  when i used the 
word. because god loves us he has told us the best way to live in his 
bible .  . god does n't cause , he us of them. 

kevin davis wrote (a while ago ) 
last week i was guilty of , , and whole mess of 
other stuff , yet i am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with 
aids .  . to even suggest that aids is deserved is ludicrous .  . 

the bible makes it clear that we all equally death  ( which is 
much worse than aids ) we have all hurt god with our sin .  . 

paul reveals his feelings 
in case you could n't tell , i get extremely angry and upset when 
i see things like this. instead of rationalizing our own and 
, we need to be out to people with aids and other 
socially unacceptable diseases .  . whether they got the disease through 
their own actions or not is irrelevant .  . they still need jesus .  .  .  . 

the first issue you bring up is your  . it is obvious wrong to 
be angry  ( gal 5 19 20 ) for any reason , especially extremely angry 
which is on par with hatred .  . jesus has every reason to be angry at us 
for putting him on the cross with our sin , yet his prayer was forgive 
them father , they know not what they do. knowing how forgiving jesus 
has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of 
love for him. please do n't give in to , it will only cause 
foolish and more bad feelings. 

it 's okay if you read something that bothers you , but you need to 
address it in a loving way. if right now , i felt like someone out 
there was saying that god punishes gay or immoral people with 
aids because they punishment that others do n't then i would 
frame a response something like this 

it makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that aids , which is 
simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other , is god 's punishment 
for people who have committed certain sins .  . god loves all of his 
children equally and when a single one comes back to him. we 
will all be judged after we die , but until then we all have the 
opportunity to accept god 's by earnestly seeking after him with 
all of our hearts , believing the gospel 's testimony , of our 
sin , that jesus is lord at baptism , and living a new life 
for him. 
let us not judge someone to be condemned .  . god 's is not 
to short to save .  . he will do anything he can to move a heart 
or a misled person. he works for the good of all men. even through 
the worst of situations , he has set the times and places for all men 
that they may perhaps reach out and find him. 

the second issue you bring up is seeing people their 
of people with aids .  . fortunately , what you describe as seeing is 
actually  . you have been missing the points made in the 
earlier posts and in to attitudes that have n't been 
expressed .  . i know that its sometimes hard to discount your 
perceptions , but please try to be open minded .  . 

you are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people 
because they all need jesus .  . this is what my brothers and sisters and 
i do on a daily basis. if you would like to send me the name of the 
city and state you live in , i will find and get you in touch with some 
brothers who have aids or know people with aids and live nearby you so 
that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself. 

the third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual 
aids .  . how someone gets aids is only relevant to their 
salvation in that there may be involved. 

the important point to be made , however , is that not listening to god 's 
commands  ( or advice or warnings ) , i.e. , causes harm or 
to yourself and others. for this reason , a good way to 
prevent the of aids , which can be in sinful ways , 
is to listen to god 's advice and have sex only with your wife or 
husband .  . 

i hope that you are feeling better now , paul .  .

over the years , i have met christians who are not associated with 
any local church and are not members of any local church. this is 
an issue that may be very personal , but is important. what does 
the bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with 
regard to this issue 

this brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much , 
and probably has not been studied much. 

as some of you may be aware , i 've posted a lot of articles lately on 
typing  ( of which the is a test  . to come up 
to speed , just read psychology . and or ask for by 
type summary file. 

one observation is that people have different personalities 
 ( no question on this) which seem to be essentially in born. with respect 
to church and participation , some people thrive on this , while 
other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more 
and lifestyle that is , they are de if 
with excessive to outside activities and lots of 
people. of course this is measured by  . 

my impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact , and 
create that  away  many who are naturally 
 ( there are many characters in the bible , btw) .  . i know , i am 
quite in preference , and find the  pressure  by many churches 
to participate , to meet together in large groups , etc. , to be very 
uncomfortable .  . knowing what i know now , these churches have been overly 
by highly people who thrive on this sort of thing. 
 ( btw , there 's nothing wrong with either or , both 
preferences have their place in the  . 

maybe i should define more carefully since these words 
are usually not used correctly in our culture .  . the 
scale is a measure of how a person is  . the following is 
from my summary 

1. how a person is 

 ( e ) preference for drawing energy from the outside

this will further discussion as to how churches can

are all truths also absolutes 
is all of scripture truths  ( and therefore absolutes ) 

the answer to both questions is yes. 

... 
an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , 
situations , etc. true in every instance possible. do you agree 
with this definition ... 

yes , i do agree with your definition .  . ... 

example of women covering their heads and not speaking 

hold it. i said that all of scripture is true. however , 
exactly what jesus , paul and company were trying to say is not always so 
easy .  . i do n't believe that paul was trying to say that all women should 
behave that way. rather , he was trying to say that under the circumstances 
at the time , the women he was speaking to would best avoid and 
cover their heads .  . this has to do with maintaining a proper witness 
others. remember that any number of statements can be derived 
from absolutes .  . for instance , it is absolutely right for christians to 
for peace. however , this does not rule out trying to maintain world 
peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  ( yes , my opinion . ) . 

i agree that there is truth in scripture .  . there are principles to be 
learned from it. claiming that that truth is absolute , though , seems 
to imply a literal reading of the bible .  . if it were absolute truth 
 ( constant across time , culture , etc . ) . then no interpretation would be 
necessary. 

it may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different 
from person to person. to me , that does n't mean that one person is 
right and the other is wrong. i believe that god transcends our simple 
minds , and that scripture may very well have been with exactly 
this intent .  . god knows me , and knows that my needs are different 
from yours or anyone else 's .  . by claiming that scripture is absolute , 
then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. 
i just do n't believe that god is that  . 

are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth.  ( and there are plenty of other examples . ) . 
can you reconcile this 

sure. the bible preaches absolute truths .  . however , exactly what those 
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion. as i said , the bible does 
preach absolute truths .  . sometimes those fundamental principles are 
clear  ( at least to  . 

this is where the arrogance comes in to play .  . since these principles 
are clear to , maybe the rest of us should just take 
their word for it maybe it is n't at all clear to me that 
their fundamental principles are either fundamental or principles .  . 

i think we 've established that out biblical truth is a matter 
of human interpretation and therefore error prone .  . yet you can still 
claim that some of them may be clear maybe to a certain 
segment of christianity , but to all. 

it 's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
on your own interpretation is absolute .  . 

god revealed his truths to the world , through his word. it is utterly 
unavoidable , however , that some people come up with alternate 
interpretations .  . practically anything can be misinterpreted , especially 
when it comes to matters of right and wrong. care to deny that 

not at all. i think it supports my position much more effectively 
than yours. ) 

so , i think that your position is 
the bible is absolute truth , but as we are prone to error in our 
interpretation , we cannot determine if we have out 
what that truth is. 
did i get that right 

what 's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending 
absolute truth , when we can never know what those truths are , and we 
can never  ( or at least should n't ) act upon them what practical 
difference can this make

what makes common law marriages wrong 

a common law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. there is 
nothing in the bible  ( old or new testament ) about getting married by 
a preacher , or by a priest  ( jewish or  . and in fact jewish 
priests have never had any connection with  . 

there is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the 
 . in fact , the traditional christian view  ( at least in the 
west ) is that the and are the of the marriage , 
and that the is there only as a witness .  . 

however ! 

the essential of a marriage is commitment .  . two 
persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound 
themselves by promises to live together as husband and wife , 
all others , till death do them part. 

the reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who 
is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public 
is in order that society , and the couple themselves , may be 
clear about whether a commitment has been made. 

suppose that we do away with the public , the standard , 
etc. instead , we have a man and a woman down to live 
together. 
after a year or so , the man says to the woman hey , honey , it 
was great while it lasted , but i think it 's time to move on. 
she says what are you talking about 
he says i am leaving you and looking for someone and

she says but you ca n't .  . we are married ! 
he says what are you talking about we never got married .  . 
she says i remember what you said to me the night 
we first made love. you said my love for you is as deep as the

he says oh that ! that was just rhetoric .  . just  . when a 
man is in a mood , he is bound to say all kinds of silly 
things like that. you must n't take them literally .  . 

and that is why you have an on a formal that is 
a matter of public record .  . 
the church insists on it , because it is her duty  ( among other 
things ) to give moral advice , and you cannot give a man moral advice 
about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married 
to whom , if anybody , and vice  . 
the state insists on it , since the state has a concern with 
property rights , with child care and support , and therefore needs to 
know who has made what to whom .  . 
fathers in law insist on it , because they do n't 
want their daughters and abandoned .  . 
insist on it , because they want to make 
sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment , 
or just  . 
and persons making themselves insist on making them 
formally and publicly , in order that they may be clear in their own 
minds about what it is that they are doing , and may know themselves 
that this is not just rhetoric .  . this is the real thing. 

hence the on a formal public explicit of the 
marriage commitment .  . the church goes further and insists that , when 
christians marry , a shall be present at the and 
record the on behalf of the church , not because it is 
impossible to have a valid without a , but in order 
to make sure that the couple understand what the christian teaching 
about marriage is , and that they are in fact promising to be married 
in a christian sense. the church also prefers a standard marriage 
, and is wary of letting write their own , for much 
the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they 
draw up a will or a contract .  . certain language has been repeatedly 
used in , and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. 
try to say the same thing in your own words , and you may find that 
the judge 's interpretation of them is not at all what you 
intended .  . similarly , the church prefers to avoid endless 
about whether you are my main and i am here for the long 
do in fact cover the same territory as all others 
and till death do us part. 

this topic has come up on the list before.  ( is there any topic 
that has n't ) one was asking , if a couple love each 
other and are living together , is n't that marriage in the eyes of 
god eventually someone asked , in that case , what is their status 
if they break up is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce 
are they in a relationship that god forbids either of them to walk 
out on the original questioner said good grief , i never thought 
of that ! in fact , there are reasonable grounds for that 
someone who says , we do n't need a piece of paper or a in 
front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each 
other , is trying to have it both ways to have the of 
marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of 
bother .  . 

at this point someone may say , none of this applies to me and my 
mate. we are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong 
commitment ,  for better or worse , all others , till death 
us do part . ' . so in our case , no is needed .  . 
to this my reply would be the reason for requiring a 's 
license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road. what is wrong in 
itself is not the existence of drivers , but the existence 
of dangerous drivers .  . however , and drivers is an 
obvious and reasonable means of the goal of reducing the 
number of dangerous drivers on the road. therefore the state 
makes and enforces such laws , and you the citizen have a positive 
moral to from driving without a license no matter 
how much of a behind the wheel you think you are. 

back to the original question. we have a who knows a 
couple who have been living together for around 20 years. he asks 
at what point did they stop and start being married i 
answer at the point , if any , where they both definitely and 
explicitly accepted an to be faithful to each other , for 
better or worse , as long as they both lived .  . if they have accepted 
such an , what are their reasons for not being willing to 
declare it in front of , say , a justice of the peace

when your authority starts telling you to do things , you should ask

one question comes to mind , especially since my last one was not answered

there is a lot of talk about the sabbath of the being  . 
answer this 

since the commandments is one law with ten parts on what biblical 
basis have you decided that only the sabbath portion is 
or you say that the seventh day is the sabbath but not applicable to 
gentile christians .  . does that mean the sabbath commandment has been 
references please. 

if god did not intend his requirements on the jews to be applicable to 
gentile christians why did he make it plain that the gentiles were now 
into the commonwealth of israel

in soc . religion . christian . you write 

regarding david 's prophecies .  . while i'm not real sure of 
his credibility , i do remember a book he wrote , called a vision or 
something like that. he made a prediction that people who bought gold 
would be hurt  . at the time , gold was up to about 
now it is less than half that. this prediction stuck in my mind 
because a lot of people where i worked were buying gold .  . 

note that the above type of prediction does not require a god to be made. 
an expert in a field can also things based on experience. 
beware of predictions like the will tomorrow ! do n't 
follow the preacher because of such statements that come true. 

note also , that if i'm describing a  ( hypothetical ) death of a friend as 
a result of his passion for fast , i might say his mother 
predicted he would die. of course , his father may have said he 'll 
make good money because of his and depending upon the final 
outcome of the situation i end up mentioning the one that 's 
relevant .  . a reader down the road will get the impression that the 
mother or father had predicted accurately the event , when it was just 
a casual statement. 

finally , on , note that there are many that can be 
fulfilled my people , often to fool believers .  . if i say , beware , the 
terminal will be shut off ! and then after 2 i turn 
it off  ( or have someone come out from another room and do it) there was 
no prediction .  . a similar situation with the of 
the jewish state. while for it , prominent jews argued that it 
was predicted that they 'd have a state again , and that the time has 
come. (i 've read this somewhere , but ca n't think of the source if 
you can , please let me know . ) . in this case , the of the 
state does not really fulfill the prophesy since the prophesy was used 
in order to push for the of the state. 

what was a fulfillment of prophesy is very tricky .  .

reading this imagery as the roman catholic church was certainly 
common in earlier protestant writers .  . a lot of us find that frankly 
now , though some of our readers will certainly advocate 
such a position. the problem is that the description makes it look a 
lot like a political entity .  . it 's associated with kings , 
world commerce , is on seven mountains  ( 17 9 recall that rome 
is traditionally regarded as built on seven  . if it 's a church , 
then it 's not the current roman catholic church , but a church that has 
been taken over by the anti christ and with the state , turning 
into something rather different than it is now. presumably in such a 
scenario the true catholics are among those who are persecuted .  . given 
the overall impression that satan is to be an angel of 
light , and the true church is a persecuted remnant , i think the most 
consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti christ 
would be presiding over a church that claims to be the of both 
the protestant and catholic traditions , but that the true spiritual 
descendants of both peter and the are equally being 
persecuted .  .

... moreover the buddha says that we are 
intrinsically good  ( as against christ 's we are all sinners ) .  . 

i never thought of these two ideas being against each other. 
people might quibble about what intrinsically means but the 
reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we 
are. the message of christ is that each of us are not only good , 
but great , that we can approach , perhaps through a 
different than you claim buddhism teaches .  . because we do 
not realize our greatness , we sin .  . peter had no problem walking 
on water until a little doubt in. 

does n't david ask in the psalm what is man that you god 
should care for him , but you have made him just a little lower 
than the angels 

i probably exagerate in my mind what a little kid david 
was , just as i probably exagerate what a 
was , but david 's power easily 's .  . 

remember the rich young man who comes up to jesus and asks what 
he can do to enter the kingdom , jesus says follow the commandments .  . 
i always picture the look on his face as he says he 's done that 
his whole life , probably an from the 
messiah .  . instead jesus gives him a harder task , sell everything 
and follow him. jesus is the bar .  . the say 
how can anyone do this if it 's so hard even for rich people. 
jesus says anyone can do it , with god 's help. 

jesus says not only can we avoid killing people , we can avoid 
getting angry at people. not only can we avoid committing 
adultery , we can control our own desires .  . 

i realize this was not your main point , but i wonder how other 
people see this.

would you have become a christian if you had not 
been by your parents you probably never learned about 
any other religion to make a comparative study .  . and therefore i claim

your point about how hard other religions are is a good one , just 
as your question is a tough question. i think that muslims 
worship the same god as i do , we can learn from their name submission . 
and buddhists and , etc. claim that god is  . 
is god personal or i say yes , but if i think a little 
more my answer is is greater .  . i think it is greater 
to be a personal entity , with an individual consciousness , but 
you 're right that that might be a cultural bias .  . if i think more 
i must admit that god 's personal nature is as far beyond my 
conception as his nature is beyond the hindu 's 
conception .  . if somehow jesus could fit into hindu 
then maybe i would n't have a problem , though that is hard to imagine.

that the catholic of of the spouse into the faith 
was too  ( and restrictive due to time as we had already set a 
date ) , and we were married in a christian church which was non  . 

during the years of our marriage , we did not often church. 

when our daughter was born , some years later , my wife insisted that she 
be as catholic .  . this was n't a problem with me. 

during a separation of five years , my ex wife was taken ill with a disease 
that affected her mental  . she was confined to a mental ward for 
two months before it was  . it has since been treated effectively . 

in other words , have deemed her a member of society. 

during the , my ex wife has buddism .  . her influence over 
my daughter has been substantial , and has primarily allowed me only saturday 
for a number of years. during this period i have read bible study 
books to my daughter , and tried to keep her aware of her christian  . 

last fall , our divorce was after a year of divorce  . 
at that time i was awarded rights every other weekend. at that time , 
i started taking my daughter to church quite often , although not every weekend. 
i did this to attempt to the christian and her to a 
religious community. 

today , easter sunday , i took my daughter to church. when it came time for 
, my daughter took the bread  ( the body of christ ) but left the wine 
 ( the blood of christ ) that she was too young for wine .  . she then 
the bread up in her hand and tried to it under the 
in front of us. 

i feel this was a in the face to me , my religion , and an to her 
religious  . it can be construed as breaking several of the commandments 
if you try. i really felt by the action. 

my daughter is only years old , but i think she should have been old and 
enough to realize her actions .  . i have difficulty blaming her directly 
for religious teachings her mother to , but when i discussed this with 
my daughter she made it clear she believed in buddhism and not christianity .  . 

my initial response of  ( moderated ) was to suggest if there is no faith 
in christ then why does she celebrate easter , or christmas i suggested i 
would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by 
with her again. 

i do not want to drive her from the , and would be willing to allow her 
to continue practicing buddhism  ( as though i had a choice seeing her only 
for two days out of fourteen ) but i want her to want to embrace christianity .  .

no , imo , mr. missed the point. 

we affirm the absolutes of scripture , not because we are arrogant 
moralists , but because we believe in god who is truth , who has revealed his 
truth in his word , and therefore we hold as precious the strategic importance 
of those absolutes .  . 

mr. seems to have rather strangely from truth to absolutes .  . 
i do n't see how that necessarily follows .  . 

are all truths also absolutes 
is all of scripture truths  ( and therefore absolutes ) 

if the answer to either of these questions is no , then perhaps you can 
explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths , and 
which truths are absolutes .  . 

the answer to both questions is yes. 

all scripture is true , being inspired by god. the evidence for this 
claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group. 

similarly , all truth is absolute .  . indeed , a non absolute truth is a 
contradiction in terms. when is something absolute when it is always 
true. obviously , if a truth is not always true then we have a 
contradiction in terms. 

many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world. such a 
statement is terribly self contradictory .  . let me put it to you this 
way. if there are no absolutes , should n't we conclude that the statement , 
there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously , we have a 
contradiction here. 

this is just one of the reasons why christians the world by claiming 
that there are indeed absolutes in the universe. 

there is hardly consensus , even in evangelical 
christianity  ( not to mention the rest of christianity ) regarding 
biblical interpretation .  . 

so people sometimes disagree about what is true. this does not 
the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe. moreover , 
evangelical christianity , at least , still to believe in certain 
truths .  . man is sinful , man needs salvation , and jesus is the 
for mankind 's sins , to name a few. any group that does not profess to 
believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical .  .

here. this is n't the right group for it. their beliefs about jesus 
appear to come as much from the koran as the bible .  . this means that 
while they honor him , what they think he did and stood for differs in 
many ways from christian beliefs about him. but moslem beliefs are 
an appropriate topic for soc . religion . islam .  . 

as i'm sure you know , many christians believe that you must accept

my advice is this if you know someone that you have the for who is 
not a christian , them and try to develop just a friendship with 
them. at the same time , witness and share the gospel with them , not so 
that you can date them , but so that they can be saved .  . once they become a 
christian , then it is quite possible to let the relationship progress 
beyond friendship .  . however , if they do n't accept christ , you still have a 
good friendship and you have n't a lot of emotional energy and gotten 
hurt. 

while i agree with most of jon says (i deleted those parts , of course) , i 
have serious about this advice. maintaining a 
friends  level of relationship is much easier said than done. people 
usually end up getting hurt. this is especially likely to happen when 
they start off with feelings of attraction .  . 

when people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement .  . 
i 've had the experience of going quickly from believing that i should n't 
date non christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to 
believing that sex is fine when people really love each 
other. when the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to 
their original state. 

this is an especially extreme case because i was young and away from home 
and fellowship .  . i do n't think it would work exactly this way for most 
people. however , it 's important not to the power of 
feelings of attraction .  .

hi , no matter what system or explanation of creation you wish 
to accept , you always have to start with one of two premises , creation 
from nothing , or creation from something. there are no other 
alternatives .  . and if we accept one or the other of those two 
premises , then again there are two alternatives , either creation was 
random , or was according to some plan .  . 
if it was random , i am unable to accept that the complex nature of 
our world with and creatures 
could exist as they do. therefore i am left with creation under the 
control of an intelligence capable of such a scheme .  . i call 
that intelligence god. 
i also prefer the ex rather than from chaos , as it 
is  . 
there is obviously no way to prove either or neither .  . we are and 
we must have come from somewhere. choose whatever explanation you 
feel most comfortable with ,  . you are the one who has to live 
with your choice.

if you are using the standard of fully god and fully human , 
that i'm not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human. i 
think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic 
definition of humanity .  . it 's a consequence of the fall .  . jesus is 
human , but not a fallen human. 

i differ with our on this. i thought the whole idea of god coming 
down to earth to live as one of us subject to sin and death  ( as one of 
the prayers in the book of common prayer  ( 1979 ) puts it) was 
that jesus was tempted , but did not  . if sin is not part of the 
basic definition of humanity , then jesus fully human  ( nicea ) would not 
be subject to sin , but then the resurrection loses some of its meaning , 
because we our humanity most when we sin .  . to distinguish 
between human and fallen human makes jesus less like one of us at the 
time we need him most. 

these issues get mighty subtle .  . when you see people saying different 
things it 's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously 
different things , or whether they are using different terminology .  . i 
do n't think there 's any question that there is a problem with 
, and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form 
without a real human nature or will is heretical .  . but i 'd like to be 
a bit wary about the , , etc. recent discussions 
suggest that their position may not be as far from 
as many had thought. was an extreme 
representative of one of the two major schools of thought. more 
moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox , e.g. theodore of 
 . my impression is that the modern groups 
inherit the entire tradition , not just  version , and that 
some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as 
orthodox .  . 

first , the inherited none of 's version they 
were on the opposite end of the spectrum from him. second , the historical 
record suggests that the positions attributed to were not as 
extreme as his  ( successful ) opponents  ( who wrote the conventional history ) 
claimed .  . mainly opposed the term for mary , arguing 
(i think correctly ) that a human could not be called mother of god. i mean , 
in the creed we talk about the son uncreate surely even 
would concede that jesus existed long before mary .  . anyway , 's 
opponents claimed that by saying mary was not , that he claimed 
that she only gave birth to the human nature of jesus , which would require 
two and distinct  . the argument fails though , because 
mary simply gave birth to jesus , who her either divinely , 
if you accept as commonly defined , or both , 
a la  . 

second , i am not sure that is not a better alternative than 
the orthodox view. after all , i find it hard to believe that pre 
that jesus 's human nature was in heaven likewise post  . i think 
rather that god came to earth and took our nature upon him. it was a 
nature , capable of being tempted as in  ( since i believe the divine 
nature could never be tempted ) but in its of weakness the divine nature 
 .

there may be differences in what we mean by subject to sin . the 
original complaint was from someone who did n't see how we could call 
jesus fully human , because he did n't sin .  . i completely agree that 
jesus was subject to  . i simply object to the idea that by 
not succumbing , he is thereby not fully human. i believe that you do 
not have to sin in order to be human. 

i again apologize for confusing and  . i 
agree with you , and have said elsewhere , that there 's reason to think 
that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in 
fact heretical .  . there are scholars who maintain that was 
not  . i have to confess that the first time i read some of 
the correspondence between and his opponents , i thought he 
got the better of them. 

however , most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to 
was an advance , and that was at the very least 
and dogmatic  ( as the editor of the controversy 
refers to him ) in rejecting all approaches other than his own. as 
regular usenet readers know , can be just as much an 
as being wrong. furthermore , he did say some things that i 
think are  . he responds to a rather mild letter from 
with a flame worthy of usenet .  . in it he says to attribute also 
to the , in the name of the the characteristics 
of the flesh that has been with him ... is , my brother , 
either the work of a mind which truly in the fashion of the 
greeks or that of a mind with the insane heresy of and 
and the others. those who are thus carried away with the 
idea of this association are bound , because of it , to make the divine 
have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some 
degree in and stand in need of assistance because of his 
... these things are taken falsely when they are put off 
on the deity and they become the of just condemnation for us 
who the falsehood .  . 

it 's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between 
humanity and divinity .  . but the whole concept of is based 
on exactly the idea that the divine does in fact have to some 
degree a part in being born , growing up , and dying .  . of course it 
must be understood that there 's a certain in the  
participation in these things. but there must be some sort of 
between the divine and human , or we do n't have an 
at all. seemed to think in black and white 
terms , and missed the sorts of one needs to deal with this 
area. 

you say i find it hard to believe that pre that jesus 's 
human nature was in heaven. i do n't think that 's required by 
orthodox doctrine .  . it 's the divine that is eternal .  .

is an area on which christians do not agree. i suspect 
that 's because our primary source of information is prophets and 
, and their writings tend to be highly  . however 
both jesus  teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation 
to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and 
eternal death. on a number of jesus does say things that 
imply some sort of , e.g. lk 10 14 and a number of 
similar passages where jesus says things like even will be better 
off than you in the judgement .  . also , i 3 talks about someone who 
gets into heaven , but by the of his , as it were. but these 
passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens , 
so much as levels of or punishment in heaven or 
hell  ( and not all christians would even go as far as  . the only 
christian group i know of that believes in multiple heavens is the 
mormons , and they are very far from mainstream christianity  ( far 
enough that many of our readers would not call them  . their 
ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations , in addition 
to the bible and holy tradition of a more generic christian sort .  . 

note that many christians will at the very thought of

i am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly 
how far god 's  . will he accept people who do n't 
explicitly acknowledge christ , but somehow still follow him in their 
hearts many christians believe that this is possible , at least in 
principle , but certainly not all do. jesus provided us with a clear 
description of how to be saved , but it 's not clear to me that he 
provided an exact description of how he 's going to place the 
line. certainly he made it clear that we ca n't expect to know whether 
other individuals are saved or not.

i must have missed the postings about , david koresh , and the second

person claiming to be it is obviously insane 

one rule of is that if a person is making the claim , they are 
wrong. i was just reading john 14 this morning (i think that is the 
right chapter , anyway it is close and i do n't have a bible at work to 
check with . ) . and in it jesus is talking to his disciples about his 
death and he says that he will be going away and then later 
he will be with them. he said something along the lines of i will 
be in you and you will be in me.  ( again i cannot provide the exact 
quote or citation . ) . anyway , my understanding of this is that 
the second coming will not be an event. it is an 
event , christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. 
if you look for a person you will be  . 

it seems to me that the jews had been looking for a messiah that would 
be a political or military leader and so did n't recognize jesus when 
he came .  . jesus tried to show that his kingdom was not of this earth. 
a lot of what i have seen written about the second coming seems to 
based on an expectation of christ coming back and finally taking over 
the world and running it the way it should be. it sounds a lot like 
what the jews were looking for. the first coming was n't like that and 
i see no reason for the second coming to be like that either. 

oh and by the way , i do n't expect it to happen once. there is no one 
second coming , there are a lot of little ones. every time christ 
comes into heart , christ has come again.

if the is infallible , and this is a matter of faith , then the 
pope cannot be wrong ! if , on the other hand , this is not a matter 
of faith , but a matter of church law , then we should still obey as the 
pope is the legal head of the church. 

in other words , given the doctrine of , we have no choice 
but to obey .  . 

this is a primary problem in the church today. what you are saying is 
more or less heresy .  . you might call it . it 's the 
idea that the pope is always right in everything he says or does. 
this is virtually all over the place , especially in this country. 

the pope is only infallible under certain very specific and 
well defined conditions .  . when these conditions are not met , he can 
make mistakes .  . he can make big mistakes .  . 

a couple historical examples come to mind. 

robert was perhaps the greatest product of the 
english catholic church. at one point during his career , the 
pope decided to one of his in an english see. 
said that this would happen over his dead body  ( though 
maybe not in so many words you have to treat with respect , even 
when they are wrong) .  . the problem was that this would just 
the of the see , and probably never set foot there. 
this would the people of the see of a shepherd .  . 
was quite right in what he did ! 

another example is that of pope john , a pope of the middle ages. 
he decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the 
vision until the last judgement .  . he decided that this should be a 
defined doctrine of the church. though he did n't quite get around to 
defining it. now there 's no way this is compatible with catholic 
doctrine .  . the pope 's doctrine was criticised by many in the church. 
he went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail , even .  . in 
the end , he had to admit his mistake. shortly before he died , he 
 . his made the exact opposite idea a dogma of the 
church. 

if you consult any of the great catholic theologians who treat of such 
subjects , such as st. robert (a doctor of the church ) , you 
will find detailed discussions of whether the pope can personally fall 
into heresy or  . 

the teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a pope 
must be resisted if they are to the of the catholic faith. 
a pope 's authority is given for the purpose of building up the 
catholic church. commands in conflict with this purpose have no 
legal or moral force.

she was conceived , and so never subject to original sin , 
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life. this was 
possible because of the special degree of granted to her by god. 

she is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to god , 
and everything that from that relationship .  . 

the catholic church sees her as the new eve .  .  ( the fathers in the

1 ) jesus was n't really descended from david as the messiah was supposed 
to have been. joseph was , but christians say that joseph was n't related to 
jesus  . 

if you look at the of christ in luke 3 and the one in 
matthew 1 you will notice that they trace different lines back to david .  . 
i have been told that one traces mary 's line back to david and the other 
traces joseph 's line back to david .  .  ( both of them go beyond david in 
history ) to some of my jewish friends , is passed 
to a child by the mother and the legal rights of are passed 
through the father .  . if it is true that one of these geneologies is 
mary 's , then christ 's is from david through his mother. this 
also means that christ had all of the legal rights of a of 
david as according to at least roman law  ( and possibly law as 
well , but i am not sure ) joseph was christ 's legal father .  . 

the argument for luke 's being that of mary is very weak. according 
to luke 3 23 

and when he began his ministry , jesus himself was about 
thirty years of age , being supposedly the son of joseph , 
the son of , 

aside from the fact that mary is not mentioned , there are two possible 
interpretations either joseph was her father or he was her brother .  . 
clearly this is not acceptable .  . a third would be that joseph , the son 
of , was her father and just happened to have the name as the man 
to whom she was  . but that would seem to be at 
 . the most straightforward interpretation is that luke had no 
intention of mary 's  ( in which case he would have 
named her ) but that he traces her husband 's , from david 's son  . 

the matthew list most definitely traces down from david 's 
son , solomon , to joseph .  . matthew 1 16 reads 

and to was born joseph , the husband of mary , by whom was born 
jesus , who is called christ .  . 

there are two apparent problems. the first is , how to reconcile the 
two which diverge with the sons of david , 
solomon and  . the second is , why is any of joseph 
at all , if joseph had nothing to do with it. if joseph was 
not jesus 's physical father , then the original poster is quite 
correct , that claims for jesus 's messianic are not based on 
truth but only on , whatever jesus 's divine nature was. 

the second problem is easy , in my mind. we assume that joseph was not 
involved in the conception of jesus in any way. however , a holy 
spirit capable of working a physical conception in mary is also 
capable of the physical agency of joseph 's seed in this 
work. in our times we interpret and its loss 
solely in terms of a physical act , whereas it is really a matter of 
on a much higher level as well. the important thing is that 
neither mary nor joseph was conscious of any union between them  ( they 
had not known each  . thus the first gospel 's of 
half its chapter to the of joseph is quite relevant 
to jesus , the virgin birth not  . 

to the first question there is an answer that creates , to begin with , more 
problems than it  . it is that the two are 
the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different 
sets of parents .  . except for the names of the parents and the child , and 
the in bethlehem there is no point in common between the two 
stories. matthew and luke converge in their accounts only thirty years 
later with the baptism of jesus in  . offered his 
explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge 
with their accounts of the one jesus of nazareth .  . he did not derive his 
resolution from biblical study or speculation , or from other external 
documents , and the discussion of how this could be might bring us beyond 
the limits of for this newsgroup .  . in any case , the 
details are described in 's the spiritual of the human 
being and of humanity , the gospel of st. luke , and the gospel of st. 
matthew . 

whether or not 's methods and explanation are accepted 
as valid , at least this interpretation the apparent 
contradictions of the two while leaving the text  . 

as for the passing of one 's through the mother , this was 
never an issue with jesus .  . no one ever questioned his or mary 's 
 . the issue of the has to do with his 
line of descent from david , the king .  .

in a previous article ,  ( pixie ) says 

do the words question authority mean anything to you 

i any theist to reply. 

well , despite what my mother told me about accepting , here goes. 

you have to be very careful about what you mean by question authority . 
taken literally , it is nonsense. that which is is , 
and to say i question to word of this authority is ridiculous .  . if it is 
open to question , it is n't an authority .  . on the other hand , it is perfectly 
reasonable to question whether something is an authority .  . the phrase 
here should be authority .  . once you have 
your authority , you must believe what it says , or you are not treating it as 
an authority .  . 

the difficulty is that an authority is not easy .  . you 
can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency 
in what it teaches , or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of 
discourse .  . but the fact that i cannot discredit something does not , in 
, it.  ( nor does the fact that i can convince myself and 
other that i have discredited something mean that it is false . ) . 
i cannot an authority by its teachings , 
because if i can verify its teachings , i do n't need an 
authority .  . i need an authority only when there is information i need which 
i cannot get for myself. thus , if i am to an authority , i must 
do it by some means other than by examining its teachings .  . 

in practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we do n't 
have time to fundamental knowledge for ourselves. every scientist 
today assumes , on the authority of the community , all sorts 
of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to 
verify for himself. 

in spiritual matters , we accept authority because we have no direct source 
 . we select our authorities based on various  . (i am 
a catholic , in part , because the historical claims of the rc church seem 
the strongest . ) . without authorities there would be no subject matter for 
belief , unless we simply made something up for ourselves  ( as many  . 

the atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities .  . this is a 
reasonable assertion in itself , but it leads to a practical difficulty .  . 
if you reject all authority out of hand , you reject all possibility of 
every receiving information. thus the atheist position can never possibly 
change .  . it is non falsifiable and therefore  . 

to demand or rational proof of god 's existence , is to deny 
god 's existence , since neither science , nor reason , can , in their very

those with bibles on hand can give the exact chapter verse .  .  .  . 
at the time jesus told peter that he was the , he said 
whatever you hold true on earth is held true in heaven , and 
whatever you do n't hold true wo n't be true in heaven. 

therefore , with respect to marriage , the has to be 
done by an rc priest .  . no big parties required. just the priest , 
the couple and witnesses .  . divorce is not allowed .  . but 
are granted upon approval by either the or the pope 
 ( not sure if the pope this  . 

maybe i'm a little tired but i ca n't seem to follow the logic here. if 
whatever is held true on earth is held true in heaven how is it that a priest 
 ( rc only apparently ) is required. 

in fact if i read the next verse correctly  ( matthew 18 19 ) i understand that 
for a marriage to take place only two are required to agree on earth 
one thing and it shall be done. 






mark disclaimer my opinions. not harris  

the lost los 

unfortunately i have n't been able to find any completely precise 
statements about what is needed .  .  ( as usual , the current edition of 
the catholic encyclopedia is vague . ) . i do know that the 
priest is viewed as a witness , and thus in some sense would not be 
required. however part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid 
any about who has and has not taken on the commitment .  . the 
community provides support to marriage , and in cases of problems are 
involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of 
their commitment as possible. thus marriage must be a public 
commitment .  . the presence of a priest is required for a regular 
marriage. where i'm not clear is exactly where the are in 
exceptional cases ( valid but ) .  .  ( 1907 ) says that 
no marriage involving a catholic is valid without a priest  ( according 
to the oxford dictionary of the church ) , and they imply that the new 
law this , but i 'd rather see a more recent and 
authoritative source. note that while a catholic priest is required 
for catholics , the catholic church does recognize marriage between 
non catholics as valid without a priest .  .

just a quick 

the way you are interpreting those passages is your opinion. you make 
it sound as if your opinion is somehow an fact. 

many would interpret the passages you cite very differently. 

 ( many have several of the great theologians you mentioned do that 
very thing. these were people who had much more expertise in the 
interpretation of scripture than you or me or probably anyone reading 
this newsgroup .  . to say that all of them are wrong and you are right 
is , in my opinion ,  ( notice those last three words ) coming pretty 
close to the sin of pride .  . 

in the future i would suggest you not be so absolutist in your

here 's a question that some friends and i were last night. 

q if you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that

my contention is that if you answer this question with no. i would 
not then remain a christian then you really are not one now. 
following jesus christ has everything to do with in 
his work and spreading the news that the kingdom of heaven is already 
among us. fear based religion is not a faith relationship with the 
one who made us all. 

so does that mean that anyone who is a christian to avoid hell is n't really 
a christian at all it sounds like it to me.

now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone  ( not what you do ) 
as taught in romans , but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james 
in with the christian being  out  

if you agree that good works have a role somewhere , you will 
generally find yourself in one of two camps 

(1) faith works salvation 
or (2) faith salvation works 

either (1) works are required for salvation , or (2) faith will 
inevitably result in good works. 

i am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone , based on 
2 and romans 3 21 31. i also conclude that james 2 , when 
read in context , is teaching bullet (2) above. when james speaks of 
justification , i would claim that he is not speaking of god declaring 
the believing innocent in his sight  ( paul 's use of the  . 
instead he is speaking of the 's profession of faith being 
justified or proven by the display of good works. also according 
to james 2 , the of such works is evidence for a dead or 
useless faith which fails to save .  . 

james 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it 
is teaching (2) .  . works would have their place , not as merit 
salvation , but as evidence of true faith.

dave he is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to 
gain what he cannot lose .  . jim  ( 1949 ) 

there are of course a number of other possibilities .  . the

salvation faith works

that no of this form can do it justice.

robert wrote 
i would like to get your opinions on this when exactly does an engaged 
couple become married in god 's eyes some say that if the two have 
publically their plans to marry , have made their to god , and 
are committed to one another (i realize this is a subjective 
qualifier ) they are married joined in god 's sight. 

the way i read scripture , a couple becomes married when they are physically 
married , i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse .  . 

e.g. the end of genesis 2  ( quoted from memory ) this reason , a man shall 
leave his parents and be joined to his wife , and they will become one flesh   
 ( jesus also quotes this scripture referring to  . 

if you read through genesis in particular , you will often come across the 
phraseology man with woman , and she became his  . this 
implies that she became his wife when they together , i.e. at the 
point of intercourse .  . 

compare this with jewish tradition joseph , when he heard that mary 
was pregnant , had it in mind to divorce her but mary and joseph were 
, not married .  . i.e. , they were in a binding relationship  ( which 
required a divorce to get out of ) , but marriage would not occur until mary 
and joseph went to together. 

compare with christ and the church  ( ephesians 5 , revelation 19 ) the church is 
described as the   of christ , but the marriage of the lamb takes 
place when jesus returns .  . i.e. , we are in a binding love relationship with 
jesus , but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will 
take place. i see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse , 
because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and god. 

in summary , engagement should be as a binding relationship , but it is 
not marriage. a civil is not marriage either. marriage occurs at the 
point when the couple go to together. (i do n't mean to the 
civil or church ours was great ! i do n't mean to be too ) . 
historically , i think i am correct in stating that the civil (i . e .  . a 
marriage by the state ) , has only been around in the west since 
napoleon , who introduced it to keep on the people  ( although i'm ready to be 
on that point ! ) 

this view obviously raises some questions 

what about those who have had sex with one or more partners , without considering 
marriage. are those people also   

if it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse , is it necessary 
to be married in the eyes of the state (i would say yes , because this 
the laws of our nations in the west .  . although it is not illegal to sleep 
together though in most western countries , i believe that it is god 
to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before 
actually our marriage. its to do with our being salt and light , and 
also to do with how people will perceive us i.e. it is 
to declare yourself married without going through a civil ) .

in article writes 
re are you christian or 
both. 

sure , why not but , are you using paul to correct the words of jesus 

there is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is 
not , at least not in this case. jesus did not deal explicitly with 
the question of whether the law was binding on gentiles .  . 

so anyone who even one of the smallest commands and teaches 
others the same way , will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the 
skies whereas anyone who keeps the commands and teaches them too , will 
be known as someone great in the kingdom of the skies .  . 19  ( gaus ) 

are you an anyone or are you a no one 

why not assume , that since jesus did n't say that his words apply only to 
jews , that they apply to all human beings , of race or sex 

why not assume , that even though jesus did not mention your name , still 
jesus was talking directly to you 

that 's why i 
have to cite evidence such as the way jesus dealt with the  . 
as to general jewish views on this , i am dependent largely on studies 
of theology , one by h . j .  . , and one whose author i ca n't 
come up with at the moment .  . both authors are jews .  . also , various 
christian and non christian jews have discussed the issue here and in 
other newsgroups .  . 
5 19 is clear that the law is still valid .  . it does not say that 
it applies to gentiles .  . 

does it say that it applies to you are you anyone or no one 

and yes , i say that the specific requirement for worship on the 
sabbath in the ten commandments is a detail , when you 're 
looking at the of gentiles .  . 

8  ( 11(jps ) remember the sabbath day and keep it holy .  . days you 
shall labor and do all your work , but the seventh day is a sabbath of 
the lord your god you shall not do any work you , your son or 
daughter , your male or female slave , or your , or the stranger who 
is within your  . for in days the lord made heaven and 
earth and sea , and all that is in them , and he on the seventh 
day therefore the lord the sabbath day and it. 

note there is no specific requirement for worship here , however i for 
one would not be so bold as to call these verses a detail. 

similarly  . 

do n't many christians still practice 

i'm not sure quite what else i can say on this subject. again , it 's 
unfortunate the jesus did n't answer the question directly .  . 

it 's unfortunate that jesus did n't use your name directly , or maybe 
jesus did are you somebody or nobody 

however we 
do know (1) what the 1st  . jewish approach was , (2) how jesus 
dealt with at least one gentile , and  ( 3 ) how jesus  disciples dealt 
with the issue when it became more  ( i'm referring to acts 15 
more than  . given that these are all in agreement , i do n't see 
that there 's a big problem. 

if you do n't see a problem , then perhaps there is none. as paul closes 
romans 14  ( gaus ) 

in short , pursue the ends of peace and of building each other up. 
do n't let dietary undo the work of god. everything may be 
clean , but it 's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit .  . 
better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your 
brother is offended by. as for the faith that you have , keep that 
between yourself and god. the person is in luck who does n't condemn 
himself for what he samples .  . on the other hand , the person with 
about something who eats it anyway is guilty , because he is n't acting on 
his faith , and any failure to act on faith is a sin .  . 

as far as i know , christians  ( except specific jewish christian 
groups , and maybe some of the both of which are very 
small groups ) do not practice on religious grounds .  . in 
some countries it has been done for supposed health reasons , but i 've 
not heard it argued that it is being done because of the biblical 
commandment .  .

now , as to the suggestion that all prophecy tends to be somewhat cyclical , 
can you elaborate i'm not exactly sure what you mean. how does the 
suggestion relate to isaiah 's prophecy of the birth of christ by a virgin 
i do n't see any in that prophecy .  . 

maybe cyclical is not the best word. ... 

another example would be the scripture quoted of judas , and his 
let another take .  . another example is something that isaiah said of his 
disciples which is also applied to christ in hebrews , the children thou 
hast given me. 

how does the view account for this phenomenon .  . 

ah , double fulfillment .  . first of all i would say that i'm not sure all 
the prophecies had double fulfillment , e.g. , the isaiah 7 14 prophecy .  . 

i would say that just because this happens on some does not mean 
it will occur always , especially with regard to nt prophecies .  . the apostles 
who quoted the ot and applied those passages to jesus were acting as divine 
and giving the inerrant word of god to the church. no one has 
that authority today. no one has the authority to say that 
such and such a prophecy has double fulfillment .  . if the of 
revelation fits with events of the 1st century , it is folly for us to try 
and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.

should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis. 

actually , there was very little to the book. first of all looking at 
the titles of her other books , i would personally consider her 
to be engaged in a bizarre form of christian like 
by eastern  ( great titles like 
the astrology of the 4 ) .  . 

however , other than the chapter one into , there 's nothing original , 
biased , or even new this book. it is basically a collection of previously 
published works by those who claim that there exist buddhist and hindu 
stories that christ visited india and china  ( he was known as issa ) 
during the period from late to age 30 .  . 

conclusion the book actually lets you come to your own view by presenting 
a summary of various published works and letters , all of which you 
could verify independently .  . it includes refutations to such works as 
well. therefore , even if you think she is theologically , this

these verses do not show that god 's love is qualified but rather that he

an emphasis on hell. god deserves our love and worship 
because of who he is. i do not like the idea of frightening people into

make it appear he had  . since jesus was buried in the grave of a 
man well know to the , to say that they did n't know where he was

here again , the problem with most of the individuals posting here , you take the 
biblical account as though it were some sort of historical in the 
modern sense. i would refer you to john book the cross that 
spoke  . and row ,  . the earliest texts which we have make no 
reference to an empty  . nor is an empty necessary for a claim of 
resurrection .  . modern fundamentalists have completely missed what 
the point of resurrection is here the work of george 's work 
resurrection , immortality , and eternal life in judaism  ( publ 
cambridge , univ .  . press , 1972 ) is most helpful .  . look at 1 1 3. paul 
here has no need of an empty  . in 1 15 , here again there 
is no mention of an empty  . he was raised  ( note the passive ) , he appeared , 
no either. 

resurrection could be accomplished without ever the bones in the 
grave .  . the whole idea of an empty is n't in any of our texts 
until well after the fall of jerusalem .  . by that time , the idea of coming up 
with a body would have been  . moreover has argued  ( convicingly , 
i think) that the empty story first appears in mark  ( we have no texts

now , you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. but think on 
this a moment .  . would you die to maintain something you knew to be a 
deliberate lie ! if not , then why do you think the disciples would ! now , i'm 
not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth , 
but to you , it is a lie. many have done this. no , i'm talking about 
dying , by , stoning , crucifixion , etc. , for something you know to 
be a lie ! thus , you position with regards to the disciples the 
body seems rather lightweight to me. 

as for , why risk the severe penalties for grave over 
the body of jesus he was n't buried with great  . so , again , this is 
an argument that can be discounted .  . 

that leaves you back on square one. what happened to the body ! 


again , let me comment that the most plausible non christian scenario , 
and the one typically suggested by who are knowledgeable 
about the nt , is that the resurrection was a subjective event , and the 
empty stories are a result of accounts growing in the telling .  . 


you are quite right here. even the idea of a subjective mystical event as the 
foundation of the resurrection narratives is currently becoming more  .

consider someone 's or refusal and then say whether they are 
obedient or . you also have to take into consideration 
whether the commands are good or bad. 

you ask where we are. i would that question. i'm not trying to be

what prevents me from choosing any doctrine i like and saying that 
papal disagreement is an error that will be in time 
this is especially true , since of have basically 
stood by the pope .  . 

it appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is 
over what is tradition and tradition , and also over

my question to the of is this 

is there any way that your positions with respect to church reforms 
could change and be to those of the pope  ( assuming that 
the pope 's position does not change and that the leaders of

if not , this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority .  . 
if i adopt the view that i'm not wrong , i can t be wrong , and 
there 's no way i 'll change my mind , you must change yours , that 
i 've either left the catholic church or it has left me. 

the orthodox church does not recognize papal authority jurisdiction 
authority as present in each , and in

regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of 
the of rome from the orthodox church. without going into 
the merits of the great , at least the orthodox agree that 
a split occurred , and do n't what appear to be games

is effective .  .  .  . . words aside , it appears to be a de facto split .  . 

so where are we are we in another heresy , complete with weak

way to answer that is to examine who is saying what , and what the 
traditional teaching of the church is. 

we sould argue from now until the second coming about what the real 
traditional teaching of the church is. if this were a simple matter 
east and west would not have been separated for over years. 

many catholics will decide to side with the pope .  . there is some 
soundness in this , because the is infallible , so eventually 
some pope will straighten all this out. 

i thought that the teaching of the church did not allow 
error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term . ` . 
i may be wrong here , i'm not roman catholic .  . ) 

what would be the effect of a pope making an ex cathedra statement 
regarding the situation would it be if not , how 
do you get around the formal doctrine of

since i'm orthodox , i 've got no real vested interest in the outcome , 
one way or the other.

it does n't work the other way around not all are

in the new testament  ( sorry i do n't have a bible at work , and ca n't

their heads in church. now , this is scripture .  . by your definition , 
this is truth and therefore absolute .  . 

do women in your church speak do they cover their heads if all 
scripture is absolute truth , it seems to me that women speaking in and 
coming to church with bare heads should be to  . 
yet , clearly , women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
heads .  .  ( at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew 
up in . ) . 

are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth.  ( and there are plenty of other examples . ) . 
can you reconcile this 

the problem you see here is that some christians claim things about 
the bible which they do n't actually believe or practice. i 've known 
all sorts of christians , from the of to 
the fire fundamentalists , and although many on the 
conservative side of the christian faith do claim that the bible is 
a  ( perhaps the ) source of absolute truth , i do n't know of anyone 
who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition .  . 
while i am not a roman catholic , i believe this is close to the official 
position of the rc church  ( perhaps an rc would like to  . 

the particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in 
terms of the social context of the time. you would think the fact 
that the seem to have to break out the and 
and give you some big song and dance about why this 
 ( other passages as well ) are n't directly applicable today would 
show them that what they claim about the bible and what they 
actually practice are two different things , but mostly it  . 

while this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of christians , 
i would suggest that some of the problem is really , in this 
case , making claims about the bible which the do n't actually 
put into practice. but if we step back from the name calling and 
look at what people are attempting to say , we see that they are trying 
to express very the unique place the bible holds within the 
christian faith. so when people use such words or phrases as word of 
god , inerrant , , the 's handbook , the 
only rule of faith and practice in the church today to describe the 
bible , we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at 
the mere words they use. some of the above descriptions are 
false and others are self contradictory , but in my experience people are 
generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even 
when the speaker 's words are at with their intentions .  . a biblical 
example is from the garden of where god asks where are you and adam 
explains that he was and afraid and himself. if adam had 
answered god 's words he would have said something like i'm here in this 
tree. the problem seems to arise when christians insist that these 
words are indeed accurate of their  . most people 
have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of 
the place of the bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases 
and explanations that others use. 

i hope this helps .  .

again. it always gives me  . but last week we were invited to sit 
during the gospel ( passion ) and listen . besides the invitation , 

on sunday at our , we were invited to take the role of 
jesus in the passion .  . i declined to participate .  . last year at the 
meeting i pointed out how we christ by our sins , so 
therefore it is appropriate that we the role of the , but 
to no avail. 

, readers , and so on. new things are introduced in the course of the 
and since no one knows what 's happening , the new things have to be 
explained , and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we 're just 
sitting there listening  ( or out , in my case ) to how the mass is about 
to be done. in my mind , i the blame on made up of 
, but that may not be just .  . i do think that a has a 
bias doing something rather than nothing that 's just a fact of 
life even though a simpler may in fact make it easier for 
people to be aware of the lord 's presence .  . 

as a member of a , i can tell you that the problem 
is certain people , who want to try out all kinds of 
 . the priests do n't seem even to want to make any 
decisions of their own in many cases. i guess it 's easier to try 
something new than it is to refuse to allow it. 

at our on holy thursday , instead of the priests feet 
( who wants to get around people 's feet , according to one of our 
priests ) the was invited to come up and help one 
another 's hands. 

the of this action me , and again i refused to 
participate .  . i thought that if we were to have to come up with 
for this action (i . e .  . body of christ amen 
for receiving communion ) , that they could be i am not responsible for 
the blood of this man. 

also for part of the prayer ( are you , god of 
all creation .  .  .  . ) was some text read by a couple. the 
priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to 
others , and i was so that i declined to receive 
that night  ( we are n't required to anyway i instead offered up 
prayers for our priests and  . 

so we 've been wondering are we the , or is the quality of the mass 
going down i do n't mean that  . we go to mass every thursday or 
friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple to make us aware 
of god 's presence .  . but as far as the sunday masses .  .  . maybe . i should 
just offer it up ) has anyone else noticed 
participation in catholic masses lately 

the quality of the mass has not changed. again , if it were to be 
according to the set down by the church , it would 
still be beautiful .  . the problem comes about from 
people trying to be creative who are not. 

i think the answer to your question on participation could be that 
given by father peter in answer to the question posed by 
the title of thomas day 's why catholics ca n't . they do n't 
want to because of all this nonsense. 

by the way , for any non catholics reading this , the problem does

the last sentence is ironic , since so many readers of

this may be unfair to lewis .  . the most prominent fallacy attributed 
to him is the liar , lunatic , and lord . as quoted by many 
christians , this is a logical fallacy .  . in its original context , it 
was not. 


exactly. 

c. s. lewis has taken a couple of pretty severe in this group lately. 
first somebody was accusing him of being self righteous and unconvincing .  . 
now we are told that we christians should be embarrassed by him.  ( as well 
as by , about whom i have no comment , having never read his 
work . ) . 

anyone who thinks that c. s. lewis was self righteous ought to read his 
introduction to the problem of pain , which is his  . in it , he 
explains that he wanted to publish the book  . why although he 
believed in the argument he was presenting , he did not want to seem to 
presume to tell others how they should be in the face of their own 
suffering .  . he did not want people to think that he was presenting himself 
as some kind of model of , or that he was anything other than what 
he considered himself to be a great coward .  . 

has adequately the question of whether we ought to be

well you know that religion has caused more wars than 
anything else 
it bothers me that i cannot seem to find a 
response to this. after all if our religion is all about 
peace and love why have there been so many religious wars 

of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics , 
the answer would be that the cause of war was economic .  . my observations 
over the past 30 years  ( and not a little history reading 
beside ) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of 
the conflicts , so does  ( unfortunately ) race , economics and any other 
items that identify one group of men as being different from another. 

if we want to the cause of conflict in christian terms , i would 
put it while christ died for our sins , we are yet sinners .  . while some 
individuals assume , most of us do not even 
come close. 

i realize that in many ways this is a answer , but i guess that 
it is my way of rationalizing man 's constant  ( or so it seems ) 
conflict .  .

i have a question for you all related to this. jesus condemns divorce 
several times in the new testament , and i have a hard time with this. 
the catholic church  ( as far as i can tell ) does grant with 
the statement that the marriage never really existed in god 's eyes. 
 ( please , if i am , correct me . ) . however , i have 
witnessed marriages where two people were very much in love but 
recognized that they were destroying themselves and each other by 
staying in a marriage , and that the problems were due to personal 
childhood issues that had never been  . i ask you , is divorce 
justified in such a case they knew who they were , what they were 
doing , they were deeply in love , but in the end , it did not work out. 
i must admit that i do n't see jesus forcing them to live together , or 
even condemning that they go and seek happiness with someone else 
later on. opinions 



i am your ! i bind unto myself today 
i am your religion ! the strong name of the 
i own you ! trinity .  .  .  .  . no disclaimer what 
st. patrick 's is there to 


this is a commonly discussed question , though it 's been long enough 
that i 'll allow it to be asked. as you might expect , there is a range 
of answers. catholics and some others will say that divorce is never 
justified .  .  ( by the way , in situations where someone is being , 
or for other serious cause , separation is allowed by all traditions 
that i know. no one should be forced to stay in a situation where 
they are in danger . ) . others see it as a last resort in situations 
that have fallen apart enough that the best we can hope for is 
to choose the lesser of evils .  . in some sense the difficult legal 
question turns out not to be divorce , but  . that 's because 
of jesus  statement in mark 10 11 12 and par .  . as with so many other 
things , this turns on your approach to the bible .  . conservative 
protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions .  . 
more liberal ones are willing to make for situations where 
a literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  ( it is noted 
that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost 
on a  . thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is 
that jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing , not 
to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be 
exceptions . ) . catholics , as is typical with catholic ethics , take a 
hard line , but allow for exceptions in practice through 
the process of  . in the last discussion most of our 
non catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that 
in some cases there might be no good alternative , but there was a 
feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of 
helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that 
come up during it , and that in a properly run church , divorce 
should not be necessary.

, 

i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on the 
newsgroup , and i think that they can be used to explain each other. 
unfortunately i do n't have direct quotes  .  .  . 

1 ) atheists believe that when they die , they die forever. 

more correctly when people die , they cease to exist. 

2 ) a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death 
is unfair .  . 

i do n't see what the problem is ! to christians , hell is , by definition , 
eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die. 

the idea i 've gotten is that to christians , hell is like heaven 
afterlife i.e , you do n't cease to exist , but are to eternal 
torture  ( well , that 's the orthodox idea anyway eternal death if you 
prefer  . atheists do n't believe in any sort of afterlife .  . 

literal of the bible will have a problem with this view , since 
the bible talks about the of hell and such. personally , i do n't think 
that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus 
with a double sword from his mouth i treat both these state 
as metaphorical .  . 

i think it 's safe to say that hell was never intended metaphorical .  . certainly 
not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. some christian concepts are indeed 
, but your idea of hell is a 20th century interpretation .  . it is , of 
course , nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the 
of modern age , but i fear the church will not accept it. , per 
, because if you accept that hell is a metaphor , then you 're one step 
closer to turning god into a metaphor as well.

again the misconception that among other oriental orthodox 
churches believe in pops up again. we had a discussion 
about it a while ago. 

in article  . andrew byler ) writes 

the proper term for what mike expresses is  . this was a 
heresy that was condemned in the council of in ad .  . it 
grew up in reaction to , which held that the son and jesus 
are two different people who happened to be united in the same body 
temporarily .  . is held by the of egypt and 
and by the of syria and the orthodox .  . 

then comments 



these issues get mighty subtle .  . when you see people saying different 
things it 's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously 
different things , or whether they are using different terminology .  . i 
do n't think there 's any question that there is a problem with 
, and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form 
without a real human nature or will is heretical .  . but i 'd like to be 
a bit wary about the , , etc. recent discussions 
suggest that their position may not be as far from 
as many had thought. 

with my to the , i believe that further 
is needed .  . this is an from an article featured in the first issue 
of the net newsletter 

under the authority of the eastern roman empire of  ( as opposed 
to the western empire of rome ) , the and of played 
roles in christian theology .  . they were invited everywhere to speak 
about the christian faith. st. , pope of , was the head of the 
council which was held in in the year 430 a.d. it was said 
that the of the church of did nothing but spend all their 
time in meetings .  . this role , however , did not well when politics 
started to with church affairs .  . it all started when the 
with matters of faith in the church. the response of st. 
, the pope of who was later exiled , to this interference 
was clear you have nothing to do with the church. these political motives 
became even more apparent in in , when the church was 
accused of following the teachings of , who believed in 
 . this doctrine that the lord jesus christ has only 
one nature , the divine , not two , the human as well as the divine .  . 

the church has never believed in the way it was 
in the council of ! in that council , meant 
believing in one nature. believe that the lord is perfect in his 
divinity , and he is perfect in his humanity , but his divinity and his 
humanity were united in one nature called the nature of the word , 
which was by st. of  . , thus , believe in two 
human and divine that are united in one without , 
without confusion , and without  ( from the declaration of faith at 
the end of the divine  . these two did not separate 
for a moment or the of an eye  ( also from the declaration of faith 
at the end of the divine  . 

the church was misunderstood in the century at the council of 
 . perhaps the council understood the church correctly , but they 
wanted to exile the church , to it and to the egyptian , 
independent pope .  . despite all of this , the church has remained very 
strict and steadfast in its faith. whether it was a conspiracy from the 
western churches to exile the church as a punishment for its refusal 
to be politically , or whether pope did n't quite go the 
extra to make the point that are not , the 
church has always felt a to reconcile differences between 
all christian churches. this is expressed by the current 
of st. mark , pope iii to the church , faith is 
more important than anything , and others must know that semantics and 
terminology are of little importance to us. throughout this century , the 
church has played an important role in the movement .  . the 
church is one of the of the world council of churches. it has 
remained a member of that council since a.d. the church is a 
member of the all african council of churches  ( aacc ) and the middle east 
council of churches  . the church plays an important role in the 
christian movement by conducting at resolving the 
theological differences with the catholic , greek orthodox , , and 
evangelical churches. 

... 

as a final note , the oriental orthodox and orthodox did sign 
a common statement of , in which the of 
was condemned .  . so the orthodox church does not believe in

please feel free to correct me and give me some texts .  . as far as i can see the 
only text which relates to jewish evangelism is found in mt. 23 15 .  . 
however since this is found only in mt. it cannot be dated before which 
makes it for understanding second temple judaism .  .

choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal 
 . what bothers me is when others suggest that , in these 
matters of faith , their specific beliefs are not only true to them 
but are absolute and should be binding on others. it follows from this 
that god must give everyone the same revelation of truth , and thus 
anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing 
the wrong path .  . this is the arrogance i see a lack of respect for the 
honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and god. 

it is certainly reasonable to ask for some about our own 
ability to know the truth. there are also different in some 
areas of practice. but i 'd like to see more clarification about what 
you mean when you reject the idea of saying their specific beliefs 
are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on 
others. if something is true , it is true for everyone , assuming that 
the belief is something about god , history , etc .  .  .  .  . 

yes , i agree. what i'm trying to point out is that , in matters of faith 
(i . e .  . which are not logically persuasive ) , one may be convinced 
of the truth of certain things through , for instance , personal 
revelation .  . and its certainly fine to share that revelation or those 
beliefs with others. and i do n't think that its arrogant , , to 
accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself .  . where i think the 
conflict is in assuming that , where on beliefs 
arise , all others must have been given the same truth , and that god 
must reveal his truth to everyone in such a way that all would 
honestly agree. i think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone 
who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest that they are 
rejecting something they know to be truth because it is 
for them , or because they wish to spurn god. 

i would say that this is equivalent to assuming that all truths one 
holds are universal and absolute .  . and the problem i see with this is 
that it the individuality of humans and their relationships with 
god. this does not mean there is no absolute truth just that some areas 
of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where god has not established or 
revealed that truth.

way now 


insert huge deletion of all following material since it had little 
relevance to what i 've found 

ok. the people before jesus did n't have jesus , right  ( so far , i 've 
that space is a vacuum ) the people who lived during the time 
jesus lived  ( especially disciples ) were taught this i tell you the 
truth , anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing. he 
will do even greater things than these , because i am going to the 
father .  . and i will do whatever you ask in my name , so that the son may 
bring glory to the father .  . you may ask me for anything in my name , and 
i will do it.  ( john 14 12 14 ) 
so , jesus asked them to pray for things in his name. since that time , 
the request has been the same , not to ask for from other 
beings , but from jesus .  . remember that there is one god and one 
between god and men , the man christ jesus , who gave himself as 
a for all men the testimony given in its proper time.  ( 1 
timothy 2 5 6. also , there have been many of those priests talking 
about priests among the hebrews , since death prevented them from 
continuing in office but because jesus lives forever , he has a 
permanent priesthood .  . therefore he is able to save completely those who 
come to god through him , because he always lives to for them. 
 ( hebrews 7 23  . hebrews is also full of areas talking about jesus 
being our rather than any other man.

the people before jesus did n't have jesus , right may not be as 
obvious as you think. in what sense to you mean did n't have 
christian thought has generally said that they had jesus in the sense 
that they were saved by his death. god is not bound by our 
chronology .  . so in some real spiritual sense they did have jesus . 
even in terms of knowledge , while they surely did n't have the explicit 
knowledge that we have , christians have normally seen messianic

this may be a really one , but i 'll ask it anyways 
christians know that they can never live up to the requirements of 
god , right (i may be wrong , but that is my understanding ) but they still 
try to do it. does n't it seem like we are spending all of our lives 
trying to reach a goal we can never achieve i know that we are saved by 
faith and not by works , but does that mean that once we are saved we do n't 
have to do anything i think james tells us that faith without works is 
dead  . how does this work 

so long as we think that good things are what we have to do rather than 
what we come to want to do , we miss the point. the more we love god the 
more we come to love what and whom he loves .  . 

when i find that what i am doing is not good , it is not a sign to try 
even harder  ( romans 7 14 8 2 ) it is a sign to seek god. when i am aware 
of jesus  presence , i usually want what he wants. it is his , his love

i think it 's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere

i 'll pose a question here that 's got me thinking what distinguishes 
true religion from cults  ( i'm speaking generally here , not 
about christianity ) jerry was on good morning america on 
tuesday to answer this question. basically , he said that 
true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. 
but , then , christianity is a cult because the message of christianity 
is the person of jesus .  . so what distinguishes , for example , the 
branch cult from the church doctrinal 
differences do n't answer the question , imho , so do n't use them as 
an answer.

there have been some attempts to characterize cult . most commonly 
it uses characteristics involving high pressure , brainwashing 
techniques , etc. but some people characterize it by doctrinal 
error. in the end i'm afraid it becomes a term with no precise 
meaning that 's used primarily to dismiss groups as not worthy 
of serious consideration .  . that does n't mean that there are n't 
groups that do highly things and have serious 
doctrinal errors. but past discussions have not suggested to me 
that cult is a very helpful term .  .

subject theists and objectivity 
organization university of nebraska at omaha 
lines 90 

can a theist be truly objective can he be 
when questioning the truth of his scriptures , or 
will he assume the of his parents 
when questioning 

i 've often found it to be the case that the theist 
will stick to some kind of when 
wondering about god and his scriptures .  . i 've 
seen it in the christian , the jew , the muslim , 
and the other theists alike. all assume that 
their and fathers were right in the 
aspect that a god exists , and with that belief 
search for their god. 

, the theist may switch religions or 
aspects of the same religion , but overall the 
majority keep to the belief that some creator 
was behind the universe 's existence .  . i 've 
known muslims who were once christians and vice 
, i 've known christians who were once 
jewish and vice , and i 've even known 
christians who become hindu .  . yet , throughout 
their from one faith to another , 
they 've kept this belief in some form of higher 
being. why 

it usually all has to do with how the child is 
brought up. from the time he is born , the 
theist is brought up with the notion of the 
truth of some kind of scripture the bible , 
the torah , the qur'an , etc. he is told 
of this god who wrote  ( or inspired ) 
the scripture , of the prophets talked about in 
the scripture , of the miracles performed , etc. 
he is also told that to question this  ( as 
children are to do ) is a sin , a crime 
against god , and to lose belief in the 
's truth is to damn one 's soul to hell. 
thus , by the time he is able to read the 
scripture for himself , the belief in its truth 
is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a 
matter of course. 

but it does n't stop there. once the child is able 
to read for himself , there is an to 
the child the right readings of 
scripture , to concentrate more on the pleasant 
readings , to over the worse ones , and to 
explain away the with mystery .  . 
circular arguments , self facts and 
truths , belief , and fear of 
hell is the meat of religion the child must eat 
of every day. to doubt , of course , means wrath 
of some sort , and the child must learn to put 
away his brain when the matter concerns god. 
all of this has some effect on the 
child , so that when he becomes an adult , the 
he 's been taught are nearly 
impossible to remove .  . 

all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can 
truly be objective when questioning god , hell , 
heaven , the angels , souls , and all of the rest. 
can he , for a moment , put aside this notion that 
god does exist and look at everything from 
a unbiased point of view obviously , most 
theists can somewhat , especially when presented 
with mythical gods  ( homeric , roman , egyptian , 
etc . ) .  . but can they put aside the assumption 
of god 's existence and question it

any former atheists converted by argument 
this is an excellent question and i 'll be anxious to see if there are 
any such cases. i doubt it. in the medieval period (esp .  .  . 
when flourished ) argument was a useful tool because everyone 
knew the rules. today , when you ca n't count on people knowing even 
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric , a good argument is 
often from a poor one. 

the last sentence is ironic , since so many readers of 
soc . religion . christian . seem to not be embarrassed by apologists such as 
and c.s. lewis .  . the above also expresses a rather odd sense 
of history. what makes you think the masses in  day , who were 
mostly illiterate , knew any more about rhetoric and logic than most people 
today if writings from the period seem consider that only the 
cream of the , so to speak , could read and write .  . if everyone in 
the medieval period knew the rules it was a matter of uncritically 
accepting what they were told .  .

very good and reasonable statements on authority deleted 

the atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities .  . this is a 
reasonable assertion in itself , but it leads to a practical difficulty .  . 
if you reject all authority out of hand , you reject all possibility of 
every receiving information. thus the atheist position can never possibly 
change .  . it is non falsifiable and therefore  . 

this is not true. the 's position is that there is no proof of the 
existence of god. as much as some people accept their church , their priests 
or straight from their own scriptures as the proof , this does not 
atheists .  . 

atheists do believe in authorities .  . if they were as dogmatic as 
you claim they are , they would be trying to prove 1 1 2 every time they 
got up. what they dispute is that churches , priests , scriptures etc. 
represent true authorities and know the truth. 

to demand or rational proof of god 's existence , is to deny 
god 's existence , since neither science , nor reason , can , in their very 
nature , prove anything. 

are you asking us to believe blindly you are trying to deny that part of 
us that makes us ask the question does god exist i.e. self awareness and 
reason. if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant 
as the other animals on this earth. does god want us to be like that 

you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything. however , if 
we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone. and since 
we can only use faith , why is one picture of god (e . g .  . hinduism ) any less 
valid than another (e . g .  . christianity )

and , from my knowledge of the bible , it seems that christians have 
been hard on the jews of christ 's day for being about accepting 
somebody that their religious authorities did n't accept as the messiah .  . 

this is a good point. christ was hardly the only person who claimed to be 
the messiah in fact , a number of were active in the area from the 
time of the roman conquest to after the fall of  . 
many of the statements made by the apostles especially their repeated 
attempts to give jesus a sword  ( give him military power ) point to the fact that 
they did n't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact. many of 
the statements in the bible can be seen as being oriented explaining 
this new definition of messiah to the jews who were being preached to.

dan 's question about mormon temple rituals deleted for 

just thought i would this , and i believe you dan when you say 
that you do n't mean to offend for us temple , the temple 
ceremonies are very sacred .  . so much so that anyone who goes there 
promises never to them. so how much can you trust someone 
who is telling you about the 

one thing i do n't understand is why being sacred should make the 
temple rituals secret. there are lots of sacred things in 
christianity , including the sacred scriptures themselves , but there is 
nothing secret about these things. 

is it appropriate for the lord not to reveal certain 
things before the world (i . e .  . , publish them widely ) 

these things sacred to himself. he may place any 
pre or post conditions he are necessary. 

moreover , there are in scripture where 
knowledge of sacred things is 

1. after the jesus instructed 
peter , james , and john to tell the vision to no 
man , until the son of man be risen again from 
the dead  . 17  . 
if we were living at the time of savior , there 
would be no  ( public ) record of this event. 

2. a faithful friend of paul experiences a vision 
of paradise when he heard words , 
which it is not lawful for a man to utter 
 ( 2  . 12  . 
this person heard something which paul can not 
write to the  ( and  .

multitude gathered themselves together , and they 
both saw and heard these children yea , even 
babes did open their mouths and utter

forbidden that there should not any man write them. 

some scholars speculate that these words 
which could not be written are the sacred 
portions from temple we are to from

pardon me , a humble atheist , but exactly what is the difference 
between holding a revealed truth with blind faith as its basis (i . e .  . 
regardless of any evidence that you may find to the contrary ) as an 
absolute truth , fully expecting people to believe you and arrogance 
they sound like one and the same to me. 

pixie 


p.s. if you do sincerely believe that a god exists , why do you follow 
it blindly 

why do we follow god so blindly have you ever asked a 
physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog 
the answer is quite simple the dog can see , and the blind person 
cannot .  . 

i acknowledge , as a christian , that i am blind .  . i see , 
but i see as well as reality.  ( watched tv lately ) 
i hear , but i hear lies as well as truth.  ( listen to your 
radio or read a newspaper . ) . remember , all that well is 
not healthy .  . so , i rely one the one who can see , hear , and 
taste everything , and knows what is real , and what is not. 
that is god. 

of course , you may ask , if i cannot trust my own senses , 
how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or 
a lie. that is why we need faith to be saved .  . we must force 
ourselves to believe that god knows the truth , and loves us 
enough to share it with us , even when it what we think 
we know. why would he have created us if he did not love us 
enough to help us through this world 

i also do trust my experiences to some extent .  . when 
i do things that the seeming logic of my experience , 
because it is what my father commands me to do , and i see 
the results in the long term , i find that he has led me 
in the proper direction , even though it did not feel right 
at the time. this is where our works as christians are 
important as of the body make the body strong , 
of faith make the faith strong .  . 

as for you , no one can convert you. you must 
choose to follow god of your own will , if you are ever to 
follow him. all we as christians wish to do is share with 
you the love we have received from god. if you reject that , 
we have to accept your decision , although we always keep 
the offer open to you. if you really want to find out 
why we believe what we believe , i can only suggest you try 
praying for faith , reading the bible , and asking christians 
about their experiences personally. then you may grow to 
understand why we believe what we do , in of the 
logic of this world. 

may the lord bring peace to you ,

excellent question timothy .  . i the answers you get will be 
as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you 
clearly .  . god of the bible has given us humans little about how he 
intends to judge mankind .  . the first test is those who have that jesus 
christ is the son of god and that his death and resurrection was to 
serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god , 
the bible calls this sin .  . for those who die before the end of the world have 
already died it is more complicated to explain without in to  . 
god must judge people on the of their works in this world. however 
there is no plus and system for god. he has declared that he can not 
tolerate spiritual imperfection , thus he can only based your to 
live with him on the wrong in your life. 
good people , yes even christians are going to constantly sin before god , the 
christian thanks god that christ has given his life for his sin 's 
penalty .  . the proscribed punishment for sin is death , just as the proscribed 
punishment for is time in jail .  . god then cannot ask for anything but 
for those sins .  . he does not want to  . the bible says in john 
3 17 , that god did not send his son in to the word to it but that 
through him it might be saved .  . when i realize that i have sinned , and i do 
with painful regularity , i must approach god and ask him to not hold sin 
against me , i have that right and only because of christ .  . as for jews 
they are promised that they must believe on the messiah who would come , and 
come in jesus of  . muslims , i fear have been given a lie from the

for those who do n't have that right , in the view of the bible they stand

about christianity because they see no other way.

well the argument usually stops right there. in the end , 
are n't we all just kids , for the truth if so , do we have 
the authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as 
false 

i find this argument very strange , though not  . 

an analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it. 

say , for example , there are people living on a island , and a group

the island that they are in danger , and should leave .  . a group of people on 
the island is given the task of warning others of the danger .  . 

they believe the danger is real , but others may not. 

does that mean that the first group are necessarily arrogant in warning 
others of the danger does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs 
are correct , and all others are false 

some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance , and behave in an 
arrogant manner , but that is a personal  . it does not

organization university of southern california , los , ca

a few points about mary 's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on 
earth 

one piece of evidence for mary 's assumption into heaven is the fact 
that no christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was 
buried .  . some christian churches claimed to be at the final 
places of peter , mark , and other , but no one ever 
claimed to the body of mary , the greatest of the  . why 
because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven. 

although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of 
mary , some passages seem , like the passage in revelation 
that describes a woman giving birth to a son and later being 
in the heavens .  . of course , the woman in this passage has other 
interpretations she can also be taken a symbol for the church. 

the assumption of mary makes sense because of her relationship to 
christ .  . jesus , perfect god and perfect man , fulfilled the 
requirements of the law perfectly .  . under the law god gave to us , we 
are to honor our mother and father , and christ 's act of taking his 
mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. also , he 
took his flesh from her , so it seems appropriate that he decide not to 
allow her flesh to in the grave .  . 

one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine 
on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary 
did not die. this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe. 
the dogma of the assumption was carefully to avoid saying 
whether mary did or did not die. in fact , the consensus among catholic 
theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die. this would make 
sense christ died , and his mother , who waited at the foot of the 
cross , would want to share in his death.

first , i would like to thank all who sent me their opinions on the matter 
at hand. all advice was taken to heart , if not directly used. my friend 
found out about the matter quite accidently .  . after reading some of my 
mail , i quit from the mail reader went about my business. i must have 
trashed my mail improperly , because he got on the same terminal the next 
day saw my old messages. he thought they were responses to a post he 
placed in alt.atheism earlier that week , so he read some of them before 
realizing that they were for me. i got a message from him the next day he 
for reading my mail said that he did not want to appear to be 
a  . he said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views 
did n't mind doing so , especially with a friend. so we did. i neither 
changed his mind nor did he change mine , as that was not the point. now he 
knows where i'm coming from now i know where he 's coming from. and all 
that i can do is pray for him , as i 've always done. 

i believe the reason that he i click instead of heads is because 
i see christianity as a tool for revolution , not a tool for maintaining 
the status quo .  . to be quite , i have more of a reason to reject god 
than he does just by the fact that i am an african american female .  . 
christianity religion have been used as tools to separate my people from 
the true knowledge of our history the wealth of our contributions to the 
world society. the kitchen of heaven was all we had to look forward to 
during the slave days , this second class status still exists 
today. i , too , have rejected 
an aspect of christianity that of the church. too much 
exists behind the walls of god 's house beginning with the 
images of a white jesus to that of the members praise god on sunday 
raise hell beginning monday .  . god willing , i will find a church home where 
i can feel comfortable at home , but i do n't see it happening anytime 
soon.

in article  ( evenson thomas randall ) writes 

which brings me around to asking an open question. is the bible a closed 
book of scripture is it okay for us to go around saying god told 
me this and jesus told me that would n't that imply that god is still 
out new revelation to us i know that some people will feel 
that is okay , and some will not. the concept of a closed would 
certainly cast a on contemporary prophets .  . on the other hand , 
an open seems to be indicated sometimes. 

there are a lot of people running around saying god told me this and 
god told me that these days. some people really have heard god , and others 
heard their  . mentioned this in a once. he 
said someone told him , the lord gave me a song .  . he said that it was 
the worst song he had ever heard. 

i know why he gave you that song , said , he did n't want it anymore. 

but god does still speak to his people today , and the idea is contrary to the 
idea of a closed  . wrote about all the of the spirit 
in the church of his day  ( 2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first 
to put forth a new testament , which was almost identical to the one 
we have today. he believed in a closed  . 

many prophets prophecies which were not recorded in the scriptures .  . 
for example , one prophet in kings , whose name starts with an m who 
that the king would lose a battle .  . that is the only prophecy 
he gave recorded in scripture , and we no that he had given other prophecies 
because the king before he heard the prophecy , he never 
anything good about me. yet only one little paragraph of all of his 
lifetime of prophecies are recorded in scripture .  . there are numerous examples .  . 
barnabas was a prophet , acts says , before he was even sent out as an 
 . yet his writings are not recorded in scripture .  . only two of 
prophecies are mentioned in scripture .  . he was already a prophet 
before he gave them. 

so prophecy may be genuine and from god , but that does not make it 
scripture .  . 

also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new 
but rather an inspired translation of scripture .  . is it right to call 
that prophecy would n't that be more having to do with 
knowledge 

i do n't know about translations of scripture , but i am familiar with 
prophecies that give applications for scripture .  . there are also 
similar examples in the bible .  . several times peter interprets prophecies 
in a seemingly prophetic way , for example , and his let another 
take concerning judas office. 

a clearer example can be found in matthew 24 .  . jesus is about 
what will happen before his return and he quotes a passage out of joel 
about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood. so scriptural 
prophecy can be used in later prophecy .  . 

sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge , 
but of the spirit seem to  . words of knowledge and wisdom 
can  . the word of knowledge and prophecy can  . 
interpretation of is very similar to prophecy .  . are often 
considered miracles .  . so sometimes the distinction between is a 
bit  . imho , it does n't usually matter that much if we are able to 
label a phenomenon , as long as we recognize them as the work of the 
spirit , and use them according to his  .

we look for the resurrection of the dead , and the 
life of the world to come. nicene creed .  . 

i always took the  resurrection  in this statement to mean the 
resurrection of the soul , but i guess resurrection does strictly mean 
the of the physical body. i have some questions on this point 

the next time you go to church , you can check the better creed , that is , 
the apostles  creed .  . it says the resurrection of the body. should 
have learned that on the first go around. but what 's a body without 
a little bit a  soul 

1. i always thought that christians believe the descent into hell was 
pretty much immediate , and that there are people burning in hell right 
now. where will my soul 
 ( which , by the way , i do n't believe in ) exist until that time 

at the risk of offending everybody , i will the century 
point of view. christ descended immediately into the of abraham 
to set captives  . he preached to the saved for three days before 
drawing them with him back to this earth. i'm no expert on this part , 
but matthew  ( 27 52 53 ) says about the death of jesus were opened , 
and the bodies of many who had fallen were raised .  . and 
coming forth from the after his resurrection , they entered the 
holy city and appeared to many.  ( nab ) regarding the hell of the 
damned , of which you speak , christ did not see it  ( ps 16 10 , acts 2 27 ) , 
although it saw him  . is 45  . 

concerning the of the dead , i do n't want to subject my 
to further , so i will direct you to contact me through e mail 
if you are concerned. 

2. will the new body i will have be created out of the same atoms 
that my body now is made of , or will it be built from 

your new body might be something like adam 's before his 
with the just one  ( acts 7 52 , trans. vulgate ) filled with 
knowledge , absent of , and immortal .  . it would probably be 
a little , too. 

3. since i will have a physical body , i assume it will need a physical 
place to exist in where is this hell in the center of the earth 
do you think we could find it if we dig 

i would n't recommend it. it 's really hot down at the center of the earth ! 
you know , the normal , and all that.

god has one set of rules for all his people. paul was never against the

the island is given the task of warning others of the danger .  . 

they believe the danger is real , but others may not. 

does that mean that the first group are necessarily arrogant in warning 
others of the danger does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs 
are correct , and all others are false 

but what if the are wrong and these people are warning of a 
non existent danger analogies can only push an argument so far  ( on both 
 . both 's and yours assume the premises used to set up your 
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise .  . 

the important point to note is the different both sides come from. 
christians believe they know the truth and thus believe they have the right 
 ( and duty ) to tell the truth to all. 

christians can get offended if others do not believe  ( what is self evidently 
to them) the truth. non christians do not believe this is the truth and get 
offended at them because they  ( christians ) claim to know the truth. 

 ( btw this argument goes for anyone , i am not just christians ) 

neither side can be really unless one of the parties changes their 
mind. as pointed out , there is no point in arguing along these lines 
because both approach from a different premise .  . a more useful line of 
discussion is why people believe in particular faiths .  .

 . they give historical background , discussion of

reading. i typically recommend , and young 's nt 
introduction .  . there are also some good one volume commentaries .  . they 
often have background articles that are helpful .  . probably the best 
these days would be 's bible commentary .  . (i 
think there may be a couple of books with this title .  . this is a 
fairly recent one , like about 1990 , done in with the 
society for biblical criticism . ) . if you are committed to , 
you will probably prefer something more conservative .  . i do n't read a

specific issue of whether it is acceptable to divorce .  .

along the way , she was married , happily , to a wonderful and 
husband and gave birth to two sons .  . still , everything was not 
perfect for , since she could never open up the part of her 
soul to her husband .  . she always found that she could be much closer to 
her women friends than to her husband , as good and as a husband as 
he might be. she very much with this until at the age of 38 , she 
decided that she was a  . when she came home to announce this 
understanding of herself , her husband told her that he had come to the same 
understanding several years before and was waiting for her to come to that 
in her own time. her children ages 9 and 11 at the time were 
also extremely of her. as the put it , that just 
means that you love people very much. and her husband agreed to 
divorce but remain friends and still consider each other as part of the 
extended family to this day. 

one of the interesting things that said in this whole discussion was 
homosexuality is not about what goes on in the  . she found that 
she was much more able to have a deep , committed relationship with a woman 
than a man. sex , in her mind , is only a part of the whole relationship .  . 
the key thing is how one with other people. she made a 
specific point to say that it was not that she had never met a good man , 
since she was married to a wonderful man for a dozen years.  ( take a few 
seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it 's implications ! ! ! ) 

i have thought about the implications , and it is scary .  . 

we have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have 
decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the 
of a , more attractive woman. if we accept that it is 
legitimate for to have , how can we not accept anyone 's 
decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can 
have a more deep , committed relationship .  . 

marriage is not a state of being , it is a journey in life. 
love is not a passive feeling , it must be actively  . 

is it acceptable for an older to dump his wife of many 
years who stayed home to care for the children because he 
ca n't be happy unless he is with a beautiful 
young the real solution for both in the couple to 
make a effort .  . 

hold fast to the faith. has not the lord repeatedly compared his 
relation to his people as a faithful and husband we 
learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and 
remain faithful through times of trial .  . 

my spouse has a brain that has left her  . 
if it were to growing  ( it is in , thanks be to god ! ) 
then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual 
relations .  . that 's life .  .  . the . lord would certainly not give me 
permission to seek someone else to my needs. 

the idea that it is to divorce if a couple grows apart 
seems to me to lead to such a destruction of the meaning 
of marriage that i feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint 
of compromise .  . we have become so petty and small minded that 
some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the 
wives lose weight ! 

i praise the lord for guiding me to marry my wife .  . she married me 
anyway despite the possibility that i could have a terrible  . 
and it turned out that she was the one with the brain , but 
had i known i would n't have cared either. and maybe i 'll be in 
a car accident tomorrow and become from the down. 
a married couple should deal with these situations with the help 
of the lord , not divorce and run away from them.

our first discussion was on prayer .  . eventually , we got around to how

that i do n't have a real answer to. the question was , if we need to pray 
in jesus  name , what about the people before jesus they prayed to god

way now 

i 'll take a try at this .  .  .  . 

from the discussions i have been in , and from how i have interpreted 
the bible , i feel that one can pray either way. but remember this , 
before jesus , the people talked to god  ( no other way ) and he talked 
back .  .  ( audible and dreams , etc . ) . today we have the bible to know 
gods will , and we have his son you died for us. he was given as our 
savior , and while we still do things according to gods will , we pray 
through his son. in the bible it says that if we are not known to 
jesus , we are not known to god.  ( sorry i do not have the verses 
with me ) so , if we are to be granted eternal life , we must present 
ourselves to jesus first , who will then present us to god.

do you mean that your fellow christians tend to find you maybe 
they 're right. you might be interested in 's books 
about what philistines american christians are to 
and more recently pearls for real swine . 

one day a few years ago walked into a greek orthodox 
church. he is now an orthodox christian .  . so is his mother and if his 
father , , had not passed away he too would have come 
into the church. 
, like many americans who have recently found the orthodox church , 
described the experience as finally coming home after a long 
through a desert .  . you should also read the book becoming orthodox by 
peter  . it describes the long journey of some 2000 weary 
evangelical protestants to the orthodox church. come taste and see how 
good the lord is.

 ( desiree asked us whether we 
should think of the serbs as doing god 's work in bosnia .  . i 've 
from posting , in hope that someone who is more familiar with 
the ot than i would answer. but at this point i feel i have to say 
something. 

many things about this posting bother me. i know of not the slightest 
suggestion in the nt that christians should use force to propagate the 
gospel , and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death 
of moslems violates the heart of the gospel .  . christ died to break 
down these distinctions .  . in him there is neither jew nor greek , there 
is neither slave nor free , there is neither male nor female .  . if 
moslems do not know him , we may preach to them , but we do n't kill 
them. furthermore , the attack is between states , not religions .  . 
there are christians being attacked as well. one of the towns under 
attack is one of the few places where christians and moslems are 
living together  . 

the being suggested are from the ot .  . there are in fact two 
different things being alluded to. the first is from the entry into 
 . for that to be a parallel , we would need for god to have 
promised this land through a prophet .  . and we would need the war to be 
a holy war. there were on behavior in those 
attacks .  . any were likely to cause the israelites to be 
 . rape would not have been tolerated .  . while the accounts in 
joshua towns that were totally , note that it was 
possible for a town to make peace with the israelites , and that once 
that was done even when deception was involved they were 
expected to honor it. in , there have been many of 
agreement in this incident .  . i see no evidence that god has granted 
bosnia to the serbs as a promised land , and if he had , their behavior 
would have disqualified this from being a holy war. 

the other ot parallel is from later , when israel was by 
assyria and  . the prophets saw this as a judgement on israel 
for her sins .  . someone asks whether we should n't see this as a 
judgement on the for their sins .  . this sounds like a 
of the old claim that we should n't have doctors or hospitals because 
is god 's judgement .  . yes , even bad things may be used by god 
for good. that includes actions of bad people. but that does n't 
justify them. if you read the prophets , you find them very clear that 
in attacking israel , the and were acting as 
unintentional of god. their intent was to attack god 's 
people , and they would be judged for it. the fact that they were 
actually carrying out god 's plan did n't excuse their action. 
furthermore , we should n't conclude from this that all attacks are 
judgements from god. god explicitly interpreted that case , through 
his prophets .  . as far as i know , he did not send any prophets to 
bosnia .  . while i find it hard to see any good in the current fighting , 
i am sure god will eventually make good come out of bad. but that 
does n't justify it , and it wo n't save the people who are doing it from 
judgement .  . 

i am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue 
because of current tensions between the west and moslem oriented 
nations .  . what we do not need is for moslems to conclude that 
christians think it 's ok to kill moslems .  . the implications for the 
mid east , and even relations with american moslems , could be quite 
serious.

and clarified through this , and i suspect that we may not disagree as 
much as we think. 

i admit that i'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical christianity ,

in ec , and went to an ec college. it was definitely the wrong place 
for me , and i react strongly to any implication that ec or conservative 
christianity has any sort of on true christianity .  . i shudder 
when i remember the condescending attitude i had about other christians 
who did n't to the ec model .  . 

i have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of 
absolute truth is the actions i have seen it lead to. i have had some 
very bad experiences with evangelical christians claiming to know the 
truth , and judging me or others based on their belief that they have 
the answers. knowing the truth does n't seem to leave a whole lot of 
room for others  opinions. 

i can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you do n't try to 
use that belief to try to force others to comply with it , and you are 
very careful that you do n't hurt others with it. love your neighbor 
seems to go totally out the when one knows the truth and believes 
that everyone should be living by that truth. other people have 
convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours , 
based on careful searching , prayer , and their relationship with god. 
do n't dismiss them because god did n't lead them to the same conclusions 
as yours. 

this is not directed personally at you , dean .  .

one thing i do n't understand is why being sacred should make the 
temple rituals secret. 

on of the of being sacred in this case is that they 
should not be spoken of in a common manner or under 
feet such as the name is today. the ceremonies are 
performed in the temple because the temple has been set aside 
as being as sacred holy place. we believe that the 
ceremonies can only be interpreted correctly when they 
are viewed with the right spirit which in this case is in the 
temple .  . so from our point of view , when they are brought 
out into the public , they are being under feet , 
because of misinterpretations and mocking , and it is therefore 
offensive to us.

it seems i spend a significant amount of my time correcting errors about

who relied on abstinence to prevent pregnancy got pregnant in 
numbers they did n't have the to  . and we 're

i am told that style values free methods , that 
teach technology and kids how to make choices ,

back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested .  . the 
article included sources to contact for information on research

the same research produced the results that abstinence related 
were found to pregnancy in  . i assume that it is 
reasonable to assume that the aids rate will with the pregnancy 
rate .  . 

the difference is not in technology but in the values taught 
to the children. the taught the kids that they have 
legitimate choices , while the abstinence related taught them that 
they did not have legitimate choices other than abstinence .  . it is the 
values system that is the strongest of the behavior behavior of

question for further discussion  ( as they say in the textbooks ) why do n't 
we teach safe drug use to kids , instead of drug abstinence is n't it 
because we know that a class in how to use drugs safely if you choose to 
use drugs would increase drug use why is n't drug abstinence education

that what happens is something we all do together , because we all know how 
do it. led by the priest , of course , which makes it a kind of dialogue we

on the one hand there are to having the stay the

seem to start out same old words  and pay attention better 
when things get changed around. i think priests and 
are trying to get our attention and make things more 
meaningful for us. it drives me crazy too.

a related issue , that it sounds like john does not have to deal with , is

i'm not enforcing the limits on this faq because most 
of our readers probably have n't seen it. 

christ that anyone who breaks one of the least of these 
commandments and teaches to do the same will be called least in 
the kingdom of heaven  . 5 19 .  . this faq is so full of error that i 
must respond to it. i hope that whoever will remove from it the 
theology .  . 

brothers and sisters , 

being new to the faith and examining the closely , i 've noticed the 
fourth commandment is pretty specific about keeping the sabbath day. it 
states the 7th  ( day saturday ) is the sabbath while most christian religions 
 ( keep or go to church ) on sunday .  . what 's up 

this is a frequently asked question. every time it , it causes 
months of debate. so let me see if i can answer you directly .  . 
basically it 's because the law was given to moses as part of a 
specific with the jews .  . most of us are n't jews , so we 
are n't part of that covenant .  . there was an argument early in 
christian history about whether the laws should apply to 
gentiles who became christians .  . you can see the account of this 
debate in acts 15 .  . the main question there was , but 
keeping the sabbath would be part of it as well. the apostles 
concluded that we need not become jews in order to become christians , 
and therefore that rules such as did not apply to us. 

1. the law was known to man before it was revealed on mount  . 
4 15 notes that where no law is , there is no  . not only 
did sin exist before  ( eden ) , but the sabbath was kept before it 
was revealed on  ( ex  . 

2. the problem with the first covenant was not the law , but the promise 
which it. god wanted to perform his will in the lives of the 
people , but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery , they promised 
what ever he says to do we will do. that is why the new covenant is 
based on better promises  . 8  . rather than do away with the law 
god promised to put my laws in their minds and write them on their 
hearts  . 8  . 

3. including the sabbath in the acts 15 is selective  . the 
sabbath was more important to the jews than  . if any attempt 
had been made to do away with the sabbath the reaction would have been 
even more than is recorded in acts 15 .  . do not confuse the weekly 
sabbath of the with the which could occur at 
any time of the week and were part of the law  ( ceremonial ) which was 
added because of  ( of the moral law )  ( gal 3  . 

4. israel stands for god 's people of all time. that is why god 
the gentiles in. 9 4 says that the , the glory , the 
, the giving of the law , the service of god and the promises 
belong to israelites .  . in explanation paul makes it clear that being born 
into israel is not enough for they are not all israel , which are of 
israel v 6. then in 3 19 he says if be christ 's , then are 
abraham 's seed , and according to the promise. all christians are 
abraham 's seed , jews , israelites .  . not physically , for that is not the 
criterion , but  . we are with jesus based on the 
promise god made to all his people the israelites .  . 


while christians agree that the ot laws do not all apply to us , 
because some of them are part of a specific with the jews , 
we also expect to see some similarity between the things god expected 
from the jews and the things he expects from us. after all , it 's the 
same god. however there are several ways of dealing with this. 

these days the most common approach is to separate the ot commandments 
into moral and . commandments apply only to 
the jews .  . they are part of the specific covenant .  . these are 
like the laws and  . moral laws apply to 
everyone. most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law , except 
for the commandment about the sabbath .  . i believe most people who take 
this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on 
the sabbath is part of the law , but a general to 
worship regularly is part of the general moral law. thus christians 
are free to choose the specific time we worship .  . 

people would probably agree but they are wrong. how can the sabbath 
commandment be when it is part of a law which the 
laws you are not free to choose your time of worship .  . even 
if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in 
sun worship .  . would you rather give up a day which god , 
, and in exchange for one which all church leaders 
agree has not biblical foundation  ( see sabbath in 
soc . religion . christian . bible .  . 

a more radical approach  ( which is generally connected with john 
and the tradition ) says that the law as a whole is no longer 
binding .  . instead , we are entirely under , and our behavior 
should be solely by love. portions of the ot law are still 
useful as  . but they are not properly speaking legally 
binding on us. in practice most people who take this position do not 
believe it is safe to leave christians without moral  . while 
we may no longer be under law , as sinners , it 's not safe for us to go 
into situations with no principles to guide us. we 're too good at 
self justification for that to be safe .  . thus christians do have moral 
, from things like jesus  teachings , paul 's advice , etc. 
these may not be precisely a law , but they serve much the same 
function as , and have largely the same content as , the moral law in 
the previous analysis. while would deny that we have a fixed 
legal responsibility to worship on any specific day , he would say that 
given human weakness , the discipline of regular worship is important. 

i do not care what or any theologian says .  . my guide is what god 
says .  . if being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law , 
why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the 
sabbath commandment , which is the only one god thought was important 
enough to say remember if you study the word deeply you will note that 
the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but 
freed by the of god. if a cop me over for speeding , then in 
court i ask for mercy and the judge does not the book at me but gives me 
, do i walk out of the court saying i can now go on speeding , for i 
am now under being under i now drive within the speed 
limit .  . paul to it in  . 3 31 we then make the law through 
faith god forbid yea , we establish the law. the law is 
holy , and the commandment holy , and just , and good  . 7  . 

in both analyses , the specific day is not an issue. as a matter of 
tradition , we worship on sunday as a memorial of christ 's 
resurrection .  . there 's some debate about what acts shows about early 
christian worship .  . the most common analysis is that is shows jewish 
christians continuing to go to jewish services on the sabbath , but 
that specifically christian service were not necessarily held then. 
act 20 7 shows worship on the first day  ( sunday ) , and i 16 2 also 
implies on that day. 

there are a few groups that continue to believe christians have to 
worship on the sabbath  . the best known are the seventh day 
adventists and jehovah 's witnesses .  . they argue that act 20 7 is not a 
regular worship service , but a special meeting to see paul off , and 
that i 16 2 does n't explicitly say it 's a regular worship service .  . 

do you prefer implication to fact a careful study of the acts 20 shows 
that the meeting was on saturday night and that on sunday morning paul did 
not go to a worship service , but set off on a long journey by foot to 
 . in 16 there is no way you can equate by him in 
with go to a worship service .  . 

it 's clear that this issue was a one in paul 's time. see 
14 5. paul 's advice is that we should be very careful about 
judging each other on issues like this. one person sees a specific 
day as mandated by god , while another does not. he who observes that 
specific day does it in honor of the lord .  . he who believes his 
worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the 
lord .  .  ( those who believe that the sabbath is still mandated argue 
that paul is not referring to sabbath worship here. note however 
2 16 , which says something similar but  . it explicitly 
mentions sabbath . ) . 

wrong. these are the sabbath days of the law , not the sabbath 
day of the moral law. 

there are some differences among christians about use of the word 
sabbath . originally the term referred to the 7th day , the jewish 
day of worship .  . many christians now use it to refer to sunday , the 
day of christian worship .  . they do this largely so that they can apply 
the 4th  ( or whatever there are a couple of different 
schemes ) commandment to it. tradition does not do this. it 
distinguishes between the sabbath which is the mandated 
for jews , and the lord 's day which is the free christian worship .  . 
 ( the only reference i can find to this in the nt is rev 1 10 . ) . there 
are also differences about laws regarding this day. many christians 
support blue laws , both in secular law and church law , setting aside 
that day and causing people to spend it in worship .  . the more radical 
anti legal approach sees such as a return to the jewish 
sabbath , which is not appropriate to the free christian worship of the 
lord 's day. 

why would you prefer to twist and turn , relying on different arguments 
which conflict with each other , rather than obey a simple request from a 
god who loved you enough to die for you. jesus died because the law could 
not be changed. why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a 
broken law if all you need to do is change the law. penalties for law 
breaking means the law is  . that is why it is no sin not to 
follow the demands of the laws .  . it will always be a sin to 
make false gods , to violate god 's name , to break the sabbath , to steal , to 
kill , etc. except it you disagree. but then your opinion has no weight 
when placed next to the word of god. 



it 's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq .  . i 
think paul 's comments on one day over another  ( rom 14 ) is 
probably all that needs to be said. i accept that is doing 
what he does in honor of the lord .  . i just wish he might equally 
accept that those who all days alike are similarly doing 
their best to honor the lord .  . 

however i 'd like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous 
proof that regular christian worship was on the first day. as i 
indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited .  . 

the difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually 
about something else. they both look like they are talking about 
christian meetings , but neither explicitly says and they 
gathered every sunday for worship . we get various pieces of 
information , but nothing aimed at answering this question. 

act 2 26 describes christians as both in jewish temple 
worship and in christian services in homes .  . obviously the 
temple worship is on the sabbath .  . acts 13 44 is an example of 
christians in them. unfortunately it does n't tell us 
what day christians met in their houses .  . acts 20 7 , despite  
confusion , is described by acts as on sunday .  . (i see no 
reason to impose modern definitions of when days start , when the 
biblical text is clear about what was meant . ) . the wording implies to 
me that this was a normal meeting. it does n't say they gathered to 
see paul off , but that when they were gathered for breaking bread , 
paul talked about his travel .  . but that 's just not explicit 
enough to be really convincing .  . similarly with 1 16 2. it says 
that on the first day they should set aside money for paul 's 
collection. now if you want to believe that they gathered 
to do this , or that they did it in their homes , i ca n't disprove it , 
but the obvious time for a to take an offering would be 
when they normally gather for worship , and if they were expected to do 
it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. 
so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day 
of every week simply means every time they gather for worship .  . 

i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements 
is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian 
worship was.

subject re certainty and arrogance 
lines 

my last article included this quote 

if any substantial number of talk . religion . misc . readers read some 
, 60 of the postings would disappear .  .  ( if they understood 
some , would disappear .  .  ) michael l 

someone called  wrote 

this quote seems a little arrogant , do n't you think 

there is a called a  , which looks like this ) . 
it is supposed to look like a face , and indicates that the 
comment is supposed to be funny .  . 


and , i 'll note that i have participated on talk . religion . misc . for over 
five years i 'd say mr was not too far off. 8 ) 



in the meat of his reply , mr serves up an excellent example of what 
i meant by there is no way out of the loop . i wrote that human brains are 
with sin , and can be trusted only in limited circumstances .  . 

in reply , mr wrote 

i would beg to differ with you here. the properly formed conscience 
can be trusted virtually all the time. 

which just the problem back one level how do you tell if your 
conscience is properly formed 

the only way to tell is to that you are capable of judging the 
formed of your own conscience .  . in other words , you can only be sure 
that your conscience is formed  if you assume that your evaluation 
can be trusted .  . assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time , i 'll 
grant , but it 's not a valid way of reasoning .  . 

unless you are infallible , your judgements about your own thinking cannot be 
certain .  . therefore , it is not possible to be certain your conscience is 
 .  ( whatever that is supposed to mean . ) . 


mr then gives another paradigm example of the problem 

now you have hit on the purpose of the church. it is by necessity the 
infallible of divine revelation .  . without the church , 
christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little sects .  . 

the church is necessity  the infallible of divine revelation 
how do you know presumably , you believe this because of some argument or 
another how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes 

you write 

therefore , although our minds are finite and susceptible to error , our 
in arriving at inductive insights gives in our 
ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true , even in areas 
not subject to the experimental method. 

but there is a huge difference between in our ability to 
distinguish what is true from what is not true  and  . i am 
confident about a lot of things , but absolute certainty is a very long way 
from  . 

this discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain 
 ( really , go check the subject  . saying you are absolutely certain is 
different than saying you are confident .  . when you say that 
you are confident , that invites people to ask why. 

except in very limited circumstances , when you say that you are absolutely 
certain , it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any 
idea of his own  . 


i have yet to meet anyone who believed in a infallible source of 
truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning .  . all of 
them every last one has claimed that he was himself infallible .  . 
the result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on. 


f 

this particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the 
original criticism. i get the feeling that the original poster 
regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong 
answers in religion , and that the difference can have eternal 
consequences .  . when i say that i think there is a hell and that he is 
at least in significant danger of ending up there , i will admit that 
as you say the reasoning processes i used to reach this are 
fallible .  . thus at least in principle i could be wrong. but these 
basic facts are clearly enough taught in the bible that i think it 's 
unlikely that i'm it.  ( in order to get this level of 
, i 've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as 
to a number of the more issues. i have n't , for 
example said that all non christians will definitely end up in hell , 
and i have n't attempted to describe hell in any detail . ) . i have a 
feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and 
even though i acknowledge that i'm fallible and so there 's 
some chance i'm wrong. 

do n't get me wrong i think there are a lot of arrogant 
christians , and often criticism of us is justified .  . but in at least 
some cases i think the constitute blaming the messenger .  . 
if the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for 
certain decisions , it 's not my fault i'm just telling it the way i 
think it is. you may think god is immoral for setting things up that 
way. it 's one of the critiques of christianity that i find it most 
difficult to respond to. but it 's not arrogance for me to tell what 
i think is the truth.

this is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this 
doctrine 


the doctrine of god 


i. the persons of the 
of all of the doctrines of scripture , this is the most 
important. the bible is pre eminently a revelation of god. 
therefore , our first objective in studying the bible should 
be to know god. 
i believe that the bible teaches that there are three 
persons in the  ( trinity ) god , the father god the 
son the lord jesus christ and god , the holy spirit .  . i 
believe that they are individual persons who are one in 
nature , meaning that they are identical in nature , each 
the same divine  . they are also 
equally worthy of our worship , our trust , and our obedience .  . 
 . matt . 28 . 19 , 2 13 . 14 john 14 8 , 9 , 16 , 17. 

ii. the , or characteristics , of the  . 
a. god 's nature is revealed in the name he has taken for 
himself jehovah .  . he is the living god , eternal , and 
 . he is without beginning , and without 
ending .  .  . 42 . 8. 
b. god is a spirit .  .  . john 4 24 .  . 
c. god is love.  . 1 john 4 8 , 16. 
as such , he is gracious , , good , faithful , 
patient , and full of  .  . 89 1 , 2 
103 8 1 7. 
d. but god is also holy and righteous .  . he is absolutely 
without sin in his nature , and so is incapable of 
in though , word , or action.  . ex .  . 15 11  . 
6 3. 
e. god is  ( everywhere present at the same time 
in the of his person ) , omniscient  ( all 
knowing , knowing all things the end from the beginning , 
infinitely wise ) , omnipotent  ( almighty , , with 
unlimited power over all creation) .  . 
god is infinite in his presence , wisdom , and power. it 
is my conviction that the work of the lord in our day 
has become very man , and that the people in our 
churches know very little about god. i believe that the 
lord 's work needs to be god , and that the 
people of god need to understand that god is 
in all things in the affairs of nations , in the lives 
of all people , and in the carrying out of his purposes 
regarding salvation .  . 

iii .  . the works of the  . 
a. in creation 
all three persons of the were active in 
creating , and all three are active in 
creation , and in the course of human affairs 
 ( for nations as well as individual people ) to the end 
of time.  . gen .  . 1 1 , 2 john 1 1 3  . 1 16 17 
 . 1 3. 
b. in salvation 
in order to understand salvation i believe that it is 
absolutely necessary to begin with god , not with man. 
all three persons of the have been , and are , 
active in salvation .  . 
1. god , the father 
salvation originated with god. the members of the 
determined in eternity past that there would 
be salvation , the conditions under which people 
could and would be saved , and even who would be 
saved .  . election to salvation is recognized in 
scripture as the work of god , the father .  .  . 
1 3 4 2 2 13 14 .  . 
2. christ , the son of god 
the lord jesus christ , through his birth by the 
virgin mary , came to the earth to two 
important works 
a. he came as the final and complete revelation of 
god , the father .  .  . 1 15 1 1 3. 
b. he came to provide salvation for all whom the 
father had chosen .  . he did this by his death on 
the cross , by his bodily resurrection , and by 
his present work in heaven. the 
work of salvation will be for us when 
the lord returns .  .  . 5 8 10 1 15 3 
4 7 25 , 1 john 3 2. 
3. the holy spirit 
as the author of scripture , the theme of which is 
christ and his work , the holy spirit is 
carrying out the plan of god in the 
following ways 
a. he of sin .  .  . john 16 7 11 
b. he  ( known in the bible as the new 
 .  . john 3 5 8. 
c. he each believer to fulfill the work 
of  .  . john 14 16 17.

salvation secure .  .  . 1 13 14 .  . 
e. he every believer into the body of 
christ .  .  .  . 12 13 
f. he teaches every believer the truth of 
scripture .  .  . john 14 26 .  .

... 

are all truths also absolutes 
is all of scripture truths  ( and therefore absolutes ) 

if the answer to either of these questions is no , then perhaps you can 
explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths , and 
which truths are absolutes .  . 

the answer to both questions is yes. 

perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then. to me , 
an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , 
situations , etc. true in every instance possible. do you agree 
with this definition i think you do 

similarly , all truth is absolute .  . indeed , a non absolute truth is a 
contradiction in terms. when is something absolute when it is always 
true. obviously , if a truth is not always true then we have a 
contradiction in terms. 

yes , i do agree with your definition .  . my use of the term always is 
rather , i admit .  . 

a simple example 

in the new testament  ( sorry i do n't have a bible at work , and ca n't 
provide a reference ) , women are instructed to be silent and cover 
their heads in church. now , this is scripture .  . by your definition , 
this is truth and therefore absolute .  . 

hold it. i said that all of scripture is true. however , 
exactly what jesus , paul and company were trying to say is not always so 
easy .  . i do n't believe that paul was trying to say that all women should 
behave that way. rather , he was trying to say that under the circumstances 
at the time , the women he was speaking to would best avoid and 
cover their heads .  . this has to do with maintaining a proper witness 
others. remember that any number of statements can be derived 
from absolutes .  . for instance , it is absolutely right for christians to 
for peace. however , this does not rule out trying to maintain world 
peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  ( yes , my opinion . ) . 

are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth.  ( and there are plenty of other examples . ) . 
can you reconcile this 

sure. the bible preaches absolute truths .  . however , exactly what those 
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion. as i said , the bible does 
preach absolute truths .  . sometimes those fundamental principles are 
clear  ( at least to  . sometimes they are not so clear to 
everyone (e . g .  . should baptism be by full or not ,  . that is 
largely because sometimes , it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers 
are speaking to a particular culture or to christianity as a whole .  . this is 
where and the study of biblical comes in. 

it 's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
on your own interpretation is absolute .  . 

god revealed his truths to the world , through his word. it is utterly 
unavoidable , however , that some people come up with alternate 
interpretations .  . practically anything can be misinterpreted , especially 
when it comes to matters of right and wrong. care to deny that

 .  .  . there . is nothing in christianity that the idea of 
repeated lives on earth. 

there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion , clearly makes 
a positive inference to  . i do n't remember which one it is off of 
the top of my head , but it basically goes like this jesus is talking with the 
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can come , 
must first come. jesus replies that has come , but they did not 
recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering to 
john the baptist .  . this seems to me to clearly imply  . can anyone 
offer a reasonable alternative interpretation i would be very interested to 
hear it.

this is somewhat long , but read it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 




boy am i glad you decided to read this. i 've got a problem that 
i need as many people 's help from as possible. 

before i go in to the details of this , let me go ahead and tell 
you that  ( though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy 
girl problem .  .  . at . least not totally like that to me .  .  .  . anyway .  .  .  . 

ok , i am a 19 year old at  . about 10 years ago , my family 
and i were vacationing at the coast in a we  . across the 
street , was girl who would at me whenever she saw me .  .  .  . 
her name in  . well , we became friends that week at the beach and have 
been writing each other for about 10 years .  .  .  . there . was a period of about 
2 years we lost contact .  . but . that was a while ago. 

by the way .  .  . lives in kansas and me in nc .  . 

ok , last year in one of her letters , she says that she is coming 
back to nc to see some of her family who are gonna be there. so i 
about 4 hours to see her. this is where it begins .  .  .  . i . spent 
the whole day with  .  .  . one . of the best days of my life. even though 
we had been writing each other , we still had to get used to being 
in person .  .  .  . she . has got to be the most incredible woman i ever met .  . 
 ( she 's one year older than me btw) .  . i mean , no person in the world could 
ask for a better person. not only was she incredibly beautiful  ( not to 
mention way out of my league .  .  . although . i'm not mind you) , but 
she had a great and a great of humor .  . her family 
is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the 
extent of their christianity .  .  . you . know the kind of people. but she 
knows i am a christian .  . 

well , you get the idea of what i think of her. if there is ever such 
a thing as love at first sight .  .  .  . i . found it. that was last year .  .  . i . kid 
you not when i say that i have thought about her every day since then. 

in out letters , and i always kid each other about not finding 
dates .  . is true for me , but i know it ca n't be for  . 
she has had some problems at home , her folks split up and she ended 
up leaving school .  .  .  . now . we are at the present .  .  .  . 

let me give you part of the letter i got from her last week .  .  .  .  . 


okay , now i'm going to try to explain my life to you. i'm not 
going to ku anymore because something just is n't right. college 
just was n't with me here. greek life is really big here and 
that just is n't my way. i was n't taking any classes that truly interested 
me i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. i was 
interested in something medical  ( physical therpy ) i love working with 
kids , but  it  just did n't work for me at this university .  . and my parents 
could tell. 

so i'm working full time at the bass bass shoes that is and now 
i have a part time job at a local  . i work in the infant room 
m w f. i 've really it so far. it up my week a little bit and 
it 's great experience. 

as of now , i'm not planning on going back to school in the very 
near future. the main reason being my indecision on what i want to 
study .  . but i plan on going back within the next couple of 
years. where i have no idea except for one thing , it wo n't be 
to kansas .  . 

right i'm discussing a with my boss and district 
 . it looks like i 'll train at the i work at now for 
about 4 6 months as assistant and when that 's done , i 'll 
basically be given a list of stores  ( newly or soon to be built ) to 
chose where i would like to  . i 've pretty much decided on either 
one of the  ( hopeully close to the beach ) would n't it 
be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years 
what do you think that i would like to know your opinion. 

this job would pretty much be temporary .  . but it is very good pay 
and any of experience would look good on an application 
or  . the company is solid and treats it employees very well. good 
benefits , medical plans. plus after 1 year of full time 
service , they will  . i do have school money 
for me , but this will help , especially since i will probably end up 
paying out of state wherever i go. 

chris , i really would like to know what you think of my decision. i 
respect your opinion. i 've been completely lost for what to do for 
long that when the opportunity came along it really 
good. i do like my job although i'm about 9 . sure that i want 
to do more with my life than  . but . it is something. 
i do n't think about 20 , 000 a year for a 20 year old female 
is too bad. 

anyway , onto your career decisions. i 'll solve your problem right now , 
marry me .  .  .  . 

you can do your thing i like to be by myself sometimes ! seriously 
 ( or not as seriously ) do what will make you the , worry about the 
home life later. 



ok , well i'm sure you see what has got me so  . what do you 
think she meant about the thing 

i dream at night about her , and then she mentions it in her 
letter ! ! ! i do n't know what to think 

since she wants to move to the 's should i search out a 
bass near here and her to come to 

i always pick on those people who graduate from high school and 
get married .  .  .  . but . what does she mean 

i 've had a lot of lately with and also the fact that 
i do n't date 1 ) no time 2 ) not that much 3) that 
most college women are wrapped up in the social with the 
greeks as a christian i ca n't support and here 
she says she does n't like the greek thing either ! ! 

maybe i'm so because there is actually a girl that i am 
so attracted to paying some real attention to me. 

i mean , what if she did move to nc .  .  . what . would i do i'm 
only 19 and she 20 .  .  .  . i'm . only a through 
classes .  .  . 

i have prayed about this over the past year from time to time .  .  . 
saying , god if she is the right one , let the situation open up .  .  . 

could this be my sign 

i would do anything to get her to nc .  .  . here . is some that makes 
it worse .  .  . 

should i call her i'm terrible over the phone. i do n't even like 
to talk to my friends here for longer than 3 minutes. 

i mean , what would a girl as perfect as her want with a very 
average guy like me 

i'm really confused .  .  .  . i . would really appreciate any help i can get .  . 

thanx 

chris 

i have a feeling that it might be more appropriate to talk with 
chris directly via email.

not quite correct. biblical teaching expects us to celebrate the 
resurrection of christ not once a year but every time someone is  . 
 . 2 12 buried with him in baptism , wherein also are risen with him 
through the faith of the operation of god , who raised him from the 
dead.  . 6 4 therefore we are buried with him in baptism into death 
that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the 
father , even so we also should walk in of life. 
those really want to celebrate the resurrection should by faith walk in 
of life after baptism .  . it is not necessary to celebrate a 
in the process. 

so , as we see from scripture , those who are of israel will observe 
the 7th day forever . the gentiles who believe in the messiah of israel 
are welcome to observe the 7th day as well , but it is not required of them 
since the are into the commonwealth of israel .  . the gentiles who 
are into the commonwealth of israel are only required to observe 
the basic commands given to those who came before  ( see also acts 
 . no further requirements are placed upon them once they come to faith 
in messiah .  . 

so from this i infer that there are different rules for christians of jewish 
descent what happened to there is neither jew nor greek , slave nor free , 
male nor female , for all are one in christ jesus jewish christians 
may find certain forms of worship and certain meaningful because 
of their cultural background , but i have a hard time understanding the 
justification for applying rules or commandments to those who have been 
justified by through faith in jesus christ .  . 

paul answered your question in romans 9. in v. 4 he stated that the 
, the glory , the , the giving of the law , the service of 
god , and the promises were given to the israelites .  . it is a deal. 
he goes on to identify those who are true israelites .  . vs 6 8 makes it 
plain that the true israelites are not those who are born that way but 
those who accept the promise of god. paul continued to that he 
was an in 2  . 11 22 , then in 3 29 he says that all those 
who belong to christ are abraham 's seed , and to all the promises 
given to the israelites .  . the promises come with the law. it is all or 
nothing. why is it that you only want to discard one part of the law 
certainly you would want your husband to be faithful to you. or do you 
believe that adultery is no longer forbidden same law. 

btw please give a reference for your statement that the gentiles are only 
required to observe the basis  . could you list those 
please. acts 15 deals with and the law of moses which was 
added because of of god 's eternal law  ( gal 3 19 4 15 )

i 've heard it said that the accounts we have of life and 
ministry in the gospels were actually written many years after the event. 
 ( about 40 years or  . is this correct if so , why the big time delay

un important , but i still ca n't help be curious !

contact me at 

the gospels are n't dated , so we can only guess. luke 's is 
about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. 
the sounds like luke is from the next generation , and had to do 
some investigating .  . there are traditions passed down that 
say a few things about the composition of the gospels .  . there are 
about how reliable these traditions are. they certainly do n't 
have the status of scripture , yet scholars tend to take some of them 
seriously. one suggests that mark was based on peter 's , and 
was written to preserve them when peter had died or way about to die. 
one tradition about matthew suggests that a collection of jesus words 
may have been made earlier than the current gospels .  . 

in the ancient world , it was much more common to rely on verbal 
of information. i think many people would have preferred 
to hear about jesus directly from someone who had known him , and maybe 
even from someone who studied directly under such a person , rather 
than from a book. thus i suspect that the gospels are largely from a 
period when these people were beginning to die. scholars generally do 
think there was some written material earlier , which was probably used 
as sources for the existing gospels .  . 

establishing the dates is a complex and technical business. i have to 
confess that i'm not sure how much i 'd put on the methods 
used. but it 's common to think that mark was written first , around 64 
ad .  . , and that all of the gospels were written by the end of the 
century. a few people vary this by a or so one way or the 
other.

the witness of the lord jesus christ 

mark 8 31 and he began to teach them that the son of man must suffer 
many things and be rejected by the and the chief priests 
and the scribes , and be killed , and after three days rise again. 

mark 9 31 for he was teaching his disciples and telling them , the son 
of man is to be into the hands of men , and they will 
kill him and when he has been killed , he will rise three days 
later. 

mark 10 34 and they will mock him and upon him , and him , 
and kill him , and three days later he will rise again. 

mark 12 26 but regarding the fact that the dead rise again , have you 
not read in the book of moses , in the passage about the burning 
bush , how god spoke to him , saying ,  i am the god of abraham , and 
the god of isaac , and the god of  

luke 18 33 and after they have him , they will kill him and 
the third day he will rise again. 

luke 24 46 and he said to them , thus it is written , that the christ 
should suffer and rise again from the dead the third day 

john 11 25 jesus said to her , i am the resurrection and the life he 
who believes in me shall live even if he dies , 

john 20 9 for as yet they did not understand the scripture , that he 
must rise again from the dead. 

acts 17 3  .  .  . explaining . and giving evidence that the christ had to 
suffer and rise again from the dead , and saying , this jesus whom 
i am proclaiming to you is the christ .  . 

the witness of the paul 1 15 1 26 

1 now i make known to you , , the gospel which i preached to 
you , which also you received , in which also you stand , 

2 by which also you are saved , if you hold fast the word which i 
preached to you , unless you believed in  . 

3 for i to you as of first importance what i also received , 
that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures , 

4 and that he was buried , and that he was raised on the third day 
according to the scriptures , 

5 and that he appeared to , then to the twelve .  . 

6 after that he appeared to more than five hundred at one 
time , most of whom remain until now , but some have fallen 

7 then he appeared to james , then to all the apostles 

8 and last of all , as it were to one born , he appeared to me 
also. 

9 for i am the least of the apostles , who am not fit to be called an 
, because i persecuted the church of god. 

10 but by the of god i am what i am , and his me did 
not prove but i even more than all of them , yet not i , 
but the of god with me. 

11 whether then it was i or they , so we preach and so you believed .  . 

12 now if christ is preached , that he has been raised from the dead , 
how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead 

13 but if there is no resurrection of the dead , not even christ has 
been raised 

14 and if christ has not been raised , then our preaching is , your 
faith also is  . 

15 moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of god , because we 
witnessed against god that he raised christ , whom he did not raise , 
if in fact the dead are not raised .  . 

16 for if the dead are not raised , not even christ has been raised 

17 and if christ has not been raised , your faith is worthless you are 
still in your sins .  . 

18 then those also who have fallen in christ have  . 

19 if we have hoped in christ in this life only , we are of all men most 
to be  . 

20 but now christ has been raised from the dead , the first of 
those who are  . 

21 for since by a man came death , by a man also came the resurrection 
of the dead. 

22 for as in adam all die , so also in christ all shall be made alive .  . 

23 but each in his own order christ the first , after that those 
who are christ 's at his coming , 

24 then comes the end , when he up the kingdom to the god and 
father , when he has abolished all rule and all authority and power. 

25 for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. 

26 the last enemy that will be abolished is death. 


logical of jesus christ s resurrection 

1. jesus 's enemies would not have stolen his 
body because that would have the 
resurrection the very opposite of what they 
desired .  . 

2. jesus  disciples could not have stolen his 
body because established guards 
to stand watch over the lest his body be 
stolen .  . 

3. sadly  ( and ironically ) , many of jesus  disciples 
did not believe in the resurrection until jesus 
had risen from the dead. 

4. in nearly 20 centuries , no body has ever been 
produced to refute jesus  assertion that he 
would indeed rise from the dead. 

5. the probability of being able to such 
a hoax successfully upon the entire world for 
nearly 20 centuries is negative !

down the of homosexuals for a long time by  ( well meaning ) 
christians .  . the question is how do they interpret these verses .  . any discussion 
of any issue  ( this or any other issue ) requires a proof of your case as well 
as a disproof of the view. we are already familiar with those verses 
and many have proven to themselves that these homosexual behaviour .  . we 
must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the

subject does  just war  exist 
organization university of 
lines 

hi there netters , 
i have a question i would very much like to see some discussion on 
is there such a thing as a   war 

what i would love to see it some basis from scripture for either all war 
is wrong , or some war is . 

to get things started i would like to outline why i am asking the 
question. in my high school days i had been quite involved in the the new 
forces  ( this is a bit like from what i understand of 
it , but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career  . 
through this i became extremely enamoured of flying , have become involved 
in the of , and have a great interest in military 
hardware as the very best a  real  flyer could ask for. my favourite 
computer games are the accurate simulations of military , both 
past and present. 

i became a christian about 10 years ago , and at the time rejected all 
military activity as immoral .  . for me , all war was in complete opposition 
to god 's commandments to love one another , especially one 's enemies .  . 

during the war in iraq , i found myself with great listening to 
the reports of the of the the attacks using the 
technology i so admire the   bomber , the , and 
strike , etc. after the war concluded i began to really enjoy 
simulations based around this conflict great to go and bomb saddam 's 
weapons plants in an on my computer , or shoot down some of his 
's in an  . the of the death of people was a wonderful 
game. i imagine the real view the real thing in much the same way. 
one only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact 
of war is ignored a building containing people , or an by a 
is simply a  . dead civilians are   . these 
are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose 
support are necessary for the continued of war one only has to 
look at vietnam to see how important public opinion is. 

now we see troops sponsored by the united nations entering , and 
the of military intervention in the muslim conflict in 
the former yugoslavia .  . my in particular to the of 
, and in the last few days of  ( sorry  spelling ) , 
has caused me to where i stand on   war. 

i will list several wars in the last 50 years i can look at each , and say 
yes this may have been , this may not. these are simply my gut 
reactions to each in many cases with the benefit of the 
history brings .  . let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for 
my reaction i am not a historian , so excuse any historical , i 
am working from popular history as it is known in new  . 

1. the second world war 
murder of jews hitler had to be stopped .  . 
massive civilian casualties on both sides 
dresden , hiroshima nagasaki 
probably  . 

2. war 
political by north korea , basically 
communism vs. capitalism .  . 
probably not  . 

3. vietnam 
as above , by us involvement .  . 

4. invasion of  . 
genocide by  . 
probably  . 

5. iraq  ( desert storm ) 
political , threat to world oil supply 
other factors such as genocide .  . 
not sure , but probably 

6. a future involvement in bosnia 
genocide so called  ethnic  
emotive much tv of atrocities and civilian casualties .  . 
probably 

7. possible future use of nuclear weapons tactical or strategic , 
somewhere in the world by the us in response to someone else e.g. 
or israel .  . 
my feelings in this are simple 
nuclear war weapons are abhorrent 
i love the new government 's stand on banning all nuclear 
armed or from  . 
never  . 

these are my own views , i have looked at scripture , and i am confused .  . i 
would appreciate others view , particularly those based on scripture .  . i 
do n't want a , wrong i think answers 8 ) .  . 

thanks for your help.

note that in this , perhaps the oldest of the creeds , there is no mention 
of the danger of hell for non believers .  . likewise there is no mention 
of the salvation of the believers  soul and its in heaven after 
death. there is only the resurrection of the body  ( and it does not say 
when or  . 

you do n't go far enough back .  . if we believe in god and that he did create the 
heavens and the earth and he did create adam and eve and that they walked in 
the garden and history from there , if we can agree with that , then would 
you agree that the further back you go the closer you get to people who had a 
stronger memory of who god was and what he said and commanded 

between adam and eve and the whole process of the fall of man 
occurred .  . this involved a gradual of consciousness of the spiritual 
world. this is in the world of different peoples through 
history. the greek , for example , could say , better a in the land 
of the living than a king in the land of the dead.  ( iliad , i think) .  . 

the question of what happens to human beings who died before christ is 
an ever present one with christians .  . i am not ready to adam 
or abraham , or even cain to eternal damnation .  . yet they all died in their 
sins , in the christian sense. the same can be said of the whole of gentile 
humanity , and also of the on the cross next to 
him. i do not limit the power of christ to save even him , through whom 
satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment .  . 

in my studies 
of the ancient mystery , i have run across many or rituals or 
what with the interpretation that those who are of god will be with him 
via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer eternal life in dieing .  . 
it was a standard belief back then. 

it is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment .  . the 
relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely 
extended conditions of mean time. it is possible to imagine 
an eternity of or or even many of them in the 
spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth. 

it was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous 
were lost. this again is the result of the loss of the consciousness 
that from us after the fall , with our ever increasing involvement with 
the sense world. 

it would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient 
people 's ideas of life after death. 

today we think we know so much and that 
if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two .  . 
but i think that as this age has grown older that it is we who from a 
, not those of the older ages. 


mankind into and , and at the turning point of 
time a new light entered into the world. the light still grows , and 
we are developing the eyes with which to see by it. much new 
revelation and growth in under standing lies before us. our new 
vision and understanding is still very feeble , but it contains 
something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and 
much more as well. 

 ( at this point i should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of 
, founder of , for many insights that have led me to my 
views on this subject) .  . 

i have said it before , i 'd love to post on this but the hammer would 
fall .  . the history to can be shown from the in england to the 
greeks who it from the egyptians who ultimately got it from the 
mysteries .  . and yes , the eastern religions also show many 
similarities .  . i mean , its black and white. the writings and the 
finds plainly show its origin and the whys and wherefores of this  . 

the way you refer to it as doctrine puts a modern intellectual 
on it. i think it was much less abstract and much more real and 
concrete , a teaching that much closer to home than our doctrines or 
teachings today can be received .  . 

i am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to 
simple from an original source. even if they were passed 
on , the question is , to what extent did they reflect real perception 
and experience the similarity in the midst of great variety of 
of the different people 's ideas of the time immediately 
after death to the presence of an underlying reality. in 
any case , we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of , 
but by the principles themselves. 

on the other hand , there is one notion firmly embedded in christianity 
that originated most definitely in a source. the idea that the 
human being consists essentially of soul only , and that the soul is 
created at birth , was from aristotle , whose ideas 
dominated christian thought for hundred years and still does 
today. he was at once the father of modern thought and at the same 
time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our 
eternal spiritual being had grown dim .  . 

maybe at sometime in the future 

indeed. i should also clarify that i do not deny that eternal 
damnation is a real possibility .  . but the narrow range in 
which we conceive of the decisive moment , i.e. after the end of a 
single earthly life , is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the 
reality , and i think that is why the early creeds were in 
terms that did not try to it out.

i must have missed the postings about , david koresh , and the second

person claiming to be it is obviously insane 

first by his  . the messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven 
on the earth. he also comes to first reveal the root cause of 
original sin  ( fallen nature ) and then provide a means to cut the 
connection to that original sin .  . he also wants to create world peace 
based on  . the messiah 's teachings will build on the foundation 
of the bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of god , 
the fall of man , the purpose of creation , and god 's of 
 . it will also provide a foundation for the unity of all 
the world 's religions .  . 

many christians expect jesus to come on literal , so they may 
miss him when he returns .  . just as the jewish people missed jesus 2000 
years ago. they are still waiting for his first coming .  . the jewish 
people of that age expected to come first. jesus said that 
john the baptist was  . but john the baptist denied that he was 
 .  ( how did this reflect on jesus ) later in prison john even 
questioned who jesus was is he the one who is to come or do we look 
for another .  ( see book of matthew ) 


i'm not saying that david koresh is the second coming of christ .  . how could 
somebody who breaks his word be the second coming koresh did promise that 
he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio 
 . he did n't .  . still it seems to me that he did fool some people. 

david koresh did n't even come close. the problem is that people like 
this make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real 
messiah when he does show up. 


and , from my knowledge of the bible , it seems that christians have 
been hard on the jews of christ 's day for being about accepting 
somebody that their religious authorities did n't accept as the messiah .  . 

so i was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be 
early to recognize the second coming while , at the same time , not wanting to 
be believing just anybody who claims to be god. 

very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for 
christians how to recognize the second coming 

the messiah should not claim to be god. what sets a messiah apart is 
that he is born without original sin .  . he is not born perfect but 
after a period of growth .  . adam and eve were born 
sinless but they , and this meant that it would take god 
thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as god 
originally intended .  . god 's is still not 
complete. the messiah is the true son of god , one with god , god 's 
representative on the earth , but not god himself. there is only one 
god. 

mark 13 21 and then if any one says to you ,  look , here is the christ ! ' 
or  look , there he is ! ' do not believe it.

it 's like refusing  god 's kingdom  . 

in one of jesus  revelation in this century ,  .  .  . same . thing as in 
the old days. people refuse to believe my  . even when 
i was alive here on earth , they refuse me. what more when i am just 
talking through somebody else  . 

with all the knowledge believers , he would think that 
we would be  enlightened  enough to detect which ones are 
 authentic and divine  as opposed to  evil or man  . 

these signs , these miracles , are you afraid that they are not from god 
that these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking 
they are evil 
well , is faith in god evil 
is true peace evil is true love that is divine and pure evil 
why ca n't someone accept that god can do what he wants in fulfillment of his 
generous love and jesus  never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to 
him for salvation 
why are we refusing god 's messenger of this truth the mother to all who are 
in christ 
what brings us these 
of being by what others will think or say about us 
which , in contrary , could be to god 
of being 
of being judged as wrong  ( wrt mainstream standard of what is right ) 
why ca n't we tolerate non believers  or of us for the 
sake of peace , love and obedience to god the lessons left to us 
by and 
we 'd rather engage in never ending and disproof of each other 's 
opinion looking at each other 's mistakes for the sake of arguments , 
instead of having in one body with christ .  . 
what makes us go blind to the truth that god is all powerful and that he can 
not be by what people wrote and have written about him in all ages 
why is our faith in god limited by all the words and literature we 
what prevents us from going beyond being saved and extend god 's rich love 
to others who are not 

why are our eyes not wide open to see that he continuously sees our faith , hope 
and love which glorify him and so he gives us of his 
with signs miracles  ( ordinary common or divinely inspired ) 
everywhere is n't that like an atheist agnostic 's view that all these 
are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural 

why then does the holy mother comes back to us 
we must really accept that prayer changes the course of things and that 
with prayers even wars can be prevented . 
but then she continues 
you often have an attitude. dear children , in these days you 
have prayed very much , but your hands have remained empty . 
why in proclaiming what needs to be done 
prayer , conversion , peace , , , the holy mass , living life 
as what the gospel brings .  . 
why not do so how to the world 
to this , the mother says 
start in your family. be a good example. live the word. 
why worry if it is going to be of good use to many 
our holy mother says 
the , leave them to the lord , do not worry about anything or 
anyone but yourself to the lord .  . 

although the holy mother does not insist because 
you are free i bow before the freedom which god gives you. 
but she follows this with 
you are surprised because i say to you decide for god and yet , see how 
you have lived this day. 
why does she constantly 
take this life god in the way as to experience the lord himself 
in your behavior and not only when you pray or one time when we 
decide that we are saved , or talk write about god , etc. 
the holy mother 
satan  ( the serpent ) is always trying to you to turn you away from 
my peace plan and prayer .  .  ( rev 12 17 , the became angry with the woman 
and went off to war against the rest of her , those who keep 
god 's commandments , and bear witness to jesus . ) . 

do you have fear or hate for god 's current messenger of true peace , love and 
our from the anti christ 
the one who is being of communism , wars , and other evils 
that the brings upon us 
this obedient and new eve 
the mother who us so we can be prepared and be strong against satan 
have n't there been faith , hope , love , peace and obedience wherever 
this messenger has shared her and that god has given her 
in good purpose 
why do we choose to be blind 
why fear the truth that god has been giving us a chance and christ 's 
ever forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother 
the mother who has been the task to reverse the 
harm and example done by the ancient eve .  . 
she has been the new with her heart .  . 
the new as  ( the womb ) for the next coming and judgement of the 
righteous by our lord , jesus christ when the lamb his  . 
should n't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of us for the 
second coming of her son as she has been conceived without sin to bear 
the son of god in her womb 
why fear true peace , love and faith and obedience to god that mary 
faithfully brings to god 's children she has been protecting the 
 ( the rest of the offsprings ) from the greedy so as to present more 
righteous members for her son 's coming .  . 
not all and miracles that resulted from them are worthy 
of belief .  . with prayer and from the holy spirit and , of course , 
approval of our church authorities , we should be aware of the true and 
divinely inspired ones specifically , the ones which with the 
scripture .  . 


also , our reminds us of of silence in our prayers 
if you speak in your prayers , how will you be able to hear 
god allow him room to answer you , to speak to you. 

she encourages us  ( with nurturing ) to continue in 
faith , hope and love to jesus , constantly .  . not with mere emotions , 
but with deep , constant obedience to jesus , her beloved son and 
acknowledgement of our need to have him as part of our lives. 

let 's not wait to the last minute to our faith and the life 
that god wants us to live when there wo n't be enough time or when 
it will be late. 

nowadays , mary says , 
pray , pray , pray for peace .  .  . , my children. 
have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to 
others. for without peace , you can not fully accept my son. 


and you think she 's just an ordinary  . not to me. she 's

andrew , 

how i wish this were true , and how i long for the day in which it will 
be true. but , it is not true of history. the bible does not have a 
message it has messages. and some of those are messages of and 
giving , to turn the other , and do unto the least of these. but some 
of the messages are the complete opposite .  . like the order to 
wipe out other tribes including women and children down to , and 
punished severely when they were less than complete about the job. like 
jews who are said to have cried out in matthew , his blood be upon our heads 
and our heads a verse quoted in every from the crusades to 
the  . have these been misunderstood i think not. they have only 
been understood too clearly .  . it is essential that christians grasp firmly 
the good the bible teaches , the meek from nazareth is a 
symbol for how we should be , his teachings we must take to heart , but we 
cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and 
say those who live by that have misread it. to say that is only to chose a 
point of interpretation and declare it  . such can be done with the 
same by anyone. instead we must let the text critique the text. 
understanding that there is both good and bad in our sacred , we test 
all things and hold fast to that which is good. 


p.s. i believe that a line of questioning like you presented 
is , strangely enough , compatible with becoming a christian .  . 
certainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviour 
of the world , and especially christians .  . i praise god for 
jesus christ , and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs 
and still come back to god and be forgiven , time and time 
again. 


at the risk of sounding heretical  ( well ok , more heretical ) i do n't think 
that doubt is something which requires forgiveness , it is something which 
requires introspection and reflection .  . if that is a sin , then there can 
be no salvation , for doubt is an part of being human. consider 
job. his friends had no doubt. whereas job had no doubt in himself but 
the wisdom and justice of god. when god finally did appear he 
rebuked the friends and had job make sacrifices for them. to be a christian 
it to always have doubt , or not to have honesty .  .

thanks in advance. 

i do n't claim to be an expert on the branch , but i might know more 
than most. 

the branch group  ( led by koresh ) is actually one of two off 
of a group known as the 's  . the 's  ( now 
as far as i know)broke ) off from the sda church in the 30 's .  . 

the 's broke away from the sda church because they felt that the 
sda church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy .  . they felt that they 
were the remnant spoken about in revelation .  . 

about the koresh group , koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988. once 
in control , he made himself the center of it. he himself as 
christ .  . 

koresh himself came from an sda background .  . he was excommunicated as a young 
adult by the local for trying to exert too much control over 
the youth in the church. after this , he joined the branch  . 

they were are a cult .  . this is why they had the of 
weapons , food , a bomb shelter , etc. they had no intent of the us 
government or anything. they were for and were 
putting themselves in a self defense position. 

in my opinion , if the atf and the fbi had left well enough alone , we  
t have the blood of 20 children out from the in  . 

if you want to know about the 's , you might want to visit the 
local sda church and talk to some of the older people. they could give you 
some insight into where koresh got his theology .  .

i any theist to reply. 




i probably should let this pass , it 's not worth the time , and it 's not 
really intended for me. but i could n't resist .  . a personal weakness of mine. 
 .  . 

the foundation for faith in god is reason , without which the existence 
of god could not be proven .  . that his existence can be proven by reason 
is  . my short , traditional for the 
existence of god , and  . 

not so i can prove that the existance of god is 
by showing that people dispute it this is easy i dispute that 
god exists. simple. 

i missed your traditional , but the i remember 
from the  ( the 5 ways i think it was ) were rather poor 
stuff. the argument is about a billion times better , imho .  . 

i would think you 'd want non traditional , considering the general 
failure of the traditional at least the ones i know of. 
(i am thinking of the argument , the cosmological argument and 
the teleological argument. those are the ones traditional enough to 
have funny names , anyway . ) . 

now , given that god exists , and that his existence can be proven by reason , 
i assert that his commands must be followed blindly , although in our fallen 
condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith. why 

this is the real question. so to discuss it , i 'll assume god exists. 
otherwise , there is no heavenly authority to babble about. 

because god is the first cause of all things , the first mover of matter , 
the independent thing that requires nothing else for its existence , the 
measure of all that is perfect , and the essential being who gives order 
to the universe  . 

please show this is the case. i am familiar with the first cause 
argument , and i 'll accept  ( for the sake of argument ) that there 
is a first cause , even though i find some of its 
questionable .  . the rest you 'll have to show. this includes 
that the first cause is god. 

i next assert that god is all good. 

got it. i deny that god is all good. so there. 

if this is so , then that which is 
contrary to the will of god is evil i.e. , the absence of the good. and , 
since god can never contradict himself , then by his promise of a savior 
as early as the of genesis 3 5 , god that because 
a human  ( adam ) was first responsible for man 's from the source 
of all good , a man would be required to act to the friendship .  . 
thus god became in the person of the messiah .  . 

this is n't self consistent if humans must the relationship , 
then god  ( incarnate or not ) ca n't do it. well , unless you think god is 
human. granted , god made himself  human  , but this is nonetheless 
the intent of the statement is clearly that man has to fix the problem 
he caused .  . god fixing it even by means contradicts this. 

now this messiah claimed that he is the truth  ( john 14  . if this claim 
is true , then we are bound by reason to follow him , who is truth  . 

why 

also , why assume said claim is true anyway 

if i claim to be truth , are you bound by reason to follow me 

you next seem to have a problem with authority .  . have you tried the united 
states corps yet i can tell you first hand that it is an excellent 
in authority .  . 

) 

undoubtably .  . do you mean to imply we should all obey the commands of the 
without question you seem to imply this about god , and 
that the are similar in this respect .  .  . if this is not what 
you are trying to say , they please explain what it is you are saying , 
as i have missed it. 

if you have not yet had the privilege , i will 
reply that the authority which is truth may never be questioned , 
and thus must be followed blindly .  . 

why why not question it even if it is truth , we cannot know this 
certainly , so why is it so irrational to question perhaps we will 
thus discover that we were wrong. 

you assert that god is truth and we ca n't question truth. but 
i assert that god is not truth and anyway we can question truth. 
how is it my assertion is less good than yours 

one may not deny the truth. 

oh 

i hereby deny 1 1 2. 

i hope you 'll agree 1 1 2 is the truth. 

granted , i look pretty damn silly saying something like that , 
but i needed something we 'd both agree was clearly true. 

now , you 'll notice no have in to 
me off to the  . no heaven either. no 
net  . i seem to be to say such things , absurd or not. 

for 
example , when the apple on isaac newton 's head , he could 
have denied that it happened , but he did not. the laws of physics must 
be whether a human likes them or not. they are true. 

they are certainly not true. at least , the ones newton derived are 
not true , and are indeed at high or small 
 . we do not have a set of laws of physics that always 
works in all cases. if we did , physics would be over already. 

science is all about questioning this sort of truth. if we did n't , 
we 'd still follow aristotle .  . i 'd generalize this a little more 
if you want to learn anything new , you must question the things 
you know  . because you can always be wrong. 

therefore , the authority which is truth may not be denied .  . 

even that truth may not be denied , and may 
not be questioned , and that god is truth , it only follows 
that god may not be denied or questioned .  . not that he must 
be ! 

we could disobey him. how of us. 
but you have not connected denial with  .

evil result of human , rather than the will of god 
in a certain sense yes. but in the sense that god allows evil to 
happen , when obviously  ( he being god) he could have not had it happen , 
does in a certain sense mean that he it to happen. god does not 
evil , but instead uses it for good , as you say , however , what 
god desires , must be from what actually happens. for example , 
god desires that all should be saved  ( 1 timothy 2 . , however , it is 
quite obvious that nowhere near all are saved .  . was god 's will 
no , because his will cannot be escaped , for even when it appears that 
it is your will doing something , it is actually the will of god which by 
his has us to do as he wishes .  . so we come to the age old 
question , why does evil occur to which we must answer that god allows 
evil to occur , though he does not it , so that his ultimate plan 
may be brought to  . personally , i suggest reading the parts of 
the of st. thomas that deal with the knowledge of god 
to get a good grasp on this whole idea. 

 . i'm going to have to be very careful with my language here. i 
think god is voluntarily giving up his omniscience in this world so 
that we can decide on our own where we go free will. in this sense 
god allows evil to occur , and in this sense can be held responsible 
as my says .  . however , his will is , of course , that all be 
saved .  . he 's not going to save us by himself we have to take a 
step in his direction before he will save us. read that last sentence 
carefully i'm not saying we save ourselves. i'm saying we have to 
accept our salvation .  . i do not believe in it would 
appear from what you say further down that you do.

i am not saying that anyone deserves punishment more than someone else.

and i said christians should not be participants in such wars and 
 . that does not the fact that god allows this evil to 
continue , for he is patient and willing that none should , so he

this is what indicates to me that you may believe in  .

i am not saying that the evil the is justified by 
their guilt .  . i am saying that it is possible that god is punishing them 
in this way. in no way is this evil justified , that does not mean 
that god cannot use evil to further his purposes. i am not accusing the 
, though they may very well be guilty of great sins , but that is 
up to god to judge. we are all when the time comes for our 
judgement by god. let us all sincerely hope and pray that we will have 
jesus christ as our advocate at that judgement .  . 

yes , it is up to god to judge. but he will only mete out that 
punishment at the last judgement .  . as for now , evil can be done by 
human beings that is not god 's will and the best we can do is see 
taht some good comes out of it somehow. the thing that most 
me about the it is the will of god argument is that this will 
convince people that we should not stop the rape and killing when i 
think that it is most christ like to do just that. if jesus stopped 
the stoning of an woman  ( perhaps this is not a good 
parallel , but i'm going to go with it anyway ) , why should we not stop 
the murder and violation of people who may  ( or may not ) be more 
innocent

lines 

a  ( d andrew , i think) wrote , in response to the 
suggestion that genocide may sometimes be the will of god 

any god who works that way is evil , 
and unworthy of my worship or faith. 

replied  ( as , in substance , did others ) 

where is your source of moral standards by which you judge god 's 
behavior 

it is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge god 's 
actions .  . who is the to talk back to the potter but we find a 
contrary view in scripture .  . when god to destroy the city of 
sodom  ( genesis 18 ) , abraham says 

suppose that there are some good men in the city. 
will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked 
far be it from you , lord , to do such a thing ! 
shall not the judge of all the earth do right 

i am told that the hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this , and 
can perhaps be better  ( dynamic equivalence ) as 

on you , lord , if you do such a thing ! 

there are those who say that the definition of good is whatever 
god happens to want. but if that is so , then the statement that god 
is good has no meaning. it simply says that god does what he wants. 
that being the case , no one can either love or obey god because he 
is good. the only motive left for obeying him is that he is 
powerful .  . just as it makes sense to obey a dictator , even when he 
tells you to round up all jews and exterminate them , because if you 
him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself , so it makes 
sense to obey god , because he has the power to punish you if you 
do n't .  . this ethical theory i take to be in radical contradiction to 
genesis 18 and to christianity in general. 

any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any 
further discussion of morality  ( or of the goodness of god) 
meaningless .  . however , it does not follow that our moral judgements 
are always infallible in particular cases , still less our judgements 
in particular cases about the course of action most likely to 
achieve a good result. 

when i read the scriptural accounts of the actions of god in 
history , those actions often seem to me very different from what i 
might expect of a god who loves us and desires what is best for us. 
moreover , leaving the scriptures aside , and considering the natural 
world , i find that nature is often very different from what i might 
expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity .  .  ( origen said 
those who believe that the author of nature is also the author of 
the scriptures must expect to find in the scriptures the same sort 
of difficulties that they find in nature. ) 

now , that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an 
argument against the existence , power , wisdom , and goodness of god. 
on the contrary , their absence would be such an argument. suppose 
that i am watching bobby play , and suppose that every 
time he makes a move , i find myself and saying good move ! 
just what i was expecting him to do. same move i would have made if 
i were playing .  . that would be a sign that is no better a 
than myself. given that he is better , i expect that at 
least some of his will have me thinking , now , what do suppose 
him to do that or even , boy , that was a real slip he 's 
just thrown the game away ! similarly , if god the 
workings of the universe better than i do , it is to be expected that 
sometimes it will look to me as if he has made a mistake. 

one difference between at the and god at the 
of the universe is that i can see the end of the 
game. if , i my earlier inference that it was 
that made him lose his queen 23 earlier. 
however , if he loses , and particularly if i can see that there was a 
time when he had an opportunity for a in two and did 
not take it , then i know that he is not as good a as i had 
thought. 

with god , on the other hand , i shall not in this life see the total 
result of some of his actions .  . therefore , my grounds for judging 
that i have seen a bad move on his part must always be far 
than my grounds for making a similar judgement about  . 



in the book of genesis , we read that joseph 's ten older brothers , 
who  ( with good reason ) found him , to sell 
him into slavery in egypt .  . there he eventually became , and 
when there was a in , he was able to provide for his 
family. when his brothers , he told them do 
not worry .  . you meant to do me evil , but god turned it into good. 

i once heard a rabbi speak on this text. he said 

the history of the jews is largely a history of events 
that look like that threaten the continued 
survival of the religion , or the people , or both. but , 
amazingly , those events turn out to be the saving of the jews 
and of judaism .  . 
the sale of joseph by his brothers looked like the 
of the family. but in fact , it ended with a of 
the quarrel between them. the that the family out

their culture .  . their oppression by the egyptians a few 
generations after their in egypt again looked like a 
disaster .  . but god used it to bring them out of egypt , and into 
the promised land. 
here the people built a temple , and regularly offered 
sacrifices .  . but the captured jerusalem and judea , 
temple and city and , and most of 
the people to  . you might have thought that that would 
be the end of the people and the religion. but it was not. 
living in , the people had been under constant danger of 
 . again and again , they had turned from the 
worship of the lord to the worship of the 
cults , with their ritual prostitution and ritual human 
sacrifice .  . the put a stop to that. never 
again did the jews show any interest in or  . 
neither the worship of the canaanites that of the 
ever again had a among them. 
nor is that all. judaism had been in danger of becoming 
simply a system of sacrifices and temple  . the only 
prescribed acts of worship of coming to jerusalem 
every so often and offering a sacrifice .  . during the , 
with the temple gone , the jews invented the , a place 
of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the 
scriptures .  . they came to realize clearly , what they were in 
danger of forgetting while they continued to live in judea , 
that god is not simply a local or deity , not just the 
of the land of , or the of the jewish 
people , but the creator of the world , and the ruler and judge 
of all humans everywhere. 
time passed , and the empire was replaced by 
that of the , and then that of the greeks , or rather 
the  . the ruler , , was determined 
to stamp out judaism , and to this end he made the reading and 
the study of the torah punishable by death. again , one might 
think that this would be the end of judaism .  . but it was not. 
the people met for worship , and instead of reading the torah 
portion for the day , they would read some passage 
from the prophets that had a similar theme , and then discuss 
that. before this time , the torah , the so called five books of 
moses  ( genesis , exodus , , numbers , and deuteronomy ) 
were the only books read and studied in the  . if it 
had not been for , the books of the prophets would 
probably have been forgotten altogether. his hatred for judaism 
saved them. 

other examples here for 's sake. 

some of you may remember that andrews first became 
famous as in the stage of my fair 
 . when brothers to make a movie of it , 
everyone expected that , who had been so on 
stage , would play the same role in the movie .  . instead , the 
decided to go with an established star , and cast 
 . andrews was naturally  . but she 
later realized that if she had played the role , she 
would have been type cast for life as an type .  . 
it would have been a disaster for her. as it was , 
offered her the role of mary , and she won an for 
it. at the , she stood there , smiling , and looking 
at , she said , and now , my special thanks to the 
man who made all this possible jack ! it was the most 
memorable line of the evening. 
in a similar spirit , we jews might thank the men who in 
the of god have preserved judaism , and kept it alive 
to this day , beginning with joseph 's brothers , and continuing 
with two , with , with 
 .  .  .  . 

after the formal meeting had broken up , one woman came up to him 
privately and said , you were talking about the , were n't 
you he answered , if that is an example that came to your mind , 
then you are right , i was talking about it to you. but i would not 
talk about it to everyone , for not everyone can bear it. i assume 
that he meant that , without the , there would have been no 
state of israel .  . 

someone hearing the rabbi 's lecture might leap to the conclusion 
that god is dependent on the of men to his 
purposes or at least that the rabbi thought so. he might then go 
on to suppose that the is in fact god 's doing that he 
stirred up joseph 's brothers to a hate against him , and 
that when the israelites were in egypt , god 's 
heart , so that he oppressed the people , and would not let them go. 
and this raises questions about how an action can be considered 
wicked and at the same time be considered something that god has 
brought about. 

i suggest another way of looking at it. consider a who has 
a log of wood from which he to carve a  . but the log , 
instead of having a even grain throughout , has a large 
that the appearance of the surface .  . the considers 
the wood for a while , and then a that features the 
, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color 
of the wood correspond to some feature of the , so that 
observers will say how fortunate the was in finding a 
piece of wood with a like that in just the right place. its 
presence is the touch , the thing that makes the a 
great work of art .  . in reality , the , far from being what the was 
looking for , was a challenge to his  . if the wood had not 
contained that flaw , he would still have made a great work of art , 
but a different one. so , if joseph 's brothers had not sold him , god 
would still have brought about his purposes for the jewish people , 
but he would have done so in another manner. if judas had not 
betrayed jesus , if and his fellow leaders had not rejected 
jesus , but had rather acknowledged him as the of god , if 
had followed his conscience rather than his and had set 
jesus free , it might appear that there would have been no 
crucifixion , and therefore no , and therefore no 
salvation .  . not so. god did not need judas  sin to us. if 
judas had done right , then god in christ would still have 
the world to himself. we do not know how , just as we do not know 
how would have the if its 
had instead been like grand central station , and 
just as we do not know how bobby would have won his fourth 
game if had refused the exchange of 
and had attacked 's knight instead  ( do n't bother to look up 
the game in question i am making up this example , but the point is 
none the less  . 

thus , we may say both (1) that god used , say , the of 
to his purposes , and (2) that the said 
was not god 's doing , and that would not have god 's 
plans by behaving justly and  . 

what , then , are we to make of the place where god says to moses , i 
will 's heart , so that he will not let the people go 
some christians have taken this to mean that was a 
with god the , and that his and 
were not his own work , but the work of god in him. i suppose rather 
that what god was telling moses was something like this if you see 
that is not willing to let the people go , do not be 
discouraged , or suppose that the situation is out of my control. my 
purposes will not be  . if chooses to hear you and 
let the people go , well and good. if he does not , i will fit his 
resistance into my plans , and fit it so perfectly that future 
and theologians will suppose that i would have been 
thrown for a loss if had me. 

to return to the question that started this all off. is it possible 
that the serbs , in the moslems of bosnia , are 
of god 's will 
first point. what they are doing is wrong , just as what 
joseph 's brothers did was wrong , just as what judas did was wrong. 
they intend it for evil. if god somehow brings good out of it , that 
does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and 
punishment .  . 
second point. of course , god will bring good out of it. but not 
the same good that he would have brought if the had 
from the sins of and rape and murder .  . nor does the 
good he purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.

your logic me. 

if the is infallible , and this is a matter of faith , then the 
pope cannot be wrong ! if , on the other hand , this is not a matter 
of faith , but a matter of church law , then we should still obey as the 
pope is the legal head of the church. 

in other words , given the doctrine of , we have no choice

catholic theologians acknowledge that there have been a number of 
when the pope was wrong. there appear to be two aspects to 
 . one is a general concept that in the long run the 
church is protected from serious error. however this does not mean 
that it 's impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or 
another. the more specific concept of papal is that in 
very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be 
infallible .  . however a relatively small of statements meet 
those  . this does not catholics from the duty to obey 
even ordinary teachings of the pope .  . however only a few teachings 
are made in a way that is explicitly infallible .  .

the basic problem with your argument is your total and complete on

least 90 years after the fact. in the meantime everyone he mentions has died 
and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up 
with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established .  . 
moreover , account of some of the events in acts  ( as recorded in 
galatians ) fail to establish the acts accounts. 

even if there was no independent proof that luke 's account was 
valid , i find it strange that you would take the negation of it as 
truth without any direct historical evidence  ( at least that you 've 
mentioned ) to back it up. the assertion was made , 
that no christian ever for their faith by believing in 
the resurrection .  . luke 's account suggests otherwise , and in the

then i suggest that this assertion is suspect .  .

i think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than 
this. it was an answer to the claim that the witnesses could n't 
be lying because they were to suffer for their beliefs .  . 
thus it 's not necessary to show that no christian ever suffered 
for believing in the resurrection .  . rather the issue is whether 
those who witnessed it did. 

i do agree that the posting you 're responding to shows that there 
can be liberal as well as conservative  .

aside from a commentary , you might also want to consider an 
introduction .  . these are books intended for use in bible 
 . they give historical background , discussion of 
, etc. and generally they have good for further 
reading. i typically recommend , and young 's nt 
introduction .  .  .  . 

two other to consider 

the introduction by ku is a translation of a nt text. 
the references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat , but 
the book contains a wealth of information. 

and 's intro is also very good. it 's somewhat more 
modern than ku 's but not quite so  . also the 
authors tend to go through the books of the nt in the historical order 
of composition this gives a very useful perspective on the 
development of the nt .  . 

... there are also some good one volume commentaries .  . ... probably the 
best these days would be 's bible commentary .  . 

a slight i think the 's is ok but not great .  . one 
particular problem i have is that it tends to be pretty on 
material. my feeling is that it is ok for quick 
look , but not real useful for study in depth (e . g .  . i keep a copy 
in my office at  . 

... (i think there may be a couple of books with this title .  .  .  . 

so far as i know there is the only one book with this exact title 
 ( james l , general editor , and row , 1988 ) although i think 
i recall a  ( older ) series under the name commentaries . also 
there 's a separate 's bible dictionary  ( most of my comments on 
the also apply to the ) . 

my favorite one volume commentary is the new biblical 
commentary . the is rather catholic in focus and somewhat biased 
towards the nt .  .  ( the reader can decide for her or himself whether 
these are or ) . in any case the is by and 
large excellent .  . 

note the is a completely , updated version of the 
biblical commentary , copies of which can still be found on

he does n't contradict himself. the church is to last for all time. 
however , there are those who use the church to themselves. this 
is evident in many letters. for instance , paul talks about the 
super apostles to the  ( 2 11 12 ) , he mentions 
how people will be led away by miracles , signs , and wonders  ( 2 
2 9 12 ) , he tells timothy that it is clear that some will 
the faith and teach lies  ( 1 timothy 4 1 3) and that some will 
search for teachers to suit what they want to hear  ( 2 timothy 4 3  . 
such passages go throughout the letters and jesus does warn about them 
 ( matthew 24 4  . but look at the promise in this last part. verse 
14 and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world 
as a testimony to all nations , and then the end will come. even today , 
there are false teachings .  . i can name two which i am well familiar 
with the non need of baptism and the praying of jesus into your life 
for salvation . both are taught .  . both are dead wrong. they have been 
taken out of context from some verses , interpreted from others , and just 
plain made up. the only way jesus taught is given in luke 9 23 26 and 
luke 14 25 33 .  . he then commands baptism in matthew 28 18 20 .  . the 
church jesus founded , though , is alive and well. it 's not being

being persecuted .  .

i can hardly use the cosmic of stuff as a guide to life. 
it would just say do n't bother .  . 

for mortals , there are many of scale you can talk 
about. in a human , you can have big purposes.

their deeds cannot be said to have come to nothing , even if they 
are utterly forgotten. 

mankind itself will one day  . 

one day , surely .  .  ( well , unless you believe in the second coming , which 
i do not ) 

but in that time we can make a difference. 

without some 
that transcends the physical , without god , it is all pointless in the 
end. 

in the end. but it must be the end until then , there is all the 
point you can  . and when that end comes , there will be nobody 
to ask , gee , i do n't think james 's deeds are gonna make 
much of a difference , , know . 

but they will have already have made a difference , great or small , 
before the end. 

why must your ends be eternal to be worthwhile 

most people are able to live with that , and for them little 
purposes  ( success , money , power , effecting change , helping others ) 
suffice .  . 

little is in the eye of the beholder , of course. 

i suppose they never think about the cosmic scale , or are at 
least able to put it out of their minds .  . 

i do n't doubt it. but i have thought about the cosmic scale. and 
it does not seem to mean much to us , here , today. 

to me , it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion .  . 

i would not find this comforting .  . but perhaps it is merely my 
definitions .  . here 's what i think the relevant terms are 

reality that which is real. 
illusion that which is not real , but seems to be. 
real objectively existing 

for reality to be an illusion would mean , then 

that which is real is not real , but seems to be. 

or 

that which objectively exists , does not objectively exist , but 
does seem to objectively exist. 

from which we can conclude , that unless you want to get a 
contradiction , that no things objectively exist. 

but i have a problem with this because i would like to say 
that i objectively exist , if nothing else. ergo sum 
and all that. 

perhaps you do not mean all that , but rather mean 
objective reality is by humans. 

which is not so bad , and so far as i know is true. 

that the 
true reality the the physical is spirit .  . 

have on. if reality is an illusion , is n't true reality an illusion 
too and if true reality is spirit , t that make spirit an illusion 
as well 

if i am not confused , this is getting buddhist .  . 

that this world is a school of sorts , where we learn 
and grow , and our souls  . 

that is one hell of a statement , although perhaps true. 

do you mean to imply that it was intended to be so if so , 
please show that this is true. if not , please explain how this 
can give a purpose to anything. 

that gives a purpose to my little purposes , 

how does it do that 

would n't the world school w intent idea make the world a for 
some greater purpose , rather than a purpose in itself. 

and takes some of the pressure off. 

what pressure 

it 's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms 
if you 're really just here to learn .  . 

it is not necessary to be a success in human terms , unless your 
goals either include doing so or require doing so before they 
themselves can be  . 

indeed , many people have set goals for themselves that 
do not include success in human terms as i understand it. check 
out buddhist type guy. out for , which is not 
at all the same thing. 

it 's more important to progress , 
grow , , to learn to love yourself and others and to express your 
love , especially when it 's to do so. honest effort is rewarded 
by god , he knows our  . 

why is learning to love a goal what happens if you fail in this 
goal to you to god to the purpose 


question about and my answer deleted because it was 
mostly quote. 

two serious questions to discussion 
1. what is the nature of eternal life 
2. how can we as mortals locked into space time conceive of it 

possible answer for 2 the best we can do is metaphor analogy 
question 2a what is the best metaphor 

i 'll have a crack at that. 

(1) the nature of eternal life is described by its name it is 
the concept of life without death , life without end. 

(2) no. we can put together word to describe it , but we cannot imagine it. 

 ( 2a ) no metaphor is adequate next to eternity if it were we could not 
understand it either.  ( or so i suspect )

the objection naturally is in the way in which you phrase it. 
easter  ( or or or or other spellings ) is the

the objection to of the when 
that way i suspect  ( or at least i would hope ) that it becomes 
apparent what my objection to her would be. 

it is of the resurrection of jesus .  . 

no , you are thinking perhaps of sunday i think. 
 ( though i'm not too crazy about the word sunday , but i certainly like 
this phrasing much better than the name of the ) . 
for that matter , stay biblical and call it  ( the of 
first  . torah commands that this be observed on the day following 
the sabbath of week.  ( sunday by any other name in modern 
) . why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection 
on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured why jump it all 
over the the way easter does why not just go with the sunday 
following the way the bible has it why seek after 
methods 

i do n't recall a command in scripture for us to celebrate 
the resurrection , but it is the sole and only reason that 
we are christians how could we not celebrate it 

so what does this question have to do with easter  ( the 
goddess ) i am all for the resurrection .  . just keep that 
out of the discussion. 

if it is only the name which is a problem , i suggest that if 
we are too concerned about , there are a lot of 
words we are going to have to drop .  .  ( as an aside , some 
terminally pc people here in ottawa want dictionaries to be 
altered so that there are no negative definitions associated 
with the word black , so as not to offend people of  . 

yes , i have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to 
streets with . (i still think sounds 
better though . ) . 

as a short person , i hope they will also remove the definition 
or associated with my physical description . ) . 

fine by me. and while we are at it , the left handed people are 
both and so we probably will have some objections from 
that as well. 

in quebec french , the word for the of the 
resurrection is pa this is related 
to  ( passover ) and the pascal lamb .  . so is the 
french canadian  ( mostly roman catholic ) better 
because it uses the right name 

yes , that sounds much better to me. is there anyone out there would 
thinks that phrasing sounds worse 

so from this i infer that there are different rules for 
christians of jewish descent what happened to there is 
neither jew nor greek , slave nor free , male nor female , for 
all are one in christ jesus 

read the letter to  . now tell me , was 's slave 
returned to him were there different rules upon the slave than upon 
how about male and female are there different rules that 
apply to them as well or if there is no more male and female can adam 
and steve get married to each other in your yes , there are 
differences in form and function. but the way we come to salvation in 
messiah remains the same no matter what our position in life. 



i am in general not in favor of continuing this discussion , as it 
seems , but this particular point is one that i believe is 
new the objection is not to having a holiday but to its name. 

i 'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this 
argument. words often change their meaning over time. the days of 
the week are of course originally based on gods .  . some 
christians prefer to refer to first day , second day , etc. however 
the majority of christians have not been persuaded .  . the question 
seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows 
as the of a word , if what people mean by it and think when 
they use it is different. 

indeed i 'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be 
dangerous. suppose people in general use easter to mean the 
of christ 's resurrection .  . postings trying to convince 
them that they really mean a in honor of some run 
the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose .  . 
they are doing their best to create a in people 's minds 
between their and the  . it 's not clear that 
this is a healthy thing.

address this and look at what people from to christianity .  . like 
it or not , religions are addressing needs that christianity should be , 
and is n't .  . 
i believe that has hit upon some major truths that christianity has 
forgotten. this does n't mean that is right , but it does mean that we 
have something to learn from the movement .  . 
first , respects the  . christianity has a long history of 
oppressing women , and many  ( if not most ) male christians are still unable to 
live in a non sexist manner. the idea that god is , or that christ 
could have been a women and still accomplished his mission , is met with a great 
deal of resistance .  . this on a male dominated theology  ( and the 
male dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have 
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches. 
second , respects the physical world. this is an idea with great 
ramifications .  . one of these is respect for our surroundings 
and our world. another is of sexuality .  . christianity has a long 
tradition of calling all sexual sinful and urging people to suppress 
and deny their sexuality .  . this is too much sex is clearly a part of human 
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a option. 
christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual , and 
is an attractive option. 
i'm not advocating that christian doctrines  ( no sex before marriage , etc . ) . 
should be changed just that christians work a more moderate of 
sexuality .  . denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as 
sexuality , and neither one does much to bring us closer to god.

and the two simplest refutations are these 

(1) what impact the only record of impact comes from the new testament .  . 
i have no that its books are in the least accurate , and that 
the recorded impact actually happened. i find it interesting that no other 
contemporary source records an , an earthquake , a temple 
being , etc. the earliest written claim we have of jesus  resurrection 
is from the epistles , none of which were written sooner than 20 years 
after the supposed event. 

first , off i 'd say that the impact if right before your eyes ! 8 ) that we are 
even discussing this is a major impact in and of itself. further , the early 
church bears testimony to the impact .  . 

(2) it seems probable that no one the body of jesus because no 
one knew where it was. i personally believe that the most likely 
explanation was that the body was stolen  ( by disciples , or by  . 
do n't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one 
gospel , and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make 
up in order to counter the grave charge .  . the new testament does 
record that jews believed the body had been stolen .  . if there were really 
guards , they could not have effectively made this claim , as they did. 

of course they knew where it was. do n't forget that jesus was seen by both 
the jews and the romans as a troublemaker .  . was no fool and did n't 
need the additional of some jesus  body to 
make it appear he had  . since jesus was buried in the grave of a 
man well know to the , to say that they did n't know where he was 
buried begs the question. 

now , you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. but think on 
this a moment .  . would you die to maintain something you knew to be a 
deliberate lie ! if not , then why do you think the disciples would ! now , i'm 
not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth , 
but to you , it is a lie. many have done this. no , i'm talking about 
dying , by , stoning , crucifixion , etc. , for something you know to 
be a lie ! thus , you position with regards to the disciples the 
body seems rather lightweight to me. 

as for , why risk the severe penalties for grave over 
the body of jesus he was n't buried with great  . so , again , this is 
an argument that can be discounted .  . 

that leaves you back on square one. what happened to the body !

one interpretation i 've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin

this verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what 
is god 's will for his family without his wife .  . god reveals 
his will to both the husband and the wife .  . there needs to be some 
degree of in decision making. even those whose understanding 
of the bible leads to a belief in an of the

about the impact technology has on life , quality of life and the rights 
that they consider important. depending on how you work out your

never had much time for the pope or any other but i did , and 
do , believe in the system. i always felt quite happy to 
look down my nose at those such as john a few posts back who 
had to engage in textual arguments to prove their faith , entirely 
to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same with 
miracles too , and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the 
bible as god 's sole revelation , it was not very good logic to argue 
that the bible proved god. no , i was happy to accept the church as god 's 
revelation .  . it was the church after all that existed before the bible , the 
church that choose under of course the of scripture .  . protestant

of luther 's right to reject a dozen or so books he  . 
but recently i read peter brown 's body and society . it is very 
well researched , and well written. but is raises some very upsetting 
questions. the early christians were even more so than today 's 
fundies .  . they had odd views on sex , views on the body , 
totally ludicrous views about demons , and 
views about other human beings .  . 
now the question is this were the first christians just as 
, but we 've got used to them , or did the fall of the 
church happen within one generation .  . it certainly did nt have to 
wait until the of the church under  . if so , 
does this say about god 's promise to always support the church. 
it 's no use throwing the usual protestant about the church 
not being an organization at me. it 's a community or it is nothing , 
and it was the early communities that were  . the 
church was a model of by comparison .  . 
i would be interested in serious catholic and orthodox responses to 
this entirely serious issue. i'm not sure it is an issue for protestants 
with their soul alone with jesus approach , but for we who see the 
as a over time and space , the early 
christians are a problem. 

this is an exaggeration of the protestant view. many protestants 
have a strong for the role of the church. the soul 
alone with god is certainly important for protestants , but it 's by no 
means the whole story. 

i have read the sort of history you talk about. as you point out , 
protestants do n't have quite the same problem you do , because we 
believe that the church had a fall at some point. however protestant 
mythology typically places the fall around the time of  ( or 
more likely , regard it as happening in a sort of fashion , 
starting from but getting worse as the pope 
power during the medieval period . ) . the consequences of having it 
earlier are somewhat even to us. most protestants accept 
the theological results of the early , including 
such items as the trinity and  . indeed in the works of 
such as luther and , you 'll find church fathers such 
as quoted all the time. i think you 'll find many 
protestants to the idea that the early church as a whole was 
.  ( there is an additional problem for protestants that i do n't 
much want to talk about in this context , since it 's been looked at 
recently that 's the question of whether one can really think of 
and other fathers as being protestants .  . their views 
on mary , the authority of the pope , etc , are not entirely congenial to 
protestant thought . ) . 

one thing that somewhat me is a question of  . 
there are certainly plenty of people in the early church. what 
concerns me is that they may be in what we see. we 
see every christian who  . but i think there 's good 
reason to believe that most ordinary christians were more than 
that. we see the  . but i think there 's good reason to

anything that does not bring me closer to god is a sin .  . 
 ( if you think this is too strict , just consider how ambiguous it is . ) . 

this implies that staying the same is a sin .  . a christian should 
never be satisfied .  . it does not imply that 
having fun is a sin .  . it does not imply that sleeping is a sin .  . 
it does imply that i sin every day. 

a perhaps simpler definition 
anything that is counter to the two great commandments 
love god , love your neighbor , is a sin .  . 
anything i do that is not from love is a sin .  .

this is condescending at best and a slightly ad hominem

vocal ones , is one reason for the hostility you sense. how do you 
like it when atheists say that people turn to religion out of 
emotionalism 

i agree if you are going to find out anything from people who do n't 
share your beliefs , do not attack them or to them and hope 
to get a neutral picture of them. come to them with an open mind. 

i do n't believe that atheists are generally any more broken 
than anybody else. any cause and effect is likely to be the 
other way. there is an emotional price to pay for being different , 
hearing one 's beliefs  ( or lack thereof ) condemned , and one 's 
motives and character attacked .  . 

well , you do believe in something , as i see it , even if it is a sort 
of anti belief  ( no negative connotation meant i mean simply that 
you believe that god does not  . christians can also feel that 
sense of difference , however , when they are associated with those 
televangelists who always talk about satan . if you 'll excuse 
the sound of this , everyone has to deal with his her 
differences from other people. i can understand how being an atheist 
could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for me. 

i became an atheist when i got old enough to reason because there 
was just no good reason to believe the religion i had been taught .  . 
this was very painful because of the pressure i was placed under by 
my family and friends. i wanted to fit in , believe , and be accepted. 
i tried , but finally the was just too great .  . 

you should not have to how you feel you should be able to 
discuss it without fear. i think there are things to learn 
from any belief , which can your own by asking myself the 
questions that atheists may ask me , i can learn the answers and become 
stronger in my faith. if my faith ca n't support knowing the answers 
to those questions , it is weak and untrue .  . 

i have sympathy for gays growing up in and 
having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves 
because i 've been there. only in my case it was my rationality instead 
of sexuality which i was forced to try to  . 

in some way the were different , of course , because you 
chose your beliefs or are you saying that they were not your 
choice , but born of necessity please , no flames about whether or 
not gay people choose their lifestyle that 's elsewhere in this 
newsgroup 

i must say that i 
was n't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends 
who did n't become atheists .  . i was just hurt differently. 

i'm not sure i understand this sentence could you explain 

points out that many most atheists are n't hostile , they 
just cease in religion 

true. consider also that people like robertson and many of the 
christian extremists in soc . religion . christianity . naturally 
hostility by their attacks on anyone who disagrees and their attempts 
to force their views on others. you are known by the company you keep .  . 
christians trying to preach in alt.atheism should not be surprised by 
hostility .  . 

, yes. part of being a christian is accepting everyone with an 
open heart including people of our own camp with whom we 
completely disagree. by the same , i believe that accusation and 
suspicion are not the best way to reach out to those not of our faith , 
nor is it effective to try to people into accepting our 
religion. i have a different idea of mission be what i am , a 
christian who is happy in her faith , and if others see that and want 
to know about either the happiness or the religion , i 'll share what i 
know without pressure and let them make their own decisions. at some 
point you just have to agree to disagree acceptance of diversity , 
not , is the way to peace .  .  .  .  .

your is correct. the conception refers to 
the conception of mary in her mother 's womb .  . 

okay , now that we 've defined the conception doctrine would it 
be possible for those more knowledgeable in the area to give the biblically 
or other support for it. i 've attempted to come to terms with it previously 
 ( in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes ) and have n't been able 
to grasp the reasoning .  . 

it was a gift from god. i think basically the reasoning was that the 
tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus .  . 
as the of faith developed , particularly with , sin was 
more and more equated with sex , and thus mary was assumed to be a virgin 
for life  ( since she never sinned , and since she was the spouse of god , etc . ) . 
since we also had this notion of original sin , ie .  . that man is born with 
a predisposition to sin , and since mary did not have this predisposition 
because she did not ever sin , she did n't have original sin .  . when science 
discovered the process of conception , the next step was to assume that 
mary was conceived without original sin , the conception .  . 

mary at that time appeared to a girl named at  . she 
refered to herself as the conception .  . since a year old 
would have no way of knowing about the doctrine , the was deemed 
to be true and it the case for the doctrine .  . 

hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources , that 
being sacred scripture and holy tradition .  . in this case , mostly tradition .  .

which brings me around to asking an open question. is the bible a closed 
book of scripture is it okay for us to go around saying god told

out new revelation to us i know that some people will feel 
that is okay , and some will not. the concept of a closed would 
certainly cast a on contemporary prophets .  . on the other hand , 
an open seems to be indicated sometimes. 


let 's get back to basics .  .  ( from the latin ) means a rule. if 
we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken. 
there is an issue also of measurement against a rule. thus the words 
that are spoken need to be compared against the rule but not 
added to the  . 

is new revelation necessary , current , personal revelation 
i 'd say is necessary. new revelation for all people for all times 
is not necessary as we have that in scripture .  . 

you also seem to confuse with scripture .  . scripture may speak of 
itself being open ie god speaking today. it would speak that it is 
closed in the sense that the is  .  ( though the concept 
of is later historically . ) . 

also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new 
but rather an inspired translation of scripture .  . is it right to call 
that prophecy would n't that be more having to do with 
knowledge i know , the gift of knowledge may not be as to 
talk about , but should n't we call a horse a horse 


i agree with the problem of confusion. if prophecy is meant to encourage , 
or correct then is an with scripture .  . if prophecy is 
meant to bring a  of the form the man you live with is not your

i would expect the difference to be the motive and means for  . 
the reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

my family has never been particularly religious singing christmas 
carols is about the limit for them. thus i 've never really believed in god and 
heaven , although i do n't actually believe that they do n't exist either 
i'm sort of undecided , probably like a lot of people i guess. 
lately i 've been thinking about it all a lot more , and i wondered how 
religious people can be so convinced that there is a god. i feel as though 
i want to believe , but i'm not used to believing things without proof 
just as i ca n't believe that there definitely is n't a god , so i ca n't 
definitely believe that there is. i wondered if most of you were brought up by 
religious families and never believed any different. can anyone help me to 
understand how your belief and faith in god can be so strong .  . 

another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is 
correct how do you choose a religion , and how do you know that the christian 
god exists and the gods of other religions do n't how do you feel about 
people who follow other religions how about atheists and people like me 
agnostics i suppose. do you respect their religion , and accept their 
beliefs as just as valid as your own is n't there contradiction between 
the religions how can your religion be more valid than any others do 
you have less respect for someone if they 're not religious , or if they follow 
a different religion than you would if they were christian 

also , how much of the scriptures are correct are all events in 
the bible really supposed to have happened , or are they just supposed to be 
stories with morals showing a true christian how to behave 

i generally follow most of the christian ideas , which i suppose are 
fairly universal throughout all religions not killing , , etc , and 
 loving my  for want of a better  . the only part i find 
hard is the actual belief in god. 

finally , what is god 's attitude to people like me , who do n't quite 
believe in him , but are generally fairly  good  people. surely not 
believing does n't make me a worse person if not , i find myself wondering why 
i so strongly want to really believe , and to find a religion. 

sorry if i on a bit i was just writing ideas as they came

regarding jesus only believers , our writes 

there may be some misunderstanding over terms here .  .  .  . 

i agree. quite likely , actually. 

 .  .  . i . believe jesus 
only originally was in the context of baptism .  . these are folks who 
believe that baptism should be done with a mentioning only 
jesus , rather than father , son , and holy spirit .  . this may have 
doctrinal implications , but as far as i know it does not mean that 
these folks deny the existence or divinity of the father .  . i'm not the 
right one to describe this theology , and in fact i think there may be 
several , including what would be called or 
 ( two rather different views ) , as well as some who have beliefs 
that are probably consistent with standards , but who wo n't 
use language because they misunderstand it or simply 
because it is not biblical .  . 

not biblical what then can they make of the end of matthew 

 ( 28 18)and ) jesus came and said to them , all authority in heaven and on 
earth has been given to me.  ( 19)go ) therefore and make disciples of all 
nations , them in the name of the father and of the son and 
of the holy spirit ,  ( 20 ) and teaching them to obey everything that i 
have commanded to you. and remember , i am with you always , to the end 
of the age. other ancient authorities add amen 

the notes give no sense that this is  . do other texts 
contradict this regarding baptism or is a misunderstanding of the 
trinity the most likely explanation after all 

but maybe i simply misunderstand their views.  ( is anyone else out there 
forced to read this group with both a good bible and an 
dictionary christianity really is an education in itself . ) . 



david r. 


 . when i talked about people who rejected 
language as , i was speaking of theology , things 
like one and three persons . obviously the three 
is biblical , as you point out. (i normally use the 
term three in referring to  . while it is certainly 
consistent with belief in the trinity , the trinity is a doctrine whose 
full occurred in the 4th and 's .  . it 's unlikely 
that  . had in mind the fully developed doctrine .  . 
indeed the three is used by some groups that do 
not believe in the trinity . ) . the disagreement over 
occurs because of passages such as acts 2 38 , which command baptism in 
the name of jesus .  .  ( there are a couple of other passages in acts as 
well . ) . this leaves us with sort of a problem we 're commanded in  . 
to in the name of the father , the son , and the holy spirit , 
and in acts to in the name of jesus .  . 

jesus only groups in the name of jesus .  . they consider this 
consistent with 28 18 , because they say that jesus is the name of 
the father , the son , and the holy spirit .  . i'm not the right one to 
ask to explain what this means. i will simply say that it does not 
appear to be normal theology .  .  ( it is also an odd way of 
dealing with the phrase in the name of  . ) . 

those who use the three do n't seem to have a standard 
answer to the passages talking about in the name of jesus .  . 
i suspect that the most common explanation is to say that in the name 
of need not be a verbal  . to say that you in the name 
of jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under jesus  
authority .  . in the 1st  . context , it christian baptism 
with the baptism of john or other jewish baptism .  . of course there 's a 
certain parallelism between these passages .  . that suggests that we 
could just as well say that 28 18 does n't require the specific 
three to be used in baptism , but simply 
baptism done by those who follow the father , son , and holy spirit .  . 

one might well suspect that in the early church , more than one 
was used. so long as we consider following jesus to 
be the same as following the father , son , and holy spirit , no great 
damage would be done by such a difference. this does not mean that 
i think we should go back to using both  . baptism is one of 
the few things that almost all christian groups now recognize 
mutually , so i do not think doing something to upset that would be in 
the interests of the gospel .  . this is by the fact that 
those groups that actually use in the name of jesus now do seem to 
have in mind a difference in doctrine .  . but as i 've said before , i'm 
not the one to explain what their doctrine is.

to what follows , our has already answered the charge of 
arrogance more that i could have done so , so i will 
myself to answering the charge of  . 

in a previous article ,  ( geno ) says 

if i do n't think my belief is right and everyone else 's belief is wrong , 
then i do n't have a belief .  . this is simply what belief means. 

, this seems to be how christians are taught to think when 
it comes to their religion. 

this is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is , or was , 
taught to think. it is the fundamental premis a is not not a . if a thing 
is true then its converse is false .  . without this basic 
theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. we 
should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word believe , 
however. the weak sense means i am not sure. i believe tom went to 
the library.  ( but he could have gone to the  . the strong sense 
means i am so certain that i use it as a basis of thought. i believe 
that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws .  .  ( despite 
the fact that nature appears and  . christian 
belief is of the strong kind.  ( though christians may well hold beliefs 
of the weak kind on any number of theological and 
) . 

some take it to the extreme and say that 
their religion is the only one and if you do n't accept their teachings 
then you wo n't be saved . 

note that these are two separate ideas. most hold the first view , but the 
majority do not hold the second .  . is is again a matter of pure logic that 
if is true , then  ( for example) must be 
false , as it contradicts or is incompatible with ,  . 
 ( and , as a matter of logic , vice ) . 

it takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim 
to know what god thinks wants. 

it is arrogant to claim to know what anyone thinks or wants , unless 
they have told you. christians believe god has told us what he thinks 
and wants. 

especially when it 's based upon your 
interpretation of a book. 

most christians do not base their belief on the bible , but on the living 
tradition of the church established by christ and constantly 
by the holy spirit .  . the bible is simply the written core of that tradition .  . 

the logic in the above statement is faulty 
in that it assumes two people with beliefs ca n't both be 
correct. 

if depends what you mean by  . if i believe tom is feet 
and you believe he 200 pounds , our beliefs differ , but we 
may both be right. if i believe tom is feet and you beleive 
that he is four foot , one of us , at least , must be wrong. 

it 's all about perception .  . no two people are exactly alike. 
no two people perceive everything in the same way. i believe that 
there is one truth. call it god 's truth , a universal truth , or call it 
what you will. i do n't believe god presents this truth. i think it is 
just there and it 's up to you to look for and see it , through prayer , 
, , dreams or whatever. just because people may 
perceive this truth differently , it does n't mean one is wrong and the 
other is right. 

thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being 
can find it. you assert that anyone who believe that we can find 
absolute truth is mistaken .  . in short , you believe that anyone who 
does not share your belief on this point is wrong.  . 

as an example , take the question , is the glass half 
empty or half full you can have two different answers which are 
contradictory and yet both are correct. so , for your belief to be 
true , does not require everyone else 's belief to be wrong. 

here i begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the 
of truth , but simply with language. saying that the glass 
is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half 
full it is the same fact expressed in different words.  ( the whole 
point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the 
and the express the same fact . ) . 

it is , of course , quite true that different people may express the 
same belief in different words. it is also true that they may fail 
to understand each other 's words as expressions of the same belief 
and may argue bitterly and believe that they are apart. great 
have occurred in just this way , and much work has 
been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal 
agreement in belief .  . this does not mean , in any sense , that all beliefs 
are equally valid .  . since some of the beliefs people hold contradict 
some other beliefs that other people hold , after all 
of language and culture in the of those beliefs have 
been away , some of the beliefs that some people hold must , 
be false , and it is neither arrogant nor illogical 
to say so. if i believe x and you believe y we may both be correct , 
but if y is equivalent to not x then one of us is wrong and as long 
as we hold our respective beliefs , we must each regard the other 
as in error.

are all truths also absolutes 
is all of scripture truths  ( and therefore absolutes ) 

the answer to both questions is yes. 

perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then. to me , 
an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , 
situations , etc. true in every instance possible. do you agree 
with this definition i think you do 

similarly , all truth is absolute .  . indeed , a non absolute truth is a 
contradiction in terms. when is something absolute when it is always 
true. obviously , if a truth is not always true then we have a 
contradiction in terms. 

i agree with here. determining absolutes is , practically speaking , a 
waste of time. and we easily forget that relative truth is , in fact relative .  . 

for example , i recently was asking some children the question what 
does water at i got the answer 212 degrees  . i asked 
if they knew what scale , and was told it 's just 212 degrees .  . any scale. 
that 's what all say. well , that 's sincere , and may be 
true in the experience of the speaker , but it is simply wrong. it is not 
an absolute truth. similarly , scripture is full of truth , which we should 
and , but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth 
and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time 
and culture in which the text was is missing the point. then religion 
easily becomes an intellectual head trip , of the living experience of 
the trinity and becomes dead , imo. 

example of head covering in church deleted 

this was a good example. there may be an absolute truth behind the 
writing , but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the 
instructions apply to the , and not necessarily elsewhere. 
the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first 
century culture and the particular at , which was having 
a lot of trouble with order. is it absolute truth to me no. and i 
see no compelling , or even reasonable , reason that it should be. 

are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth.  ( and there are plenty of other examples . ) . 
can you reconcile this 

even the most die hard do not take all of the bible literally .  . 
i 've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse is he who takes your 
babies and their heads against the literally .  . the bible 
was not printed or handed to us by god with color to tell us 
what parts should be interpreted which way. 

many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world. such a 
statement is terribly self contradictory .  . let me put it to you this 
way. if there are no absolutes , should n't we conclude that the statement , 
there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously , we have a 
contradiction here. 

i do n't claim that there are no absolutes .  . i think there are very 
few , though , and determining absolutes is difficult. 

i agree. very few. and even if we knew them , personally , we may not be 
able to express that in a way that still absolute truth to another. 
the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference , since i 
know i can never fully an absolute if it walks up and me. 

there is hardly consensus , even in evangelical 
christianity  ( not to mention the rest of christianity ) regarding 
biblical interpretation .  . 

so people sometimes disagree about what is true. this does not 
the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe. 

i ca n't prove the existence of absolutes .  . i can only rely upon my experience. 
i also trust god 's revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite .  . 
therefore we ca n't comprehend the absolutes .  . so i do n't need them. 
i can never know the essence of god , only the by and through which 
god is to god 's creation. so the reality can be that there are 
absolutes , but it is of no practical importance .  . it 's like claiming that the 
original scriptural autographs were perfect , but copies may not be.  . 
who cares it does n't affect me in any practical useful way. i might as 
well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue , and that they 
live on  . maybe god did. so what is that going to have any effect on 
how i deal with my neighbor , or god whether or not i go to this or that 
for lunch no. 

this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians 
are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning .  . christianity is true , 
wonderful and sensible .  . it appeals to reason , since reason is an inner 
reflection of the of god. explanations that violate that simply 
appear to be responses to a complex world. 

note i'm not claiming there is no place for authority .  . that 'd be silly. 
there is a world of difference between authoritative and  . 
authoritative is en of authority that respects others. 
is en of authority that fails to do that , 
and is generally agressive .  . good parents  ( like god) are authoritative .  . 
many christians are simply , and , not surprisingly , few 
adults respond to this treatment .  .

last days and ours would be the last generation to see the 
anyway 

i heard the same thing , but without that he actually said it. 
it was just as to us as to you the bible says that nobody knows 
when the second coming will take place. 

nor does it say that if you do find out when it will happen you 
should rape everything in sight just before.

dean quoted a letter from james m , president of 
bible institute 

the other day , i was at the and the radio was playing .  . 
it caught my attention because a talk show was criticizing 
evangelical christians , saying we believe in absolutes and think we 
are the only ones who know what the absolutes are. 

we affirm the absolutes of scripture , not because we are arrogant 
moralists , but because we believe in god who is truth , who has revealed 
his truth in his word , and therefore we hold as precious the strategic 
importance of those absolutes .  . 

there has been a lot of discussion , but so far nobody seems to have hit on 
exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at. 

the arrogance being attacked is that we think we are the only ones who know 
what the absolutes are . in short , many claim that they are 
infallible on the matter of religious texts .  . 

in particular , the problem is one of epistemology .  . as a , you can 
think of epistemology as how do you know that question , it turns out , is 
a very one. 

the problem with certainty  is that , at the bottom , at least some of 
the thinking goes on inside your own head. unless you can be certain that 
everything which happens in your head is infallible , the reasoning you did to 
discover a source of truth is in question. 

and that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of 
authority which means you do not have absolute certainty .  . 


let 's take the specific example of biblical , and a fictional 
named  .  ( the following arguments applies to the idea of 
papal , too . ) . 

has , we presume , spent some time studying the bible , and history , and 
several other topics. he has concluded , based on all these studies  ( and 
possibly some religious experiences ) that the bible is a source of absolute 
truth. 

he may be correct but even if he is , he cannot be certain that he is correct. 
his conclusion depends on how well he studied history he may have made 
mistakes , and the references he used may have contained mistakes .  . his 
conclusion depends on how well he studied the bible he may have made 
mistakes .  . his conclusion depends on his own reasoning and he may have made 
mistakes .  .  ( noticing a common thread yet 8 ) 

everything about his study of the world that he did everything that 
happened in his own head is limited by his own thinking. no matter what 
he does to try and cover his mistakes , he can never be certain of his own 
 . as long as any part of the belief is based on his own 
reasoning , that belief cannot be considered absolutely certain . 

believes that he has found a source of absolute truth but that belief 
is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it. unless he can 
say that his own reasoning is , his conclusions are in doubt. 

any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on 
your own thinking there is no way out of the loop. only an infallible 
thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs .  . 


this is easy to demonstrate .  . let 's go back to our method of doing 
epistemology how do you know imagine a hypothetical discussion 

a the bible is a source of absolute truth. 

b how do you know 

a i studied history and the bible and religious writings and church 
teachings and came to this conclusion .  . 

b how do you know you studied history correctly 

a well , i double checked everything. 

b how do you know you double checked correctly 

a well , i compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed. 

b just because some smart guy believes something that does n't mean it is 
true. how do you know they studied it correctly 

a ... 

and , as you see , b will eventually get a to the point where he has to say i 
ca n't prove that there are no mistakes and as long as you may have made a 
mistake , then you cannot be absolutely certain .  . 

there is no way out of the loop. 


this is where the arrogance of christians many people believe 
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the 
doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are 
infallible , and that there is no possibility of mistake. 

claiming that you cannot have made a mistake , and that your thinking has led 
you to a conclusion , is pretty arrogant .  . 



people who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to 
find the of the church , by george  . he is attacking 
the idea that the pope can be infallible  ( and he does so very well ) , 
but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible is 
inerrant .  .

at the core of all well founded belief , lies belief that is unfounded .  .

jesus was born a jew .  . we have biblical accounts of 
both his mother 's ancestry and his father 's , both back 
to david .  . it seems reasonable to assume , therefore , that jesus 
was semitic .  . 
as an interesting aside , jesus  being semitic makes him 
neither white nor black , and in some sense the 
point made earlier that his color was not important , it was his 
message , his , and his divinity that we should concentrate 
on. 
finally , i would direct anyone interested in african 
involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of

the argument towards people who do not believe that christ rose 
from the dead , but in your proof , you use the bible exclusively .  . 

the post is therefore immediately useless to anyone who does n't

why do we follow god so blindly have you ever asked a 
physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog 
the answer is quite simple the dog can see , and the blind person 
cannot .  . 
... 
of course , you may ask , if i cannot trust my own senses , 
how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or 
a lie. that is why we need faith to be saved .  . we must force 
ourselves to believe that god knows the truth , and loves us 
enough to share it with us , even when it what we think 
we know. why would he have created us if he did not love us 
enough to help us through this world 


seems to me if you learned to between illusion and 
reality on your own you would n't need to rely on doctrines that 
need to be updated .  . my experience of christianity  ( 25 years ) is 
that most christians seek answers from who have little 
or no direct experience of spiritual matters , and that most of 
these questions can be answered by simple introspection .  . most 
people suspect that they cannot trust their senses , but few take 
the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves. not to 
get too esoteric , but it seems that most religions , christianity 
included , are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand 
this. 

 ( stuff deleted ) 

as for you , no one can convert you. you must 
choose to follow god of your own will , if you are ever to 
follow him. all we as christians wish to do is share with 
you the love we have received from god. if you reject that , 
we have to accept your decision , although we always keep 
the offer open to you. if you really want to find out 
why we believe what we believe , i can only suggest you try 
praying for faith , reading the bible , and asking christians 
about their experiences personally .  .  .  .  . 

and what if the original poster , pixie , is never converted 
does it make sense that she  ( or i , or the majority of humanity 
for that matter ) would go to hell for eternity , as many 
christians believe it makes more sense to me that rather 
than be converted to a centuries old doctrine that holds no 
life for her , that she simply continue to decide for herself 
what is best. 



you may be right about christians relying on clergy , but i have some 
reason to hope you 're not. protestants conversion , 
experience of the holy spirit , and use of the bible .  . this is intended 
to make sure that christians have religious experience of their own , 
and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and 
other christians .  . i ca n't speak for catholics and orthodox , but i 
believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat 
what they are told .  . i admit that this is n't always successful we 
certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents 
expect it. but most of our members do seem quite able and willing to 
make judgements for themselves , and have a commitment that comes out 
of their own experience. unfortunately , it 's the nature of usenet 
that doctrinal get emphasized , so it looks like we spend 
most of our time dealing with doctrine .  . that 's certainly not my 
experience of the way christians really live.

our duty to our 

do good to all men  ( gal 6 10 ) 
love our as ourselves  ( matt 22 39 ) 

act the part of the good  ( luke 10 ) any who may be in 
trouble .  . we will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured 
man , and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes 
people harm  ( even medical corps of the army  . 

christians are by faith citizens of the commonwealth of israel 
 ( ephesians 2 11 12 ) , and also recognise that god rules in the of 
men , and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the 
of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith. 

we are to be strangers and amongst the nations , so we are just 
passing through , and not part of any nation or any national aspirations 
 ( this can also be applied to politics etc , but that 's another  . we 
are not supposed to or resist evil  ( even suffer yourselves to 
be ) it is therefore for us to to assist in 
a state which christ will destroy when he returns to set up 
god 's kingdom .  . 

our duty to the state. 

render therefore unto the things which be 's and unto god 
the things which be god 's  ( luke 20  . 
let every soul be subject unto the higher powers .  . for there is no power 
but of god the powers that be are of god. 
the power , the of god  ( rom 13 1  . 
submit yourselves to every of man for the lord 's sake whether 
it be to king as supreme .  .  .  . for so is the will of god that with well doing 
may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men  ( 1 pet 2 13 15 ) 

these scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a 
divine command , but it is equally clear from acts 5 19 29 that when any 
of man runs counter to god 's law , we must refuse submission to 
it. the reason for this is that we are god 's bond and his 
service is our life 's task .  . an example of the type of thing is in 
3 22 23 where were to work as unto the lord so 
also we should work as if our boss was god i.e. pressed down , 
together , and running over ... oops a bit of a side track there .  .  .  . 

in the between the nations , we are on god 's side a side that is 
not fighting in the battle , but is to the truth. 

when we believe in god and embrace his promises , we become fellow 
citizens with the and of the of god , and are no longer 
interested in of the world. think of this in relation to 
etc as well. paul tells us to aside every weight that we may 
run the race that is set before us , and if we are wise , we will discard 
any association which would our progress thou therefore 
as a good of jesus christ .  . no man that

chosen him to be a  ( 2 tim 2 3  . 

one of these he about is be not 
together with unbelievers . one of the obvious applications of this is 
marriage with unbelievers , but it also covers things like business 
partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association 
with any person or persons not believing the truth about god  ( in this case 
the  . the principle comes from 22 10 remember that as well as 
them being different animals of different , one was clean and one 
under the law. these ideas are strongly stressed in 2 6 13 18 
i suggest you read this. the also has another aspect that of 
, and jesus says take my yoke upon you , so we are then 
with christ and cannot be with unbelievers .  . we have already seen 
that we are of christ , and paul says become not the

3. he firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted 
on hearing the prophet of the lord  ( trying to do the right thing ) , he 
found that he was and therefore could n't break away from the evil 
association he had made. 

god says to us come out from among them and be separate , and touch not 
the thing , and i will receive you and shall be my sons and 
daughters  ( 2 6  . 

this is more or less what i have found out so far i'm still looking into 
it , as i do n't think i 've answered all the questions raised by 
yet. a summary and a few things to think about 

the christian in under command. obedience to this command is an essential 
factor in his relationship with christ  ( john 15 10 ,  . 

total to this course of action is required  ( romans 12 1  . 

the close relationship between christ and his 
followers  ( 1 pet 2 7  . 

we are to be separated to god  ( rom 6  . this involves a master servant 
relationship  ( rom 6 12 ,  . 

no man can serve two masters  ( matt 6 24 , 13 ,  . 

all that is in the   is lust and pride quite opposed to  ( 1 
john 2  . kingdom is not of this world (i . e .  . not worldly in 
nature ) if it was , his would fight to deliver him. if christ is 
our master and he was not by his because his kingdom 
was not of this world , then his cannot possibly fight for another 
master .  . 

strangers and have no rights , and we cannot swear allegiance to 
anyone but god. 

the servant of the lord must not war but be gentle to all  ( 2 tim 2 24 ) 
this does not just apply to war , but also to avoiding strife throughout 
our lives. there is a war to be , not with man 's weapons  ( 2 
10 3 4 ) , but with god 's  ( eph6 13  .

never be accomplished through the disbelief of man. jesus came to

the was the will of god how could jesus pray that this

women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes .  . 
is jesus less than these. no he is not. he knew the 
was not the will of god. god 's will was that the jewish people accept 
jesus as the messiah and that the kingdom of heaven be established on 
the earth with jesus as it 's head.  ( just like the jewish people 
 . if this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what 
kind of world we would live in today. it would be a very different 
world. and that is eactly what god wanted .  . men and women of that age 
could have been saved by following the living messiah while he was on 
the earth. jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would 
have continued his reign after his to the spiritual world to 
live with god. now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to 
wait for christ 's return. but when he returns will he be recognized 
and will he find faith on this earth. is n't it about time for his 
return. it 's been almost 2000 years.

(2) nobody ever the dead body of jesus , even though both the

the recorded impact actually happened. i find it interesting that no other 
contemporary source records an , an earthquake , a temple 
being , etc. the earliest written claim we have of jesus  resurrection 
is from the epistles , none of which were written sooner than 20 years 
after the supposed event. 

(2) it seems probable that no one the body of jesus because no 
one knew where it was. i personally believe that the most likely 
explanation was that the body was stolen  ( by disciples , or by  . 
do n't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one 
gospel , and seems like exactly the sort of thing early christians might make

the story i related is one of the seven 
approved by our church as worthy of belief .  . it happened 
in la , france .  . 

the moral lesson of the story is 

the lamb of god has been sacrificed and his blood has 
been used to us of our sins every moment as god 
worthy of being done in heaven. mary weeps for the lamb and 
for the rest of her  . this will continue while we 
disobey god or sin against him. mary , as a messenger , 
has been given the task to make us be  aware  of the evil 
 ( communism , wars , , , 
to god , etc . ) . running after the rest of her  . 
the children who went astray by led by the is 
brought back by her peace and loving messages , for sins , 
to obey god 's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence 
of the lamb .  . 

as she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the 
son of god in her womb , mary has been us , the church , 
the body of christ , for his second coming  ( making sure we are 
protected from the  . also , she has been the new 
, by the deed of the ancient eve .  . the new will be 
the of the righteous as judged by christ in his 
next coming .  . 

i relate the story again 
i believe this and mary , in one of her 
in or 20th century , she appeared to these 
two children who tends and (i forgot 
the exact  . she was weeping and telling the 
children that she is afraid she 's going to lose her 
son 's . she is too for these 
because it was their fault that there 
would be in their not much good 
food again this year as it was last year .  . 

mary tells the children 
most of the in this place worked whole 
week even on sundays when they should be in church 
god. these and 
uses her son 's name in bad words. that is 
why her son 's is so heavy in pain. 
then she asked them if they pray .  . the children 
said hardly . she asked them to pray every 
morning and night. when the children went back 
from work they had to tell somebody about this. 
when the news was and after 
investigation of the incident , the 
were converted and faith and obedience to god 
were in their community.

in article writes 
i think it was lewis who said that in a , it 's the principals 
that marry each other the church and the state are present merely as 
witnesses .  . 

this is not just lewis it 's a summary of standard catholic 
theology .  . however this does n't mean that the presence of those 
witnesses is optional , except in odd situations like the standard 
desert island .  . 

i originally wrote to the person who asked this question 
personally , but decided to post the information i had on the topic. 

i spoke to the of my  ( catholic ) recently , 
by coincidence , on this subject. his was that 
while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence 
of a priest , it is important to have it recognized by the 
church as soon as it is possible. because the church 
itself as a community of believers , members 
of the church , to some degree , are to be held accountable 
to each other. to be less hypothetical than that mythical 
couple on the desert island , there are many places in the 
world that do not have priests for marriages 
on a regular basis. therefore , get married without 
the priest being present , but get the priest to testify to 
their marriage when one comes through the area. 

i remember a religion teacher in high school saying 
that the marriage is not for the benefit of the couple 
as much as it is for the benefit of the community. thus , 
married have some responsibility to the community 
to stay married , as divorce sets a bad example for the 
community. also , the couple has to become one with 
one another the community should be able to rely on that 
couple to be as one. 

while may marry without witnesses , they 
may not get without a priest present. an 
is simply an admission of the church that what 
they had declared a marriage was not , in fact , a marriage 
at all , for whatever reason. so do n't start getting married 
in the back of a station and giving yourselves 
a half hour later ! ! 

i tend to agree with the response back there that 
said become married as soon as they their 
marriage , but i would add that should consider their 
marriage if they have sex , whether or not they 
intended to be married , assuming they were both willing 
partners to the sexual act. the couple must be prepared 
to raise any children they may have as a result of that 
sexual act with the benefit of both parents .  . sex is a 
commitment , i believe , in god 's eyes.

from  ( dr nancy 's sweetie ) 
subject re certainty and arrogance 
organization college of new jersey 
lines 122 

in an earlier article , i explained that what many people find arrogant about 
christians is that some christians profess absolute about their 
beliefs and doctrines .  . that is , many christians insist that they cannot have 
made any mistakes when their beliefs , which to saying 
that they are infallible .  . 

claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant , most of us will 
probably agree. 

in short , the problem is that no matter how good your sources are , if any 
part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning , 
then those doctrines are suspect .  . so long as your own brain is involved , 
there is a possibility for error. i the problem by writing there 
is no way out of the loop. 


someone called  has claimed that there is a way out of the loop , but 
he did not bother to explain what it was , instead to paraphrase 
, about , and say that the conclusion of my argument 
leads to relativism .  . 

as i have explained to him before , you cannot reject an argument as false 
because you dislike where it leads the facts do not change just because 
you dislike them.  wrote 

i disagree with dr nancy 's 's conclusion because if it is 
taken to it leads to relativism which leads to  . 

however , as any first year philosophy student can explain , what  has 
written does not constitute a refutation .  . all he has said is that he does 
not like what i wrote he has done nothing at all to dispute it. 



there were two sentences in 's post that seemed relevant to the 
point at hand 

there is such a thing as true truth and it is real , it can be 
experienced and it is verifiable .  . 

i do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience. i 
have , for example , direct experience of adding numbers. i do n't claim to 
be infallible at it in fact i remember doing sums incorrectly but i 
do claim that i have direct experience of reasoning about numbers. 

however , once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about 
them , we are on much ground. that was the point of the earlier 
article. human brains are with sin , and they can only be trusted 
in very limited circumstances .  . 


it is only because of god 's own revelation that we can be absolute 
about a thing. 

but how far does that get you once god 's revelation stops , and your own 
reasoning begins , possibility for error appears .  . 

for example , let 's suppose that our modern bible translations include a 
perfect of jesus words at the last , and that jesus said , 
exactly , this is my body. 

we 'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely 
true. what can we be certain of not much. 

at the moment he stops speaking , and people start interpreting , the 
possibility of error appears .  . did he mean that literally or not we do 
not have any record that he elaborated on the words. was he thinking of 
or con he did n't say. we interpret this passage 
using our brains we think and reason and draw conclusions .  . but we know 
that our brains are not perfect our thinking often leads us wrong.  ( this 
is something that most of us have direct experience of. 8 ) 

why should anyone believe that his reasoning which he knows to be 
fallible can lead him to perfect conclusions 

so , given the assumptions in this example , what we can be certain of is 
that jesus said this is my body. beyond that , once we start making up 
doctrines and using our brains to reason about what christ revealed , we 
get into trouble .  . 

unless you are infallible , there are very few things you can be certain 
of. to the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking , they 
cannot be certain .  . 



that is the problem of seeming arrogant .  . the non christians around us know 
that human beings make mistakes , just as surely as we know it. they do not 
believe we are infallible , any more than we do. 

when christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead 
them astray when we implicitly claim that we are infallible the non 
christians around us rarely believe that claim .  . is 
hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you 
are either too foolish to recognise your own limits , or intentionally trying 
to cover them up. 

i think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what 
things we are only very confident of. for example , we might say that we 
know our sin , for sin is something we directly experience. but 
other things , whether based on reasoning from scripture or extra biblical 
thinking , should not be as infallible we should say that we are 
very confident of them , and be ready to explain our reasoning .  . 

but , so far as i am aware , none of us is infallible speaking or acting 
as if our thinking is is ridiculous .  .

notice what i said about this book. i called it easy reading. the reason i 
dropped as my major was because i into too many 
simon 's .  . i do n't know how many walking encyclopedia 's i across in 
classes .  . the problem is n't in knowing much more than your 
average person , the problem comes when you become up about it. 
is just fine for the average person. that was who he was 
to. i suppose that you would have criticised john that his gospel was 
to simple. i 've talked with one on one. i 've been in with 
the man when he was being drilled by students and 's from secular 
as well as christian universities .  .  ( nd alone would fill both those catagories ) 
his answers were enough that the 's themselves often were taken back and 
caused to re think what their question was. i saw this time and time again at 
different open forums. so yes , books are by in large , well , 
simplistic .  . it certainly is n't level reading. but we must get off our 
high horses when it comes to recommended reading. do you seriously think most 
people would get through the first chapter of i may have more to 
say about this secular scientist at another time. 

also , one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by 
 . one cannot live his life constantly from a doubt 
base .  . 

look , the christian supports genuine rationality .  . but we must 
add a to give this  . christianity is second to none in 
keeping reason in its place. we never know the value of a thing until we know 
its limits .  . put unlimited value on something and in the end you will 
it of all value ! 

this is why is thoroughly rational but not the least bit  . 
it also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism , and not christian 
faith , which leads to  . if we forget the limits of a thing , we 
in the face of reality and ourselves to learn the simple ironic 
lesson of life 

more without limits is less less with limits is more. 

or as i have so often stated it , freedom without form soon becomes form w o 
freedom .  . 

let 's put it another way. the rationality of faith is opposed to 
absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery .  . think about that. it can tell the 
difference between the two if you will let it. christianity 's contention with 
rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it , but that it has very 
little else. when a christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust 
go hand in hand , but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called 
to go on by itself without his understanding. 

this is where the principle of judgment applies .  . at such time if the 
christian faith is to be itself and let god be god , it must suspend judgment 
and say , father i do not understand you but i trust you. now do n't read all 
your objections of me into that statement. i was n't saying i do not understand 
you at all , but i trust you anyway. it means that i do not understand you in 
this situation but i do understand why i trust you anyway therefore i can 
trust that you understand even though i do not. the former is a mystery 
by rationality and from absurdity .  . the latter is 
a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of 
faith. so .  .  .  .  . the principle of judgment is not irrational .  . it is 
not a leap of faith but a walk of faith. as believers we cannot always know 
why , but we know why we trust god who knows why and this makes all 
the difference. 

now , there is one obvious to all this and this is where i have parted 
company with philosophy what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit 
more difficult in practice. in practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith 
like the of a 3 year old .  . it is n't just that we would like 
to know what we do not know but that we feel we must know what we cannot 
know. the one produces because curiosity is denied the other 
leads to genuine  . more specifically the poorer our understanding is in 
coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after 
coming to faith. if we do not know why we trust god , then we will always need 
to know exactly what god is doing in order to trust him. failing to grasp 
that , we may not be able to trust him , for anything we do not understand may 
count against what we are able to trust .  . 

if , on the other hand , we do know why we trust god , we will be able to trust 
him in situations where we do not understand what he is doing.  ( too many 
leaders teach as if the christian had a in the back of his head which 
allows for understanding at every foot fall ) for what god is doing may be 
ambiguous , but it will not be inherently contradictory ! it may be mystery to 
us , but mystery is only what would be is absurdity .  . 
and that my friend , was the conclusion of both in theory and in 
practice.

 ( lawrence c. foard ) writes 

and many others me. here is a reply to one of the letters. seems to 
me that atheist do not like the doctrine of hell ! 

there 's nothing like a preacher to put fear into an 
ignorant man .  .  .  . 

if god had n't created hell in the first place , there 'd be no 
no need to die and save us. is n't it also a bit 
to say god died when , in fact , no such thing is remotely 
possible. can the infinite die 

your using 20th century concepts to 1st century writers .  . of course , 
in your , god could not cease to exist. however , that is not what 
death ever means in the scriptures .  . if you will study the word , you will see 
that it separation .  . death is separation , not  . this is 
the reason for the of the cross .  . for the first time in eternity , one 
member of the was separated from the other two .  . 

i once met a young that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived .  . 
she was as as any saint ever imagined .  . she was to become my 
for several years. however , having been , we were 
separated by distance .  . to me that was a form of death. later , she decided 
that she could n't wait for me to come home and me  . that to me was 
death. it was separation from that which had made me whole .  . death is 
separation and eternal death is eternal separation from his fellowship , not 
because he chose to send you into outer , but because you chose to go 
there. 

did you know that jesus talked more 
about hell than he did about heaven ! 

thank you for this info .  . what respect i had for the man now 
has been  . i promise never again to 
say how wise or loving this man was .  .  .  . 

when i against my earthly father , he me. i found no wisdom in 
that until i had grown older and especially until i had my own children. he 
was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if i continued 
on my course. he did it in love though i interpreted it as harsh and 
 . if god of danger , that is love. if choose to let us 
do as we please , and then at the end tell us the rules , that would be harsh .  . 
you have a conscience , no matter how or fallen it is , that witnesses to 
you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear. 

being jesus was allegedly god , i doubt he could honestly feel 
the man dealt him .  .  .  . 

this may give light to the error of your understanding. one must have correct 
knowledge in order to have correct faith. faith and knowledge are  . 
jesus most certainly felt the of life. as the scripture say 

 . 4 15 for we do not have a high priest who cannot with our 
weaknesses , but one who has been tempted in all things as we are , yet without 
sin .  . 

the passage of 2 states that he gave up his 
when he took upon himself humanity .  . it has been a favorite of mine 
to think about this. it was to be my thesis. the consciousness of 
christ .  . i have talked at length with a great many people about this 
interesting study , including  . 

it is my that as jesus , the 2nd member of the trinity , actually 
suffered as we do. he became part of the human race and experienced it as we 
do. he grew in knowledge. he chose not to grasp his omniscience , but chose 
to be taught .  . it is my understanding that he was led of the spirit to such 
an extent that sometimes it is hard to between jesus the man and 
jesus as god. but in jn 8 where the women was thrown before him , 
the are quite clear in that the whole situation took him by surprise .  . 
that is , he was not aware that this event was to take place in time. he was 
living history as you or i. 

maybe some other time we can discuss this , but it is a very lengthy discussion 
and one that causes the of the brain to pop more often than 
not. 

thanks again for the info .  . just so you know , some friends and i 
are starting a organization and i'm going to 
use some of the info you provided for an organization intro

i was once a member of that club. the free thinker is a glorious ideal .  . by 
, of course , you believe that the believer is the 
of everything that is dogmatic , , reactionary and  . i find 
such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd .  . if the liberal humanist 
wishes to criticize a christian or a buddhist or a marxist , that is his right. 
but what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his rational 
doubt when in fact he was led to it by his faith . he must acknowledge that 
while it is rational doubt for him as a free thinker to criticize the 
christian , it might equally be a rational doubt for the christian to criticize 
him as a humanist .  . if there is no faith , there can be no  . there is no 
faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith. 

pascal pointed out that sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive .  . 
few. .  . speak . of scepticism .  . the fact that skeptics are not 
skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must 
believe in something else ! the person who is skeptical one faith or 
even most faiths , will be the devoted adherent of another. in fact , it is a 
measure of his poverty both that he is of it and that he can define 
himself only in negative terms , hence the term a theist .  . 

some people claim otherwise and argue for complete skepticism .  . in 
my campus ministry i across this more times than i care to remember. 
however , they disproved their own argument with every thought , every word , 
every point of logic that they used. every moment of shared 
speaks against their total skepticism .  . their very of trying to make 
sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent .  . 

that is to say , that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism 
is arbitrary .  . next time you 're in a room of skeptics , out look , your 
is ! each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he 
believes without skepticism .  . to this is to the obvious , but it 
the point that no one can know how he knows what he 
knows. pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an  . 
the answer to this lies in a 3rd way of knowing , one which is based on 
 . but if knowledge proceeds on what must be before 
it is proved , the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt , and 
critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective 
and neutral .  . in other words , another myth .  . 

my friend. it is impossible to doubt anything unless there is 
something we do not doubt our own assumptions  . even these can 
be only upon the basis of other assumptions .  . are 
our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for 
absence .  . 

i tell you what if god condemns me for being honest , he is 
unworthy of my worship .  . better to burn in hell than to 
serve a tyrant in heaven .  .  . 

of course that is hardly an original statement. coined it but it had 
been in use for  . it was even used in the first movie .  . 
but again , your is based on a faulty knowledge of the character of 
god. you are operating off of a premise of 
theology , not what he has revealed of himself through history , through his 
prophets , through his word , and lastly , but most of all , thru his son. if you 
are to reject god 's savior , then reject him from a correct 
understanding of himself.

i believe that a careful understanding of scripture can help us here. it

i must to add that i was always skeptical , even cynical , about

good point it is very true that these false predictions are

then i suggest that this assertion is suspect .  . 


john , 
the problem here is that you have taken one of my response , without 
bothering to connect it with the other parts. i have repeatedly noted that 
one needs to take the of acts and then examine the 
work of john and  . once you have taken the time 
to examine recent developments in biblical , i think you will 
grasp more clearly what i am saying. 



i think the original claim may have been somewhat more limited than 
this. it was an answer to the claim that the witnesses could n't 
be lying because they were to suffer for their beliefs .  . 
thus it 's not necessary to show that no christian ever suffered 
for believing in the resurrection .  . rather the issue is whether 
those who witnessed it did. 

i do agree that the posting you 're responding to shows that there 
can be liberal as well as conservative  . 



certainly this is an issue as i think the situation in shows most 
clearly .  . if all that is required is that people are willing to die for a 
belief for it to be true , then surely david koresh is the son of god. no , 
the arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be 
willing to die must be put to rest. the other problem is that it is so 
 . even if the resurrection was a big deal  ( which it does n't 
seem to have been for either q , thomas , or even john to a certain degree ) 
there are a lot of other things which the early christians could have been 
doing together that would have been worth dying for. it is my belief that 
even the idea of a race community , which brought down regional national 
in the name of could have been enough for people to be 
willing to die. radical do that (e . g .  . , , , etc ) 
but my original point was that roman persecution  ( which is the only persecution 
we have documented proof of ) was not about whether a came back from 
the dead. such a claim was not unique nor particularly to the roman 
or greek mind. my point is that of military and duty (i . e .  . 
worship ) would have been much more which has nothing 
to do with the resurrection at all. when used christians as human 
to light up his party it was n't because the believe in a 
risen savior , it was because they were supposedly involved in and 
 . the argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection 
just cannot stand up to critical examination .  .

religion  ( especially christianity ) is nothing more than a drug .  . 
some people use drugs as an escape from reality. christians 
themselves with and live with that high. 

your logic is  . if christianity is a drug , and once we die we 
die , then why would you be reluctant to this drug so that 
while you are alive you enjoy yourself. 


pardon the that follows .  .  .  . 

once , i told a christian please do not take advantage of jesus 
or anybody for the sake of your own  ( selfish ) or search 
for true faith religion belonging  being in  fear of hell etc. 
instead of serving yourself , we must be serving him . 
until you have this truth , you are only doing things for your 
own  . 

let us not use jesus , our religion , the bible , anything or 
anybody as a means of escape or getting or high. 
we are god 's children and we must have a true and authentic

dear fellow netters , 

from time to time a term like    ( or something 
similar ) has occurred in posts to this group. i also know that there 
is a movement called something like  jesus alone . ' . 

i believe in the trinity and have no plans to change that , but 
i was made aware that there is at least one person within our church 
who holds the view that there is no trinity .  . in the near future we 
will discuss this item , and i feel that i shall ask you , my friends on 
this group , for background information. 

can anybody tell me the basic reasons for holding a belief that there 
is only jesus and vice the foundations for the trinity 

i shall appreciate both quotes from the bible and historical 
development .  . 

thank you all.

i have come across what i consider to be an excellent  . it is a 
bit lengthy for a posting , but i thought i 'd share it with all of you 
anyway. feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might 
benefit from what it says .  . may god bless those who read it. 



d o e s g o d l o v e y o u 


q .  . what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs , 
, books , and bumper stickers that say , god loves you. is n't 
that true 

a. it is true that god his love to the whole world , as we read 
in one of the most quoted verses in the bible 

for god so loved the world , that he gave his only 
son , that in him should not , but 
have life. john 3 16 

however , god 's love is qualified .  . the bible says 

the way of the wicked is an unto the lord but he 
him that after  . 15 9 

for the lord the way of the righteous but the way of 
the shall  . psalm 1 6 


q .  . but i am not wicked .  . i am a decent , moral person. surely the good 
i have done in my life far whatever bad i have done. how 
can these verses apply to me 

a. by god 's standard of even the most moral person is 
looked upon by god as a on his way to hell. the 
bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven. 
on the contrary , we are all sinners and we are all guilty before 
god. 

as it is written , there is none righteous , no , not one there 
is none that , there is none that after 
god. romans 3 10 11 

the heart is above all things , and 
wicked who can know it jeremiah 17 9 


q .  . if i am such a wicked person in god 's sight , what will god do to me 

a. the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will 
come under eternal punishment in a place called hell. 

for a fire is in mine , and shall burn unto the 
lowest hell , and shall the earth with her increase , 
and set on fire the foundations of the mountains .  . i will 
upon them i will spend mine upon them. they 
shall be with , and with burning , 
and with bitter destruction i will also send the of 
upon them , with the poison of of the  . 
deuteronomy 32 22 24 


q .  . oh , come on now ! hell is not real , is it surely things are not 
that bad. 

a. indeed , hell is very real , and things are that bad for the 
who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior .  . the bible 
makes many references to hell , indicating that it is both eternal 
and consists of perpetual suffering .  . 

and was not found written in the book of life was 
cast into the of fire .  . revelation 20 15 

so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come 
forth , and the wicked from among the just , and shall 
cast them into the of fire there shall be wailing and 
of  . matthew 13 49 50 

... when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with 
his mighty angels , in flaming fire taking on them 
that know not god , and that obey not the gospel of our lord 
jesus christ who shall be punished with 
destruction from the presence of the lord , and from the glory 
of his power 2 1 7 9 


q .  . that is terrible ! why would god create a hell 

a. hell is terrible , and it exists because god created man to be 
accountable to god for his actions .  . god 's perfect justice demands 
for sin .  . 

for the wages of sin is death romans 6 23 

for we must all appear before the judgment of christ 
that every one may receive the things done in his body , 
according to that he done , whether it be good or bad. 
2 5 10 

but i say unto you , that every idle word that men shall speak , 
they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment .  . 
matthew 12 36 


q .  . does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought 
to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell 

a. indeed it does that is , unless we can find someone to be our 
in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our 
sins .  . that someone is god himself , who came to earth as jesus 
christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him. 

all we like have gone astray we have turned every one 
to his own way and the lord laid on him the of 
us all. isaiah 53 6 

but he was for our , he was bruised for 
our the of our peace was upon him 
and with his we are healed .  . isaiah 53 5 

for i unto you first of all that which i also 
received , how that christ died for our sins according to the 
scriptures and that he was buried , and that he rose again the 
third day according to the scriptures 1 15 3 4 

for he made him to be sin for us , who knew no sin that 
we might be made the of god in him. 
2 5 21 


q .  . are you saying that if i trust in christ as my , who was 
already punished for my sins , then i will not have to worry about 
hell anymore 

a. yes , this is so ! if i have believed in christ as my savior , then it 
is as if i have already stood before the judgment of god. 
christ as my has already paid for my sins .  . 

he that on the son life and he 
that not the son shall not see life but the wrath 
of god on him. john 3 36 


q .  . but what does it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that 
the bible says about christ as savior , then am i saved from going to 
hell 

a. believing on christ means a whole lot more than in our 
minds with the truths of the bible .  . it means that we our whole 
lives on him. it means that we every part of our lives to 
the truths of the bible .  . it means that we turn away from our sins 
and serve christ as our lord .  . 

no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one , 
and love the other or else he will hold to the one , and 
despise the other. cannot serve god and  . 
matthew 6 24 

therefore , and be converted , that your sins may be 
blotted out , when the times of shall come from the 
presence of the lord acts 3 19 


q .  . are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except 
through jesus what about all the other religions will their 
followers also go to hell 

a. yes , indeed. they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account 
able for our sins .  . god demands that we pay for our sins .  . other 
religions cannot provide a to bear the sins of their 
followers. christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and 
save us. 

neither is there salvation in any other for there is none 
other name under heaven given among men , whereby we must be 
saved .  . acts 4 12 

jesus said 

i am the way , the truth , and the life no man unto the 
father , but by me. john 14 6 

if we confess our sins , he is faithful and just to forgive us 
our sins , and to us from all  . 
1 john 1 9 


q .  . now i am  . i do not want to go to hell. what can i do 

a. you must remember that god is the only one who can help you. you 
must yourself on the of god. as you see 
your hopeless condition as a , cry out to god to save you. 

and the , standing off , would not lift up so much 
as his eyes unto heaven , but upon his , saying , 
god be to me a  . luke 18 13 

... , what must i do to be saved and they said , believe 
on the lord jesus christ , and thou shalt be saved , ... 
acts 16 30 31 


q .  . but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him 

a. , god not only saves us through the lord jesus , but he 
also gives us the faith to believe on him. you can pray to god that 
he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior .  . 

for by are saved through faith and that not of 
yourselves it is the gift of god 2 8 

god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith. so , 
if you really mean business with god about your salvation , you 
should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible , which is 
the only word of god. 
in this , all verses from the bible are within 
 . give to them with all your heart .  . 

so then faith by hearing , and hearing by the word of 
god. romans 10 17 


q .  . but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god 

a. yes. god wants us to come to him in total , 
our and our , trusting totally in him. 

the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a 
heart , o god , thou not despise .  . psalm 51 17 

because we are sinners we love our sins .  . therefore , we must begin 
to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins .  . and if we 
sincerely desire salvation , we will also begin to turn from our sins 
as god us. we know that our sins are sending us to 
hell. 

unto you first god , having raised up his son jesus , sent him 
to bless you , in turning away every one of you from his 
 . acts 3 26 


q .  . does n't the bible teach that i must church regularly and be 
will these save me 

a. if possible , we should do these things , but they will not save us. 
no work of any kind can secure our salvation .  . salvation is god 's 
gift of given according to his mercy and good 
 . salvation is 

not of works , lest any man should boast .  . 2 9 


q .  . what else will happen at the end of the world 

a. those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be 
into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever 
more. 

for the lord himself shall from heaven with a , 
with the voice of the , and with the of god 
and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are 
alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the 
, to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be 
with the lord .  . 1 4 16 17 


q .  . what will happen to the earth at that time 

a. god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens 
and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever 
more. 

but the day of the lord will come as a in the night in 
the which the heavens shall pass away with a great , and 
the elements shall with , the earth also and 
the works that are shall be burned up. ... 
nevertheless we , according to his promise , look for new 
heavens and a new earth , wherein  . 
2 peter 3 10 , 13 


q .  . does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will 
come 

a. yes ! the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to 
save .  . 

and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the 
world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end 
come. matthew 24 14 


q .  . can we know how close to the end of the world we might be 

a. yes ! god gives much information in the bible concerning the 
of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the 
lord will come as a in the night for the , it will not 
come as a for the believers .  . there is much evidence in the 
bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be 
very , very close. all the time clues in the bible point to this. 

for when they shall say , peace and safety then sudden 
destruction upon them , as upon a woman with 
child and they shall not escape .  . 1 5 3 

surely the lord god will do nothing , but he his 
secret unto his the prophets .  . 3 7 


q .  . but that means judgment day is almost here. 

a. yes , it does. god warned ancient that he was going to 
destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning .  . 

and jonah began to enter into the city a day 's journey , and he 
cried , and said , yet forty days , and shall be

q .  . what did the people of do 

a. from the king on down they themselves before god , 
of their sins , and cried to god for mercy .  . 

but let man and be covered with , and cry 
unto god yea , let them turn every one from his evil 
way , and from the violence that is in their hands. who can 
tell if god will turn and , and turn away from his

q .  . did god hear their prayers 

a. yes. god saved a great many people of  . 


q .  . can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into 


a. yes. there is still time to become saved even though that time has

at the first began to be spoken by the lord , and was confirmed 
unto us by them that heard him hebrews 2 3 

in god is my salvation and my glory the of my strength , 
and my refuge , is in god. trust in him at all times

i have seen the claims , but i do n't know if there are any 
cases of people making in 
real they do n't know. from my observations , speaking 
in in practice has nothing at all do with this. 

i have a simple test. i take several people who can speak 
only one language (e . g .  . chinese , , german ,  . 
then i let the one start speaking in . 
the audience should understand the one clearly 
in their native language. however , the one can 
only hear himself speaking in his own language. 


there seem to be many points to the speaking in thing which 
are  . it 's use as prayer language seems especially 
to me. i understand that when you pray in , the spirit is doing 
the talking. and when you pray , you pray to god. and the spirit is 
god. so , the spirit is talking to himself. which is why i only go 
by the use where it 's an actual language. 

moreover , the phrase though i speak with the of men and angels 
used by paul in i  . is out of context. some would then 
assume that there is some tongue , and if when they speak , it 
is no known language , then it is an tongue .  . 

hmmm .  .  . in . the old testament story about the of , we see how 
god punished by giving us different language. can we assume then that 
if angels have their own language at all , that they have the same one 
amongst other angels after all , they were not punished in any manner. 

so why do these supposed all sound different from one 
another it 's to think that some people find ways to 
justify  . 

but i 'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned .  . 

trouble is , while such stories abound , any and all attempts at 
 ( and we are to test the spirit .  .  . ) . either show that 
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances , or that outright 
was involved. the brother story in a previous post 
seems like a friend of a friend thing. and , a two 
syllable word hardly as language , or no.

to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children should men be allowed to have babies , if that 
is made possible. 

in a word , yes. i do n't believe that physical knowledge has a great deal of 
impact on the power of god. in the past , god gave us the ability to create 
life through sexual relations .  . now , he is giving us the ability to create life

, and even if we gain the ability to create universes we wo n't begin to

a similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood 
is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are 
jehovah 's witnesses and so have objections to blood 
 . the doctor 's efforts to persuade them to agree to a blood 
could be perceived to be arrogant in precisely the same way as 
christians could be perceived to be arrogant .  . 

the truth or otherwise of the belief that a blood is necessary 
to save the life of the child is irrelevant here. what matters is that the 
doctor believes it to be true , and could be seen to be trying to his 
beliefs on the parents , and this could well be perceived as arrogance .  . 

let me carry that a step further. most doctors would not claim to be 
infallible .  . indeed , they would generally admit that they could 
be wrong , e.g. that in this case , a blood might not turn out to 
be necessary after all. however , the doctors would have enough 
and conviction to claim , out of genuine concern , that is is necessary. as 
fallible human beings , they must acknowledge the possibility that they are 
wrong. however , they would also say that such are not reasonable , 
and stand by their convictions .  .

in article ,  ( mark baker ) writes 
to demand or rational proof of god 's existence , is to deny 
god 's existence , since neither science , nor reason , can , in their very 
nature , prove anything. 

are you asking us to believe blindly you are trying to deny that part of 
us that makes us ask the question does god exist i.e. self awareness and 
reason. if we do not use our ability to reason we become as ignorant 
as the other animals on this earth. does god want us to be like that 

i am asking you to believe in things not  . i do n't know if this is 
blindly or not. i'm not sure how comes into it. i do 
not deny reason , indeed i insist upon it , but reason only conclusions 
from evidence. if you decide in advance that your reason will act only on 
the evidence of the five physical senses , then you cut reason off from any 
possibility of a conclusion outside the physical  ( beyond the 
rather , if inconclusive , conclusion that the physical 
is not self  . 

christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence , 
which they call faith , and which is a gift of god. that is , this evidence 
is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. the 
evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a exists. reasoning 
on the evidence of the senses wo n't help either. but christians do reason 
of the evidence of faith , and do claim that this evidence is wholly 
consistent with the evidence of the other senses , and indeed , that the 
evidence of these other senses is part of god 's revelation of himself 
to us. 

it is not the case however that knowledge of a god must come 
through this route .  . there may be other senses than the physical ones 
providing evidence of non physical realities .  .  ( there may , of course , be 
physical realities of a type for which we have no senses , for 
all we know . ) . these senses , if they exist , may provide valid evidence for 
reason to work on. and , as with all senses , these senses may be 
in some people , that is , they may be blind .  . in this sense , 
belief in god becomes an act of sight , and it is disbelief which is blind .  . 

you are right that science and reason cannot prove anything. however , if 
we do not use them we can only then believe on faith alone. and since 
we can only use faith , why is one picture of god (e . g .  . hinduism ) any less 
valid than another (e . g .  . christianity ) 

faith , as i have said , is not opposed to reason , it is simply a new source 
of evidence on which reason may operate .  . it is clear that human beings 
have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses , and 
similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by 
faith. religious believers in general , and christians in particular , use 
reason to help through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding 
of the evidence provided by faith. science claims , with good reason , to be 
the most valid system for explaining the physical universe , and christianity 
claims , also with good reason , to be the most valid system , of the 
best evidence , for explaining gods revelations of himself to man. 

if you doubt that christians use reason , read this newsgroup for a while 
and you will see rational debate  .

out if i should buy one here for later study or wait until i get back to 
the u.s. 

my impression is that for advanced work you will be much better off with 
german reference works  ( lexicons ,  . for a first time 
, my personal preference would be to deal with a textbook written in 
my native language. but if you know german and are in germany , pick up all the 
reference books you think you can handle .  . (i only know these works by 
reputation , since my german is most , but i 'd look at the following books 
's , 's concordance , the theological 
dictionary of the ot . ) . 

what 's it like at divinity schools or in the states is 
there a lot of language done i really do n't have a basis 
for comparison .  . 

the amount of language available at us varies widely , 
mostly depending on the of the school. 
and probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical 
than others.  ( of course , any divinity school that has a 
program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources ! but 
there are quite a few masters degree here at which the 
attitude seems to be more , well , if you 're really interested we 'll give you 
a long course , but we do n't understand why . . . ) 

the pattern here at the is for first year 
students to take five week introductory language in each 
language , followed by long  .  ( that is hebrew in 
august , ot in the fall greek in , nt in the spring . ) . 
these are required for , a third or a half of the students , 
i 'd say , take advanced biblical work that requires language work.

in article  ( darius lecointe ) writes 

you cannot show , from scripture , that the weekly sabbath is part of the 
laws .  . before you post a text in reply investigate its context. 

first of all , law is an term .  . it is sometimes 
used as a to view scripture .  . but if you look at , 
without going into it with the assumption that the sabbath cannot be 
a law , you will see that it does refer to the sabbath .  . 

paul writes in 2 14 17 how that christ nailed the laws that were 
against us to his cross , and therefore we should not be judged in what 
what food we eat , what we drink , the keeping of new and holy days , 
or the keeping of the sabbath .  . 

the word for sabbath in this verse is and is used throughout the 
new testament to refer to the 7th day. if there is any scripture from 
which we get the idea of the law , this is one of them , and the 
sabbath is listed among the laws .  . 

if one goes into this with the fundamental assumption the sabbath cannot 
be a law then he will have to find some way around it , like 
saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 
7th day , because the sabbath cannot be a law. but 
paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of 
statement if there is anything that can be seen as a to sin 
in his writings .  . 

also , why is the sabbath absent from the epistles  ( except for hebrews 4 , which 
talks about the rest that comes through faith ) surely it would have 
been a big problem for first century christians living in a society 
that did not rest on the 7th day. especially slaves .  . many new were 
slaves .  . it would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath 
if it had been mandatory .  . why is there no mention of this in the epistles

when you say that man is only an animal , i have to think that you are

me so are you going there 
him if there was a heaven , i would. 
me but since there is n't a heaven , you 're not going there , are you 
him no. 

the point is that heaven is based on faith if you do n't believe in heaven , 
there 's no way you 're going to be in it. 

hmmm .  .  .  . people in the before the time of christ , children who 
die young , etc. 


of course , the next step is , i do n't believe in hell either , so why will i 
be there it seems to me that hell is eternal death and from god. 


but of course , the popular conception of hell  ( correct or incorrect ) is 
something akin to eternal of consciousness , at the very least. 


most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever , and never 
see god so they do , in fact , believe that they 're going to hell. 

i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond 
bodily death , but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe 
they 're going to hell. they believe they 're going to die . understand 
that you 've turned hell into a verb .  . using the same logic , it also follows 
that all animals are  going to hell . ' . are you sure this is what you want 
to say  ( presumably animals do n't have the opportunity to get to heaven , 
but this still does n't change the fact that they 're going to hell  ( die 
a final death ) 

i do n't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some 
sort , but if hell is as you described  ( final death , and 
not eternal of consciousness ) it will be true that 
there will never be a moment when i am aware of my non existence .  . 
 ( assuming i  go to hell  and not to heaven ) in other words , i 'll 
never know i'm dead. hmmm .  .  .  . 


hell does n't have to be worse than earth to be hell because it 's eternal , 

ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill , and has died 
at least she 's not suffering any more she 's in heaven now. 

consider the following statement 
at least she 's not suffering any more she 's in hell now. 

the above statement sounds odd , but according to your definition of hell , 
it would be a true statement. the person in hell would not be suffering .  . 
granted , they would n't be anything  ( would n't be having any 
conscious experience  . 

you say hell  ( death ) is eternal .  . however , this loses its meaning 
to a dead person. and to me , it seems that the threat of some sort 
of eternal punishment only makes sense has force if one expects to 
be conscious throughout this eternity .  . 

many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the 
product of propaganda ( friend , do you want the free gift of e life 
it 's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife .  . 
can anyone back me up on this ) combined with the survival instinct all 
animals share .  . the difference is we have consciousness , and once we get the 
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains , we then desire a sort of 
super survival .  . 


and it 's a lot worse than heaven. that 's the only comparison that matters. 

that would depend on what heaven is like. if god is a king , and 
an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king , 
i might opt for hell. i read a account of a missionary trying to 
convert to christianity in the book the illusion of immortality 
by  . the missionary started to speak about heaven. 
are there seals in heaven will we be able to go asked an 
 . the missionary said no. the group of then said something 
to the effect of , well what good is your heaven if there 's no

goodness that is within the power of each of us. now , the 
is that one of my best friends has become very 
fundamentalist .  . that would normally be a non issue with me , but he 

hello. firstly , what do you exactly mean by fundamentalist i will 
for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes 
that the bible is god 's word to mankind i suspect that what happened 
to him is what he 'll call being born again anyway , was that recent 
if the answer is yes to all the questions above , it is quite 
understandable .  . however , imo , i rather give advice to your friend ! 
i think i 've been through something similar to him , and one thing i can 
say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to 
communicate from different  . why he talks about those things 
is because they are now obvious to him. what is obvious to him is 
not obvious to you. secondly , why he may be very persuasive is because 
from his point of view , he has been on both sides of the . this 
i mean that before he turned fundamentalist , you two are agreeable 
because both of you see things from the same side. if suddenly , as if 
a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him , it is like the 
of let 's say a new continent , or a new planet. to him , he 's 
got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than 
where he was , and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. 
you have got to realise that from his point of view , he means well to 
you , he may end up offending you. to him , it is worth that 
risk. nevertheless , it is really up to him to respect where you stand 
and listen to you as well. at this moment , it may be difficult because 
he is either very or feel it is too to keep quiet about , 
however , he may not realise that he 's really putting you off. 

... 

the bible that it is so . ' . so my question is , how can i convince him 
that this is a subject better left , so we can preserve 
what is  ( in all areas other than religious beliefs ) a great 
friendship how do i convince him that i am  beyond saving  so he 
wo n't try thanks for any advice. 

so far , i 've only been trying to explain things from his side. however , 
i do understand how you feel too , because i was n't a christian for a good 
part of my life as well. i was quite turned off by christians or 
fundamentalists who were really all out and enthusiastic about their 
faith. they really scared me , to tell you the truth. unfortunately , 
religious belief is a very personal thing , just as your agnosticism 
is also a very personal thing to you. since the christian belief is 
inevitably at odds with anything non christian  ( religious or otherwise ) , 
it will be a matter. like all , it will take both 
sides to do their part to make it work. in this matter , maybe you can 
do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he 's 
trying to convince you about , that it 's beyond you or not your concern 
for now . do n't tell him it 's nonsense , because to him it is reality 
and that would be a real insult .  . he 'll also have to be careful not to 
insult where you stand too. 

like i said before , i wish i could give your friend some advice too. 
i 'll admit that i did similarly to some of my friends when i became a 
christian .  . in some ways , i wish i could have done things a little 
differently. however , it was difficult then because i was so 
and just away about what i 've found ! to me , it was too good 
not to know. to some , i was crazy , and i did n't really care most of 
the time what they thought. you will probably think he 's crazy too 
but god is very real to him , as real as you are to him. keep that in 
mind. and he thinks he can convince you because since god is so real 
to him , he does n't see why god ca n't be real to you too. 

i do n't know how helpful this is to you. but all the best anyhow 
this is quite a challenge for you to face. by the way , personal 
conviction nobody is beyond saving except the one we call the 
devil and his hosts .  .

i am uncomfortable with the in general because there seems to be 
an emphasis on hell. god deserves our love and worship 
because of who he is. i do not like the idea of frightening people into 
accepting christ .  . 

and yet , , as we read the gospels and in particular the that jesus 
himself spoke on , hell in a large of the time certainly more than 
heaven itself. paul , as we learn in i , taught new believers and new 
churches and did not to teach hell and damnation .  . rev , 
chapter 20 11 15 is very specific and cannot be  . i think the word 
is used 45 times in rev and that the come to receive the 
of the of judgement , for in john 3 we read that they are 
already judged .  . 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut .  . there is no 
recourse , excuse or defense .  . 

i see evangelism as a way of living that shows god 's love with 
putting into words and explaining that love. preaching the gospel 
without living the gospel is no better than being a gong or a 
 . 

yes i agree with you. life is often like a where it to 
before stopping at  . i think we have seen the extreme of 
the hell fire preacher , but also we have seen the other extreme 
where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending 
 . 

i forget who founded the word of life , but i remember him telling a 
story. he was in a small town hardware and some how a man got to the 
point of telling him that he did n't believe in satan or hell. he believed 
everybody was going to heaven. it was at this point that the man was asked to 
pray to god that he would send his children to hell ! of course the man 
would n't do it. but the point was made. many people say they do n't believe in 
hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it does n't 
exist. if this man had , he would of prayed the prayer because hell did n't 
exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered. and 
yet , they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there. 

i 'd use a different however. i have to include myself in it. 
when i watch , say a  ( go bulls ! ) game , and i see a blatant foul that 
is n't called , vey ! . what 's with that that he did n't make that call .  . 
it 's unfair .  . and just so in life , demands  . as the 
surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the away , so god cuts off that which 
is still of the old creation. we must preach the gospel in all its 
which includes the fact that if you reject the way and the truth and the life , 
then broad is the way to  . 


here 's a question how many of you are christians because you are 
afraid of going to hell how many are responding to god 's love 

i think i would fall in there somewhere. actually it was both. after all , 
is n't only a turning towards , but also a turning away from ! 
no , again , if jesus used it in his ministry then i can surely see that we 
should do it also. in love , of course , but in truth most  . 

i have thought about writing something on this topic , but not now and here. i 
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its 
 . 

1 ) god is light. yes he is love , but his love has the of  . 
2 ) of man. either a man is a or he is a responsible creature .  . 
if responsible , then he is also accountable .  . 
3) the of sin .  . today we have a poor , poor concept of sin god. 
4 ) christ .  . he was willing to die and go there himself to offer an avenue to 
the will.

d. andrew writes 

are you suggesting that god supports genocide 
perhaps the germans were punishing jews on god 's behalf 

any god who works that way is evil , and unworthy of 
my worship or faith. 

the bible does tell us that governments are by god  ( romans  . 
and furthermore , god everything that would happen. it is 
just to difficult for humans to with our limited minds , the 
of the of god 's plan , and this is especially hard to 
grasp when we see doing evil. however , though they are 
doing evil  ( and we should not with them when they do such ) , it 
must be understood that what happens is what god wanted so as to lead to 
the final of his plan to save as many souls from hell as is 
possible. in short , the slaughter in bosnia , though deplorable in the 
eyes of god  ( maybe , then again , they might be getting their just 
now rather than later there are plenty of examples of god killing 
people for their sins in the old for example , and 
and in the new ) is what he to happen so that his 
plan might be accomplished .  . 
but do n't forget , it is not for god to use one nation to 
execute his just judgement upon another. the romans were used to 
fulfill the of let his blood be upon our hands of the in 
 . and was chastised by , which got israel , 
which was gotten by , etc. god does use nations to punish 
other nations , as the bible very clearly shows in the old testament .  . 
do n't you remember the words of god recorded in daniel , , , 
, had been weighed in the of god 's 
justice , found wanting , and was thus given over to the 
as their due punishment for their  . another is the 
of the , ordered by god as the task of israel .  . 
the had been given their chance , found wanting , and 
the great judge , carried out his just sentence  . i could go 
on with more examples , but i see little need to do so , as my point is 
quite clear. 
two things need to be at all times. 1 ) it is not up to us to 
question why god has ordered the world as he has .  . in his divine wisdom , 
he made the world as was best in his eyes , and like paul says in romans 
9 , the is not one to back to the potter .  . 2 ) the message of 
jesus christ is as follows now , for the kingdom of heaven is at 
hand. jesus christ did not allow any time for let 
the dead bury the dead , come , follow me. there is not an infinite 
amount of time , rather christ is passing by right now , calling people to 
follow him and become of men. he does not say , well , , 
you can call me back in a week and see if my kingdom fits in with your 
plans. he said follow me. his message is not i'm just a 
who would never hurt a , you 've got all the time in the world , and 
divine judgement , that 's only a fairy tale .  . our great god and savior 
jesus christ  ( titus 2 . is also the just and righteous judge of the 
world. and it is not up to the in the trial to be 
questioning his entirely just sentences of either or mercy .  .

we also cannot fail to note the intense suffering a devastation which has been 
on our world because of christians who were certain they were 
following christ .  . from who have polluted the in strict 
obedience to the command to the earth , to nazi 's who have 
justly 
punished the jews for the killing christ  ( as well as the other progroms ) , the 
innocent women who were burned alive in accordance with you shall not allow a 
witch to live , the moslems who were killed in the crusades , the god fearing 
men by the  . the religious wars in spain , france , england , 
etc. christianity has caused the most suffering and loss 
of life by individuals whose that they were following the 
instructions , was  . there is much to  . 




very interesting , but i also believe that you have presented a 
argument. christianity is not the cause of the massacres 
and that you relate , rather they are the fault 
of people who misunderstand jesus christ 's message , and 
it to suit their own beliefs and , rather than alter their 
to be more in line with those presented as desirable in 
the new testament .  . with every and good message that 
carries authority or implied authority , comes the inevitable 
fact that some  ( many ) people will understand it in a 
way , with inevitable consequences .  . 

the bible 's message is that we are to love all people , and 
that all people are  . it preaches a message of 
, and of giving .  . unfortunately , all people have 
hearts , and are capable of turning this message 
around and it in sometimes ways. 
this is also a fundamental christian doctrine .  . 

one of the problems is that you look at the world through 
the eyes of western history. i think that you will find 
many , many cases of massacres that were by 
people who never claimed they were christian .  . i am not saying 
this to justify the massacres that were , but i am merely 
pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already. 

consider the world without christianity .  . i doubt that we 
would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we 
live , if it was n't for the peaceful doctrines of jesus christ .  . 
perhaps we would even be by a very harsh religion 
(i wo n't name any here , though one comes to mind ) which 
would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such 
subjects .  . 

point the blame at inherent human of thirst for 
power , greed and hatred .  . please do n't point the blame at 
a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial , in 
love for others. 

yours in christ , 

andrew 


p.s. i believe that a line of questioning like you presented 
is , strangely enough , compatible with becoming a christian .  . 
certainly christianity encourages one to question the behaviour 
of the world , and especially christians .  . i praise god for 
jesus christ , and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs 
and still come back to god and be forgiven , time and time 
again.

i disagree with your claim that jews were not  ( except in 
the narrow sense of the  . jewish was widespread .  . 
there are numerous accounts of jewish , both in the new 
testament and in roman and greek documents of the day. 

i am not so sure of jewish then , but i would like to relate 
an account of a recent i had with jews a few months ago. 

the was by the of the , whom i had met while 
my wife in last october .  . the dear old  ( now 
deceased ) was very proud of her jewish , although not especially 
devout .  . her parents were both murdered in nazi concentration camps in 
austria during wwii because they were jewish .  . while with her 
about politics , world affairs and religion , she that it would 
be a good idea for me to visit her on my return to  . 

within two days of returning to , her called to 
me over for with her husband .  . i went , not knowing really what to 
expect , other than stimulating conversation and fellowship .  . what i got , 
however , was rather  . the thrust of the evening 's discussion 
was to condemn the reagan bush policies prohibiting abortion 
in funded family planning clinics , prohibiting the sterilization 
of minorities on welfare here and in , on 
the ban on tissue research , and against the mexico city policy , 
which denies u.s. foreign aid to programs that promote abortion .  . 

the crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of 
overpopulation , rampant domestic crime , african , 
, etc. , on christianity , rather on the fall of adam .  . now , this 
is not what i had to come to talk about. but every time i tried to 
bring up the subject of judaism , they would condemn jews for jesus 
and me against converting to judaism , because it involves 
too much study and effort .  . and i did not even raise the , nor 
try to convert them to the truth of christ ! there was certainly no 
jewish going on there. 

and again , last i a traditional jewish and was 
to a 30 minute against jesus and christianity in 
general. i realize that these are two isolated incidents , and that the 
best i ever had at work is jewish , but from my experience , 
the modern jew is not known for his  .

i believe that the god has preserved the bible perfectly in that it 
perfectly all of the truth that he intended .  . this he has done 

oh yea which version of the bible is the perfectly preserved one and 
why are there so many translations that are not perfectly preserved is 
god trying to confuse us 

minor changes in wording or even accidental of passages in some 
manuscripts does not change the truth being , nor would it lead a 
serious student into doctrinal error.  ( note also that god provided many 

but that is exactly what  . there are so many branches of 
of christianity and deviations of doctrine 
from translations of biblical texts by serious students that 
are much too numerous to begin to count. if there is a perfect bible , 
then there would be no possible and there would be 
no need for anyone here to be it. on the other hand , maybe 
the bible is perfect , but no one on this planet is perfect enough to 
read it correctly , but then there would be no point in god giving us 
something we cannot use correctly. 

in short , if you attack the credibility and reliability of the bible , you 
are on weak ground. furthermore , the only reason that i can see for wanting 
to do so is to remove the bible as the final authority , and instead put 
that responsibility on men to the bible to out the of 
truth that it contains  ( in other words , what they want to believe ) , and 
ignore the rest. the bible is truth it does not just contain truth. 

imho , if you trust your salvation on the reliability of a single book , 
you are on weak ground. remember , in the beginning was the word , and 
the word was with god , and the word was god. this word existed before 
the bible was written.  ( note word god) .  . this word that john is 
trying to describe cannot be fully described in any written language , 
all being imperfect .  . comes only from 
of the word , and is outside the of language. i use the bible 
as a guide , a , but in no way is it my final authority .  . 
god alone is the final authority .  .

can someone cite biblical references to homosexuality being immoral , other 
than so far , when i ask , around here , i get the verses from 
spouted at me , but the whole rest of that book tends to be 
ignored by christians  ( have n't seen any in a long time ) .  . 

later , 
 ( bob ) 

the list was posted not long ago , as i recall , aside from , commonly 
cited passages are 

the story of sodom .  . note however that this was a homosexual rape , and 
there 's no disagreement that that is wrong. i take an 
position on this note that sodom is referred to elsewhere in the 
bible for its  . it does n't seem to have been known 
specifically for homosexuality .  . rather , i think it was considered a 
of all sins .  . however from what we know of jewish attitudes , 
homosexuality would have contributed to the of the action 
described .  .  ( it almost seems to have been contrived to about 
as many forms of evil in one act as possible homosexual rape of 
, who were actually angels . ) . but this story is not specifically 
about homosexuality .  . 

in the nt , the clear references are all from paul 's letters. in 
1 , there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. 
note that the passage is n't about homosexuality it 's about 
 . homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment , or at 
least result , of  . there are a number of arguments over this 
passage .  . it does not use the word homosexuality , and it is referring 
to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality .  . 
so it 's not what i 'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality .  . 
but it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway , 
that paul shares the general negative jewish attitude towards 
homosexuality .  . 

the other passages occur in lists of sins , in i 6 9 , and i tim 
1 10. unfortunately it 's not entirely clear what the words used here 
mean. there have been suggestions that one has a meaning , 
such as , and that another may be specifically male 
prostitute . again , we do n't have here a precise teaching about 
homosexuality , but it is at least weak evidence that paul 
shared the ot 's negative judgement on homosexuality .  . 

1 7 is sometimes cited , however it 's probably not relevant .  . the 
context in involves angels .  . since those who were almost in 
sodom were angels , it seems likely that strange flesh refers to 
intercourse with angels .  . 

as you can see , the nt evidence is such that people 's conclusion is 
determined by their approach to the bible .  . note that 
the passages from paul 's letters imply that he accepted the ot 
 . this is enough for them to regard it as having nt 
endorsement .  . note that there 's no specific teaching , and no 
clear definition of what is being or why  ( is the concern in 
1 the connection of homosexuality to worship what exactly 
do the words in the lists of sins mean ) .  . thus some believe it is 
legitimate to regard this as a attitude paul took with him from his 
background and not a specific teaching of the gospel .  . 

this is an explosive topic , which tends to result in long 
on the exact meaning of various greek words. but it 's 
clear to me that that 's mostly irrelevant .  . what it really comes down 
to is whether people are looking to the bible for law or whether they 
believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the gospel .  . this 
appears to depend upon one 's reaction to the message of the bible as a 
whole , as well as one 's perception of the needs of the church today. 
this is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference 
between protestant and catholic in the 16th , and one where both 
sides believe that the bible is so obviously on their side that they 
keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the 
other side will finally come to their senses .  . that makes things 
very frustrating for a , who that such an 
outcome is not very likely .  .  .  .

into account references in the bible .  . 

like most , we 've been through this one before , but here is

i 'd like to suggest that discussions based on single quotations 
are a bad way to proceed .  . there are passages consistent with 
either theory. the sensible way to proceed is to look at them 
all , and see if we can come up with a view that encompasses all

we assume the universe just exists as you assume god to 
just exist why must there be a why to the universe 

whether there is a why or not we have to find it. this is pascal  ( 's ) wager .  . 
if there is no why and we spend our lives searching , then we have merely 
our lives , which were meaningless anyway. if there is a why and we 
do n't search for it , then we have our meaningful lives. 
suppose the universe is 5 billion years old , and suppose it another

i have seen two common threads running through postings by atheists on 
the newsgroup , and i think that they can be used to explain each other. 
unfortunately i do n't have direct quotes  .  .  . 

1 ) atheists believe that when they die , they die forever. 

true to a point. if you were to ask a buddhist atheist .  .  .  . 

2 ) a god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death 
is unfair .  . 

i do n't see what the problem is ! to christians , hell is , by definition , 
eternal death exactly what atheists are expecting when they die. there 's no 
reason hell has to be especially awful to most people , eternal death is bad 
enough. 

actually , yes and no , hell is eternal death. actually , the way 
i 've had it related to me , it 's more of an eternal damnation , 
where sinners will feel the flames of hell. if i 
supposedly can feel these flames , i would assume i'm still 
alive , but suffering and away from god. 

literal of the bible will have a problem with this view , since 
the bible talks about the of hell and such. personally , i do n't think 
that people in hell will be thrust into flame any more than i expect to jesus 
with a double sword from his mouth i treat both these state 
as metaphorical .  . 

i believe jehovah 's witnesses have a similar view , where the body 
for ever .  .  .  . 

i do n't have a problem with being condemned to hell either. the 
way i see it , if god wants to punish me for being honest in 
my skepticism  ( that is , for saying he does n't exist ) , he 
certainly would n't be changing his nature. besides , i would 
rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven 
knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being

insert deletion of unnecessary quote 

why is it that we have this notion that god takes some sort of pleasure 
from punishing people the purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and 
his angels .  . 

first of all , god does not take any sort of pleasure from punishing 
people. he will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on 
whom he will have compassion  ( ex 33  . however , if he 
punishing people and sending them to hell , then why would he send jesus 
to seek and save that which was lost  ( luke 19 10 ) 


to the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with 
the fact that the fallen angels were not , remember the bible 
teaches that god has them until the day of judgement .  . their 
judgement is soon to come. 

let me suggest this. maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory 
should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it. stay away 
from human theories , and only take into account references in the bible .  . 

you asked for it. 

2 peter 2 4 talks about how those who are are punished .  . 
matthew 25 31 46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in 
god 's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity .  . 
2 1 6 10 states that those who cause trouble for the 
disciples will be punished with destruction and shut out 
from the presence of the lord . 
2 2 9 12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth 
being condemned .  . 
revelation 21 6 8 talks about the difference between those who 
and those who do not. those who do not , listed in verse 8 , will be in 
the of burning . 
revelation 14 9 12 gives the indication that those who follow the 
will be with burning and there being no rest day or 
night for them because of it. 
psalm 9 17 the wicked return to the grave , all the nations that 
forget god. 

i think those should be sufficient to prove the point. 



joe 

in the following i'm mostly playing devil 's advocate . i'm not 
advocating either position. my concern is that people understand that 
it 's possible to see these passages in different ways. it 's possible 
to see eternal destruction as just that destruction .  . rev often 
uses the term second death . the most obvious understanding of that 
would seem to be final  . the problem is that the nt speaks 
both of eternal punishment and of second death. i.e. it uses terms 
that can be understood either way. my concern here is not to convince 
you of one view or the other , but to help people understand that 
there 's a wide enough variety of images that it 's possible to 
understand them either way. as tom commented , the primary 
point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire , 
whatever the details.  ( to make things more interesting , luke 20 35 
implies that the damned do n't get resurrected at all. presumably 
they just stay dead. yes i'm aware that it 's possible to 
understand this passage in a non literal way . ) . 

2 peter 2 4 is talking about angels , and talks about holding them 
in hell until the final judgement .  . this is n't eternal  . 

matthew 25 31 46 talks about sending the into eternal fire 
prepared for the devil and his angels .  . the fact that the fire is 
eternal does n't mean that people will last in its flames forever. 
particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been 
prepared for the devil and his angels .  . rev 20 and 21 talk about the 
eternal fire as well. they say that the and the false prophet 
will be forever in it. when talking about people being 
thrown into it  ( 20 13 14 ) , it is referred to as the second death . 
this sounds more like than eternal  . is is possible 
that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as 
the devil , and humans 

2 1 6 10 similarly , what is destruction 
this is not necessarily eternal  . this one can clearly be 
understood either way , but i think it 's at least possible to think 
that is being used to the kind of destruction 
that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in 
eternity .  . 

2 2 8 again talks about destruction .  . 
revelation 21 6 8 see comment above 
revelation 14 9 12 is probably the best of the quotes. even there , 
it does n't explicitly say that the people suffer forever. it says 
that the  ( and presumably the fire ) is eternal , and that 
there is no from it. but it does n't say that the people 
are forever. 

psalm 9 17 i do n't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.

it me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious 
wars , of which christianity has had no small part. 

when christians see a non believer , they say that person is blind 
to the truth , but they cannot realize that it is they who live 
with this of each day. jesus was just prophet

a brief description about islam 



the movement in islam , an international 
, was founder in 1989 in , india .  . the founder of this 
,  ( 1835 1908 ) , to be the 
promised of this age as in almost all the major 
religions of the world today  ( islam , christianity , , 
 . he claimed to be the long awaited second of 
jesus christ  ( metaphorically ) , the muslim mahdi , and the promised 
messiah .  . he claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all 
the great religions of the world about the advent of a messenger 
from god have been fulfilled .  . 

the claims raised of hostility and 
extreme from many people of muslims , chris 
, jews and of that age. such opposition is often wit 
in the history of divine  . even today this 
is being persecuted in some of the muslim  . 
dispite the opposition and persecution , this has won many 
adherents in 130 countries. it has over 10 million followers , who 
come from a ethnic and cultural background .  . 

the is devoted to world peace and in bringing about 
a better understanding of religion , and the of all

this is certainly a valid objection to religion as explanation of 
nature. 

fortunately for the convenience of us believers , there is a class of 
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science. for 
example why does the universe exist at all after all , the time space 
world did n't have to exist. why does anything exist and is it 
possible for persons (e . g .  . man ) to come into being out of a purely 
these questions which look at the real mysteries of 
life the creation of the world and of persons provide a permanent 
that the meaning of life in the material world can only be 
found outside that world , in its source.

religion  ( especially christianity ) is nothing more than a drug .  . 
some people use drugs as an escape from reality. christians

when you say that man is only an animal , i have to think that you are 
presenting an statement a dogma , if you will. and one 
the requires a kind of faith too. by taking such a hard line in 
your atheism , you may have into a religion of your own. 

but before you write off all christianity as and shallow , i hope 
you 'll do a little research into its history and varieties , perhaps by 
reading paul johnson 's a history of christianity . from your remarks , 
it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian 
religion and not others. even an atheist should have enough faith in 
man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth , and 
be by some values .  .

the too. some of their odd views make a lot more sense in the 
context of the society they lived in. i found it a positive 
view of christianity considering that the author is not a christian 
herself .  . another plus is that each chapter begins with an 
original source quote so that it makes a good starting point for serious 
research .  .

mike walker 

if you are using the standard of fully god and fully human , 
that i'm not sure why you object to saying that jesus was human. i 
think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic 
definition of humanity .  . it 's a consequence of the fall .  . jesus is 
human , but not a fallen human. 

the proper term for what mike expresses is  . this was a 
heresy that was condemned in the council of in ad .  . it 
grew up in reaction to , which held that the son and jesus 
are two different people who happened to be united in the same body 
temporarily .  . is held by the of egypt and 
and by the of syria and the orthodox .  . it believes 
that jesus christ was god  ( which is correct ) , that he was man  ( which is 
correct ) , that he was one person  ( which is correct ) , but that he had 
only one nature and one will and energy  ( which is heretical , the 
orthodox position is that he had two and two and two 
, both divine and human , though the were in perfect 
 . that is what mike is trying to get across , that while jesus 
came in human form , mike says he did not have a human nature or a human 
will. in reality , he had both , though neither made him subject to 
original sin .  . 
it is interesting to note that the were a reaction to this 
conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two but 
not two or two  . it also was condemned , at a late council 
in i believe.

these issues get mighty subtle .  . when you see people saying different 
things it 's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously 
different things , or whether they are using different terminology .  . i 
do n't think there 's any question that there is a problem with 
, and i would agree that the saying christ had a human form 
without a real human nature or will is heretical .  . but i 'd like to be 
a bit wary about the , , etc. recent discussions 
suggest that their position may not be as far from 
as many had thought. was an extreme 
representative of one of the two major schools of thought. more 
moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox , e.g. theodore of 
 . my impression is that the modern groups 
inherit the entire tradition , not just  version , and that 
some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as 
orthodox .  .

hi .  .  .  . i'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame  ( thanx 
in advance ) 

i want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible there 
is this version of the bible i have read about and on the front page it says 
 .  .  .  . contains . data and inconsistencies .  . 

thanx in advance .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 

i'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. 
the primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style 
of the translation. it 's pretty unusual to see significant 
differences in meaning. there are a few differences in the underlying 
text. that 's because before printing , manuscripts were copied by 
hand. slight differences resulted .  . there are enough manuscripts 
around that scholars can do a pretty good job of the 
original , but there are some uncertainties .  . fortunately , they are 
generally at the level of minor differences in wording .  . there are 
something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved , 
but with recent of older manuscripts , i do n't think there 's 
much about those cases. as far as i know , no christians 
believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of 
is free of error. but i also do n't think there 's 
enough uncertainty in establishing the text or it that 
it has much practical effect. 

whether the bible contains data and is a hot 
topic of debate here. many christians deny it. some accept it 
 ( though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details 
that do n't affect the  . but this has nothing to do with there 
being multiple versions. the supposed can be found in 
all the versions. i'm surprised to find a reference to this on the 
title page though. what version are you talking about i 've been 
referring to major scholarly translations .  . these are what get 
referenced in postings here and elsewhere. there have certainly been 
that are  ( to be kind ) less widely accepted. this includes 
everything from reconstructions that parallel accounts into 
single , to that material that the editor 
objects to for some reason or the other. the on the bible 
has long since , so there nothing to stop people from making 
that do whatever thing they want. however the 
that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from 
a variety of , with lots of  . i could imagine 
one of the lesser known claiming to have fixed up all 
data and inconsistencies .  . but if so , it 's not any edition 
that 's widely used. the widely used ones leave the text as is. 
 ( weeeeelllllll , almost as is. it 's been alleged that a few 
translations have a word or two here and there to minimize 
inconsistencies .  . because translation is not an exact science , there 
are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best , 
i'm afraid . ) .

faq and  response deleted 



it 's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the faq .  . i 
think paul 's comments on one day over another  ( rom 14 ) is 
probably all that needs to be said. i accept that is doing 
what he does in honor of the lord .  . i just wish he might equally 
accept that those who all days alike are similarly doing 
their best to honor the lord .  . 

i am myself an sda and i am in total agreement with what has to say. 
i also worship on saturday to honor the lord .  . your mention of 
all days alike imo has to do with the fast days observed by the jews .  . but 
no matter how you interpret that passage , i do accept your worship on sunday 
as being done in honor of the lord , in with what many of my fellow 
sda believers may believe. to me , though , the bible points 
to saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of god 's 
of the israelites from egyptian  . to those who would 
attempt to point out that my of saturday is being , 
this is simply not the case. rather , keeping saturday allows me a full day 
to rest and god 's goodness and  . 


however i 'd like to be clear that i do not think there 's unambiguous 
proof that regular christian worship was on the first day. as i 
indicated , there are responses on both of the passages cited .  . 

similarly with 1 16 2. it says 
that on the first day they should set aside money for paul 's 
collection. now if you want to believe that they gathered 
to do this , or that they did it in their homes , i ca n't disprove it , 
but the obvious time for a to take an offering would be 
when they normally gather for worship , and if they were expected to do 
it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. 

the idea was introduced to me once that the reason paul wanted the 
to aside money for the collection on the first day of the 
week was because that was when they received their weekly wages .  . paul 
wanted them to aside money for the collection as first priority , before 
spending their money on other things. i do not have any proof in front of 
me for this though , although it would explain why they would aside money 
in their homes instead of a meeting. 

so i think the most obvious reading of this is that on the first day 
of every week simply means every time they gather for worship .  . 

i think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements 
is that the nt authors assumed that their readers knew when christian 
worship was. 

it would seem to me that you assume that the christians in the nt regularly 
worshipped on the first day. i assume that the christians in the nt 
regularly worshipped on the seventh day. but i agree with you that we only 
have implications because the authors did assume the reader knew when 
was.

first , i thank collectively all people who have given good answers 
to my questions. in my follow up to jason smith 's posting , i will 
address some issues that have caused misunderstanding 

jason smith wrote 

in article  ( petri pihko ) writes 

i also concede that i was , as i asserted no reasonable 
alternative exists , an entirely subjective statement on my part  ( and one 
that could be , given time and further by the 
 . i also understand that a proving a theory does not necessarily 
that this is how it happened , but a likely description of 
the phenomena in question. am i mistaken with this understanding 

yes , to some degree. there was an excellent discussion in sci . skeptic . 
on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago , i hope it did not 
escape your notice. 

the correct word is  . there is no way to be sure our models and 
theories are absolutely correct. theories are backed up by evidence , 
but not proved no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense. 

however , theories are not mere descriptions or of 
phenomena .  . it is extremely important to test whether theories can 
something new or not yet observed .  . all successful theories 
science has come up with have passed this test , including the big 
bang theory of cosmic evolution , the theory of natural selection etc. 
it does not mean they must be correct , but they are not mere 
 best fits  for the data .  . 

but if you claim that there must be 
an answer to how did the universe  ( our spacetime ) emerge from 
nothing , science has some good for an answer. 

all of which require something we christians readily admit to  . 

well , yes , if you want to believe in them. this is not what science 
requires take a good look at the theory and the evidence , see if 
the theory has made any successful predictions , and use your reason. 
are not punished .  . 

the fact that there are several that none are conclusive .  . 
with out conclusive evidence , we are left with faith. 

this is what me why do we need to have faith in anything 
my fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist someone who is 
unable to believe , ie , fails to entertain any belief in god. 

yes , i know that one ca n't believe without god 's help luther makes 
this quite clear in his letter to  . i'm afraid this does not 
change my situation. 

a couple of deleted. summary we ask why does the 
universe exist 


i think this question should actually be split into two parts , namely 

1 ) why is there existence why anything exists 

and 

2 ) how did the universe emerge from nothing 

 ( deletions ) 

the question why anything exists can be countered by 
demanding answer to a question why there is nothing in , 
or in non existence . actually , both questions turn out to be 
of meaning. things that exist do , and things that do n't exist 
do n't exist. tautology at its best. 

carefully examine the original question , and then the counter question . 
the first asks why , while the second is a request for definition .  . 

no , it is not , although it does look like one. this is a true dichotomy , 
either something exists , or nothing exists. if nothing exists , nobody 
would ask why. if something exists , it is possible to ask why , but 
actually no existing being could give an answer. 

imagine , for a moment , that the in non existence could also 
ask why nothing exists this is equivalent to my counter question , 
why nothing exists in . 

now , why anything exists is equivalent to why something exists in 
. this is what i meant with my tautology , my apologies 
for the poor wording in my previous post. 

i might add , the of things that exist do , and things that 
do n't .  .  . do . n't is as grounded in the realm of the non falsifiable , 
as does the theist 's belief in god. it is based on the assumption 
that there is not a reason for being , something as ultimately 
 ( un)supportable ) as the position of there being a reason. its very 
foundation exists in the same as that of one who claims there is a 
reason. 

i do indeed think there probably is no reason for being , or existence , 
in general , for reasons i stated above. however , they will still 
leave open the question why this , and not that , and this is where 
theistic explanations come in. 

science cannot give reasons for any particular human being 's existence .  . 

we come to this. either i am , therefore i am .  . , or i am for a reason. 

this is a deep philosophical question is determinism true , or not 
also , is god or not i tend to think this question has 
no meaning in his case. 

if i am for a reason , i 've yet failed to see what it would be. 
from our perspective , it looks like  i  exist for truly random 
reasons. i just rolled two dice why did i get 6 and 1 how can 
i believe there is any better reason for my existence 

if the former is a answer , then you are done , for you are 
satisfied , and need not a doctor .  . if the latter , your search is just 
beginning. 

yes , i am satisfied with this reason , until i find something better. 
my 15 years of christianity were of no help in this respect , i have 
to admit , but i am patient .  . 

another answer is that god is the source of all existence .  . 
this sounds much better , but i am tempted to ask does god 
himself exist , then if god is the source of his own existence , 
it can only mean that he has , in terms of human time , always 
existed .  . but this is not the same as the source of all existence .  . 

this does not preclude his existence .  . it only seeks to identify his 
qualities  ( implying he exists to have qualities , btw) .  . 

no , it does n't , but i think an existing god cannot know why he exists , 
for an answer to this question is not  . of course , this 
should not be any to belief in his existence .  . 

i also have discovered science is an tool to answer why . it 
appears that m. pihko agrees  ( as we shall  . but because a tool is 
to answer a question does not preclude the question. asserting 
that  why  is an invalid question does not provide an answer. 

it is impossible to know unknowable things. however , the question 
why do i exist , in particular is not an invalid question this 
is not what i said. but from our perspective , it is impossible to 
tell , and i ca n't just believe in any given explanation instead of 
another , especially since i found i was myself. 

my apologies .  . i was using why as why did this come to be . why did 
pre existence become existence .  . why did pre become  . 

i think pre existence is an oxymoron .  . there is no time  outside  of 
this  ( except in some other universe ) , and from that 
perspective , our universe never was. it exists only for those who 
are inside it. 

but we come to the admission that science fails to answer why . because 
it ca n't be answered in the realm of modern science , does that make the 
question invalid 

no. the validity of the question has to be discussed i think 
philosophy is of great help here. what can be known , and what is not 


m. pihko does present a good point though. we may need to ask what do i 
as an individual christian base my faith on will it be by the 
of evidence that our sacred or will we seek to 
understand if a new truly disagrees with what god said  ( and 
continues to say ) in his word 

this is a very good question. in trying to answer this , and numerous 
other questions that bothered me , i finally found nothing to base 
my faith on. 

i think it would be honest if we all asked ourselves , why do i believe 
or why i do n't believe .

lines 

note i am cross posting  ( actually , emailing ) this to 
bit . catholic . while main posting goes to 
soc . religion . christian .  . 

quotations  . this is in response to a question about 
the conception .  . i explained it , but left justification 
up to our catholic readers .  . 

there is no direct reference in the holy scripture except for the 
mention of mary 's full of in the by 
angel in luke 1 26 28 

and in the month the angel was sent from god unto 
a city of , named nazareth .  . to a virgin to a 
man whose name was joseph , of the house of david and the virgin 's 
name was mary .  . and the angel came unto her and said , , 
thou that art highly favoured , the lord is with thee 
art thou among women. 

now , now , hold that line of thought the lord is with mary 
art thou among women while you read on .  .  .  .  . 

in the book , first of the world , a popular history of 
devotion to mary by peter 

the conception matter is really far more complicated 
than the assumption . this in 430 ad .  . it is quite possible 
that the of mary 's conception under the title the conception 
of saint anne , originally the physical miracle of 
a woman beyond the age of child bearing , a daughter , 
just as had conceived john the baptist .  . a in 
emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in anne to the miracle 
of wrought by god in the soul of mary was logical . mary 
is the out of which was the 
of christ 's sinless body she is god 's , in whom there is 
no tree of knowledge , and no that  . her perfect 
beauty and find their in christ , her 
in that of the father .  . at the time of the council of , 
she was as innocent , without , , inviolate , 
, holy in soul and body , who was as a from 
among , in the evil ways of eve . 
... 
at the end of the century , an irish , 
john  ( 1266 1308 ) ,  .  .  . god . that it was a 
greater thing for him to preserve his  ( the son ) mother from all 
sin than to use his power to her from it later . 
... 

now let 's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin .  . 
from catholic by john a. 

baptism 
remains after baptism .  . 
or the tendency to sin remains in the 
but since it is left to provide trial , it has no power to 
those who do not consent and who by the of 
christ jesus , resist  ( canon  . 

original of adam and eve before their fall 
in the light of the foregoing , we see that our first 
parents were originally three times over 
they had the natural of human beings especially the 
power to think and to choose freely .  . 
the had the of bodily immortality 
and of , or the internal power to control desires .  . 
they had the supernatural of , 
the virtues of faith , hope , and charity and the 
title to enter heaven. 
by their , they lost the supernatural and 
entirely , and were  ( without 
losing ) their natural capacity to reason and to choose 
freely .  . 

baptism the supernatural life lost by adam 's 
sin .  . it does not the 
but as a title to a of our 
bodies on the last day .  .  .  . 

going back to conception 
(i am not sure if this interpretation is in any other 
books but it may be another to the 'puzzle' ) 

given the miracle of st. anne bearing a child at a 
non age , and christ was not yet born 
and there was no baptism yet on mary 's birth but 
still , the angel 's was 
mary , full of , the lord is with you. 
art thou amongst women . 

even mary was confused about this  . 

mary could very well have all of the 
original above given to our first 
parents  ( adam and eve before their sin ) 
mary  ( example of praise given by the angel gabriel ) 
full of  ( natural , , supernatural ) 
the lord is with you  ( at those times , god would 
definitely want to be with those he 
has made ) 
art thou amongst women  ( that says it all ) 

at the conception , god made mary full of 
and as the   for the coming body 
of christ and so , 

conception of mary is true and mary still 
has her heart .  .

light and facts on this matter. thanks . ) .

... 

are all truths also absolutes 
is all of scripture truths  ( and therefore absolutes ) 

if the answer to either of these questions is no , then perhaps you can 
explain to me how you determine which parts of scripture are truths , and 
which truths are absolutes .  . 

the answer to both questions is yes. 

perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then. to me , 
an absolute is something that is constant across time , culture , 
situations , etc. true in every instance possible. do you agree 
with this definition i think you do 

similarly , all truth is absolute .  . indeed , a non absolute truth is a 
contradiction in terms. when is something absolute when it is always 
true. obviously , if a truth is not always true then we have a 
contradiction in terms. 

a simple example 

in the new testament  ( sorry i do n't have a bible at work , and ca n't 
provide a reference ) , women are instructed to be silent and cover 
their heads in church. now , this is scripture .  . by your definition , 
this is truth and therefore absolute .  . 

do women in your church speak do they cover their heads if all 
scripture is absolute truth , it seems to me that women speaking in and 
coming to church with bare heads should be to  . 
yet , clearly , women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare 
heads .  .  ( at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew 
up in . ) . 

are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture 
to be absolute truth.  ( and there are plenty of other examples . ) . 
can you reconcile this 

many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world. such a 
statement is terribly self contradictory .  . let me put it to you this 
way. if there are no absolutes , should n't we conclude that the statement , 
there are no absolutes is not absolutely true obviously , we have a 
contradiction here. 

i do n't claim that there are no absolutes .  . i think there are very 
few , though , and determining absolutes is difficult. 

this is just one of the reasons why christians the world by claiming 
that there are indeed absolutes in the universe. 

there is hardly consensus , even in evangelical 
christianity  ( not to mention the rest of christianity ) regarding 
biblical interpretation .  . 

so people sometimes disagree about what is true. this does not 
the fact , however , that there are still absolutes in the universe. 

but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute .  . how can you 
determine absolutes derived from scripture when you ca n't agree how 
to interpret the scripture 

it 's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based 
on your own interpretation is absolute .  . do you deny that your own 
background , education , , etc. come into play when you read the 
bible , and determine how to interpret a do you deny that 
you in fact interpret

jurisdiction .  . however , standard catholic textbooks of theology make it

intrinsically 

the principal argument used by those claiming that  . is in 
is that the of a without a papal is 
an intrinsically act. a who carries out such a 
, it is claimed , becomes facto a  . this is 
not true. if such a is an intrinsically act it 
would always have involved the penalty of  . in the 
code of law the was punished only by  ( see 
of the  . pope had raised the penalty to 
as a response to the of a 
church in china .  . the of these illicit chinese

that is , to deny that he has the right to the church , and the 
chinese were given a to exercise 
an mission .  . neither nor any of the

jurisdiction .  . they have been solely for the purpose of 
the survival of the society by carrying out and 
also to perform  . i do not wish to minimize in any way 
the gravity of the step take by  .  . the of 
without a papal is far more serious matter than the 
of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the 
or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the roman 
 . but the could argue that the crisis the 
church could not be more grave , and that grave measures were needed in 
response. 

it appears to be taken for granted by most of the 's 
that he was excommunicated for the offense of , and the vatican 
has certainly been guilty of this impression .  . there is not 
so much as a of truth in this  . the new code of 
law includes a section beginning with entitled 
penalties for specific offenses  ( de in  . the 
first part deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the 
church  ( de et  . 
deals with the offense of which is , evidently , together 
with apostasy and heresy , one of the three fundamental offenses 
against the unity of the church. 

but the was not excommunicated under the terms of this 
or , indeed , under any involving an offense against 
religion or the unity of the church. the cited in his 
comes from the third section of penalties for 
specific offenses which is entitled of 
functions and offenses in their exercise  ( de

, which reads a who someone and 
the person who such a from a without a 
an automatic  ( latae sententiae )

the attempts to smear with the offense 
of are , then , contrary to both truth and charity .  . a comparable 
smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly 
justify legal action for libel involving massive  . an accurate 
parallel would be to state that a man convicted of had 
been convicted of first degree murder .  . 

i must that what i have written here is not the dubious opinion 
of in the of law. lawyers 
without the least of sympathy for  . have 
the charge of made against him as totally  . father 
patrick , dean of the of law of the

excommunicated for but for the of an ecclesiastical 
function. he added that it is not the of a which 
constitutes but the of an mission upon the

the which proves the intention of establishing a 
parallel church. 

, president of the for the 
authentic interpretation of law , commented on the 
in the 10 1988 issue of la  . it would be hard to 
imagine a more authoritative opinion. the wrote 

the act of a  ( without a papal mandate ) is not 
in itself a act. in fact , the code that deals with 
offenses is divided into two sections .  . one deals with offenses 
against religion and the unity of the church , and these are 
apostasy , , and heresy .  . a with a 
is , on the contrary , an offense against the 
exercise of a specific ministry .  . for example , in the case of the 
carried out by the 
in and , although the was excommunicated 
he was not considered to have committed a act because 
there was no intention of a with the church. 

.... 

it is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in 
without a papal had the least 
intent of establishing a church. he is not a and 
will never be a  . the considers correctly that 
the the church is its worst crisis since the heresy , 
and that for the good of the church it was necessary for him to 
the four to ensure the future of his society. 
law provides for just such a situation , and even if one believes that 
the future of the society could have been guaranteed without these 
, the fact that the believed sincerely that it 
could not means , as law states clearly , that he has not incurred

as to the faith with it cannot 
expect catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a 
great and orthodox whose entire life has been devoted to

appears more with grave roman  ( and , unfortunately , also 
papal ) than with  . and from the 
eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to 
present the 's act of grave as an offense 
against the faith ! it is said today that  . has an 
erroneous concept of tradition .  . if this were so , 
could not , on behalf of the pope , have addressed to the 
the following words in his letter of 28 1987 
your ardent desire to tradition by for it 
 the means to live and  to your to 
the faith of all time .  .  .  . the holy father your concern 
and shares it.

engage in a bit more conversation with joel before 
someone who does n't expect it with cards. 

i 'd suggest that more than some are in order. without knowing 
anything about the situation , it is impossible to the 
of writing. some folks will check , others with more

imho , requests of this nature should be made only for oneself or for someone

some people suffer such emotional , physical , and mental 
in their lives that their deaths seem to be  . but at least 
the pain does end in death. what if you lived a hundred such lives , 
at the conclusion of one you were into another 
what if you lived a million , a billion years in this state 
what if this kept going forever 


did this happen to jesus i do n't think so , not from what i heard. he lived 
one day of suffering and died. if the wages of sin is the above paragraph , then 
jesus t pay for our sins , did he 

i 'd be surprised to see the let this one through , but i seriously

replies to a question on the of translations of the bible , 

as far as i know , no christians 
believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of 
is free of error. 

unfortunately , this is n't true. on another news group earlier this year , 
someone posted that the king james bible was the divinely inspired version 
of the bible in english and was , therefore , inerrant all other english 
translations were from satan , trying to the body of christ .  . a 
few years ago , the of a church i was showed me a poster

very on the poster was the fact that the man used only the kjv .  .

in article  ( petri pihko ) writes 

this is not true. science is a collection of models telling us how , 
not why , something happens. i cannot see any good reason why the why 
questions would be bound only to natural things , assuming that the 
supernatural domain exists. if supernatural beings exist , it is 
as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist. 

i beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models .  . 
scientific models are a game to play , and are only as good as the 
assumptions and measurements  ( if any) that go into them. 

as an example , i remember when nuclear was the big in 
science. it was n't long after 's that 
one of our was adding another level of reality into his model of 
the nuclear scenario at in boulder .  . he decided to assume 
that the atmosphere is more like a two dimensional thing , than a one 
dimensional thing. he also assumed that it and that the 
blow in the real atmosphere .  . on returning to tech , he showed 
a of according to the year they 
were generated by the models .  . there was an unmistakable correlation 
between the age  ( meaning of assumptions i.e. , 
from reality ) of each model and the degree of  . whereas 's 
model showed an approximate 40 degree , the next model 
in showed about half that , and so on until we got to 
our boy 's model , which showed a 1 2 degree drop if the war happened in 
the and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer .  . 
he predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans , chemistry , 
the biosphere , and other of reality in the models , we would 
probably see even less  . thus nuclear was reduced to even 
less than a nuclear , one might say , to a nuclear  . 

to quote from h . s .  . yoder , 

the models have become accepted as the reality 
instead of the of assumptions they are. 
the field , and a very critical 
analysis of each argument is to be encouraged .  .  .  .  . skepticism 
of the model approach to earth problems is because 
many key have not been included. 

this statement surely applies equally well to  . only when 
convincing evidence the modeled results 
may one suggest that the model may describe the reality. just thought 
i 'd clear that up before things really got out of hand.

they believe the danger is real , but others may not. 

does that mean that the first group are necessarily arrogant in warning 
others of the danger does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs 
are correct , and all others are false 

some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance , and behave in an 
arrogant manner , but that is a personal  . it does not 
necessarily mean that they are all arrogant .  . 

no the members of the first group are not necessarily 
arrogant .  . but when i ask them if they are absolutely certain

despite my trendy , liberal , and the fact 
that i basically agree with what you are saying i will rebut 

 ( dr nancy 's sweetie ) writes 
 ( chris mussack ) writes 
for all those people who insist i question authority why 
... 
authorities sometimes tell people to do evil things. people who just 
follow orders have tortured and killed others in very large numbers , 
and their innocence afterwards. 

the basic question here is how do i know what i am supposed to do 
this is true in every situation that comes up. some people do not 
think about it at all and merely follow their  . i claim 
that is just as dangerous as following authority . i could site 
diseases , drug abuse , all manner of criminal 
activity , the savings and loan , car accidents , eggs thrown 
at my house , all are examples of people not following authority . 
i could easily argue that in the evil examples you gave the 
problem was a leader not following his authority and doing what 
he wanted .  . of course , where is the top of the lies 
our search .  . 

when your authority starts telling you to do things , you should ask 
questions. except for situations of need ( i said shut the 
because the is filling with water ! ) , any reasonable 
authority should be able to give at least some justification that you 
can understand. 

i do n't think it 's as simple as you are claiming .  . need is 
ambiguous .  . should i or not 

realize that i have four kids who , despite being very 
of course , are very tiring with their constant lack of understanding 
the knowledge i wish to impart to them. 

just be sure to listen when authority answers. 

! an ironic ending .  . 

the irony i was implying in my initial retort to the bumper 
question authority was that i was questioning 
the authority of the person telling me to question authority .  . 
it seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning 
only in being different , only in rebelling , everything 
for the sake of freedom .  . i question their and  . 
there is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly. 
different people are at different levels of development in different 
areas .  . part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities 
to follow , we ca n't know everything about everything. often 
when learning a new or subject i will follow the teacher , 
perhaps blindly .  . only when i have learned enough to ask appropriate 
questions should i question him , only when i have developed 
my enough should i challenge him. once again , how do i know 
when i get to those stages 

if you have to be told to question authority , perhaps you should n't .  .

this is why the most effective 
substance abuse programs involve meeting peoples  spiritual 
needs. 

you might want to provide some evidence next time you make a claim 
like this. 

in 12 step programs  ( like anonymous ) , one of the steps 
involves a higher power . aa and other 12 step abuse 
programs are acknowledged as being among the most effective. 

and so on 

i seem to have been rather  . 

what i was asking is this 

please show me that the most effective substance 
programs involve peoples  spiritual needs , rather than 
merely attempting to fill peoples  spiritual needs as 
by the people , a.a , s . r . c .  . , or  . this will probably 
involve defining needs  ( is it not that clear ) and 
showing that such things exist and how they can be filled .  . 

you might take is to say that fulfilling spiritual 
needs means a higher power of some sort , then 
show that systems that do require this , work better than otherwise 
identical systems that do not. a correlation here would help you , 
but as you point out this might just be demonstrating 
one crutch for  .  ( however , i do feel that religion is 
usually a better crutch than , as it is not usually 
! ) ) 

i hope with that clarification , my question will be  . i actually 
did know about the 12 step program , its the question of what it does , 
rather than what it tries to do , that makes a difference to me.
