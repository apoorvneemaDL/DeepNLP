is there a utility out there that will let me use filenames longer than
the standard 8.3 format.

yep , it 's called os2 !

yep , you can use any type of unix , or maybe vms , or buy a mac or something...
if you want longer filenames for your documents , i heard of a wordprocessor for
windows which let you assign long names to files. those long filenames could only be
seen from that programs open save dialogs though... maybe someone knows more about
this wordprocessor than i do \?


if i rember correctly , lotus notes gives u this possiblity , among other things...

i 've had the same problem with a maxtor 7213a. turned off

norton speed disk (nu 4.5) , up to 8 times , requesting ndd to be
run when attempting to defrag drive. at some peoples' suggestion
i reformatted my drive and reloaded dos 5.0 , win 3.1 from
scratch. a few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1
beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem , so i tried this
drastic solution. when the problem reoccurred , i did n't have the
brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.

i get arround the annoyance by copying my .grp files to .gro.
when i get the message , i run file manager and copy the
offeniding group files from .gro ove rthe .grp. then i quit
and restart windows(if the group is an often used important one.)

this really sucks. but i'm pretty sure that the problem is the
drive (especially with the nsd problem). i will be going with
out over 66 of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks , while
the guy i bought the disk and system from , goes over it and
either fixes it or replaces the drive. i ca n't wait to have a
system that will run consistently with all hte goodies !

on all 1.44mb drives (both mac and pc) , the disk spins at a constant
rpm. on 800k mac disk drives , the spin rate of the disk is varied so
that the tracks pass under the head at a constant speed a slower rotation
for the outer tracks , and a faster rotation for the inner tracks. a pc
needs special controller hardware to make this happen.

begin slip.txt
based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows , here
are my comments on setting up slip in this environment. i thank the
trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments.


configuring your modem

a) turn off dtr (at d0 w)
i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use
to dial my slip server (qmodem) drops dtr when i exit the program
and therefore hangs up the line. if you use a program like kermit
or conex to establish the slip connection , then this need not be done.
these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit.

note if you use univ. of minn. phone to dial and establish a
slip connection , you do not need to turn off dtr.

b) dial and establish the slip connection first. this can be done
automatically if you use a program like phone (from the university of
minnesota) which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the
slip packet driver. the phone scripting language is simple and
phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with
other slip server. in addition , while the only packet driver
that phone works with is umslip (currently) , it is easy to write a
batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers.
there is a section on phone in the document with both script and
batch file examples.


configuring the slip drivers

there are five slip packet drivers commonly available
cslipper.exe peter tattam 's compressed slip driver
slipper.exe peter tattam 's slip driver
slip8250.com crynwr driver (i like phil burn 's modified driver)
ethersl.com crynwr driver (ethernet simulation over slip)
umslip.com univ. of minnesota driver (based on slip8250)

of these four , i vastly prefer c slipper.exe over slip8250.com or
ethersl.com for the following reasons

a) it is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 uart
b) while using etherslip slip8250 umslip , myself and several others
have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a
long ftp transfer.
c) it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode
d) when used in ethernet simulation mode c slipper seem to work with
every tcp ip application that i have tested it with.

instructions for c slipper.exe (and you do not use phone)
a) load slipper in your autoexec.bat file according to instructions
for instance if you have a v.32bis modem on com1
slipper com1 vec 62 baud 57600
b) if you use dos tcp ip applications in win 3.1 dos boxes , then use the
double ended packet driver shim winpkt.com this creates a virtual
packet driver at 0x60. dos applications in native mode , dos
applications in windows 3.1 dos boxes and windows applications can all
use this virtual driver at 0x60.
winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
c) if you use qvt net , load pktint.com next. qvt net is configured in
qvtnet.ini to use the interrupt at 0x60.
pktint.com

instructions for slip8250.com
a) try getting a version 10 slip driver. philip burns of northwestern
university has a modified slip8250.com driver that is better at hardware
handshaking. this driver is distributed along with nupop.
b) load the driver after establishing the slip connection. my modem is a
v.32bis modem on com1 , so here is how i would load the driver.
slip8250 w 0x62 h 4 slip 0x03f8 57600
c) as discussed above if you use dos tcp ip applications in windows 3.x
dos boxes , you probably want to use winpkt.com
winpkt.com 0x60 0x62
d) if you use winqvt net , load pktint.com
pktint.com

instructions for ethersl.com
if you choose to use ethersl.com instead of slip8250.com , the
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. you
will have to delete the line device vcd from the 386enh section
of system.ini. this will interfere with running regular windows comm
applications (such as crosstalk) , and you will get lots of dropped
characters etc. in these applications. this is therefore not
recommended. etherslip would be loaded as
ethersl w 0x62 h 4 0x03f8 57600

configuring windows 3.1

a) make the following modifications to the system.ini file 386enh
section.
i) list all your com ports , with their addresses and interrupts.
com1base 03f8
com1irq 4
com2base 02f8
com2irq 3
com3base 03e8
com3irq 5
this can also be done from within windows control panel ,
but double clicking on the ports icon.
ii) give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer
com1buffer 10000
iii) change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish
to use for your modem to zero. this is the amount of time that
windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to
another application. if you use winqvt net and then want to switch
from one session to another , and this value is at the default value
of 2 seconds , you are will get a gpf and windows will crash.
com1autoassign 0
this can also be done from within windows control panel.
double click on 386 enhanced , and under device contention , set
the device contention for the com port your modem is on to
never warn

additional notes

what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each
slip session \?

i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user
a permanent ip address , so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet.ini
each time that i establish a slip connection.

if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in ,
please try to use bootp aware software , and let bootp do the
configuration for you. however , qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp
will not work over a slip connection. to get qvtnet working in a
situation such as this , you must do the following

edit the qvtnet.ini file. let the net section look like this

net
name
ip
netmask 255.255.255.0 (or whatever is appropriate for you)
arptime 20
packet vector 60 (or whatever is appropriate)

save the changes , and then write protect this file
attrib r qvtnet.ini

start your slip connection , and remember the name and ip address
that you are assigned. each time you start qvt net 3.1x , the
general configuration dialog box will open. enter the name and
ip address and you were assigned for that session , click on ok ,
and you should be up and running. the changes you make will not
be saved , as qvtnet.ini is write protected.

a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address
assignment is provided by victor menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)
victor uses the program bootpq to semi automate qvtnet preparation.
bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip , which is then saved to a
file called myip . another file noip is essentially a complete
qvtnet.ini file that lacks the ip address. in the final step myip
and noip are copied into a single qvtnet.ini file. an example of
victor 's batch file is provided below

slipper com2
pktint.com
bootpq i ip s myip
bootpq i my ip is s
copy q net myip noip e com qvtnet qvtnet.ini
del q myip
@echo off
echo .
echo ready to run winqvtnet

for questions and more details about bootpq , please contact victor
menayang (victor@ccwf.cc.utexas.edu)

qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvt net.

how do you use pktmux over slip \?

pktmux will not work over the slip8250.com packet driver , and crashes
immediately if used with ethersl.com

pktmux will work with c slipper.exe , when c slipper is used in ethernet
simulation mode. an example of this configuration is shown below

the latest release of pktmux is 1.2c and it is important that you
use this version , if you want to use virtual packet drivers with
applications like trumpet for windows (to be released very shortly).

from autoexec.bat

lh c slipper com1 vec 65 baud 57600 ether (packet driver)
lh pktmux 5 65 5 (pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers)
lh pktdrv 7f 65 (first virtual packet driver used for qvt net)
lh pktint.com (qvt net pktint.com)
pktdrv 63 65 (pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet)

additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within
windows 3.1 dos boxes. for example , my pif file to load popmail is
directed to the file popmail.bat . this is what popmail.bat reads
like

pktdrv 60 65 loads a virtual packet driver at 0x60
cd popmail
popmail
cd
pktdrv 60 u unloads the packet driver at 0x60
exit causes the dos window to close

i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp ip applications
like pc gopher. it is my experience that pktmux works fine
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos
sessions , are loaded at the same software interrupt. for example
within two different dos boxes one for popmail and the other for
gopher , the virtual packet driver (pktdrv) is loaded at 0x60 in each
instance.

how much does pktmux degrade the performance of c slipper \?

i have a v.32bis v.42bis modem in a 386 33 running windows 3.1 with
a reasonably fast video card (ati graphics ultra). under these
conditions , when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and
being used as follows
a) driver at 0x7f qvtnet ftp client session
b) driver at 0x60 in one dos window cutcp tn3270 session
c) driver at 0x60 in another dos window trumpet for dos

i get ftp transfer rates of 0.8 1.0 kb sec while transferring
compressed files. this rate is comparable to that which i get with
slip8250 loaded as a packet driver , and where a single tcp ip session
is active. if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session
is active , i get transfer rates of 1.3 1.4 kb sec on the same
files.

while there is about 40 degradation in the performance of slipper ,
for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the
performance hit.

c slipper and ethernet simulation mode

in ethernet simulation mode , c slipper ver 1.3 works with all the
applications that i have tested it with. one or two applications
that required ethernet simulation balked at c slipper 1.2 , but even
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3

when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode , and used with pktmux ,
i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads
ip incorrect packet type or ip bad version number . this does not
seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning , although i cannot comment on
loss of performance.

what can you do if your dos tcp ip application does not work with
c slipper in ethernet simulation mode \?

in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with
c slipper in ethernet simulation mode , first contact the author
peter tattam peter@psychnet.psychol.utas.edu.au , and let him
know. chances are that he can fix it.

in the meanwhile , you can try the following. i do not know if it is
kosher , but it worked when i had problems with c slipper ver 1.2

(c slipper is loaded at 0x62 as described above under the pktmux section)

i load ethersl.com at 0x60 , run the application and then terminate
ethersl.com

this also works within windows 3.1 virtual dos boxes. however a
packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box
at a time.

so for example , here is my batch file to run grateful med (a
medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library
of medicine).

ethersl w 0x60 h 4 0x03f8 57600 loads etherslip
cd gm6
search
cd
termin 0x60 terminates etherslip
exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows

if you use this method , be cautious about one thing do n't have
any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time. after closing
the ethersl window , you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no
problem. btw , the example above grateful med , works with no
problems with c slipper ver 1.3

phone script files

the documentation that accompany phone , provide good instructions on
writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than
the university of minnesota server. for example here is a script
that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend.

background to start a slip connection , i dial our terminal server ,
and login with a username and password. after doing so , i start a slip
session with the following command slip username slip.dialin.cwru.edu ,
followed by my password again.

here then is the relevant portion of the phone.cmd script file

how to use packet drivers other than umslip with phone \?

the quick answer there is no clean way. below is a batch file
hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers. in this
example , the packet driver is peter tattam 's cslipper. to use a
batch file like this , you must know the parameters with which you
plan to use the packet driver i.e interrupt vector , baud rate ,
port address , and irq. this batch file requires umslip.com ,
cslipper.exe , and termin.com to be in the same directory
or in your path ...

all that the batch file does is to let you dial the slip connection
using phone , load the appropriate packet driver , hangup the
connection , and unload the driver when you are done ...

lots of stuff deleted because i felt like it

this ms bashing has definitely lost all its humor value.

i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of ms products do not even know about internet , and unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. and the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. while pc users tend to
customize any windowing setup , they can not do much with their
command line.

so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize
quality. ms has made their life easier , and more productive and to them
that is quality. they do not care about what innovative things ms has
done , other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. you may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to
all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. we here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

after hearing endless debate (read name calling) over which os is better , dos
and windows or os 2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
of different operating systems , i have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test , as so many fellow newsposters have suggested. i have ,
however , no desire whatsoever to use a version of os 2 which wont really
do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) os 2 2.0 2.1 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but
os 2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to. i have heard
that os 2 2.2 beta is available via ftp , and i was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information , as i would like ,
once and for all , to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

i do n't think the question is
will os 2 x.x run windows y.y apps now \?

a more important question is
will subsequent os 2 versions continue to run apps
from subsequent windows versions in the future \?

can it keep up \? will a future os 2 3.0 run windows 4 apps \?
ole2 is very complex and is the sign of things to come.
after this fall , i believe ibm no longer has any rights to

guide to creation of dib images

copyright march 15 , 1991



abstract

the format of images created for use by ms windows 3.0 3.1
applications is documented in the ms windows programmer 's
reference guide. this guide is intended as a clearify some
wording of the specifications , and to put forth a
recommendation among the various alternatives.

please send updates corrections suggestions and revisions to
me. please thank me for writing this on my own time by
keeping my name with the document. thank you for your
respect.

this document copyright , 1991 , by thomas b. kinsman.
if desired , a postscript version of this document is
available.

this information is free. you get more than what you pay for.
do n't sue me if i'm wrong.


overview

the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent bitmap
file format. (what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to
me.) four pixel resolutions are supported 1 bit , 4 bit , 8 bit , and 24 bit
pixels.

these images were intended for use on dos (ibm , or little endian) systems.
if you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte
swap all short and long integer values.

by convention , dib images end in the extension .bmp . this is because



march 15 , 1991

they are a super set of earlier bitmap image files . consequently you
will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files.

since dib images files are a super set , there are three flavors of dib
images
o dos dib images. these are the recommended convention , and the
form which i will describe how to create. they are intended for
applications running under ms windows 3.0 in a dos environment.
o os 2 dib images. my understanding is that these are the flavor
of dib images that were used by the presentation manager.
o old style bitmap images.

differences between flavors

the dos dib images consist of
1. a bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a
dib file. this header also gives the total size of the image
file , and the offset to the image data.
2. a bitmapinfoheader image header which specifies the image
attributes.
3. an optional palette of colors used by the image. if it exists ,
this may contain 2 , 16 , or 256 entries. each entry is a windows
rgbquad structure.
4. the image data itself.


the os 2 dib images consist of
1. the same bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file
as a dib file. this header also gives the total size of the
image file , and the offset to the image data.
2. a bitmapcoreheader image header which specifies the image
attributes.
3. an optional palette of colors used by the image. again , if this
exists it may contain 2 , 16 , or 256 entries. each entry is a
windows rgbtriple structure.
4. the image data itself.


the old style image bitmap consists of
1. either a bitmapinfoheader or a bitmapcoreheader. which header
type is determined by the first long integer (dword) value.
2. an optional color palette. this palette may be composed of
either windows rgbquad structures (if the header was a
bitmapinfoheader) or windows rgbtriple structures (if the header
was a bitmapcoreheader).
3. the image data itself.


creating dib image files.

creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forward steps.
the headers need to be created and then written to the file. these header
structures are defined in the ms windows 3.0 windows.h include file.
palette information needs to be stored for images that are not 24 bit
images. the five general steps are
1. filling in the bitmapfileheader and the bitmapinfoheader
structures the basic image information.
2. if the image is a 1 bit , 4 bit , or an 8 bit image , creating the
color palette of rgbquads.
3. calculating the total file size and putting this information in



march 15 , 1991





4


the bfsize field of the bitmapfileheader.
4. calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the
file , and putting this in the bfoffbits field of the
bitmapfileheader.
5. writing to the file the bitmapfileheader , the bitmapinfoheader ,
the color palette , and the image data (in that order).

the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft c type
defined keywords. the following table describes these keywords for those
not familiar with microsoft c.

the bitmapfileheader

this structure is defined in windows.h as
typedef struct tagbitmapfileheader
word bftype
dword bfsize
word bfreserved1
word bfreserved2
dword bfoffbits
bitmapfileheader

the bftype field is the two ascii characters 'b' and 'm'. this serves
to identify the file as a dib image file. on an intel byte ordered
machine (ibm or a compatible) , this constant can be formed in c as the
quantity ('m' 8 'b') 0x4d42 on an intel system.

the bfsize field is the total size of the file. for our purposes this
field is equal to the size of the bitmapfileheader , plus the size of the
bitmapinfoheader , plus the number of entries in the color palette times
the size of a rgbquad , plus the number of bytes of image data. if the
image data is being written out in an uncompressed form , this value can be
calculated ahead of time. otherwise , this field needs to be filled in
later.

both the bfreserved1 and the bfreserved2 fields are always set to
zero.

the bfoffbits field is set to the offset to the start of the image data
from the start of the file. for our purposes , this field should be set
to the size of the bitmapfileheader , plus the size of the
bitmapinfoheader , plus the number of entries in the color palette times
the size of a rgbquad. this works out because the image data is written
write after the color palette if one exists.


















march 15 , 1991

the bitmapinfoheader

this structure is defined in windows.h as
typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader
dword bisize
dword biwidth
dword biheight
word biplanes
word bibitcount
dword bicompression
dword bisizeimage
dword bixpelspermeter
dword biypelspermeter
dword biclrused
dword biclrimportant
bitmapinfoheader

the bisize field is set to the size of the bitmapinfoheader structure
itself. when reading the image file , this value is what is used to
determine that the image contains a bitmapinfoheader and not a
bitmapcoreheader.

the biwidth field is the width of the image in image pixels.

the biheight field is the height of the image in image lines.

the biplanes field should always be set to 1. this data is written out
as if there was one color plane.

the bibitcount field is the bit depth of the image. this must be either
1 , 4 , 8 , or 24 , depending on the bit depth of the image data.

the bicompression field tells how the image data is compressed if it is
compressed. dib images support two forms of run length encoding.
however , i have never seen any images which use it , and do n't know yet how
it works. set this field to zero (long zero , or 0l) , to indicate that the
data is not compressed.

all subsequent fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure may be set to
zero. a requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to
compute these fields as necessary from the previous information.

the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be biclrused .
for 4 bit and 8 bit images this field indicates that not all of the
possible color entries are used and that the image contains biclrused
colors. if you are using only 32 colors with an 8 bit image , then you may
only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries. generally , set
this field to zero.



march 15 , 1991

color palettes

each entry of a color palette is a rgbquad structure. the rgbquad
structure is defined in the windows.h include file as
typedef struct tagrgbquad
byte rgbblue
byte rgbgreen
byte rgbred
byte rgbreserved
rgbquad
the rgbreserved field is always zero. for each color used , the amount
of blue , green , and red are filled into the structure and the structure is
written to the file. a value of zero in the rgbblue , rgbgreen , or
rgbred fields indicates that that particular component does not
contribute to the color composition. a value of 255 in any of these
fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color
composition.



image data

there are three surprises about the ordering of image data in dib image
file. the creator of this format was determined to be creative , and
certainly was.

within the image data , each line written out is padded to the next four
byte quantity. so , if you had an 8 bit image which was only one pixel
wide , you still have to write out four bytes for every image line. the
number of bytes per line can be calculated as

bytes per line (width in pix bit depth 31 ) 32 4

or , in terms of the fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure

bytes per line (biwidth bibitcount 31 ) 32 4


when writing out your image data , you must write it out bottom line first.
the bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the
first line of image data in the file.

for 1 bit , 4 bit , and 8 bit images , information is written as you would
expect. one bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte. four bit
images are padded two pixels to a byte. eight bit images are written one
pixel per byte. twenty four bit images are written three bytes per pixel.
however , for 24 bit images the information must be written out in the
order blue , green , red. while most image file formats write data out in



march 15 , 1991

an rgb ordering , a dib image file writes the data out in an bgr
ordering.

summary

this should provide enough information to create dib images from
applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines. if you
find out any more about dib images , please pass the information on to me
so that i can modify this document accordingly.

by night i'm an amiga user. by day i work with windows. i 'd be much more
comfortable in windows if i had two things.

1. a good personal information manager. you know a calendar , address book ,
reminder list etc... rolled into one clean interface.

i prefer infoselect myself , but it is a strange kind of pim.

2. a good file manager. microsofts is very poor by my standards. how
about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations
between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface
would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. those
who are familiar with directory opus on the amiga know what i'm
looking for.


well , a few things might help you like the 3.1 file manager better.

1) to get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon.
that it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy. you
can drag files between windows , to any icon on the tree on the left
side of the window , and to any drive icon. this beats your left
and right window as you can have as many open as you wish instead
of just two.

2) you can launch any app from within file manager by double clicking
on the executable 's icon.

3) you can launch any application and open a document file by double
clicking on the document file 's icon , provided you have
associations set correctly. this is easily done with the menus. the
browse capability adds a lot of functionality to 3.1. so if you
name all your text files with .txt and point all gif , tiff , etc.
files towards paintshop or wingif , this takes care of your
requirement for text reading and graphics viewing .

i know someone who prefers using file manager as his shell. setting up
all the associations you need is the way to do it.

if directory opus is half as good as file manager then it must be
pretty good indeed ! file manager just needs you to understand how
some things are done.

in the manual , it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of
extended memory. since i have the noems option , it seems to me that the
emm386 device is useless in my case.

should i use emm386 or should i remove it from my config.sys \?

thanks for your help ,

emm386 noems enables the system to use the upper memory between 640 and

here is the latest on relocating your help files to a server.
the winhelp() function , as i am told by ms , does search your path so
relocating ms windows helpfiles wo n't be a problem as long as you include
the path to where you move them to , however , if an application has
hardcoded the path into their code so that when winhelp is invoked it
searches the given path (i.e. winhelp(hwnd , c amipro) for example) then
winhelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory
where you have installed your software.

i tested this out on a variety of software packages. i moved all my
helpfiles to the drive z and included this in the path statement.
here is the results for different software packages


norton desktop found helpfiles
windows v3.1 for workgroups found helpfiles
windows v3.1 found helpfiles
ms powerpoint v3.0 found helpfiles
ms word found helpfiles
ms excel v4.0a did not find helpfiles (strange)
ms foxpro v2.5 for windows found helpfiles
lotus amipro v3.0 did not find helpfiles
procomm plus for windows did not find helpfiles


i guess this is better than nothing but it would make sense to be able to
specify a global path for helpfiles.

if anyone has any comments or if i can help anyone or if i left something

we are using pkzip v2.04 and i am interested to hear from
people who have used one of the many windows programs that
call these.
which ones are available and does any one stand out amongst
the rest \?

well , i got winzip from cica (do n't know which version , but i think
it 's the latest , as this is not long ago) , and i was initially imressed.
but here 's the low down

winzip is a great progra , as long as you only unzip . it lets you
vew files , unzip only selected files , and even puts the files in a
checkout directory , and creates a checkout .grp and group if you want
to check the program out. it even prompts for deletion of these on
exit , if you didn t like the program.

however (big however over here). i have problems zipping. i do n't
konw specifics on this , or ammount of consistency , but sometimes when i
zip a few files , or add a file to a .zip , dos will violate something
or other , and i 'll be asked (in a kind , micro oft kind of way) to quit
all applications , quit windows , and restart my computer. i do n't know
(as i said) how consistent this is , as i jdont' zip much (and when i do ,
now i just go to dos and use it from there , or just use the run cmd)
but i do know it 's happened when i added files to an existing .zip
file , and when i created a new .zip file , using selected files only.
i do n't know if it 's happened when i zip an entire dir.

still , it has a rather nice interface , and quite useful unzip ing
functions. if the above is fixed , i 'll be the first to register the new
ver. (as for now , a good old , run unzip .zip will work.

(ps if a new ver is out that fixes these , please let me know).

i am working with visual basic v2.0 for windows.
specifically , i am working on an application that generates formatted reports.
since , some of these reports can be rather large , my first question is

1. is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in
visual basic windows beyond the 64k limit \?

as i have not (as yet being optimistic ) come across a way to get
around the above problem , i am working on the following approach

i am trying to create my own defined template in ms word , using the
wordbasic macros so that i can open up word from visual basic(vb) and load
this template of mine , which will work in the following way

it will first open myown.ini file (created in vb at the time when the
user selected the kind of report he weanted) and read the section from the
.ini file and jump to the appropriate code in template which will then
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the .ini file.

1. when using the getprofilestring function in wordbasic , is there a way
to specify change the default .ini file (which is win.ini) to myown.ini file \?

2. when using the file input function in wordbasic is there a way to
read more than the 32k at one time \?


any help will be appreciated.

i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most
eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa
counterparts. for instance , the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is
only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus , which is n't
what i would call fast.

i do n't understand why eisa video cards are n't , as a group , on the
same level of performance as local bus cards , given that eisa video
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around , instead of isa 's 8 bits.

since they are not , why would anyone (me included) pay a higher
cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than
and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board , such as a
diamond speedstar 24x \? from pc magazine 's (i think) recent report ,
i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card , but it 's
around 500 , which is just about double what my wallet will allow
me to spend. and , for 500 , i could get a diamond viper and still
have 100 left over (of course , i 'd have to get a local bus mother
board too...)

personally , i 'll be blasphemous and say that if microsoft keeps doing
what it does so well , i hope to see much harsher stricter copyright

be one who actually does innovate , and then have microsoft come in
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff ,
marketing , etc) to get fat off of my innovation. i do n't have all
that much sympathy for apple 's complaint against microsoft , since
they just took the ideas from xerox 's pa research center when the
federal government forced xerox to disclose their patents over
antitrust fears. however , for other companies and individuals who

they told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from

with my list of 'i wants.' after installing the software , it did n't load.
no part of
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.

i called deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty
million different questions about my system.. concluded that i had one of
the
systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. of course they 're
willing to
give me my back.. what a waste of time and energy. the folks on their
support line , although nice , are extremely ignorant regarding the workings
of
windows 3.1.
after my experience with the installation of the sb 16 , i learned
some of the function of windows dll files. before sending back desktop
animator , decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of

.dll files i had. i had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8 92 and
100k the
other dated 1 93 and smaller (the 1 93 smaller version was the one supplied

with desktop animator). i moved the bigger , older version of cpalette.dll
to a
directory outside my path. (for some reason , i had the older cpalette.dll
in my
windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows system directory.)
when i did this , the animator 's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the
applications in the package.. the main application still did n't load. does
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions

for trouble shooting \?

this is the part that usually gets me. while i am set to make money , there usually
are other things to be considered and debated. that is the purpose of life.

like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product are measures
of success. they can be measures of short term or long term success. i think
in ms case they are a good measure of their long term success. the original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking ms and not willing to accept anything positive about ms.
i was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of ms products they definitely tell a different story.

i also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
them are highly technical. look around in the real world people do n't want
to grep and auck and ls l they just want to push the buttons and get their
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. like it or not ms and the
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under windows does
this and does it well. we are running 150 pc 's loaded with a complete
suite of mostly ms windows applications in an administrative business
function on a novell network running all software off the server.
it does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
windows again.
again i repeat to ms keep doing what you are doing. you are doing a great
job.

subject observation floppy copy works under pgm mgr , but not dos shell.
organization motorola (austin , tx)
lines 51
nntp posting host ome.sps.mot.com

has anyone observed this \? if i copy a large , say 800k file (a large pkzip
file for instance) to my floppy drive (3.5 ) under ms windows 3.1 via either
program manager or a dos shell , the file copied under the dos shell
has errors whereas the file copied from within program manager does not.

the corruption is detected by executing pkunzip t b file.zip after
both copies. the file copied via the dos shell always shows corruption.


now here 's the kicker


i have many windows open while doing this both dos and windows apps.
supposedly all windows' apps share the same time slice , whereas the
dos apps get their own equal time slice (unless overriden).


so , as an example , i have 5 windows' apps open , 2 multitasking dos sessions running ,
and one execution execlusive dos shell iconized (inactive). under this
scenario , cpu time is divided into two major slices one for all the windows
apps and one slice for the running dos app.

when copying under windows pgm mgr , i 'll assume the other windows and dos tasks
are essentially inactive. thus pgm mgr gets , say , 80 of the windows slice and
95 of the execution background dos shell 's slices. thus it gets (.8)(.95) 2
.72 or 72 of the total available cpu time.

when copying in a dos shell , i activate the execute exclusive mode dos shell
(no other dos background tasks allowed) , full screen , under the windows task
manager. the cpu time available to this shell would be 80 of the windows slice
(assumming inactive windows applications) and 100 of the dos slice
(1.0)(.8) .8 or 80 of the total available cpu time.

so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu
time \? is program manager working in a pre emptive mode during the floppy
copy \? it must be !

there was a post about something similar a while back. it seems windows
does not take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an
applllication is using when that application is done. that job is left
entirely to the application. that is , the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits.

anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which will
clean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip \? \? \? ).

peace ,

it could also be that your shell is hogging the resources. for example ,
open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources
with ndw 2.x as shell ,

then do the same with program manager , and see if it 's the shell or the
apps.

while working on my shareware toolbar , i found myself 'eating' resources ,
and a very wise person pointed me to the sdk , and specifically the debug
kernel. once you have all the sdk stuff installed , (this also comes with

runs c o n s i d e r a b l y slower , but you then execute the command
dbwin , and let it report to you what is going on. you are going to find

copying things to the clipboard (so i have to save and load pix for
editing in paintbrush) or crashing every hour or so.

the one nice thing it has , though , is it 's dither option. you 'd think
that this would turn colors into dots , which it does if you go from , say ,
256 colors to 16 colors. but if you go from 256 or 16 colors to b w ,
you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which
turn to white. for me , this is useful because i can turn light grays on
buttons to white , and the dark grays to black , and thereby preserve the
3d effect on buttons and other parts of the window.

hello ,

i want a little network for 3 users. all users want to run windows.
the most important things i want for the network are file sharing ,
mail utility , two printers on one of the computers and a fax modem
card on one of the computers. we all want to use each others harddisk.

my idea was to buy three computers (one 486dx and two 386dx). all
three have a 40mb local harddisk , the 486 also has a very large
harddisk. all three also have a network card. the 486 is connected to
the printers and contains the fax modem card. and last but not least
workgroups for windows.

my questions
is this possible \?
what exactly are the possibilities and advantages of workgroups
for windows \?
will all the computers be fast enough \? behind all three , someone
is working.

thanks ,
martijn

yes , certainly. it was ibm that wrote the windows code ! ! !

cliff , do you know the difference between windows and win os 2 \? here 's
a helpful hint

running windows under os 2 2.0 is only possible in real mode , in a dos
box. of course , this is only possible with windows 3.0 , since windows 3.1
no longer has a real mode .

the ability to run standard mode , the ability to have an os 2 windows
clipboard , the ability to run seamless , and a few other things were all added
by ibm to win os 2 .

now , everybody who is running windows in real mode in a dos box under os 2
2.x raise your hand. finally , everybody who is running win os 2 under os 2 ,
raise your hand.

get the picture , cliff \?

subject local windows .vs. shared windows (discussion)
organization the ohio state university , department of physics
lines 110

i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a novell administrator 's point of view.

i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they
(microsoft) has decided to implement , as a standard for software support ,
the local setup (described below) as the most advantageous installation .
if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then i will comply but i 'd like to hear it from administrators first.

the local windows installation

windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the
resources are available). from a network administrator 's implementation ,
he she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup a.
then install windows on a per machine bases by running setup off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives. in this way , all drivers
are available to the setup procedure w o the need to change disks.

advantages
reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to
the local access of main windows files.
network independence if the network fails (and they all do at one point
or another) , the local installation would allow users to keep producing
and reduce the cost of down time.
faster windows theoretically , windows will run faster from a local hard
drive than over a network. this may be a hard point to prove if the network
has an optical backbone and or the network drives are significantly faster
access than local ones.
a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about
varying setups (monochrome , color , types of mouse , etc...) since the
windows installation is assigned to the workstation.

disadvantages
cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk
space. workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can
increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.
administration local windows installations are very difficult to
administer.
new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available , each of
which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.
security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system
files from simple ignorance. this could result in quite a headache for
administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.
backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks. the backup
sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.
backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all. this may be
eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable
applications and not user data.

the shared windows installation

windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup a procedure
described above. users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of
files to individual user directories. these directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory. the bulk of the
windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory
(some 400 files) and are accessed (shared) as needed by users throughout
their windows session. the user 's files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his her windows session. these include
group files , .ini files and other regularly updated files.

advantages
a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy. as
an updated driver becomes available , it only needs to be installed in this
single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.
assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories ,
the administrator can easily edit any .ini file as needed to correct
problems that may arise. this includes win.ini and system.ini.
backup of all pertinent files is done easily. even if the users' files
are on a local hard disk , the bulk of the windows system is backed up with
all driver updates.

disadvantages
network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network
directory , traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the
speed of windows.
if the network crashes , all production comes to a stop since window 's
is reliant upon the network for its files. loss of data usually occurs
as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will
usually not be able to save their work.
although minimal , disk space is still a consideration. if the users' files
are maintained on the network , a large number of users can cause a
significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows
files alone.
users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation
hardware are similar. this is due to the windows installation being
tied to a particular username (in the case of network user files).

the discussion

i would like to know , from other administrators with a large windows
userbase , how they prefer setting up windows. personally , i have
setup numerous installations using the shared setup. all windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks. in fact , i sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money.

i would also like to see recommendations for applications. should
apps such as word and or excel be installed locally regardless of how
windows is installed \? again , i keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket
if the network crashes , work comes to a halt.

now i am sure microsoft (and i know your out there) has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to
hear from people with actual working experience with users and network
administration.

my original post
subject re why is my mouse so jumpy \? (ms mouse)
i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20
i think , but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better). vertical motion
is nice and smooth , but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes ca n't click
on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly
for a bit , then jump to the right , then move smoothly for a bit then jump
again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch ! ). this is crazy ! i have
never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions \?

aha , i think i found the problem and it is n't dirt ! another guy here was
using a different kind of mouse and was using 640x400x16 video driver (the
default vga for windows). he has an s3 localbus card like i do and when i
loaded the s3 video driver in windows for him , his mouse became jumpy too.
seems like it is the s3 driver ! is there any newer one than version 1.4
that would solve this problem \? it is really bad. i have to use the
keyboard instead sometimes ! the s3 w31.zip on cica is version 1.4 (which is
the same version that came with my card).

this may be an faq (if so , please direct me to the known answer) but i
am getting frustrated and looking for help.

i am running win 3.1 with ndw 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
applications are not giving back system resources when i close them.

when i load windows i start with about 83 resources available but many
of the application programs i run regularly (wpwin 5.2 , vb 2.0 , winqvt
2.8 , lotus organizer , etc.) seem to not return all their resources when
i exit them. after a day or two of work i often find myself down under
50 of available resources even when i have no applications other than
my shell running.

i am aware this is a known problem what i am looking for are some
suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it.

1. what software is the culprit \? win 3.1 , ndw , my applications \? are
some modes of win 3.1 (standard , real , enhanced) better than others at
plugging this leak \?

2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak \?

3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with
this \? seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
great market for a third party memory company like qemm.

4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside \? (i was
hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this , but it seems no different
than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less
likely my code will eat resources \?

6. any other suggestions that i do n't know enough to ask for
specifically \?

thanks for your help. as this is a common problem and i have seen only
a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who
would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending
me email.

i think you would need a dos macro program. superkey (by borland \? )
comes to mind. i do n't think windows is capable of sending
keystrokes to a dos window.

what you want to do sounds like a security problem to me , though.

the format for word for windows doc files is available from microsoft.
call their developer support services number (sorry , do n't have it handy)
and ask for the word for windows binary file format spec.

warning it is not terribly useful , and you will need to do a lot of
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored.

general primer

word for windows stores its data in two chunks. the first chunk is the
actual text in the file. this is all stored together and has nothing
but text and graphics. the second chunk is the formatting information.

for general use , to read a word for windows file , skip the first 384 bytes
of the file (its a general header). then read the remaining text until you
hit binary data.

from pankaj saxena u09416@uicvm.uic.edu
subject tcp ip through windows 3.1
lines 52

i do n't know much about computers , so please bear with me. here 's my question

context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the
university mainframe (an ibm 3090 running vms mvs) , and log on to my
account. when i installed slip on my computer , i had to configure it
for my modem (14.4 kbs etronics internal) and had to supply the phone
number to dial to reach the mainframe. the way it works now is that
i type telnet uicvm or tn3270 uicvm (either will work) at the dos
prompt. uicvm is the node name of the mainframe. the program then
dials the mainframe , establishes a protocol , and gives me the logon
screen. telnet and tn3270 are the names of batch files in my slip
directory. i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the
session.

problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows 3.1 because i
hardly ever use dos directly. slip will not run under windows. i
talked to the people at our computer center , and they suggested that
i use a packet driver called winpkt.com with slip. they gave me
instructions on how to load it before i start windows , and how to
modify the tcpstart and tcpstop batch files (in the slip directory)
to ensure that it would work. i did all that and i could run slip
from windows , but there were other problems. for one thing , slip
would not hang up the phone when i exited. i had to run my communi
cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when
that did n't work. for another , there were too many errors. it often
took me 3 4 tries to connect to the mainframe. our computer center
does not support slip under windows , so i ca n't keep going back to
them with more questions.

question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows
and do what slip is supposed to do \? i need a package that is not too
expensive , which is why i am looking for shareware. i have heard that
there are regular commercial packages that do all this , but they cost
hundreds of dollars. these are the main requirements

1. must be able to run under windows 3.1
2. must allow vt100 and ibm tn3270 terminal emulation
3. must allow ftp file transfers , since that 's the only kind the
mainframe allows. no y modem or z modem etc. i believe the ftp
transfers are made through a kermit protocol , but i'm hazy about
that.

a subsidiary feature (that would be nice to have) if it 's a true
windows program (rather than a dos program modified to run under
windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently
with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet
session and other applications.

any information received is appreciated.

this sounds like what happened to my hd a month ago. my hd was stacked

the hd got corrupted (directories changed into unreadable files with

dos6 that is troublesome.

i now use stacker v 3.0 , and so far i have had no trouble.

(i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over
a week. if you do get multiple copies , my apologies.)

here is a challenge to microsoft or microsort supporters to defend the
pathetic state of dos 6 as an upgrade distribution it is a long story
but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the
potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos 6 that i have been able to
notice after only about a week of playing around with it.

my envorinment


ti travelmate 4000 winsx (486sx 25) 4m ram 120m disk
system bios version 1.03 05 21 92 by texas instruments
cl gd6420 vga bios v 1.03 a1 by cirrus logic quadtel

smart drive cache (win3.1 dos6) parameters 2048 1024 a b
windows benchmark winbench(tm) v 3.11 02 11 93 by zd labs

after updgrading to dos 6 , i could not understand why certain things
became so slow , especially after i decided to try 'dblspace'. in the
process of finding out why , i discovered some interesting things.


disk performance with double space and smart drive


while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time , certain
applications appeared to run very much slower. what was interesting is
that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to
consider them useful by any standards. i suspected double space (ds)
and decided to measure its impact on my system using winbench(tm).

the real disk winmark of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from
factory with dos 5 and windowws 3.1) became 10718 when upgraded to
dos 6 with ds. thus there is an effective performance degradation of
more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because i knew
that ds compression must cost something.

specifically , for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes , ds actually
improves transfer rates by about 10 (because cpu being faster than
i o , more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings
in i o cycles). however , for all other cases , particularly large
random writes , the transfers take up to three times as long.

while the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or
sequential , small or large transfer units) , on the average (based on
winbench 's assumptions) , the disk slows down to half its speed.

the tests alone , done in 'real mode' (see winbench) and with smartdrv
on , do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective
statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or
even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and
slow disk i o'.

this explained why some applications ran markedly slower , but not why
'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.


double space and windows


dblspace will not run at all from within windows , not even if you
wanted to only to get information , not modify anything , or for that
matter even check on its usage try fasthelp dblspace in a dos box
within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you
get. how narrow minded can a programer get , i wonder.

yes , this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add on to
file manager , but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed
floppy ! (use the dos 6 supplement utility to create a compressed
floppy if you dont know how to.)


dos 6 defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm


defragmentation seemed to take too much time. even so , i waited
patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.
this confirmation 'dblspace def' command for the 120m drive should take
no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters i have used)
but it took 12 minutes.

i discovered that if i moved the mouse , defragmentation checking ran
faster (the figure ticked more rapidly). it dawned on me that this
had to do with ti 's battery saver advanced power management (apm)
module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle ,
and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process ! after
disabling the ti 's power saver , this operation took only 20 seconds.


microsft programmers think ti4000 and gateway nomad users are idiots


in the readme.txt file , you can find the the following

running microsoft backup with ti4000 and gateway nomad computers

to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup
for windows or ms dos , add a l0 switch to the device command in
your config.sys that loads the battery.pro file. or , before you
run microsoft backup , type setpower l0 at the command prompt.

if you checked ti 's manual on the l0 option , you will realise that it
means disable all power saving features of your notebook . why would
anyone want to run a driver disabled ! as i have found out , not only
does ti 's power management interfere with microsoft backup as the
readme.txt claims , but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what
else) are crippled by the ti 's power saver.

it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications. if
there indeed is such a thing , then either microsoft programmers or ti
programmers dont know how to read these specifications. you dont have
to guess as to who are the idiots.

by the way , if you run the advance power management utility , power.exe
in dos6 , when you check the status , it says

power management status

setting adv max
cpu idle 60 of time.

this figure of 60 seems to be the steady state value on my notebook
when i am running nothing (windows with only program manager in
iconised form). does that mean that windows takes up 40 of my cpu all
for itself , and that i have at best only 60 left for useful work \? is
such an overhead justified (whether or not windows is an operating
system or just another user interface) \? (in dos alone , it reports 99
idle time.) looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type
of package that i like my students to study as the classical 'negative'
example of our times !


microsoft programmers do not know batch programming


i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of
addpath statements like this

set path c dos
...
set path c etc bin path c bin
...
set path c etc windows path c windows
...
set path path c bcc bin
...
set path path mouse

even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old
one (i.e. c dos) , dos 6 installation program modifes each and every
path statement , and prepends c dos to its value. as a result , my
resultant path has so many dos 's.

if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path , and add
the new dos path , clearly it has to only scan for the path statement
containg the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path.
(even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a
directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)

instead , the microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one)
decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and
prepend dos to the value. i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it
would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.

i started a thread on this when dos 4 came up , and the microsoft
representative in singapore called me about this poster. in fact he
specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the
information to him as he did not have access to internet.

now that has not changed one bit. in fact , if you have a path statement
with path already in it , is it not obvious that the this statement
should not be touched for any reason \?

as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to
understand batch programming i had the mouse driver invoked as

set mouse c etc mouse
set path path mouse
loadhigh mouse mouse.com

guess what memmaker did \? it replaced the last statement with

lh ... c etc mouse mouse.com

why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with lh and its
parameters , without touching the rest of the line , i do not understand.


dos 6 software quality


dos 6 is the only operating system i know , in which , under normal usage ,
you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the
commands that come with it.

i am deliberately being cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to
use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it. if they dont
within a week , i will post how you can create this ghost file.

surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a
particular command only twice , i am sure two dozen microsoft (idiot)
programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find
it that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of
their products.

i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality
when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested , but
can only be built into the product. no wonder they cannot provide any
form of guarantees on their products , not even a decent list of bugs
that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond
repair !

also , if you run 'dblspace def' often enough , repeatedly when the disk
is fully defragmented , you may get errors , that was created by the
defragmenters. i got my io.sys file size error and it got truncated
when i did the chkdsk. this happend only after five successive
defragmentation efforst after the first one supposedly did its job and
with no new file creation since.

microsft , dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you
admit that your ds has bugs , and are willing to let us know what we
should watch out for if we have already used ds.

i am having a really bothersome problem using the msdos prompt in windows 3.1
to open a dos box. when i am done with the dos box , i cant get back to windows.
if i do alt enter to shrink the box or use 'exit' to close it , the screen goes
black and i have to control alt delete until i kill windows. i get a couple
of screens about app not responding.

i think things are still alive under the black screen because if i alt tab
to cycle through the running apps , i get flashes of text but then the
black returns.

this persists even if the machine is powered on and off.

i am working with an app developed using borland 's 3.1 application frameworks
and c . it seems to work fine.

hardware is a 486 with 16meg ram not on a network. video is a tseng
vga. dos 5.0.

i reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back. i am
using temporary swapping for virtual memory.

i would really really appreciate any hints anyone might offer.

be done to remedy the situation.


these are perfectly valid points and i agree. i'm glad we (ms) are starting
to remedy this situation with dos 6 (and it will get better in future
releases). you do need to be aware of some history , however. in the
mid late 80 's , ms 's point of view was that os 2 was going to take over
the world and dos would be phased out. as such , resources for dos
(and windows , for that matter) development were mostly redirected to os 2.
the theory was to keep just enough resources on dos to support people
until they started using os 2 , so utilities and such for dos fell by the
wayside.

then windows 3.0 hit the market , os 2 flopped (1.x , at least...2.x seems to
be doing a little better , but its future is still cloudy) , and people either
stayed with their dos (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to windows. about that
point in time , ms made its decision to drop os 2 for dos windows in the
short term and windows nt in the long term. dos 5 , much improved over dos
3.x and 4.x , was the first result of ms 's refocussing on dos and windows.
version 6 takes things somewhat further and i suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of real os features (i work on nt and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in dosland are doing , but i do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago).

what appears to be happening is that the truetype fonts do n't get printed properly. my
experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from corel draw) print
ok. graphicsworkshop for windows happily prints gifs etc. ms notepad and ms write will
print correctly providing the font 's in the text are printer fonts.

when i print truetype fonts , some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. if i change
the text font to a printer font , the problem is eliminated.

i have tried using printer drivers for printers which the kx p1123 (snappy name) emulates ,
namely epsom lq 850 and ibm proprinter x24 and the same problem occurs.

it has been done , but the other companies do n't have the marketing
budgets that ms do. 4dos , for instance , is everything that
command.com should have been (but never could be under ms). those who
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine. but they
have to rely on word of mouth for sales. it seems to have worked
pretty good so far , but your corporate weenie manager type usually
likes to see a big glossy ad in pc magazine. that 's okay , marketing
is n't a fundamental human right , but they 've got a product that 's
superior to the dos command interpreter in every way. they have a lot
more to be proud of than ms does. if ms really gave a damn , they
could duplicate it , buy it outright (they 've got the money) , or even
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with
compatability issues and absconding with the technology.

dos is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch
marketing and vendor agreements. the mediocre was excusable in the
early days when it was someone else 's hack , but they 've had ten years
to play with it.

an interesting thought on that most ms products that i'm aware of in
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and
programmers through easter egg screens , including windows , or at least
have the names buried in the files. is there such a thing in dos 5.0

why is win 3.1 sometimes so finicky \?

dell replaced the mouse , gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard. just prior to this problem windows would
only load up every other time. i would get the logo and either it would
go on into windows or lock up. this was very consistent every other time.

much deleted
any thoughts or comments

sounds like a memory conflict problem , which can cause truly weird symptoms
like these. call dell tech support (or better , post to them on cserve if you
have an account) and get the memory range(s) used by video ram on your
machine. the block windows from using those ranges with an
emmexclude statement in the 386enh section of system.ini. you probably
should include a statement excluding the same range from emm386 or whatever
memory manager you use in config.sys.

dell installs windows on the machines they ship , but the installation does n't
consist of much more than copying the files to a hard disk. you still have
to do the work. and the fact that you have the problem in enhanced
mode but not standard strongly suggests a high memory conflict.

i do n't know the specifics of the compression algorithm , but i 've used the

it from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , but i do n't know what the file is called
or what directory it is in (you can start by looking in pub pc win3 or try

to convert a .bmp file to a .rle file , you just load the .bmp file and do a
save as... select windows bitmap and compressed (or is it rle \? )
whatever it is , it 's fairly intuitive...

please research carefully. just because a fax modem behaves like
a printer on a local machine , does n't guarantee functionality
when a local machine has fax software printing to a remotely
installed fax card. i tried this with workgroups and the
fax software did n't like it at all. could have been winfax 's
peculiarisms but i do n't think so. a lot of special hardware
interaction takes place internally. in my case , a fax manager
program merely intercepts the print job and spools it to
it 's own directory , not print manager 's spool directory. to
software , it appears the job was printed . print manager
plays no part in the handling of the actual process.

pardon me if i 've incorrectly assumed this is what you were
up to. a truely network aware fax modem will most likely be
required , or a lot of weird setup and tinkering.

from article c68ubg.k2w@world.std.com , by cfw@world.std.com (christopher f wroten)
i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most
eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa
counterparts. for instance , the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is
only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus , which is n't
what i would call fast.

i do n't understand why eisa video cards are n't , as a group , on the
same level of performance as local bus cards , given that eisa video
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around , instead of isa 's 8 bits.

good question.
answer the eisa bus does move 32 bits rather than isa 's 8 (16 \? )
but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus.
i think that 's either 8 or 10 mhz.
the local bus designs also move 32 bits like the eisa , but
they move the data at the cpu speed , up to 40 mhz.
so , on a 33mhz cpu , the local bus is moving 32bit data at
33 mhz , and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
so the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than eisa on
a 33 mhz cpu. eisa should be about two (maybe 3) times as
fast as isa.

i would expect the eisa board to be more than twice as fast as the isa
board. not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at
least) , but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for
bus transactions between the two busses. most isa boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction typically this is around 3 4.
eisa boards are suppose to be able to 'burst' at a 1 1 rate , so i
would expect performance to be 6x 8x that of an isa card.

so i guess , for me , the question is unanswered still. i would expect
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference , and he apparently does
not.

yep , the os 2 apps are comming , the os 2 apps are comming.

yet another micro minion hoping that if he says something long enough ,

hey , i remember the good old days running os 2 2.0 alpha with brief ,
excel , word , and a couple internal apps (product support database
client , os 2 based email front end). life was good. but it was also
impractical 'cause the masses were using windows and my job was to help
the masses.

apparently you prefer os 2 to windows or at least did

to windows 3.0 , yes.

by you last comment
do you mean that your knowledge of os 2 is dated (it must be) or argue

it 's definitely dated i used os 2 1.21 , alpha 2.0 (when msft was
developing it...)

i suspect that the masses were using windows because they could n't afford
to use os 2 , can you say as much for nt \?

i preferred windows 3.1 because it was more stable faster than 3.0 ,
but could still run more apps than os 2 (again i made this choice
before 2.0 was released).

but getting back to the original question , do you have any data on the
relative avaliablity or windows applications versus os 2 applications
or any evidence that stated support will be dropped by any of the above \?

no , i 've seen no such data.

grow up. other companies are supporting os 2. make points please.

if you see life in terms of debating points , i think you need
to grow up.

ah yes i remember the days when we kids would engage in orderly debate ,
but our parents would usually find out and force us to act in the more
mature manner of heaping invective and casting rocks and dirt clods.

hee hee. good one

it does n't help microsoft

not like walking into the 1984 commercial. there are individuals
here. you think they 'll all talk the same way , say the same thing ,

it appears to me that he is voicing his frustration to an attitude
he has encountered before.

...and one that i 've encountered as well...

i on the other hand have had no such
experience other than from reading this thread. you at microsoft
are in a unique position to present facts ,

hmm. are you sure \? i'm speaking from my own experience as an
os 2 user . certainly people in , say , the nt marketing group
would be in a unique position to present the results of , say ,
research on upcoming nt and os 2 apps (vs windows and ms dos apps).
part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does
not mean one has access to such data (if it exists).

but prefer to make baseless claims or attack to poster. i must
make the same conclusion as he.

i will confess to , at times , attacking the poster.

usenet accounts are not restricted to the marketroids. they 're

subject upgrading to windows nt
nntp posting host 127.0.0.1
organization performance systems int'l
x mailer psilink dos (3.3)
lines 65

i 'd like to appeal to the net 's nt wizards for a bit of advice.

first a general description of the machine as follows
motherboard utron 33 mhz opti chipset , 20 meg memory , 256kb cache
(soon i hope to drop a dx2 chip into it)
fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg , 1024x768x256)
proaudio spectrum 16 sound board
primary disk connor cp30174 on a caching ide controller
secondary disk conner cp30174 as slave on same controller
tertiary disk fujitsu \? \? \? 650 meg on superstore esdi controller
planned future disks include scsi hd and cd rom on pas16 scsi port
tape drive is a colorado jumbo 250 on the floppy controller
future tape drive may be a dat on the scsi interface.
other hardware includes modem fax , serial ports , and a teletext board
(ugly dos software drives the latter)

applications used include normal windows stuff (excel , word , quicken
and turbo pascal windows) but the important stuff is my audio
work environment which includes turtle beach wave for windows , mcs stereo ,
and other misc stuff for dinking around with audio files. also i use
stacker on the primary drive , hp newwave (for my wife 's use , and she
wo n't let me get rid of it ! ) , and a product called infinite disk from
chili pepper software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom
used offline files.

i plan to upgrade to nt , when it becomes a released product. i was stongly
tempted to become a beta user early on , but i do n't have time to mess around
with the hassles of beta software. i expect to buy it , tear off the
shrink wrap , and use it without hassle (i know , unrealistic , but i can
hope ca n't i , after all , i have work to do).

the advice i want concerns the state of nt regarding device drivers , and
hardware specific stuff in general. how smoothly can i expect the
upgrade to go \? can i expect support for all my stuff , or do i
still need to scramble around downloading drivers (pas \? , orchid \? , colorado \? )
from some bbs , etc. what steps should i take to ensure the installation
goes smoothly. note that i want to nuke dos totally from the system. i'm
allergic to command lines ! i plan to run a pure nt system. also , will
nt communicate with the workgroups lan \? what about stacker \? i currently
have stacker on the first disk drive. without stacker , and the infinite
disk product , i will have great difficulty fitting everything i have on the
system (it 's cramped now).

i realize stacker will be incompatible with nt , but will there be an nt
version \? or will nt support compression a la dos 6 \? i know infinite disk
will be incompatible with nt , but will they offer (or does anybody else)
a comparable product for nt and at what cost \? (perhaps i need to ask
chili pepper that question) i can live without id if i have to , but i 'd
rather not. will nt run my dos apps (the teletext board mainly) without
dos on the system \? what do i need to keep around \?

any feedback or advice (including forget nt with good reasons) is much
appreciated. my only significant reason for moving to nt is i need a better
multitasking environment than windows (among other reasons , wave locks up
the machine for hours and hours doing dsp processing on large audio files) ,
and i want better lan support than i now have (internet access , etc). maybe
there are better solutions than nt and if so , i would appreciate hearing
about them (os 2 \? what 's it 's status these days \? )

pls respond by email and if there is interest i 'll summarize for the net.

thanks ,

i'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a novell
network (using shell version 3.22 , i think). the workstation , a 386 , was set
up to run windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. needless to say ,
i 'd like to upgrade it to windows 3.1 , and have it work with the network.

basically , the windows files 'd be on the local hard drive , but
several dos applications , like word perfect , will be on the network. i 'd
mainly want windows to access the network drives , the network printers , and
perhaps handle some network functions as well. if i could multitask the dos
apps whose executables are on the network , that 'd be great , but i could live
without it.

eventually , i 'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working
with the network and windows 3.1 as well. (however , most of the terminals
are 286s , which leaves the network pretty much dos bound , and i guess that
leaves out windows for workgroups.) and in the future , maybe there 'd be
norton desktop , but that 's gettingahead of myself.

as you can guess , i 've never done anything like this before. i 've
read through the networks material that came with windows , but still , i 'd
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.

please reply by email. i do n't scan these newsgroups often.

so i think there are 2 possibilities

1) i'm right. if my disk really crashes , i would at least have to
re install dos and windows to get the backup program working.

using the software you 're using , i agree with you there. what i did
i installed dos , windows and cpbackup (functionally the same
as your norton , for the purposes of this discussion) , and used the
dos backup command on just that much. to restore , i boot to the
system diskette , and use dos restore to read in that much , then
boot to windows and restore my full backups using cpb (norton , in your
case) , overwriting what i 've just restored. that allows me to keep
this skeletal windows essentially unchanged , with all my customization
on the real copy done using the 3rd party backup utility.

2) i'm wrong. there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk
that can easily restore it 's state from scratch.

seems possible , if you can put skeletal versions of dos and your backup
utility on a system floppy. then you could restore it all on one go .

you can print to a file from an hp (or any other printer). just go into
the printers section of your control panel. select the printer you want
to re direct to a file , and click on connect. then choose file as the
port to connect the printer to.

when you print from any application to that printer , windows will prompt
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the
printout.

it 's pretty easy.

good luck !

the easiest way to do this is if you can send the files accross the network.
this is much easier going from a mac to a pc because you do n't have to worry

paintshop pro for windows is a fantastic product. it can handle tiff , gif ,

ftp.cica.indiana.edu). log in as ftp , use your username as a password ,
and look for a program called psp101.exe or something like that. i have
the registered version , and the only major difference i can detect is that
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program
asking you to please register it.

once again , fantastic software. up to 24 bits , huge images , everything.

takes the place of dos and windows and more , i actually think the
requirements for os 2 are very reasoable. i also think that anyone
using windows 3.1 without 8 megs of ram , a 386 40 , and 200 megs of
hard drive space , is beating their head against a wall. those are
also legitimate requirements for os 2. in fact , the requirements
for windows 3.1 and os 2 are about equal.

finally , in order to run your specific version of windows , you
must simply change the path to include c winmastr and your
specific configuration path , e.g. c winwife. you could get
fancy and use batch files , environment variables , or a menuing
system to do this.

if you happen to be running the new msdos 6 , you could use multi

i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users
of ms products do not even know about internet , and unix is that
very unfriendly place where bizzare abreviations replace the rather
comfortable abreviations they know. and the abreviations have subtle
differences between the different vendors. while pc users tend to
customize any windowing setup , they can not do much with their
command line.

you ca n't customize a command line interface \? where have you been \? i
can change the prompt , i can make aliases (so someone like me who is
used to say , ls , can type it on my dos machine and still get a
directory listing) , and under unix , if i do n't like the command line
interface , i throw it out and get a different one. (csh , bash , ksh ,
sh , etc...)

so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize
quality. ms has made their life easier , and more productive and to them
that is quality. they do not care about what innovative things ms has
done , other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot
easier. you may know better than most computer users in this world
but that will not change their perception.

this is true.

face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to
all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream
of computer users. we here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

a decent gui for all variations of unix \? lessee... what about motif \?
or the stuff from mit \? (twm comes to mind...) those are pretty
standard. heck , an xwindows program runs like it likes to all the
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows
with the mouse , and since it is a gui , it 's graphical and a bit
easier to figure out. (something the windows people have been pressing
down our throats for some time now...)

the thing i fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users
running windows (all flavors) and the other power users running unix
and other more advanced oses. at least right now , dos is still pretty
much king. i can bring a copy of my latest whiz bang programming demo
over to my friends house , and since we both run dos , he can enjoy it

would you like to tell me

(2) if there is one , where can i find it \?
(3) is any such software package on public domain \?

what version of winfax do you have \? the newest version (3.0) has an ocr

i think it is important to clear up your first reply. you gave the
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker. you are
correct re caching the compressed drive. however , as i understand it ,
you can cache the uncompressed drive. thus if you have compressed your
disk c , you will have a c and probably a d drive under stacker. c being
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on d ) and d being the
uncompressed disk. you should only attempt to stack d . in fact , with
win 3.1 and smartdrv.exe , it seems smart enough to automatically default
to stacking your a , b and d drives.

it depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that
comes standard with windows , or with an icon from some other icon manager.

well , if it is one of those that comes with windows , just highlight the
item by clicking once on it , click on 'file' and then on 'properties'.
you should see a box which says 'change icon'. click on it. you are going
to be presented with some icons (sometimes just one). if you do n't like
any of those presented , click on the 'browse' box , and look for the file
'moricons.dll' select it. browse through the icons presented , and just
double click on your desired icon.

if you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager ,
say iconpower for instance , open the icon manager at the bottom of your
screen , where it will not block the application icon you wish to replace.
when you have found your desired icon , click on it once , and while holding
the mouse button down , pull this icon over the one you wish to change.
and thats it !

emm386 noems enables the system to use the upper memory between 640

managed to load them high (ie between 640kb and 1024kb).

criteria are themselves objective \?

i believe that enough is inferior to make it overall as a product
inferior to its competition apple system 7 , os 2 2.0 , nextstep 3.0 ,
unix xwindows (pick your favorite flavor).

in other words , it is your opinion that msw3.1 is inferior to its
competition. that 's not the same as msw3.1 being objectively inferior.

no. it is technically inferior to the os guis that i listed. i have already
described why. to say briefly

system 7 easier to learn and use. there have been independent studies to
that effect.
os 2 can run msw applications and has more stable multitasking.
nextstep easier to learn , use , and program. more stable multitasking
unix x as easy to learn and use. more stable multitasking.

with the prpoer setup , all of these will exchange data with msw machines as
well as msw machines will amongst themselves , so interoperability is not
an issue.

by this criterion , it is inferior. if you have another , then perhaps i am
incorrect. do you pick up the glove \?

i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse.com 8.00 (was using 8.20
i think , but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better). vertical motion
is nice and smooth , but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes ca n't click
on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly
for a bit , then jump to the right , then move smoothly for a bit then jump
again (maybe this time to the left about .5 inch ! ). this is crazy ! i have
never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions \?

here is another hint

i have a really jumping mouse (ps2 type) , and finally the mouse
stops jump changing himem.sys (yes , himem ! ) , is you use

very well indeed. at home (a vl bus version of the graphics pro) i can stretch
an avi window to 640x480 and it will continue to play back smoothly. it drops
a few more frames but on most machines even attempting such a thing would mean
one frame update every 30 seconds. an isa graphics was able to do zoom by

somebody help me cure my poor computer before i go insane !

i have a problem with my 486 when running windows that appears
to be memory related. it 's actually not limited to windows , but
that 's where it causes most of my problems. ths machine 's 486dx33 ,
8meg ram , 256kcache , trident tvga card , pas 16 soundcard.

1) windows runs really , really slow most of the time. slower than
on my old 386sx16. graphics draws fills are slow , boots are slow ,
applications are sluggish , dialog boxes take up to 15 seconds to appear.
(note some of my other non windows applications do funny things that
appear to be related. several run slow , my .mod player crashes the
system etc..)

2) running borland c 3.0 before running windows (or any of the other
programs) completely fixes the problem. windows will run as fast as
i 've ever seen it run , easily 10 times faster for graphics than
when i do n't run bc beforehand.

3) i do n't have a memory manager installed in config.sys. installing
emm386.exe does not fix the problem it makes it worse. after emm386 is
installed , running bc will not fix the problem anymore.

this problem is driving me nuts. if you think you can help ,
please reply through the mail.

fiddling around with the windows setup for some time , and when i needed to do
some work with finale things did n't print properly. it might and it might
not have anything to do with the installation of atm from 1.something to
2.0 , but i do n't have the old atm lying around anomore.

the most annoying problem was that the petrucci font did n't print , which is a
rather important font )

i managed to get direct printing to work if i included ownps 0 in the
finale section of win.ini , but compile postscript listing still does n't
work and it 's those .eps files i need. when i look at the .eps files
generated the only font which appears there is courier. i found out that if i
manually changed the courier 24 point to petrucci 24 point in the .eps file
everything worked ok , but i 'd rather avoid that since i have a lot of songs
to work with.

and yes , in the special font font names dialog box all the fonts i need are
listed , with the correct mapping between finale , screen and printer fonts.
finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works
well (that is , after i included ownps 0) , and all my other windows
applications print petrucci and the other fonts well.

has anyone encountered problems like this \?

again , my point was that not all microsofties are here to sell
readers on our products (which would conflict with the no ads
philosophy of usenet). nor do we necessarily have access to info
that others have.

it certainly smacks of that ! remember the poll that you quoted
saying that you had seen a 95 of users being satisfied with dos 6.0 \?

it was 93 94 , and actually another msdos team member posted it.
note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know
about that , or...

care to recall how unbiased the sample set was \?

when i heard those numbers i wondered how they got them (having
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller
has very little positive to say about the product , i figured it was n't
from there...) so i wandered over to the marketing folks and asked.
and i was told it was from a survey of registered users. and i
posted that on the net when people asked where the 93 figure came
from.

that post sure looked like fud....and coming from a microsoftie
.... well , it sure seemed like something was not on level.

hmm. i figured , if chuck posted the numbers , why not include where
they came from \? (i also find it interesting that postitive info is
fear , uncertainty doubt .)

advocacy is good but spreading fud to advocate your favorite os is very
unethical especially when you have a vested interest in the success
of that os.

\? \? \? \? i think you 've got me confused with someone else. i do n't
pretend that msdos provides what all people need , or that other
oses (including unix os 2) do n't provide useful and or necessary
features. i also do n't push people to use msdos i even posted in
comp.os.msdos.misc that i suggest waiting before installing a
new os , esp if you have trouble (support is always overloaded
during release , unless the sales are a total bomb).

i also get tired of people assuming that microsofties are , like ,
members of the borg.

that is because their actions seem to invite this opinion never seen more
defensive people in my life.

i ai n't saying some of us do n't get defensive sometimes. do you really
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it \?

i just mean we all are n't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie
cutter. we do n't all think alike. yeah , chuckst and i have some inside
info on msdos does n't mean that everyone else does )

seriously speaking , it is a shame that ms techie employees get the heat for
ms 's actions most of which are perpetrated by the management and marketing.
i am sure that they are very talented etc ... i have not doubts about their
abilities , just about the ethics of their marketing practices.

subject re question on eisa video board performance
organization clemson university
lines 44

from article c68ubg.k2w@world.std.com , by cfw@world.std.com (christopher f wroten)
i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most
eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa
counterparts. for instance , the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is
only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus , which is n't
what i would call fast.

i do n't understand why eisa video cards are n't , as a group , on the
same level of performance as local bus cards , given that eisa video
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around , instead of isa 's 8 bits.

good question.
answer the eisa bus does move 32 bits rather than isa 's 8 (16 \? )
but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus.
i think that 's either 8 or 10 mhz.
the local bus designs also move 32 bits like the eisa , but
they move the data at the cpu speed , up to 40 mhz.
so , on a 33mhz cpu , the local bus is moving 32bit data at
33 mhz , and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz.
so the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than eisa on
a 33 mhz cpu. eisa should be about two (maybe 3) times as
fast as isa.

since they are not , why would anyone (me included) pay a higher
cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than
and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board , such as a
diamond speedstar 24x \? from pc magazine 's (i think) recent report ,
i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card , but it 's
around 500 , which is just about double what my wallet will allow
me to spend. and , for 500 , i could get a diamond viper and still
have 100 left over (of course , i 'd have to get a local bus mother
board too...)

that 's a very good question. the eisa bus does have more advantages
over the isa bus than just it 's width. for example more better
interrupts and bus mastering. but these other factors do not impact
a video card very much. they have more impact on file servers with
multiple hard drives , full throttle network cards , cd roms , etc.

can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration \?

thanks ! christopher wroten , cfw@world.std.com

re irish gaelic truetype font wanted synopsis

i wrote
can anyone tell me where i can find an ms windows truetype font
that will give me the characters used in writing irish gaelic
in the old style \?

for example , in this font the letter t would look something
like a c with a horizontal bar sitting on the top , and the
letter g would look something like an s with a horizontal
bar sitting on the top.

many thanks to those who responded to my question. unfortunately i have
had no luck in actually getting such a font , and a lot of people interested
in geting one , and so i have decided to create my own truetype font fitting
that description. this font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of
dineen 's dictionary and is typical of that found in irish books from the
early part of the century. this may take me some time to do (in my
limited spare time) but i 'll make it available to anyone who is interested ,
when it is ready.

the responses i received are summerised below

kevin donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that michael everson
(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some clo gaelach fonts
for the macintosh and may be able to advise me. i contacted michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the macintosh , and
that he will eventually port them to the pc , but that he will be charging
ir 100 (about 160) for each one.

pbryant@ukelele.gcr.com mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice irish gaelic look to them'. these are durrow and american
uncial normal . i do n't know where you can get these but i do n't
think that they have the effects i am looking for.

finally , rhiannon@netcom.com (rhia) mentioned that the meath font
included in the casady greene fluent laser fonts 2 package
is very much like what i was describing. i faxed casady greene for
info but got no reply.

so that 's it. i 'll post these newsgroups when i make my font available.

and not being able to adress your memory better than dos ,

not sure what you mean here. os 2 sees 16 megs , uses 5 or six
of these for it 's own use (more if you want to count winos 2).
windows sees 16 megs , uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the
disk cache as i am for os 2) for itself. if memory efficiency
were a big issue , pc geos would be the current king of the
intel desktop.

i assumed he was referring to os 2 's 32 bit flat model addressing while dos
(and therefore windows) use 20 bit segmented addressing. as a programmer , i
agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things. it 's annoying , too.
but when just a windows user , i do n't think about it much. and , i doubt many
other people think about it (or even care) when just writing a document ,
calcing a spreadsheet , etc...it works and they get their work done.

just a neutral comment
it 's funny , i think , how arguments about windows vs os 2 sound so very
similar to arguments about atheism vs christianity or something like that.
it 's somehow very personal to people. convictions are irrational and
there 's nothing wrong with that it 's just...interesting.

there is no need to load emm386. qemm , or anything else on many

otherwise you just need to load himem.sys and let windows go straight

why is win 3.1 sometimes so finicky \?
i have a new dell 486dx2 66mhz 8 megs ram.
windows was working just great. i had a bus mouse and mother board problem.
dell replaced the mouse , gave me a newer mouse driver for windows
and replaced the motherboard. just prior to this problem windows would
only load up every other time. i would get the logo and either it would
go on into windows or lock up. this was very consistent every other time.

now with the new motherboard and all , it still does the same thing.
the computer is less than one month old. at first it worked fine !
i can get into windows each time now with the win s command.
this forces standard mode. things seem to run slower. i mainly
use windows apps , but in standard mode there is no virtual mem.....
plus it is slower.

i re loaded windows , it still does the same thing. should i first delete
everything in all windows dir 's \? i did not because i have so much
added in sub dir 's etc.

really puzzling why enhanced mode would not load each time but consistently
every other time. standard mode each time......

any thoughts or comments \? \? \?

do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) os 2 2.0 2.1 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but
os 2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to. i have heard

ftp

cosy pak is available by anonymous `ftp' from
mishna.esys.cwru.edu (internet no. 129.22.40.23). a sample ftp session
is given at the end of this file.



changes in version 0.9 (update from v0.81 to v0.9)

in this version , we have revised cosy pak to take advantage of
the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v2.1.
since mathematica 2.1 provides a better and working
laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than
mathematica v2.0 did , we adopted them. this has made cosy pak
smaller. thus brian evans' signal processing packages that supported
the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the
cosy pak v0.81 are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v0.9. for
power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very
fine brian evans package on signal processing (available at
the anonymous ftp site gauss.eedsp.gatech.edu or ip 130.207.226.24). on
the downside , the disadvantage of this update
can be that mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its
previous version.



for mathematica 2.0 users

we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in
the directory `for 2.0'. please move all files and directory under for 2.0 into
the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory.



introduction

this is an unsupported release of cosy pak a control systems
analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using
mathematica 2.1. classical control systems analysis and design methods and some
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package.

this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a
next (tm) computer (a unix based workstation). they have been
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control
engineering texts (ogata 1991 , phillips and harbor 1991 ) for
undergraduate courses in `control engineering i' taught at the systems
engineering department of cwru. in addition to the next , they have
also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers (tm) , and ,
ibm pc 's (tm) running ms windows(tm). we would be very much interested
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on
platforms not mentioned above. ibm users however will have to
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics.

once installed (see below for instructions) , this collection of
mathematica packages can be loaded by any user. bundled with the
packages are many notebooks ( cosy notes ) which demonstrate
the functionality of these packages. the notebooks follow a plan of
many fine , standard , undergraduate control engineering text books
listed in the references. examples used in these notebooks have
been collected from the various references given at the end of this
file. the contents of the notebooks in the cosy notes directory are
given below.

end notebook contents


compressed files

the files that contain a complete set of the cosy pak v0.9
packages and notebooks for mathematica are

cosy pak 09.tar.z compressed tar file for unix systems

cosy pak 09.sit.hqx compressed sit file for macintosh
systems and encoded by binhex 4.0
format (requires the shareware
stuffit file v 1.5.1 or higher).

cosy pak ibm 09.zip zip file for the ibm pc running ms dos

once expanded the mathematica files can also be used on
macintosh ibm pc unix systems also.


installation of cosy pak

o in unix command line type the following command

zcat cosy pak 09.tar.z tar xvf

o in macintosh open the .sit.hqx file using the shareware
stuffit v 1.5.1 or higher.

o in ibm command line type the following command

pkunzip o d cosy pak ibm 09.zip

note this .zip file was zipped by zip utility v2.0. you must use
pkunzip version 2.0 or higher to unzip it. ibm pc 's may limit the
directory name characters to eight. in that event type pkunzip o d
cosy pak.zip. you can also unzip the cosy pak ibm 09.zip file on any
unix machine if you have unzip utility on it.


uncompressing and untarring cosy pak 09.tar.z or unzipping
cosy pak ibm 09.zip will create a directory called cosy pak .

once the files are expanded you should see a single directory
cosy pak containing the following three files , four
sub directories and their contents

sub directories in cosy pak
cosypak contains control tool box packages
manual cosy pak manual in .ps , .rtf , .txt , and .wn formats.
cosy notes contains notebooks
for 2.0 contains laplace transform package from mathematica 2.1
for mathematica 2.0 users.

files in directory for 2.0
laplacetransform.m diracdelta.m
sub directories in cosy pak common
files in directory common support.m

important

the notebook example files(.ma files) will be under the
cosy notes directory. to use the notebooks , move the directory `cosypak' to
a
directory that mathematica can recognize

locallibrary mathematica packages on a unix machine ,
my harddisk mathematica packages on an apple macintosh ,
c winmath packages on an ibm pc.

at the beginning of the initialization cell of each notebook
in cosy notes directory , we list the example about how to make
mathematica identify the directory

( initialization of path )

( example for a unix machine (default) )
(
path join path ,
locallibrary mathematica packages
)

( example for an apple macintosh )
(
path join path ,
my harddisk mathematica packages
)

( example for ibm pc
)
(
path join path ,
c winmath packages
)

change the pathname according to your machine by removing the
mathematica comment sign `( ' and `) ' before and after ` path'
setting.

this command makes mathematica recognize the directory

locallibrary mathematica packages on a unix machine
my harddisk mathematica packages on a apple macintosh
c winmath packages on an ibm pc


mathematica 2.0 users

we include the laplacetransform package from mathematica 2.1 in
the directory for 2.0. please move all files and directory under for 2.0
into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory.


getting started

after installation , start mathematica and open the notebooks in
the cosy notes directory. all notebooks load their own packages.
navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. ibm users however will have to
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

seen from a typographically point of view , atm using postscript fonts
is better than truetype the hinting mechanism incorporated in ps is
gorgeous.
multilingual users may see the limit of possible different characters in
a ps font as problematically they may have better use of the unicode
features of tt fonts (in windows nt).

i 've seen lots of really beautiful and printable in small size ps fonts
i have n't seen those as tt fonts. most of them are rendering quite
inaccurate (in small sizes , esp. as screen fonts).
simply compare timesnewroman as a ps font with the tt font the first
looks better.

has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so , what have you
done to cure it \?

one workstation in a wfw network goes deaf to any form of communication from
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. from then on other
workstatons can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf
again.

the workstation is set up to share its discs etc. the machine
is a 486dx 33 , 8mb ram , with diamond stealth video. it behaves this
way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters , including a smc elite.
it also behaves the same way if i use the windows vga driver , rather
than the diamond drivers.

due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts.

this is a uuencoded bitmap. 960x600 256 colors.
the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background.
the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons
to fit in without being on top of the picture. reguarding image
quality and resolution i have not seen much better.

please do not do this !

i do n't know how the rest of you read news , but here 's how i do it i
subscribe to an outernet system which allows me to dial up via modem and
download e mail and news articles automatically. when someone posts a
huge attached binary file , i have no choice but to receive it along with
all the other new articles in the groups i subscribe to. i also pay for
the connect time , which is normally not a problem because i have a 14.4k
modem and each day 's upload download session takes only 5 minutes or so.
today 's session , however , lasted about 25 minutes because of roman.bmp.
consequently , it cost me about 3.00 extra just to receive a file that i
did n't want in the first place.

if you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available , there are other
ways to do it either upload the file to an ftp site (like
ftp.cica.indiana.edu , which has a complete windows section) and tell
people how to get to it , or use one of the newsgroups like
alt.binaries.pictures (or something like that) , which are file archives
rather than discussion groups. do n't use discussion groups like this one
to send out attached files , especially when they 're 600k in size.

emm386 noems enables the system to use the upper memory between 640 and

(keep it in ! )

emm386 is not reqired to load the dos kernal high (or else you could n't

there are a few things to consider before you make the leap though.
first (for me at least) is that you cannot get a full speed dos box.
what i mean is , i cannot (for instance) run falcon 3.0 or any other
resourse intensive program in a dos box. it absolutley crawls.
and my machine is a 486 33 with a 330mb hd and 16mb ram. if anyone
knows how to get a fast dos box (or full screen for that matter) ,
please let me know.

the second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff.
for instance , my pas 16 has been demoted to running as a sound blaster
(which is natively supported nice) , because mediavision has n't
produced drivers yet.

your disk should be large enough to keep an 80mb dos partition , and
give the rest over to windows nt (tm). the only thing is , whenever
you wanted to run windows programs , you 'd have to reboot and log into
windows nt (tm) , instead of just typing win.

windows nt (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal windows
though. it 'd be a good choice if you have the resources. you should
really have at least 8mb ram though. one last thing , modems work
well enough , but i have yet to get my fax card to work , and i 've never
heard of anyone else who did either.

it 's only better than unix because it runs killer software out of the
box , whereas with unix there is n't the same availablity.

i guess it comes down to windows nt (tm) is not yet for the faint
of heart , it 's still a beta. but it 's a very good beta.

hi ,

i 've got an older 386 25 motherboard (old as in , uses a 1988

it has developed a problem where trying to copy files from floppy cause
the machine to lock up (reset button required) , but only when in 386
enhanced mode. this occurs in norton desktop , file manager , and when
trying to install software. running win 3.1 in standard mode works fine.

has anyone run into this \? any ideas \? much thanks appreciated.

i 'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.
windows itself almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by
an errant application (my personal favorite \? any one of the corel
3.0 programs). on the other hand , i have had os 2 crash randomly
a number of times , mostly just running it 's own applications.

i do know that ibm systems , the ps 2 56slc2 , in particular , have
absolutely no problem with os 2 never had a random crash while
running any of my programs under os 2. in fact , i do n't remember
ever crashing.

of course , i really do n't run any os 2 programs , just the same bunch
of dos and windows stuff that i 've always been running.

and when i had the 56slc (this is the 386slc system) running
dos windows , i had only one crash , and it was consistent. ftp had a
tendency to crash whenever i would get large files ( 1mb) from
particularly fast clients (dtr 's 150k 200k sec) , i figured out the
problem was with smartdrv 's write buffering if i turned off the write
buffer , everything would work fine.

ftp under os 2 has never locked , though. i can even format floppies
(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os 2.)

for instance , i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
wp 5.1 (dos) locks up my system.

yeah , i guess i'm willing to admit that os 2 is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware. wp51 for dos works perfectly fine on my slc2...

please explain. the only time i wait on anything under windows is
when i'm copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing (and even
then , not long i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per
minute , and can still go do things slowly while it 's doing
this i 've downloaded with pp @9600 while printing).

well , i save all my personal files to floppy , and when i did that
under windows , a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.

i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the
tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background.

and not being able to address your memory better than dos ,

not sure what you mean here.

the idea is that os 2 's dos sessions can see more memory than windows
dos sessions. i let xpl (a shareware calculus program) see around
720kb of free conventional memory , which lets me do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible under straight dos (where it would see
around 610kb of conventional ram.). i also found it really handy for
my own dos based programs , which , without any re writing , could now
handle larger data sets , simulate for more iterations , etc. of course ,
the point is now moot , since the os 2 programs i now write simply
never run into memory limitations. i never programmed for windows ,
so i do n't have much of a comparison here , though....

that doublespace and memmaker are both problem areas that will cause a

i received my graphite vl on thursday , and i 've had a little bit of
experience with it now. in general , it feels fast , although this
is the first vlb card that i have tried. still , the results are
impressive.

with my 486dx2 66 w 16 mb , running at 1024x768 256 , i 've had the following
wintach 1.0 results


card wp cad spread paint overall

ati graphics ultra 13.5 14.5 19.1 25.0 18.0
ati ultra (no aperture) 11.2 13.8 10.7 20.9 14.1
hercules graphite vl 16.1 67.8 41.4 52.8 44.5

unfortunately i do n't have the numbers here , but the ati ultra pro vlb
had an overall wintach score of about 26. the ultra pro was nearly as
fast in text handling , but was blown away in the cad and paint tests.

as an additional test , we hand timed a complex coreldraw ! slide resize
redraw times. there was no swapping , but i 'd expect there is a fairly
heavy load on the cpu. the graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2
seconds , with ati ultra pro at 12.0. this jives with steve gibson 's
contention that the isa graphite is faster than an ati up on his complex
micrografx draw document.

so far , i'm very impressed. the drivers look solid , and the card flies.
the installation and utilities are different , but comparable to ati 's. and
i did n't have to wait for build 59 for some reliability... with hercules'
software developer special , you can get an evaluation copy of the card for
just 225 (or 200 for the isa version). call 800 532 0600 if you want to
give it a try i'm a happy customer now !

this may be an faq (if so , please direct me to the known answer) but i
am getting frustrated and looking for help.

i am running win 3.1 with ndw 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a
6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my
applications are not giving back system resources when i close them.

i am aware this is a known problem what i am looking for are some
suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it.

1. what software is the culprit \? win 3.1 , ndw , my applications \? are
some modes of win 3.1 (standard , real , enhanced) better than others at
plugging this leak \?

it 's the applications that do this. unfortunately , even the applets
that ship with win31 seem to have this problem (i 've seen it in
solitaire , for example).

2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak \?

none that i know of. if an application does n't give back the
resources , they are lost and gone forever , pending a restart of
windows.

3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with
this \? seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a
great market for a third party memory company like qemm.

if the applications do n't free up the memory (and a lot of them
do n't) , there 's bugger all that any other piece of software can do
about it.

4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak subside \? (i was
hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this , but it seems no different
than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources.)

no. this is a problem with the applications , usually.

5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less
likely my code will eat resources \?

there are books written on this one. in general , just be sure to free
up everything that you ask for before you exit. unfortunately , i

hello phjm , you wrote

firstly , does windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode do anything special
with dlls that have been compiled using the large memory model \?

no.

we are being told that even in 386 enhanced mode windows
will load dlls into real memory below 640k and page lock it.

no.

my second question relates to static data inside dlls. is there
any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data
segment (dgroup \? ) \?

no , but...

you can allocate real static data within code segments !
when you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap.

you can forget most of what was written about memory management. under 3.1
you have paged virtual memory. you can lock every block without hampering
the memory manager. you can use far pointer everytime without always lock
unlocking the memory block.

an besides dll 's are mostly just disguised exe 's , that happen to be called
by another task.

munch


you must of read too many os 2 advertisements. crash protection is such
a marketing gimick , it is n't funny.. out of 4 months of using windows on my
new machine i 've only had it crash once , and i do n't have a run of the mill
configuration.


munch following is reformatted


it does sound funny , i will admit. but for me it is true. windows
crashed on
all of the time (and from what i have read in pc mag , this is not
the exception)


i 'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare.
windows itself almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by
an errant application (my personal favorite \? any one of the corel
3.0 programs). on the other hand , i have had os 2 crash randomly
a number of times , mostly just running it 's own applications.

for instance. today i discovered a new one. while i was downloading
with procomm plus for windows (running seamless with the standard
vga drivers on a run o' da mill vga card 640x480) , i decided that
i wanted to edit a copy of a quote that i wanted to add to my
.finger. but since i 've learned not to really trust seamless ,
i fired up a full screen winos 23.1 session. whoops , the download
finished while winos 2 was loading. it had just gotten
the pointer up , so i hit alt escape to get back t the desktop
(i have a lot of fonts , so loading takes a good long while).

blam. screen trashed , procomm hangs up. hm. well , i can sorta
see the mouse , so i clicked on the minimized winos 2 session
and got back my fullscreen windows session (but the color were
off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys).
so i closed this , and got back to the desktop (now fully restored).

pp was still sitting , window open , but it was no longer
connected to the com port so i exited it (the normal way
it told me i was still online and it would hang up , though it
was already hung up). hm. well , load anothe no , bad idea.
shutdown and reboot.

ok , refresh first.. now , shutdown. yes , everything is closed...

hm. nothing seems to be happening. let 's see.. ah , the
windows list still comes up. ok , let 's try shutdown again.

no go. huh.

alright , wait 60 seconds to see if it 's just running slow.

hmm. still seems to be running os 2. try shutdown again.
nothing. oh well. reboot. enjoy the checkdisk time.

in this case , a part of the os crashed not only itself , but
os 2 entirely (which is n't even smart enough to tell when it s
been compromised , i guess). in everyday (specifically today )
use.


os 2 gives each windows app a vdm and they ca n't touch each other or
(generally) anything they are n't supposed to have.


that 's the idea , anyway. in truth , when a program crashes on
os 2 , it will bring the system down with it. the programs that
would just gpf under windows do the same under os 2 , but programs
that are fine under dos and windows bring os 2 screaming to a halt ,
task protection or no.

for instance , i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed
wp 5.1 (dos) locks up my system. it works fine under dos or even in
a dos box under windows 3.1. (admittedly , it does n't crash if i run
wp51 full screen , but the first time this bug big me , it bit hard).



if windows works for you ,
then great. maybe this is why some people do n't see why os 2 is the os of
choice. if windows does n't crash on you , and you do n't mind waiting on each
task ,


please explain. the only time i wait on anything under windows is
when i'm copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing (and even
then , not long i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the printman per
minute , and can still go do things slowly while it 's doing
this i 've downloaded with pp @9600 while printing).



and not being able to adress your memory better than dos ,


not sure what you mean here. os 2 sees 16 megs , uses 5 or six
of these for it 's own use (more if you want to count winos 2).
windows sees 16 megs , uses 3 or 4 (more like 5 if you count the
disk cache as i am for os 2) for itself. if memory efficiency
were a big issue , pc geos would be the current king of the
intel desktop.


some of the
key reasons for using os 2 are gone. i probably would still use it , but it
would be more of an even fight.


on the other hand.. i am finally able to say with some confidence
that both os 2 and windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to
them. for instance , the machine i am sitting at runs both fine ,
while the machine next to me constantly locks up under windows.
(but ran os 2 without a hitch once i got it through a 5 crash
install). on the whole , i 'd say os 2 is a whole lot more sensitive
than windows , but there are (i suppose) machines that windows
just does n't like.


wittism of th week i think that it 's wrong to believe in an ism , you should
believe in yourself ferrish bueller


was n't this ferris bueller \?

right \?

2. in lieu of the above , is there any way to escape the cr lf in a
.bat file and continue a single command across multiple lines \? i have an
application which exits to the system and submits a batch file. the batch
file is created on the fly from site specific code stored within the
application. as currently designed , the line length for the stored code
and the output file (.bat file) is 80 characters , which is not enough for
all the options that must be specified on a particular command. it would
help tremendously if i did n't have to redesign my code to kludge around the
lack of a true batch shell programming language.

rest deleted

as a followup to my post let me add that

i'm not really a windows or windows nt user , so please excuse my ignorance.
however , i'm a developer at sas institute , and one component of the
application that i support is the ability to submit a (sas) batch job from
within an interactive sas session. the user site can enter their
site specific batch profile into a dataset within our product , specifying
the pathname to the sas executable , specifying site specific sas options ,
etc. at run time certain variables are resolved , and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file. then i exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously , returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted. the batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session.

as currently designed , the internal dataset has a record length of 80
characters. but , to run the batch job , the command to reinvoke sas in
batch mode requires more than 80 characters. up til nt this has not been a
problem , since every job control shell language up til nt (eg.
mvs cms vms unix os2) had a way to escape the cr lf and enter a single
command across multiple lines (os 2 via their rexx language , which is
standard with os 2).

the gist of all this is , since this application is for end users , not
within my company , i have to try to develop this process using native nt.
since my first posting i 've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for windows windows nt.
and i'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it , but i ca n't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with nt.

i saw another post on this list (the subject was something like is vi
available for windows \? ) in which someone said that vi , make , awk , and
ksh was available with microsoft toolkit. what is that product \? is
it a separate product or part of windows \? ksh would do what i need if i
could count on it at all nt sites.

one last question i 've heard that nt has remote processing capabilities ,
i.e. i could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there. if these are native nt commands rather than network specific
commands , this would also help me improve this process. if you can comment
on these commands , i would appreciate it.

thanks again for the help ,

i really think you are comparing apples and oranges. nobody disputes
that os 2 has more big os features. the question is does an
individual need the power. the sales of windows vs os 2 answer that
question. the next question is even if i did want to run os 2
and i had this big monster machine to run it on , is there a diverse
set of applications to run on it that allow me to productviely do my
work. go to your local computer store to answer this one.
i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os2 2.1. this
is where the new battle lines will be drawn. windows 3.1 has won
the single user pc war the next one will be the client server
war and the entries are nt , os2 2.1 , unix and netware 4.0.
granted these os 's will be eventually scaled down to be
attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii'
of the war. who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure
is fun watching and arguing about it tho.

are b w. it 's the best all color library out there , in my opinion.

2. c.a.r. graphics library (have n't counted how many images , but you can
purchase the library on 48 floppies , to give you an idea of the size).
this costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. i rate this clip art as
very high quality , but it 's only b w.

about 4 hundred bucks mailorder. i rate this clip art as very high quality
(got some awards in one of the major mac mags , forgot which). some of
the images are color , but most are b w.

for what it 's worth , all three of the cd 's are saved in multiple file formats.
they are readable on mac 's and pc 's. additionally , totem 's will mount native

after hearing endless debate (read name calling) over which os is better , dos
and windows or os 2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
of different operating systems , i have decided to put the two products to a
head to head test , as so many fellow newsposters have suggested. i have ,
however , no desire whatsoever to use a version of os 2 which wont really
do what it says (i.e. run windows apps) os 2 2.0 2.1 will not run windows
apps in 386 enhansed mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but
os 2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to. i have heard
that os 2 2.2 beta is available via ftp , and i was wondering if anyone knew
where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information , as i would like ,
once and for all , to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

robbie
z shererrg.sfasu.edu

if you wait until may the 18th you will be able to buy the new os 2
2.1 since it will be released at comdex that day. it will run windows
3.1 apps and windows enh. mode. if you ca n't wait , then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftp os2.nmsu.edu , but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product.

when you do your test , please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task. the real power of os2
lies in the multitasking and ca n't really be measured by a stopwatch.

happy benchmarking.

word 2.0c does n't show the period centred character to indicate
spaces if i use the ttfonts from coreldraw. our editors need to
be able to see how many spaces are in text but the character
displayed is a large hollow box. they overlap each other and
characters on each side , which is useless.

i believe the character used by w4w is the period centred (0183).
this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the
hollow box which tends to confirm this. i have edited the corel
font with fontmonger and changing the font graphics for the 0183
character makes no difference to the font output in charmap or w4w.
altering the paragraph (0182) or cedilla (0184) does alter their font
graphics displayed however ! !

is the w4w character used to indicate spaces the period centred character \?

this pretty much confirms my original impression after reading

the may issue of pc computing page 246 has a windows hint and tips for
just this thing. you have to edit the win.ini file and add a couple
of lines. i tried it and it works. i actually made my title bar
and iconized text , and icon text smaller. on my monitor it works well.
you can select a larger font also. you edit the win.ini file with
a font name in your system directory. read the article because i would
not want to retype it here in case i type errored and caused your

if it records the vital doubledisk info , then using it daily
should go a long way toward protecting yourself against the

shame on microsoft.


mirror is one of those dos commands that did n't survive the change
from dos 5.0. it 's been dropped , along with backup , join , edlin
and a couple other crummy old dos commands. you can still use the
5.0 commands if you absolutely have to , but they are not included

however , in mirror 's case , i'm 99.9 certain that it does not know

even so , my point still stands to an extent ... that 64k limits appear all
over the place where they really are not necessary , such as the edit control
limit.

while the 64k limit may not be necessary limitation , they probably fall
within the category of 'reasonable' limitations. if you find yourself
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64k of text , it 's probably
time take a good look at your program 's design.

why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory
handles allowed \?

in what way is 8192 a 'small' number \? it seems to me that you 'd hit the
wall in many other ways before you 'd hit the systemwide limit on global
handles , unless , of course , you 're abusing globalalloc.


and please do n't try to tell me that it 's impossible to abuse the
resources available under other operating systems. all systems have
limits. the question is whether or not the limits are reasonable . so
far , you have n't offered a single argument which suggests that windows'
limits are any less reasonable than limits in other systems.

well , i 've come into some money and want to buy cd rom , sound board
and speakers. i have not kept up on any material relating to sound
boards and cd rom 's because until now i never thought i 'd have enough
money.

so can you guru 's out there point me in the direction of a good
package including cd rom , sound , and speakers (and software i
suppose)... or since i do n't really need the cd rom right now give me
some good ideas for sound boards and speakers. those i could really
use now. i have looked at soundblaster pro , which costs about as much
as i think i want to spend on a board ( 120) , and i 've looked at the
gravis sound board , which is about 140 and i do n't know the
adv disadv of either of these boards.

right now i want to use it with any games that support sound , and to
use in windows 3.1 to utilize sound capabilities there. so any
concise info on sound boards , complete multimedia packages , etc would
be greatly appreciated. if anyone else is interested in this info i
would be glad to summarize responses and post.

and if this is some type of faq please point me in the right
direction and do n't bother taking up a lot of bandwidth. thanks !

determine the last dblspace drive required and set that as lastdrive in your
config.sys if you are using w4ww you might want to go a couple of drives higher
to give you some shared drive space. reboot and novell will set its first
drive one above the lastdrive in config.sys. you might have to remap some
of your novell drives if they were originally mapped to lower drives. make
sure that the bat file or whatever you are using to log onto novell is set
to the correct drive (one above the lastdrive setting in the config.sys file).

in article 1srg8c i54@spud.hyperion.com , the author writes
i am setting up my dos unix box on a 116m ide and a 412m scsi drive
and was wondering about the use of the (ms dos 5.0) join command. i
like the way it sets things up since i wo n't have to stick with the c
d e (crap) that dos enforces. i like how it would mimic mount
points of unix filesystems. i have heard that there were problems
with using it , or at least under older versions of dos. please tell !

i have been using the join command for many years now , mostly with good
success in duplicating unix style file mounts. you will hear lots of
people cursing join because they confuse it with the dos append command
(a truely gnarly hack) , but do n't believe them. you also will hear
people saying that microsoft recommends that you not use join. but , in
microsoft 's windows 4 workgroups resource toolkit , the following appears

join , an ms dos utility , works fine with windows for workgroups 3.1 if
you do not change the state of the joined drives during a windows for
workgroups 3.1 session. this includes adding or removing joined drives
from within windows for workgroups. we recommend that you do not use
join when running windows setup or windows for workgroups 3.1.

within this caveat , join appears to be valid under windows. however , i
have found a couple of applications that do n't deal well with filesystems
that have been mounted using join.

in particular , the worst offender is word for windows 2.0x. it gets very
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. it
wants to create the saved file as nnnnn.tmp in the current dir , then
delete the old file and rename the nnnnn.tmp file to the .doc file.

unfortunately , wfw usually writes the nnnnn.tmp file in some idiotic
place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the
joined filesystem , but not always). then , after deleting the original
.doc file , it ca n't find the nnnnn.tmp file to rename it. unless you
search your disk systems , the document is gone.

i have also found subtle problems using the mks toolkit from a dos box
when joined filesystems are present. i used to join c temp with a 4meg
ramdisk , but mks sometimes gets confused when doing an ls on the c temp
dir , and misses some files in the temp dir. (this is difficult to
reproduce , but it goes away totally when join is not used.) i think
this is a windows problem , rather than mks 's , since it works ok under raw
dos.

so , i would suggest that you can use join , but be aware that it may not
be as robust you would like.

would n't it be real great to mount network drives (i.e. z ) under the main
file tree , rather than having all those darned drive letters \? unfortunately ,
join wo n't let you do it. there was talk on the net about a simple patch
to let join work on network drives , but i do n't remember the source.

it 's too bad the join command is not better implemented , since it would
avoid using all those stupid drive letters. i realize that messdos was
meant for casual , even ignorant users , so mounting all the drives in
one file tree might be confusing. but , it looks like ms is going to carry
this over into windows nt (another os meant for casual , even igorant
users not ! ). with all it 's old family system baggage , maybe ms needs
a recovery group so they can get on with life (.

subject summary canon bj200 vs. hp deskjet 500
organization computer science department , stanford university.
lines 401


hello again ,

about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers. specifically , a comparison between the
canon bj200 (bubblejet) and the hewlett packard deskjet 500. many people
asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail i
received. below is my original query and the responses i received. i have
not deleted any part of the responses , only the headers and signatures , so
you can extract what you find necessary. some people asked me for an
unbiased account however , the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments , you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer. there are a
wide range of comments , each has its own value.

there was no clear winner , some like the bj200 (especially its
price performance ratio) , others preferred the durability and reliability
of the deskjet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background). two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention , a new
printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year (around
summertime) , and an addition to the epson product line (their first
inkjet). you will find that after the initial purchase , the costs of
re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same (this largely
depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer). no one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print , but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 1500 sheets
(laser printers will do 4000 5000 sheets per toner cartridge). well ,
that 's a brief research summary of my personal research. enjoy !



hello fellow 'netters.

i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i
should purchase , the canon bj200 (bubblejet) vs. the hp deskjet 500. i
thought , rather than trust the salesperson , i would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential. and , i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson.

now , i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360
dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett packard deskjet 500 (300 dpi).
which is faster \? is there a noticeable print quality difference ,
particularly in graphics \? which will handle large documents better (75
pages or more) any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here \? which works better under windows 3.1 (any driver problems , etc) \?
cost of memory , font packages , toner cartridges , etc \? basically , your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable ,
both good and bad.


well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their 50 rebate
program on that printer (it ends 5 31) , and i bought it from computer
discount warehouse because their price of 325 could n't be beat anywhere i
looked , and i think it 's a hot printer. just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode. i compared the
output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my
bj 200 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed
how well i could read the small print on the bj 200. printing speed was
several seconds faster on the bj 200 which is amazing considering that the
hp has 2.5m ram installed. i measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data (as i used print manager in windows).

i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office , and two other engineers placed their orders
too. if you need cdw 's phone number , it 's 800 598 4239. delivery to ny
was two days.

good luck !

i own a deskjet 500. performance is n't spectacular under windows using
truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen. quality for
the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on 'standard' photo copy
paper the characters have slightly 'frayed' edges but on better quality
'distinction' type paper things look better. for most applications i find
copy paper fine still better than dot matrix. comes with a windows
driver , which seems to by pass print manager , has a few
'intelli fonts'which are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype
but have n't really tried them out. can get ram font cartridges but unless
the speed of truetype is a problem i would n't bother. the ram cartridges
ca n't be used as buffer soft fonts only.

for graphics , i.e. bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via
the hp supplied win driver. there a number of dither options such as
'scatter' , 'pattern' etc. the manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed. text is not so good in this mode. problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text. the
range of tones for graphic images is n't brilliant but i think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general.

from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects.

however , a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
epson. this printer is faster , cheaper , and capable of producing
laser like quality on normal copier paper. ca n't remember the model , lx
something i think \?

i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here . the
introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand.



about a month ago , i got a canon bj200. i absolutely love it. it is
incredibly fast , except for printing from pspice (i do n't know if you ever
do stuff with that or not.) most of the stuff i print is either from
microsoft word for windows or just plain text. the only problems i 've had
are printing headers footers (the printer freaked out) , and printing on
cheap paper (lots of streaks). normal copy paper works great with it , you
can only tell it 's not laser printed by holding it , oh , less than twelve
inches from your face. (that is , if you 're nearsighted , like me ! ) ) the
printer comes with its own driver for windows 3.1 ! ! i have no other
complaints. the printer also can act just like some epson or another for
those archaic software packages that have n't written a driver for it yet.
the teeny weeny footprint is a real plus , too and , if you purchase it
between now and may 31 , you get a 50 rebate from canon ! ! i bought mine
from a store called compusa , and the price now is 340. i have a friend
who has the hp you are looking at. it also prints very well , and everyone
has drivers for it , but it is very slow !

hope i helped !

(360dpi sure looks great ! )

i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj 300 at work and a
deskjet 500 at home. i prefer the deskjet. the printing speed and quality
are similar (i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet
for home). the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications. the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm
proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time. the design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper , the deskjet is quieter , and the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs.

yes , there is the landscape mode printing problem , but it does not
present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the
translation. i actually thought of some other points after i posted the
note. the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately .5inch around
the paper the bubblejet does not. you are right about the graphics
resolutions , i tested the printers with the applications i had access to
wordperfect , harvard graphics , wingif , paintshop pro , and paintbrush and
could not tell a difference. in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down. the bubblejet did not.
i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no
comparision there. finally , i wanted sheet feeding. in that configuration
the bubblejet cost approximately 100 more than the deskjet.

i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i
spent my own money. btw , i am replacing the bj 300 with a deskjet 500 at
work this month anyway.

i spent some time comparing the two. we ended up getting the bubblejet
bj 200 versus the hp. our reasons were

1) the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon
2) 360dpi versus 300 we felt we could see the difference
3) price canon has a 50 rebate program going on at the moment.

the bj 200 was our choice over the bj 10ex we could have 100 pages in the
bj 200 feeder. the bj 10ex holds only 30 pages , i think.

as you can see , up to 100 pages on the bj 200. we have n't done anything
big with the bj , but its performance seems reasonable under windows. i
know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the
printer , but i do n't know how it compares (also the driver included with
the printer is canon 's whereas i do n't know where the microsoft bbs one
comes from microsoft \? )

hope this helps.

altough i'm sometimes also a salesperson (if i'm not suppost to study ))
i would recommend to buy the bj200. the printing quality is a bit better ,
but you you 've got much more possiblities. do n't forget the hp engine is at
least 2 years on the marked , the canon engine (witch is also used in
other new bubblejet printers like e.g. the epson ones) is quite recently
available..

now , i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360
dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett packard deskjet 500 (300 dpi).
which is faster \? is there a noticeable print quality difference ,
particularly in graphics \? which will handle large documents better (75

i 've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me
canon printers) 2 times the same picture , one printed with the bj200 , one
with the canon , the other with the hp , and.. there was a difference in
printing quality , .. the canon was a bit better..

when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to
inkjet printers. they have near laser quality , speed , and they are quiet.
we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj 200s. i prefer the paper handling
qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print
quality. the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder , however i did end
up buying a deskjet for home use (got too good a deal). anyway , we are
using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well. out
of 15 deskjets and 4 bj 200s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and
that was taken care of very quickly by hp.

whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say , pick out the top
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt. i 've been
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so i 've done this a
few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers.

i ca n't remember much about the process except that i read about three
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top. i
bought the 500c because of the added dimension of colour (i intend to build
a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner
towards that). although i haven 's used the colour thing in earnest yet i
tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the
result.

i note that even though you can now get the 550c (the one with both colour
and mono with no need to change the cartridge) , the 500c and 500 are still
readily available (at least in the uk). the following are my
views experience

1. i do n't know anything about the canon except that i came away
from reviews (and replies to a posting similar to yours) with
the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio.

2. i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the
ideal place to be but the market 's still young so one assumes
they have the expertise.

3. the 500c is worth the extra. operation in mono is perfectly
acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from
windows.

4. i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured
typesetters (before their american owners closed them down ! )
and i can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is
pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor...

5. the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers.

6. if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it 's pretty
slow with it , god knows what it 's like without !

i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it 's not in daily
use. i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and
having a really dumb problem at the start it 's easy peasy to operate.

hope this is of use.

just bought the bj 200. i thought the price could n't be beat ( 329 , with
50 rebate thru 5 31) and so far it is comparable , even superior , to the
deskjet in print quality.

speed per page rate seems to be faster (i do n't have figures).
i do n't print long docs , though.

quality i think the graphics quality is excellent. print quality is
excellent as well , unless you use small fonts and hold it up
close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet.
the 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the
page print head in place , i would imagine.

large docs not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages ...
manual says up to 100 , though. have n't tried it.

drivers no problems under win3.1 yet. winword does n't want to print
the envelopes the same way the canon does , though.

know nothing of add on costs.

daniel a. hartung dhartung@chinet.chinet.com ask me about rotaract



the deskjet is slow. this is in comparison to the other printers i
mentioned. i have no idea how the bubblejet compares.

the interface between win3.1 and the printer is just dandy , i 've not
had any problems with it.

i just bought a bj 200 printer a couple of days ago. i compared it to the
sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp was n't for me. the
bj 200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. i can compare
it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical (

wow , it 's funny you should ask this. i'm a little behind in news reading
so i know this may be late.

i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night. i was really worried
that i would n't like it but the print quality , and noise level is
fantastic ! i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it
printed damn near laser quality. you ca n't tell it 's not laser unless you
get 2 inches from the page.

no problems with drivers. the printer came with the driver diskette
which is good because i was beginning to panic when i could n't findi it
under windows or wordperfect. it works well under both. i have yet to
install word for windows so do n't know how it works with them.

i had a deskjet 500 at work last year. it was a good printer as well ut
i felt it was awfully slow. and much noisier than the bubblejet. i wo n't
say the bubblejet is much better , but i really do like it more. just my
0.02 worth.

i have tried installing various dos comm progs on friends' machines , most of

1) always run the prog thru a .pif , never by calling its .exe , 2) in the .pif
always toggle on lock application memory actually this is something
ms points out in the readme.wri file , and is especially critical for downloading
3) go under ctrl panel 386 enh and check for all your com ports 'alway warn'
it will help u w. debugging this thing and it 's 'healthier' 4) check where
are u running the mouse from com port 5) check the com port addresses from

these might help u... if yu still have problems , get 100 and buy procomm win.. ,

hmmm. i gave two examples which matched your objective criteria , and your
response was some subjective claptrap about them being 'lame'. you never
did counter the fact that those examples fit your objective criteria.

i repeat. what are they \? you mentioned what you tried to present as
innovative , but what new concept was brought to market \? an efficient
basic \? basic existed before , and efficiency is not original either.
ole \? what new concept does that bring \? document oriented computing \?
the mac had that before msw. you simply have n't made your point the
burden of proof is upon you.

my exact challenge what new computing concept has ms brought to
market first \? nothing more , nothing less. explain how your examples
fit that criterion.

hmm...has anyone of us computer geeks (me included) ever consider
that inovation is not limited to software hardware. true , ms
products do not boast features that ms invented , but how many products
out there by other vendors out there are truely innovative in
their continuing development \?

i think what makes ms special to the public is thier innovative pricing.
it is true the xwindows mac next all have some feature(s) in thier gui
that are better than ms. but people like me ca n't afford them.
it is true that apple has lower their pricing on the low end models..
but they are just that...low end. system 7 is a better operating
system , but the machines they operate on just are too expensive for
my tastes...a unix platform is powerful enuf , but tell the common
user to set up .xdefault (i am still confused on what some of them things
do) and they either puke or faint.

if u think about it , low prices aint innovative if u come down to it. but
for the product it offers and on the lower cost (and powerful hardware
that it runs on as compare to macs)....ms is kinda innovative..

oh yea , i guess the fact that the support products and applications
they have garnered for mswindows does make them kinda innovative too..

you 're right.

you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii 800k 3.5 disk or apple ii
5.25 disk without extra hardware. however , mac 1.44mb disks can be read
and written in a pc 3.5 hd drive with software only.

this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file. it sure gets
asked enough.

i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list. but we have
strayed from the original topic. our computer environment is pretty split
between mac 's and pc 's... i am lucky and get to have both on my desk. but
there are people who have pc 's and need to share data with the mac users
here. the mac users have no problems because of package called dos mounter
which automatically lets the mac read dos disks natively. for the pc there
is no equivilant... that i know of ! both mac ette and macsee have been
inconsistant under the dos platform , and requires you to perform the activity
in a dos program to selectively transport the files.

the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into
windows like a .dll that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is
in a pc , and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs. it is quite
clear that this would only be available for the 1.44mb flopies.

would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing. those
who are familiar with directory opus on the amiga know what i'm
looking for.
i have written the file manager hfm , wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or
similar files. the 7 most important operations , copy , move , delete ,
show the file , start a progam , navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. this is very
convenient , because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed , occur in one move. for bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated , for spreadsheat and database files
i use the view program from pctools 7.1. hfm can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. it does
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
this filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface , but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager
in several labs in our university.
the drawback of this filemanager is , it 's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun. i use the
program package run18.zip , where run tells its windows companion
sched.exe which windows program should be started. in this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox. the new version 3.19
(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
windows program start.

really when you come down to it who cares. i just hope ms keeps doing
what they do best getting usable productive software to the masses.

lets see... what ms products do n't have major bugs in them \? oh , but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up , even if their
customers must buy new releases from them that are little more than
bug fixes. anyone who buys a 2500 computer system and then runs ms
windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.

oh wait ! ms innovated the plastic housing on the ms mouse did n't

personally , i 'll be blasphemous and say that if microsoft keeps doing
what it does so well , i hope to see much harsher stricter copyright
and patent laws for computer algorithms , concepts , interfaces , and
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators. i 'd hate to
be one who actually does innovate , and then have microsoft come in
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass (development staff ,
marketing , etc) to get fat off of my innovation. i do n't have all
that much sympathy for apple 's complaint against microsoft , since
they just took the ideas from xerox 's pa research center when the
federal government forced xerox to disclose their patents over
antitrust fears. however , for other companies and individuals who
have a great idea , yet get it borrowed by larger corporations who
can afford to quickly bring it to market , without any licensing from
the original innovator , i feel much sympathy.

is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker.

so i think there are 2 possibilities

1) i'm right. if my disk really crashes , i would at least have to
re install dos and windows to get the backup program working.
2) i'm wrong. there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk

unix x as easy to learn and use. more stable multitasking.


the following three are not the competition for windows 3.0 (imho of course)
system 7 does not currently run on intel boxes
nextstep rather expensive should be a competitor to windows nt not 3.x
unix x


with the exception of os 2 all of the above will require most users
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that
run under these os 's. and basically money speaks louder than anything
else. you keep saying more stable multitasking is what you mean
not multi finder gem geoworks co operative multi tasking but
real honest to goodness prioritized pre emptive multi tasking \?

with the prpoer setup , all of these will exchange data with msw machines as
well as msw machines will amongst themselves , so interoperability is not
an issue.

basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for
quite a long time , but are still to blind to know it.


by this criterion , it is inferior. if you have another , then perhaps i am
incorrect. do you pick up the glove \?


why pick it up \? you stated the reasons behind your opinions. stated them in
a very straight forward , though over protective , manner. and aside from
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor , i think we are in
agreement.

does tim glauert agree \? let 's wait and see.

one can only remap special command keys in procomm it seems. i
would like to remap other keys too especially altgr 2 , and
such combinations.

anybody know a plain or dirty way to do this \? \? (of cause most
people settle for remapping function keys , but i do n't see
why there should be a limitation...)

winfax pro provides you with ocr. it is the ocr from omnipage.
although it is not as customizable it does the job and is auto
matic (if you want) and much cheaper than the same package
(omni page professional 700) sold separatly.

last time i check winfax pro was only 100 \? \?

bs this is also how you can put your own logo into the windows startup

brad ,
what is the procedure used to 'specially' compress the bmp file \? i would

love to use some of my bmp files i have created as a logo screen. thanks

i thought i 'd reply to this , though i ai n't brad. at any case , a lot
of picture file viewers that will convert , say , between .gif , etc , to
.bmp will convert to .rle. i know for a fact that paintshop
(shareware from cica desktop , i think , filename psvvv.zip (i think ,
where vvv is the ver. number. if that 's not true , let me know and i ll
post a corection).


this , however , will write your .rle file with a .bmp extension , so you
have to rename it.

now , another thing....
this is from the windows' faq

your file has to be less than 64 k
( at least that 's what the faq says , but mine wont work for more than
about 30...maybe they mend 32k , i do n't know).

your file has to fit vga size (480 860 , or whatever standard vga size
is.) if you use a non vga screen (e.g. cga , ega , svga , there is also a
way to do it , but i thing instead of vgalogo.lgo you use another file ,
such as cgalogo.lgo , egalogo.lgo , or something. i'm not sure about
this , as i have a vga , but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a
windows help ver. of which is available at cica , but do n't konw the
filename).

also....your .bmp has to be 16 colours or less.

these specs rule out some of the good .bmp 's. i found cartoon drawings
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little
memory.

finally , remember to save your current win.com before , and put your
new win.com in the windows directory. also , do n't start windows from a
directory where another win.com is present , as that is used instead of
the one in the windows dir , and win. wo n't start.


share this fairly , but do n't take a slice of my pie (pf).

a couple of error messages along the lines of

similar for the font fences.

i know i have these fonts on my system but are unable to use them.
i have tried both of these solutions to no avail.

if anyone has had similar problems and has found a way to fix this , could
they let me know. it is urgently required ! !

thanks ,


it's back ! ! ! ! ! !

congratulations , you 've just discovered a very nasty , and very frequently
ecountered , bug in the word setup program. once you know what is wrong , it
is quite easy to fix. go into the fonts dialog under control panel , and select
the two fonts mt extra and fences. delete them , but only delete the list
entries , not the disk files. now select add , and add the fonts mt extra plain
and fences plain. close the font box , close control panel , and restart word.
everything should be alright now.

does anyone know if microsoft has fixed this thing yet \? they have to know
about it by now , it 's been so frequently reported.
