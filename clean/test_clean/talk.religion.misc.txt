i was n't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to , but i guess
the misc is there for a reason. here goes... i am getting married in june to
a devout (wisconsin synod) lutheran. i would classify myself as a strong
agnostic weak athiest. this has been a a subject of many discussions between
us and is really our only real obstacle. we do n't have any real difficulties
with the religious differences yet , but i expect they will pop up when we have
children. i have agreed to raise the
children nominally lutheran. that is , lutheran traditions , but trying to
keep an open mind. i am not sure if this is even possible though. i feel that
that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.

anyway , i guess i 'll get on with my question. is anyone in the same
situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this \? we 've
taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting
anything get bottled up inside. sometimes i get the feeling we 're making this
much bigger than it actually is. any comments would be greatly appreciated.

subject objectivity (was after 2000 years...)
organization tektronix , inc. , wilsonville , or.
lines 83

this discussion on objective seems to be falling into solipsism (eg the
recent challenge from frank dwyer , for someone to prove that he can actually
observe phenomena). someones even made the statement that science is
subjective and that even atom are subjective. this is getting a bit silly
and the word objective is losing all meaning. lets start by remembering the
definition of objective which has been already presented

objective adj. 1. of or having to do with a material object as
distinguished from a mental concept. 2. having actual existence.
3.a. unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. based on
observable phenomenon.

the objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that
thing (eg the world is objectively round , regardless of the fact that there
exist flat earthers) , but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable
phenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes , feeling , mental
processes , etc). thus atoms , being based on very observable and repeatable
phenomenon , are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective.
even weird , high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though
that observation can change the outcome). nor are those observable phenomenon
affected by emotion , or personal prejudice (eg chemical reactions do not
change to the whims of different people). thus to say that science is not
objective (ie objectively verifiable) is a bit silly , as that is the
point of science. now i will agree that science is not objectively good i
will not thereby conclude though that science is not objective.

now some examples things which are objective a d 12 tractor is larger
than the average breadbox. chlorophyll is green. seawater contains salt.
there exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently). ozone blocks
ultraviolet light. ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin cancer.

good on the other hand is a value judgement. it does n't seem to have an
existence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the
existence of an omnipotent entity which has defined good ). we cannot
quantify it , touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg i have a bag
full of good ). now we do sometimes attempt to give the word good an
objective meaning , e.g. good has been used to denote strength , resiliency ,
speed , etc. that though , is a subjective definition , as some might not see
strength and etc , as necessarily good (eg strength inspired by naziism
is not generally viewed as good ).

as to a morality , i cannot say that i have ever seen a morality strictly based
on verifiable observable phenomenon. the closest i have seen is some form of
the golden rule , which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss
people off , as they will likely then involve themselves in your life , in a
manner you wo n't like. this is verifiable when you get in someone 's face ,
they will often retaliate. another objective fact about morality is that a
more powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group , and thus can
at times , ignore that form of the golden rule without fear of reprisal. now
as to whether this enforcing of morality is good or bad , is quite
subjective. by the way , remember that subjective does not mean that a thing
cannot be formally stated , or even commonly agreed upon it only means that
that it is not verifiable from observable phenomena , or has a physical
existence unto itself. also note that i have not stated that there is no such
thing as an objective morality , or that i could not accept any such a
morality i have simply stated that i have seen no evidence of any such
morality.

one other thing to notice , objective is many times used as synonymous with
true and or absolute , and subjective sometimes has the connotation of
false and or relative. tai n't necessarily so. for instance , when a
conclusion is based on objective , but insufficient evidence , then it can be
both objective and false. as to absolute , it is easy to note that while we
can objectively show that tnt is explosive , but that does not absolutely mean
that all tnt will explode , and thus objective is not necessarily absolute
either. on the other hand , something subjective can also be either
absolutist , or true. for instance , there are some theists who are
specifically absolutist in their morality , even though they have only
subjective evidence to back it up. further , many a scientist and detective
has been motivated by subjective reasons (eg a gut feeling or hunch ) , to
investigate a phenomena or situation , and gather the objective evidence
necessary to support a true hypothesis. on the whole though , i would have to
agree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective
evidence.

later ,

dave butler

in starting any thesis , it seems to me , one should put forward as one 's
point of departure something incontrovertible the expression should be

a certain ruler asked jesus , good teacher , what must i do to

ken , the book of romans states that we are born sinners. we do
not grow into being a sinner. we sin because we are sinners. the
common mistake , even in christian circles , is to think the reverse
true. so for as surely as you grew to look like you parents ,
you not only inherited their appearance , but also their sin nature.
it goes with being human.

even though a new born is innocent as can be , his sinful nature
will surely manifest itself more explicity as he gets older. for
as surely as he grows hair on his head and teeth within his mouth ,
he will show the signs of his innate sin by rebelling

god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god , of course... ! ) \? \?


he is god.

in other words , the right of might.

in his infinite wisdom , he made it perfectly clear that if we do n't live
according to his rules , we will burn in hell. well , with what right can god
make that desicion \?

he is god.

in other words , the right of might.

let 's say , for the sake of argument , that god creates every
one of us (directly or indirectly , it does n't matter.). what then happens , is
that he first creates us , and then turns us lose. well , i did n't ask to be
created.


god granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.

in other words , he can do it , he did it , and your in no position to
argue about it.

let 's make an analogue. if a scientist creates a unique living creature (which
has happened , it was even patented... ! ! ! ) , does he then have the right to
expect it to behave in a certain matter , or die... \?


the scientist creates the living creature to examine it , poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour. he will kill it if it becomes a threat. for
example , let 's say the scientist creates a tyrannosaurus rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population. the scientist
would not hesitate in killing it.

god creates us to be his loving companions. he knows whether we are true in
our love for him or not. and he lets us know the consequences of rejecting him.
god cannot abide by sin. by rejecting god , a person becomes an enemy of god ,
one that must be killed by him. note i say that god and god alone is
worthy to be judge , jury and executioner. we are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy.

in other words , you better do what this god wants you to do , or else !

who is god to impose its rules on us \? who can tell if god is really so
righteous as god likes us to believe \? are all christians a flock of sheep ,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest \?


god is god. who are we to question the creator \? if you doubt god 's doing
in certain situations , do you claim to know a better solution \? would you
be playing the role of god \?

in other words , its his game , he made the rules , and if you know whats
good for you you 'll play his game his way.

from the sermon on the mount matt 6 5 6 and when you
pray , do not imitate the hypocrites they love to say their
prayers standing up in the synagogues and at the street
corners for people to see them. i tell you solemnly , they
have had their reward. but when you pray , go to your
private room and , when you have shut your door , pray to
your father who is in that secret place.

but no. they want public prayers , the better to manipulate
children. amen indeed.

when the pro school prayer types stop trying to sneak religion
in , i 'll stop opposing everything that even looks remotely
like religion , thank you.

i hope you do n't mind if i say amen to this \? )

nunnally@acs.harding.edu (john nunnally) writes
when are we going to hear a christian answer to this question \?
in paraphrase
on what or whose authority do christians proclaim that they
are above the law and above the prophets (7 major and 12 minor) and not
accountable to the ten commandments of which jesus clearly spoke his opinion
in matthew 5 14 19 \? what is the source of this pseudo doctrine \? who is
the pseudo teacher \? who is the great deceiver \?
ok , here 's at least one christian 's answer
jesus was a jew , not a christian. in this context matthew 5 14 19 makes
sense. matt 5 17 do not think that i jesus came to abolish the law or
the prophets i did not come to abolish , but to fulfill. jesus lived
under the jewish law. however , he was the culmination of the promises
of the prophets. he came to fulfill the prophecies and fully obey
god 's purposes.
verse 18 says for truly i say to you , until heaven and earth pass
away , not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the law ,
until all is accomplished. the key to this verse imho is the last
phrase. jesus , as the fulfillment of the law , accomplished what the
law was supposed to accomplish.

jesus did not say that he was the fulfillment of the law , and , unless
i'm mistaken , heaven and earth have not yet passed away. am i mistaken \?
and , even assuming that one can just gloss over that portion of the word
of jesus , do you really think that all is accomplished \?

verse 19 whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments ,
and so teaches others , shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven
but whoever keeps and teaches them , he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven. taken in the context of jesus teaching jewish
people about living lives under the law , this makes sense.

then why did n't jesus say any jew who annuls ... in v. 19 \? are you
saying that all of jesus' recorded words mean nothing to gentiles \? are
you really saying that jesus only spoke for and to the jews \? jesus
did n't mention your name , does that mean he was n't speaking to you \? when
you read the words of jesus , do you think he is speaking to someone
other than you \?

in general , it appears that jesus is responding to some criticism he
must have received about doing away with the law. that was not
jesus' intent at all.

you said above that jesus was the fulfillment of the law. are you
saying that does not mean doing away with the law \?

he had come to earth to live the law as it
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by god to his
people all the way back to eve gen 3 15 the serpent will bruise your
heel , but he will bruise his head.

gen3 15(jps) i will put enmity between you and the woman , and between
your offspring and hers they shall strike at your head , and you shall
strike at their heel.

gen3 15(nrsv) i will put enmity between you and the woman , and between your
offspring and hers he will strike your head , and you will strike his
heel.

gen3 15(kjv) and i will put enmity between thee and the woman , and
between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head , and thou shalt
bruise his heel.

looks like your translation has taken a few liberties with the word \?

jesus appeared to be doing away with the law
because he did not honor the traditions of men as
equal to the law of god. he regularly locked horns with the religious
leaders of the day because he would not conform to their rules , only
god 's law.
in the matthew passage jesus is defending his dedication to the law
and defending himself against his accusors. almost the entire sermon
on the mount (matt. 5 7) is dedicated to helping the jewish people
understand the true intent of the law , sweeping away the clutter which
had been introduced by the pharasees and their traditions.

only helping the jewish people \?

in galatians 3 23 26 , paul describes the relationship of jesus to the
law in this way
23 but before faith came , we were kept in custody under the law , being
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed. 24 therefore
the law has become our tutor to lead us to christ , that we may be
justified by faith. 25 but now that faith has come , we are no
longer under a tutor. 26 for you are all sons of god through faith
in christ jesus.
i believe this says that after christ was revealed , the law had
served it 's purpose , i.e. our tutor to lead us to christ , and
now , we are no longer under a tutor. the law has been fulfilled
as christ said he would do.

you are using your interpretation of paul as an argument against the
clear words of jesus \?

god , the author of the old law , and the christ man , jesus , are the same
personality. therefore , the old law and the new testament (the last
will and testament of jesus) are based on the same moral principles.
it makes sense that many of the principles in the old law are
re expressed in christianity.

re expressed \? care to define that a bit better \?

on the other hand , now that the law has fulfilled it 's purpose and

what \? are heaven and earth gone away \? where did they go \? is all
accomplished , for example revelations \? explain please.

christians relate to god through christ , not the law , it also makes
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to
represent the mysteries of this new relationship. i.e. baptism
representing christ 's death , burial , and resurrection (rom. 6 3 8) ,
the lord 's supper as a memorial to his sacrifice (i cor. 11 26) , and
sunday as a day of worship commemorating his resurrection (matt 28 1ff ,
acts 20 7)

again , your interpretation of paul versus the clear word of jesus. do
you see any problems here \? when did heaven and earth go away \? when was
all accomplished \?

ok , that 's one christian 's explanation. i do n't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and i welcome
other christians to offer other alternatives.
please excuse the long posting. thanks for your interest if you have read
this far...

subject commandments i (the basics)
organization panix public access unix , nyc
lines 205

why should anyone (check let 's restrict this to christians , why do we )
want to find commandments in the books regarded as scripture \? what 's
going on \? i will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more
open) as not the kind of issue to deal with here the question is what is
the theological point involved \? and it has been quoted at me often
enough by those who do n't believe i take it seriously , that jesus (is said
to have) said , if you love me , you will obey my commands. john 14 15

i am , like any christian , the slave of christ , and it is my will that i
should do as he wills me to do. i am (also , or instead) his younger brother ,
but still under his direction , though we both call god abba. christians ,
therefore , will try to find what it is that their lord commands them , and
discovering it will feel obligated to do it , or to confess their failure.
readers here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as slaves of
christ ) the point is that adherents of a religion will read the texts
(whether classified as inspired or not) that are held up as models , in an
effort to find application to their own situations. this practice ranges
from devotional reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon
ical scripture as the word of god. and at the highest pitch , this leads
to a question of whether we can find in inspired scripture something that
can act as absolute guidance for our actions.

the problem is in finding out just what it is our lord commands. i am
going to set aside for this essay one major direction in which christians
have looked for these commands , namely christian tradition. that is not
because i reject tradition , but because my primary audience in this essay
is protestants , who deny tradition a determinative value , in favor of the
witness of scripture. the question i want to deal with is , what commandments
can we find from our lord in scripture \? and that turns out to be a hard
question. if any of my protestant inquisitors would like to turn the
discussion to the authority of tradition , i can accomodate them ) , unlike
most protestants , episcopalians admit claims from a) scripture b) reason
and c) tradition on roughly equal standing.

earlier in john than my quote above , we read john 13 34 i give you a new
commandment love one another. this is the only place in the nt where
christians are given an explicit commandment , with the context commenting
on its imperative mode pronouncement by jesus. at the same meal so we
readers infer , since it is not in john , but in the synoptics jesus
says , take this bread this is my body. mark 14 22 , cf. matthew 26 26 ,
luke 22 19 , 1 corinthians 11 24 the mode is imperative (greek labete ) ,
and hence this , too , is a commandment.

in both cases we have to infer that the command is directed to a wider
circle than the immediate collocation of disciples because we judge the
evangelist 's point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or
entirely dead) is that we are expected to follow this as a commandment
from our lord. in the case of communion , paul 's mention (at least this
is probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy
in which these words operate to bind christians to the original command
to his disciples , as a continuing commandment to the christian community.

i am entirely comfortable with this inference , but i must point out that
it is there , between us and the occasion on which jesus spoke the command.
i take it as a clear inference , at the very least the evangelist's notion ,
that all christians are called to love one another , in jesus' command
directed at the disciples. but i have to call attention to the inference.
the command cannot apply to me without the generalization from the specific
context of its statement to my own context as a disciple of christ.

all reading of scripture has to make such inferences , to get any sense out
of the text whatsoever. this is a general problem in reading these texts
we cannot read them at all without our own understanding of our native
languages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts , and without
some appreciation of the original context (and at points , the original
languages , when english misleads us.) i am going to presume , in what follows ,
that we have the general problem of how to read scripture under control
i do n't really think this is true , but it will suffice for my current
purposes. i will address only the issues that arise when we have already
coped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world
than the one we live in. questions at that level only introduce more reser
vations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we
can read the texts as the original audience might have done.

among the reasons we have for seeing john 's agapate allelou as a general
commandment (not merely an instruction by jesus to this disciples on that
one occasion) , and one linking it to the synoptic great commandment is
that we have criticism , from jesus , about limiting our love to those whom
we congenially associate with. in matthew 5 43ff we read , you have learnt
how it was said 'you must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy. but i
say to you love your enemies. in fact , the leviticus context quoted
does not say 'hate your enemy' it is merely the common human presumption.
(and leviticus is at pains to say that the love should extend to strangers
amongst the people of israel.) luke , in expanding on this same q context ,
goes on to have jesus say. even sinners love those who love them. 6 27
all of this suggests quite strongly , i 'd say ) that limiting the
scope of the new commandment is not quite what jesus has in mind. in
short , inference leads me to generalizing the actual text to a command
that is in force on christians , and with objects not limited to other
christians.

trickier than the agapate allelou or institution of communion , there is
the case of the great commission where (matthew 10 , mark 6) the twelve
are sent out to evangelize , proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close
at hand. the verb is imperative ( ke russete ) , but the context is rather
specific to the twelve , and there are further specifiers (as in do not
turn your steps to pagan territory , and do not enter any samaritan town
the lukan parallels are even more specific to jesus' final journey to
jerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all christians
than the previous examples. that has n't prevented christians from making
such an inference what i have to call attention to is that such inference
is not justified in the text , nor (unlike the first two cases i cite) by
the rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader. still , paul seems to
have felt obliged to proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand
even (contrary to jesus' instructions to the 12 )) to the gentiles , to
the ends of the earth. so , christians after him have also taken this as
a commandment in the sense of john 14 15. do i accept this \? i do n't
know. it is surely rather speculative. but you see how the ripples of
inference spread out from the text that is the pretext christians (may)
infer a general commandment , applicable to all , from what is presented in
the gospels as a specific occasion. i do not (necessarily) object to this
kind of generalization but i insist that people who make it must
have an understanding that they are reasoning (at some considerable
length) from what we actually have in scripture. there are assumptions
involved in this reasoning , and these are not themselves scriptural
(though people will do their best to justify their assumptions by other
references to scripture which simply adds more inference into the mix ! )

let 's move on to the great commandment that we should love god with
our whole hearts and minds and souls. this is , perhaps , the synoptic
equivalent of john 's agapate allelou . and yet , it is not presented
as a commandment , in our texts. rather , the context is controversy with
the pharisees. to cite matthew 22 34ff

but when the pharisees heard that he had silenced the sadducees
they got together and , to disconcert him , one of them put a question ,
master , which is the greatest commandment of the law \?

it is by no means obvious here (though i accept it as such) that jesus'
answer is meant to be a commandment to christians . he is answering a
polemic from his enemies. mark 's account , in 12 28 34 casts the answer
in a far more positive light as (so the scribe in this version says)
far more important than any holocaust (i need to point out that this word
originates in the context of animal sacrifice forget the nazis for this)
or sacrifice. luke is intermediate he has a lawyer posing the question
to disconcert jesus , and gets the good samarian parable for his pains
luke 10 25 37 . the contexts here are so confusingly various that one
could be forgiven for drawing no inferences ) in no account is this
said as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on
christians though i think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each
case that jesus thinks it to be so. the point is that our mental gears
have to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about
what we are commanded to do , by jesus. and all of this is contingent on
our understanding the point of jesus' use of the torah in the (all quite
different) gospel accounts , and the application of such a context to us .

the different contexts among the synoptics are curious. it should be noted
that only in luke do we get the fixing of this command by the parable of
the good samaritan. we may look for an analogous intent in matthew , where
7 12 gives the golden rule as the meaning of the law and the prophets
(and where we may also hear an echo of hillel saying the same , a generation
before jesus.) if we make these associations (which i think are entirely
reasonable) , we are again indulging in inference. the texts do not
explicitly support us rather , we read the texts as having this kind of
inter relationship. current literary theory calls this intertextuality.

my discussion of why the agapate allelou has to apply beyond the
community of the disciples , and beyound the circle of christian believers ,
applies again here , to buttress a conclusion that this is (despite the
presentation not saying so explicitly) a commandment to christians.
few christians would disagree with my conclusions but i must point
out that they are conclusions , they depend on rather elaborate chains
of reasoning that are simply not present in the texts , themselves.

the contextual problem keeps coming up , more and more severely as we look at
those sayings of jesus that are not so universally taken by christians as
commandments. and we get some really hard cases. take divorce. mark is
pretty clear , the man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty
of adultery against her. 10 11 , cf. luke 16 18 except that matthew
has an escape clause except in the case of fornication , 5 31 . this
seems to be a rather clear commandment (whether or not we take matthew 's
reservation) and some christians , to this day , take it so. but some do n't ,
at least in practice. this is rather peculiar it is not as if jesus were
not explicit about this (whereas he says nothing at all about some of the
things people gnash their teeth over.) how is it possible , if the commands
of christ are clear , that matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists
of the synoptic tradition \?

i'm going to continue this examination , into ever murkier waters , but this
is enough to start with. the theme is finding commandments in scripture
is an exercise in inference our inferences are informed by our assumptions ,
that is , our own cultural biases. i have , so far , identified a very few
commandments that are generally accepted by all christians and yet in
these , already , some of the difficulties start to surface. it is these
difficulties i want to discuss in my next essay on this topic. the divorce
commandment already strikes at some of the difficulties i see almost no
evidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn
me with , spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or
misc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce , or demanding that
us law refuse to allow it , or refuse unrepentant divorcees places in
their churches. that is not to say that divorce does n't enter into
consideration in general it is most definitely a matter of concern , in
even the most liberal church circles. for example , a (wildly) liberal
episcopalian priest of my aqauintence , in a (wildly) liberal diocese , has
recommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a
private secular ceremony before a judge , so that the public ceremony
he celebrated need not go through an agonizing examination by officials
who would just as soon not take on this role of interpreting the commands
we are faced with as christians. this , in a church that was effectively
created by a famous divorce !

summary in response to mike cobb.


in article c5ztju.fkx@news.cso.uiuc.edu cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (mike cobb) writes
why is the nt tossed out as info on jesus. i realize it is
normally tossed out because it contains miracles , but what
are the other reasons \?

far from being tossed out , the gospels are taken , almost
universally , as the primary source of information about jesus.
i am curious as to whom mike cobb is referring. who tosses out
the new testament \? undoubtedly a few naive atheists do this ,
but the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that cobb
ascribes this more broadly.

perhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is
why , except for some naive believers (who , unfortunately , far
outnumber nonbelievers , both naive and critical) , are the gospels
not taken as gospel truth that faithfully records just what
happened two thousand years ago \? this has an easy answer , and
the answer has nothing to do with miracles no text is taken
this way by a critical reader.

there is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text ,
measures it by some set of criteria , and then either confirms the
text as historically valid or tosses out the text. i suspect
this myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and
secondary school , where certain texts are vested with authority ,
and from writers such as josh mcdowell who pretend to present
historical arguments along these lines for their religious
program. in fact , most texts used in primary and secondary
school history classes ought to be tossed out , even the better
such texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed
above , and josh mcdowell would not know a historical argument if
it bit him on the keister twice.

let me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts
and their use in studying history. first , all texts are
historically valid. all texts. or to put this another way , i
have never seen a notion of historical validity that makes any
sense when applied to a text. second , no text should be read as
telling the gospel truth about historical events , in the way
that many students are wont to read history texts in primary and
secondary school. no text. (this includes your favorite
author 's history of whatever.)

every text is a historical fact. every text was written by some
person (or some group of people) for some purpose. hence , every
text can serve as historical evidence. the question is what can
we learn from a text \? of what interesting things (if any) does
the text provide evidence \?

the diaries of the followers of the maharishi , formerly of
oregon , are historical evidence. the gospels are historical
evidence. the letters of the officers who participated in the
vampire inquests in eastern europe are historical evidence. the
modern american history textbooks that whitewash great american
figures are historical evidence. these are all historical
evidence of various things. they are not much evidence at all
that the maharishi , formerly of oregon , could levitate that
jesus was resurrected that vampires exist or that great
american figures are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.
they are better evidence that some people saw the maharishi ,
late of oregon , levitate that some of the early christians
thought jesus was resurrected that many people in eastern europe
saw vampires return from the grave and that we still have an
educational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather
than teach history.

how does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of
historical evidence text or otherwise evinces \? this is a
very complex question that has no easily summarized answer.
there are many books on the subject or various parts of the
subject. i enjoy david hackett fischer 's historian 's fallacies
as a good antidote to the uncritical way in which it is so easy
to read texts present history. it 's relatively cheap. it 's easy
to read. give it a try.

rule do unto others as you would have others do unto you.

all perpetrators in the present will become victims in
the future , most likely in a future incarnation. most
victims in the present were perpetrators in the past , usually
during a previous life.

what is needed is a massive worldwide program of
education to teach all present and potential perpetrators , in
a convincing manner (with sufficient supporting evidence) ,
that what they do to others will be done to them , in this
life or the next.

anyone who doubts the fact of reincarnation , and the
related law of retribution , should read books such as here
and hereafter , by ruth montgomery , which describes several
kinds of evidence supporting reincarnation , including
hypnotic regression to past lives about 50 accurate the
subconscious mind can sometimes make things up , especially
with a bad hypnotist , spontaneous recall (especially by
young children , some of whom can identify their most recent
previous relatives , homes , possessions , etc.) , dream recall
of past life experiences , deja vu (familiarity with a far off
land while traveling there for the first time on vacation) ,
the psychic readings of the late edgar cayce , and even
supporting statements from the christian bible including
matthew 17 11 13 (john the baptist was the reincarnation of
elias.) and john 9 1 2 (how can a person possibly sin before
he is born , unless he lived before \? ! ).

strong interests , innate talents , strong phobias , etc. ,
typically originate from a person 's past lives. for example ,
a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually
results from having drowned at the end of a previous life.
and sometimes a person will take an immediate dislike to
another person being met for the first time in their present
life , because of a bad encounter with him during a previous
incarnation.

people would behave much better toward each other if
they knew that their actions in the present will surely be
reaped by them in the future , or in a future incarnation !

as long as we 're trading secrets , let me tell y'all one i got a
really bad feeling in my heart back when i was a christian. i
could n't really pinpoint it , but something felt dreadfully cheap and
wrong about the whole affair. i had been a devout follower , even a
bible banger , but eventually it started ringing terribly hollow to me.

and i felt torn when i began to disagree with a lot of what the bible
(and my priests) told me this was what made me finally realize that
either i was very wrong , or else the bible was very wrong. and since
i felt reasonably sure of myself , i decided to start analyzing the
bible very closely. that was the catalyst to my break with my faith ,
though it was a long and difficult effort.

brian , have you checked out what your priests told you in the
bible to see whether they were telling you the truth \? did you know
that according to the bible , there should n't even be such things as
priests anymore \? do you know why the preisthood was established in
the old testament to begin with and the reasons why after jesus ,
there were no priests that is until the roman catholic church
300 years later devised the doctrine of transubstantiation by ignoring
the whole concept beyond the book of hebrews \?

you said you analyzed the bible very closely. i think you are
lying. for if you had , i would think you would have at least
got the doctrine of hell straight.

so what is your beef against jesus \? be specific and point on

i found this on the net at my college. it sounds pretty good to me. what do
you folks think \?

this are the tenets of stan as handed down and set within the holy book
of stan.

1 thou shalt not spill thine drinks or waste thine food , for all that
is is sacred , and to waste is the denizen of luc , the infidel. all who
waste today shall have not tomorrow.

2 thou shalt pay heed to those who know the higher calling of stan so
that they may teach you the way , and that thou shalt become one with
stan and the universe shall be in your hands.

3 thou shalt honor thy loved ones and cherish those near you , for they
are the true path to happiness , and happiness is a devine gift of thy
lord stan.

4 stan is the one true god and shall be taken before all others so
that the false gods will know that he is the one , and all who oppose
him shall forever be banished to the form of the sheep and be sent to
the flocks of luc for all eternity.

5 the word is the law , and the law is the word. the word is within
thine own heart , follow the path and be true to thine own self and thou
shalt be blessed by stan , thy lord and saviour.

6 thou shalt honor the faiths of others , for it is their choice to
follow this path , and do not think less of others for being of a
different faith , yet even in the face of these false gods , do not
waiver in thine faith in stan , and hope that the unbeliever will see
the light that is stan.

7 thou shalt not wrong others for being different , for stan cherishes
the different , and holds freedom in the highest regard , for to do less
would be to fall in with luc , the infidel , for stan does not control ,
he merely guides , and lets the choice lie within thine own heart.

8 thou shalt know that thy lord stan has many names and is called
differently by many people , but know also that stan is the true name ,
and all those of the faith shall know that stan is god and god is stan.

9 thou shalt be to the world what thou art to thineself , for to be
false to others is to be false to yourself. thy lord stan asks not that
you be like him , he asks only that you be like yourself for that is all
you were ever meant to be.

10 thou shalt not kill the innocent nor spill blood unnecessarily , for
those who are deserving of death shall be dealt with by stan and sent
for all eternity to the flocks of luc , and those who harm the children
of stan , being born of woman , shall be judged as the sheep of
luc and spend all of time within his flocks.

these commandments are the words of stan. heed them and he shall be
happy , and if thy lord stan is happy , his happiness shall be passed
down to his followers.

hail stan !

it seems like a pretty good set of tenets to me.

anyway , i do n't have anything against amorc , i just wanted to point
out that secret organizations are lead by human beings , and we all
know what that means.

i had an ehum , interesting experience with the rosicrucians , or at
least rosicrucians of some sort last sunday. they had advertised that
they were holding a lecture titled the graal of the king the room
of the heart (which rhymes in swedish). out of curiosity , i went to
the lecture.

there were four people there apart from the two rosicrucians , one
woman and two men apart from me. the rosicrucians were male , both of
them. first one of them told us about the rosicrucians and lectorium
rosicrucianum , which was founded in harlem , nl in 1925. he read
straight from a piece of paper , which i at that point was because he
lacked experience in talking in front of people , but the other guy
read , too , and he was used to holding speeches , i could tell. the
first guy also said that the r s are a mystical christian order , and
that they base their teachings on the teachings of the kathars
(english \? ) from the thirteenth century.

the other guy took over , reading from his piece of paper in a
fairy tale teller 's voice. what he said sounded like a load of crap to
me. of course that might be because i am unenlightened or something.
what made me a bit suspicious , was the way they first said that we all
contained something divine , and could find our way back to divinity ,
then that we could n't become divine as the persons we are currently ,
but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss. maybe i 've
read too much raw , but it sounded very much like the things he talks
about in the chapter how to robotize people and brainwash your
friends in prometheus rising .

it was very interesting to watch the two rosicrucians. the one holding
the actual lecture , obviously was top dog , and the other one seemed to
be a true believer. i got the impression that the top dog had more
distance to the faith than the true believer , that he used it to gain
power and admiration. he spoke like a fairy tale teller , whenever he
remembered. )

its just variation within a thread. the variation at times has been so great
that speciation has occurred. so albert sabin is the common ancestor of
several threads , some of which have themselves speciated. on a separate topic ,
i subscribed to t.o. just recently. albert sabin existed at that time , so i

specifically , i 'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
people grotesquely disagree. is it

(a) both are right

(b) one of them is wrong , and sometimes (though perhaps rarely) we have a
pretty good idea who it is

(c) one of them is wrong , but we never have any information as to who , so
we make our best guess if we really must make a decision.

(d) the idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless (implying that
whether peace is better than war , e.g. , is a meaningless question ,
and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer)

(e) something else. a short , positive assertion would be nice.

from whose point of view would you like to know what relativism concludes \?
one of the people involved in the argument , or some third person observing
the arguers \?

i 've just come from responding another of your posts , where some pennies
have dropped for me. but it would clarify further if you would answer
from the point of view of any disinterested observers perhaps an
observer as likely to be in position a as in position b (where a and b
disagree) in the future , and have his or her conclusion now binding on
them at that time.

well , if our observer x is as likely to be in a 's position as b 's , and if he
agrees that both a and b are making appropriate observations and inferences
regarding the situation , then i would expect him to conclude that there is no
right answer. hopefully there would be some other factor which would allow
him to make some judgement regarding which answer to accept.

if , on the other hand , he disagrees with the principles of either a or b , i
suspect he would make a decision in favour of the other one.

it is unfortunately the case that not all moral arguments have answers from
all perspectives. for instance , i am completely unable to come to any
conclusion regarding whether abortion should be allowed or not , from my
perspective. in an ideal world , all living things would have a right to
life but in an ideal world , women would have the absolute right to do what
they like with their own bodies. clearly there is no way to resolve in
favour of both these principles. therefore i agree with the compromise
solution of allowing abortion up to a certain time after conception , and
deciding on the time based on various (sometimes ill defined) criteria. this
is also a sensible move , i think , because it lets people make their own
decisions (within reason). and for what it 's worth , i am reasonably happy
with current uk abortion law.

similarly , the situation in what 's left of yugoslavia is a horrible mess , and
i really ca n't see my way to any sort of conclusion. there , i do n't even
know enough to imagine what sort of compromise one might manage.

the default condition , in the absence of a preponderance of
evidence either way , is that the proposition or assertion is undecidable.
and the person who takes the undecidable position and says that he she
simply disbelieves that the proposition is true , is the only one who
holds no burden of proof. this is why the so called weak atheist
position is virtually unassailable not because it stands on a firm
foundation of logical argument , but because it 's proponents simply
disbelieve in the existence of god(s) and therefore they hold no burden
of proof. when you do n't assert anything , you do n't have to prove
anything. that 's where weak atheism draws its strength. but its
strength is also its achilles' heel. without assertions axioms , one
has no foundation upon which to build. as a philosophy , it 's virtually
worthless. imo , of course.

yes , as a philosophy weak atheism is worthless. this is true in
exactly the same sense that as a philosophy christians' disbelief in
zeus is worthless. atheists construct their personal philosophies
from many different sources , building non god based ideas in the same
way as christians build non zeus based ideas of thunderbolts.
atheists no more base their philosophy on atheism than christians
base theirs on the nonexistence of zeus.

the weak atheist position is logically extremely assailable any
logical demonstration of the existence of a god completely destroys it
as soon as the demonstration is made in the presence of a given weak
atheist. atheists in this newsgroup are barraged regularly with
attempts to provide such a logical demonstration , and they all fail
miserably. in fact , most of the people around here who claim the
strong (as opposed to mathematical) atheist position do so on this
basis not only do we not believe in a god , but also all the arguments
presented in favor of particular gods have to date proven unsound
therefore , one can say that those gods as argued by those arguments do
not exist. this does n't apply to such philosophers' gods as are
defined to be logically undemonstrable , but these are not the gods of
popular religion , and the coherence of such claims is quite
questionable.

well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of

everything we need to know about the seven seals is already

unless the fbi were to kill all publishers of the bible , it

russell turpin , as is his wont , has raised some interesting issues
in his struggle with the christian texts and the christians.
unfortunately , he seems to be hoping for simplicity where it is
not available. the lukewarm stew he detects may well be an inevitable
result of the divine mixing himself up with a bunch of losers such
as humanity.

also unfortunately (perhaps) i have a deadline in two weeks , the
responsibility for which prevents me , in good conscience ,
from writing a more considered response and fully entering the
fray , as it were.

let me then say what i can , briefly.



the two commandments are rules they are merely rules that are
so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.

this point , for the net.browsers who also still read books , is
pursued throughly in kaufmann , critique of religion and philosophy.

the commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed ,
in part , as reminding man that he is not god and cannot act as if
he has ultimate responsibility.

this is a theological statement worthy of barth.
dr turpin (dd) may wear the black robe of geneva yet ! )

indeed , many traditions present
an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
loving one 's neighbor as following various other rules , and
relying on their god to make things come out right , precisely
because it would be wrong for man to assume such ultimate
responsibility. once again , we are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean.

this requires the assumption that all interpretations are
equally valid , that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing
among them. i would n't make that assumption i do n't think it is
a reasonable assumption.

and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted \? there
are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the christian god behaving in just this way.

michael , and i , and others , read 'the bible' with christian
glasses. among the things that this should imply is that the
nt informs the ot , even to the point of dominanting it. some
points in the ot (ceremonial dietary laws) are explicitly
abrogated by the nt texts. to drive russell turpin 's point with
adequacy , one needs to begin with nt texts (probably from matthew ,
and probably about damnation) (just trying to help ) )

this part is , i discover , what most moves me to post

mls i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously.

no , michael , the conservative christians also take the gospel
seriously. what differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel.

russell turpin 's 'no' here is misplaced , not to say inappropriate.
michael 's self description much govern. the equation of radical liberal ,
which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong. radical conservatives are
possible (if sadly lacking in numbers at present). thomas merton
was a radical , even though conservative in some ways. st francis
was a radical , similarly. how many examples are needed \?

mls ... why do n't i and the (myriads of) other christians like me
mls tell you something about christianity \? ...

michael 's question gets to a heart of the matter (klingons have
two hearts , so my metaphor is not mixed , just extraterrestrial ) )
russell turpin (in an earlier post) had said that michael (michael 's
theological positions , actually) did n't tell him much about christianity
dean simeon responds (this time gently) 'what do you mean \? ' more
direct , perhaps , would have been 'what could you possibly mean \? '
the implied rhetorical effort , to separate michael from the
tradition , is a failure. michael is in the tradition. if your idea
of the tradition does n't include him , change your idea of the tradition !

the irony here is that there is nothing in christianity per
se that michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and
gays.

how can one answer this while staying on the more general issue \?
i'm on the other side of the interpretive fence (from michael)
on this issue , yet ' nothing ' is a hideous overstatement.

one verse is enough to refute it i 'll offer two , from
paul (of all people)

'in jesus christ there is neither male nor female...'(galatians 3 28
i do n't quote single verses as a rule , and i do n't carry
them in my head ) and ' nothing shall separate us from the glory of god...'
(roughly , from romans). if russell would promise to convert based
on these or any other verses , i 'd promise to get the full context
for any that he requires ) )

in short , it is the extra christian principles that
make michael 's christianity beneficial , and i suspect they would
be as beneficial , perhaps moreso , without being filtered by
christian interpretation.

this conclusion does not follow , even in short , from the
argument that goes before. a surprising logical ellipsis.

some
people even raised protests when we had a moment of silence for a class
member who had tragically died , saying this implied endorsing religion.

because , of course , that possibility existed. meaning any student who
really gave a shit could have a moment of silence on his her own , which
makes more sense than forcing those who don't want to participate to
have to take part. what other reason is there for an organized moment
of silence \?

a moment of silence does n't mean much unless everyone
participates. otherwise it 's not silent , now is it \?

non religious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead
classmate (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together , (3)
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school , (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it 's not disruptive later.

blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic.

what is the fact of evolution \? there is a difference between calling evolution
a fact and talking about the theory of evolution providing facts (i happen to
think the latter is more accurate).
deleted

evolution is both fact and theory. the theory of evolution represents the
scientific attempt to explain the fact of evolution. the theory of evolution
does not provide facts it explains facts. it can be safely assumed that all
scientific theories neither provide nor become facts but rather explain facts.
i recommend that you do some appropriate reading in general science. a good
starting point with regard to evolution for the layman would be evolution as

i think i see where you are coming from kent. jesus does n't view
guilt like our modern venacular colors it.

feelings have nothing to do with guilt. feelings arise from the state of
being guilty. feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive. feelings are a
reaction from guilt. jesus is talking about the guilt state , not the
reaction. let me give you an example

have you ever made a mistake \? have you ever lied to someone \? even a
little white lie \? have you ever claimed to know something that you really
did n't know \? have you ever hated someone \? have you ever been selfish \?
are you guilty of any one of these \? the answer is of course , yes. you
are guilty. period. that is it what jesus is getting at. no big surprise.
feelings do not even enter the picture. consider jesus 's use of the word
guilt as how a court uses it.

huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

if things happen wrong , i will try to learn from the mistakes

this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines. and if your personality type is
opposite , then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system.

so do you see jesus 's point \? christians are not perfect. nonchristians
are not perfect. nonchristians do not want to come into the
light of jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives ,
and they will not like the sight. it is an ugly thing to see how far

subject theists and objectivity
organization university of nebraska at omaha
lines 82

can a theist be truly objective \? can he be impartial
when questioning the truth of his scriptures , or
will he assume the superstition of his parents
when questioning \?

i 've often found it to be the case that the theist
will stick to some kind of superstition when
wondering about god and his scriptures. i 've
seen it in the christian , the jew , the muslim ,
and the other theists alike. all assume that
their mothers and fathers were right in the
aspect that a god exists , and with that belief
search for their god.

occasionally , the theist may switch religions or
aspects of the same religion , but overall the
majority keep to the belief that some creator
was behind the universe 's existence. i 've
known muslims who were once christians and vice
versa , i 've known christians who were once
jewish and vice versa , and i 've even known
christians who become hindu. yet , throughout
their transition from one faith to another ,
they 've kept this belief in some form of higher
being. why \?

it usually all has to do with how the child is
brought up. from the time he is born , the
theist is brought up with the notion of the
truth of some kind of scripture the bible ,
the torah , the qur'an , etc. he is told
of this wondrous god who wrote (or inspired)
the scripture , of the prophets talked about in
the scripture , of the miracles performed , etc.
he is also told that to question this (as
children are apt to do) is a sin , a crime
against god , and to lose belief in the scrip
ture 's truth is to damn one 's soul to hell.
thus , by the time he is able to read the
scripture for himself , the belief in its truth
is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
matter of course.

but it does n't stop there. once the child is able
to read for himself , there is an endeavor to
inculcate the child the right readings of
scripture , to concentrate more on the pleasant
readings , to gloss over the worse ones , and to
explain away the unexplainable with mystery.
circular arguments , self evdent facts and
truths , unreasoning belief , and fear of
hell is the meat of religion the child must eat
of every day. to doubt , of course , means wrath
of some sort , and the child must learn to put
away his brain when the matter concerns god.
all of this has some considerable effect on the
child , so that when he becomes an adult , the
superstitions he 's been taught are nearly
impossible to remove.

all of this leads me to ask whether the theist can
truly be objective when questioning god , hell ,
heaven , the angels , souls , and all of the rest.
can he , for a moment , put aside this notion that
god does exist and look at everything from
a unbiased point of view \? obviously , most
theists can somewhat , especially when presented
with mythical gods (homeric , roman , egyptian ,
etc.). but can they put aside the assumption
of god 's existence and question it impartially \?

a gun that was recognizably fully automatic and state of the art.
is n't that conveeeenient \?


assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'
measurement (that the temperature is in centigrade , rather than the
more common in the us fahrenheit) , you are still laboring under at
least 2 misconceptions

1. you seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 c.
actually , the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are
iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 c. even if the gun
were found in area which achieved the 1000 c temperature , the steel
parts of the gun would not be deformed , and it would still be
trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.

steel may not melt at 1000c , but it will weaken , expand and deform.
if there is enough of a load on the steel , like the load on a steel
roof truss , or the pressure exerted by steel parts in a machine
trying to expand against each other , the steel can and will
deform extensively. for the record , any weapon found in
the cult compound should be indentifiable , but it may be
impossible to do normal ballistics tests because of the
damage done to the weapon.

if , if , if.... anyway , the question was if the gun was identifiable , which
it is.

... bad thoughts these.

well it depends on whether you take the literal dictionary definition of
cult and say all faiths are cults , or if you take a more social context
view of cult which allows you to recognize mainstream religions as
socially acceptable and cults as groups that involve techniques of brain
washing and all the other characteristics that define oppressive probly not
the best word cult behaviour.

my understanding of the academic use of the word cult is that it is
a group of people oriented around a single authority figure. it need
not be religious. however , i have seen plenty of religious cults ,
including some that mainstream.

since everywhere i look , zoroaster is suggested as being a probable
descendant of daniel suppose you prove he was n't.

zoroaster is far older than daniel. if anything , one could claim that ,
in a sense , daniel is a descendant of zoroaster as daniel , though being
hebrew , has assimilated into zoroastrianism and has successfully
introduced the religion into the tanakh of judaism. however , the majority
of the book is in hellenistic aramaic (not babylonian aramaic) and only has
kethuvim or writing status.

ref encyclopedia of religion , mircea eliade

daniel , or , in hebrew , daniyye'l hero of the biblical book that bears his name.
daniel is presented as a jew in the babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in
the royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his
salvation from death in a lion 's pit. he also appears in the last chapters of
the book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of israel 's
restoration to national religious autonomy. as a practitioner of oneiromancy in
the court , described in daniel 1 6 (written in the third person) , daniel per
forms his interpretations alone , while as a visionary apocalyptist , in daniel
7 12 (written in the first person) , he is in need of an angel to help him
decode his visions and mysteries of the future. it is likely that the name
daniel is pseudonymous , a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known
from ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (ez. 14 4 , 28 3).
the authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative
voices and content but by its language daniel 1 1 2 4a and 8 12 are written in
hebrew , whereas daniel 2 4b 7 28 is in aramaic. the language division parallels
the subject division (daniel 1 6 concerns legends and dream interpretations
7 12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). the
overall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (daniel 2 7
is chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. after the
prefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of daniel and some
youths to their ancestral religion , a chronological ordering is discernable a
sequence from king nebuchadrezzar to darius is reported (dn. 7 12). much of
this royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic for example ,
daniel 4 speaks of nebuchadrezzar 's transformation into a beast , a story that
is reported in the qumran scrolls of nabonidus belshazzar is portrayed as the
last king of babylon , although he was never king and darius is called a mede
who conquered babylon and is placed before cyrus ii of persia , although no such
darius is known (the medes followed the persians , and darius is the name of
several persian kings). presumably the episodes of daniel 2 6 , depicting a
series of monarchical reversals , episodes of ritual observances , and reports of
miraculous deliverances were collected in the seleucid period (late fourth to
mid second century bce) in order to reinvigorate waning jewish hopes in divine
providence and encourage steadfast faith.
the visions of daniel 7 12 , reporting events from the reign of belshazzar to
that of cyrus ii (but actually predicting the overthrow of seleucid rule in
palestine) , were collected and published during the reign of antiochus iv prior
to the maccabean revolt , for it was then (beginning in 168 bce) that the jews
were put to the test concerning their allegiance to judaism and their ancestral
traditions , and many refused to desecrate the statues of moses and endured a
martyr 's death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. all of the visions
of daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways for example , via images of
the enthronement of a god of judgment , with a son of man invested with rule
(this figure was interpreted by jews as michael the archangel and by christians
as christ) , in chapter 7 via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre
manifestations , as in chapter 8 or via complex reinterpretations of ancient
prophecies , especially those of jeremiah 25 9 11 , as found in daniel 9 12.
the imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four
metals in chapter 2) , representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth
monarchy of divine origin , is one of the enduring images of the book it sur
vived as a prototype of jewish and christian historical and apocalyptic schemes
to the end of the middle ages. the role and power of this imagery in the
fifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete isaac abravanel , the
scientist isaac newton , and the philosopher jean bodin and among the fifth
monarchy men of seventeenth century england , for example , is abiding testimony
to the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of
diverse thinkers and groups. the schema is still used to this day by various
groups predicting the apocalyptic advent.
the encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and
propagandized in daniel 11 12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of isaiah
52 13 53 12 , regarding the suffering servant of god not as all israel but as
the select faithful. neither the opening stories about daniel and the youths nor
the final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt they rather
advocate a stance of piety , civil disobedience , and trustful resignation.
victory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel michael , and the
martyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. persumably the
circles behind the book were not the same as the maccabean fighters and may
reflect some proto pharisaic group of hasidim , or pietists. the themes of
resistance to oppression , freedom of worship , preservation of monotheistic
integrity , the overthrow of historical dominions , and the acknowledgement of
the god of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of
trust for the faithful in their darkest hour.

zarathushtra , founder of the religion know as zoroastrianism or mazdaism (from
mazda or ahura mazda , the name of the god prophesied by zarathushtra.) the
etymology and history of zarathushtra , the avestan and oldest form of the name ,
as uncertain , both in various iranian languages and in related forms else
where. there may have been an old persian form , zara ushtra , from which the
greek form , zoroastres , may be derived , and there may have existed an old
iranian form , zarat ushtra , to which may be linked the middle iranian zrdrwsht ,
several middle persian forms (such as zrtwsht) , and the new persian zardusht.
we can state with certainty only that the second half of the name , ushtra ,
means camel. the form zoroaster , derived from the greek zoroastres , was used
traditionally in european culture until the eighteenth century , when
zarathustra , closer to the original (and as found in nietzsche) , came into
common use after the rediscovery of the avesta , the collection of sacred books
of zoroastrianism , and the resulting studies in iranian philology. see avesta.
notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of zarathushtra , even in
western culture , the sources available to us are few , extremely fragmented ,
and heterogeneous. our principle sources are the five gathas ( songs ) ,
attributed to zarathushtra himself and included in the yasna section of the
avesta gatha ahunavaiti (yasna 28 34) , gatha ushtavaiti (yasna 43 46) , gatha
spentamainyu (yasna 47 50) , gatha vokukhshathra (yasna 51) , and gatha
vashishtoishti (yasna 53) , the last of which was probably written after the
prophet 's death.
other sources of considerable , albeit varying , importance are the younger
avesta and the remaining zoroastrian religious literature , in particular the
pahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures ce. although the achaemenid
inscriptions (sixth to fourth centures bce) never mention zarathushtra , he is
mentioned by some greek sources of the time (not , however , by herodotus , who
seems unaware of him).
the avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true
chronological history of zarathushtra. but the text is useful in an indirect
way , as it clearly implies that the environment in which zoroastrianism arose
was not that of iran under the medes or the persians. the greek sources , on the
other hand , do provide some information concerning the time of zarathushtra ,
although from a historical point of view they are unreliable. some place him
six thousand years before the trojan war (xanthus of lydia , eudoxus of cnidus ,
hermippus , hermodorus , aristotle , plutarch , diogenes laertius , and pliny). the
account by xanthus of lydia , however , has also been interpreted by some to mean
six hundred , rather than six thousand , years before the expedition of xerxes
against greece. this interpretation is favored by diogenes laertius , who makes
reference to xanthus , but although a few scholars (a. s. shabazi , helmut
humbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts , it
is generally rejected.
although the historical value of the greek sources is negligible , they are
nonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history
of the cosmos had already been developed in iran by the achaemenid period , as
the above account would seem to demonstrate. they also show that by this time
zarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure , one from an
extremely distant past. all of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet
could not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with , or even close
to , that of the achaemenids.
later zoroastrian sources , the pahlavi texts , do provide an absolute chrono
logy for zarathushtra , one that was also accepted by some arab authors. accord
ing to these sources , zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before alexander.
again , scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology some view it as
historically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical
justification. the most convincing arguments , however , seem to support the
latter position. the figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface
because it represents , in fact , the more general one of 300 , which was employed
by sasanid propagandists to locate zarathushtra 's lifetime roughly around the
beginning of iranian domination. for a number of reasons connected with complex
problems inherent in the iranian chronology , there was also a desire on the
part of the sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. in this
context , zarathushtra , whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after
the beginning of the cosmos , converted vishtaspa at the age of forty two , and
vishtaspa 's conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium
(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before alexander).
given the unreliability of the few available sources , we are forced to
reconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements , principally
on the contention that zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before cyrus
the great , cambyses , and darius , as there is no mention in the avesta of the
great political achievements that took place in western iran in the middle of
the first millennium bce. nor is there any mention of the history of that
period , which was to lead iran to a position of such predominance. at the same
time , for a number of reasons , going back much further in history would not be
justified. consequently , the traditionally accepted theory of placing zara
thushtra around the beginning of the first millennium bce appears to be the
most legitimate.
as to zarathushtra 's land of origin , many scholars agree , on the basis of
valid arguments , that he must have come from eastern iran. some have held that
he was a mede , largely because of a late iranian tradition linking zarathushtra
with azerbaijan , but also because of linguistic reasons , based on the language
of the avesta. this hypothesis , however , should be discarded , as we can suppose ,
both on historical and linguistic grounds , that zarathushtra came from the east ,
even though we do not know precisely from which region. there is a considerable
variety of opinion on this particular matter , including the improbable view
that he came from chorasmia , or present day khorezm , or from a wider chorasmian
region , reaching as far as the oases of merv and herat. most likely , however ,
zarathushtra 's land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the
hindu kush mountain range to the more southern regions of bactria and arachosia
(modern qandahar) , as well as drangiana (the area of lake helmand). it would
thus be located in what is now afghanistan or in the border regions of iran.
zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (yasna
33.6). he was a zaotar (cf. sanskrit hotr) , that is , a priest belonging to a
specific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned
religious poetry. even in the so called younger avesta he is described as an
athravan (yashts 13.94) , a more general term encompassing the entire priestly
caste. to enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training , which he used
to lend dignity (as in the gathas) to the contents of his new message , the
product of a great and original ethical mind.
zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition , linking india
to iran in another way , by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan ,
or possessor of asha , that is , the one who , as in the vedic rtavan , seeks
truth and masters it , thus becoming ashavan in this life almost an initiate
and blessed after death. any good follower of such teachings seeks the vision
of asha , just as those chosing the right path in vedic india aspired to the
vision of the sun , a manifestation of rta. behind these concepts and this
language lies the great tradition of aryan mysticism , that is , of indo iranian
mysticism.
zarathushtra 's greatness , however , does not lie in his having belonged to a
particular religious tradition. rather , it lies in the innovation and strength
of his message , which was in itself a break in the tradition , one that force
fully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas dualistic
monotheism (the wise lord who fathers two twin spirits , the beneficent and the
evil) and the expectation of a transfiguration (av. , frashokereti pahl. ,
frashgird) of life and existence. see frashokereti
both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological
doctrine deeply separate zarathushtra 's teachings from the indo iranian tradi
tions of his upbringing. they exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic
and ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem
of evil. because of his basic tenets , zarathushtra , who advocated an inward
religiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi
tion , can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.
another original facet of zarathushtra 's message , one that is not easy to
understand but which , however , holds the key to a deeper understanding of the
complex intellectual and poetic structure of the gathas , is the doctrine of the
amesha spentas , the beneficent immortals. these are spiritualizations of the
abstract notions of good thought , best truth , desirable power , bounteous
devotion , wholeness , and immortality , all of which operate according to a
system of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the
manifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. see amesha spentas.
other than the names of his father , pourushaspa ( possessing gray horses ) ,
and of his mother , dughdova ( one who has milked ) , we know almost nothing of
zarathushtra 's life. a late pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.
according to tradition , zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty , and at
thirty he was subject to a revelation , both through an intense and powerful
inspiration and through a vision. only after ten years had passed , however , did
he succeed in converting a cousin of his , maidhyoimah , to his beliefs. he was
strongly opposed in his native land by kavis , karapans , and usijs , priestly
groups associated with traditional teachings and practices. this hostility
caused him to leave his region (yasna 46 1) and to seek refuge at the court of
kavi vishtaspa , a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with
his wife , hutaosa , when the prophet , according to tradition , was forty two
years old. we also know the name of a son , isat vastra ( desiring pastures ) ,
and of three daughters born of his first wife , as well as the names of two more
sons , urvatatnara ( commanding men ) and hvarecithra ( sun faced ) , born of
his second wife , hvovi , a member of the influential hvogva ( possessing good
cattle ) family. two other figures belonging to the hvogva family are mentioned
frashaoshtra and jamaspa , the former as hvovi 's father , and the latter as the
husband of the third daughter of the prophet , pouruchista ( very thoughtful ) ,
whose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the gathas (yasna 53). again ,
according to tradition , zarathushtra died at the age of seventy seven. he was
assassinated by a karapan , a priest of the old religion , who belonged to the
tuirya tribe and was called tur i bradres (his name is known only in the pahlavi
form).
the paucity of information on the prophet 's life is compensated by a tradi
tion , rich in legendary detail , that arose through the centuries in zoroastrian
communities. the main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of
the denkard , a pahlavi work dating from the ninth century ce , as well as
passages from other pahlavi texts and a new persian work from the thirteenth
century , the zarathusht nama (book of zarathushtra) , written by zaratusht i
bahram i pazhdu. mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about
zarathushtra , which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the
perfect man.
zarathushtra 's great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the
renaissance until the enlightenment. during the classical and hellenistic
periods he was viewed as a wise man , a typical representative of an alien
wisdom , a master of the secrets of heaven and earth , a seer , astrologer ,
psychologist , and wonder worker. pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the
influence of zarathushtra on pythagoras himself , and the academicians always
openly admired the persian thinker who founded the school of the magi and
advocated a doctrine of dualism. earliest christianity viewed zarathushtra as
a precursor of the christian faith , one who not only prophesied , as had the
biblical prophets , the advent of the messiah but also predicted the supernatural
sign of his coming , the star that was to appear in the east and guide the three
magi to the manger in bethlehem. see magi. this christian interpretation is
derived from the zoroastrian doctrine of the saoshyant , the savior of the
future. see saoshyant. later , however , religious struggles arose during the
sasanid empire in persia (third to seventh centuries ce) , which linked the
spread of christianity with the roman empire. zarathushtra 's popularity in the
christian world began to decline. the iranian prophet , who had been praised
often by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by mani as one of the three
great messengers from the past , was now seen , instead , as a leader of imposture
and heresy , a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. but during the renaiss
ance and the enlightenment , european cultures reverted to the image of zara
thushtra that had come down through classical and hellenistic antiquity. he was
viewed , once again , as a great and wise man , as the author of the chaldean
oracles and probably inventor of qabbalah , as a teacher of astrology , as a
possible bridge between christianity and platonism , and , at times (as in
voltaire) , as a symbol of non christian wisdom.
after western philology rediscovered zarathushtra during the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries , friedrich nietzsche , in an intentional paradox , gave
the name zarathustra to the hero of his work also sprach zarathustra (1883
1892). nietzsche saw the iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the
true motive force underlying all things , that is , the eternal struggle between
good and evil. see also zoroastrianism

allow me to play devils advocate a moment jg

o what was called many months of planning was probably
the intelligence collecting paperwork and interviews.

o it 's important to them because it justifies budgets.

o the warrant was sealed to keep from jeopardizing the
the government 's case.

o there was probably no one actually exercising oversite.
instead , a system of bureaucratic rules has been set
up for such incidents. like computer programs these
have to be debugged periodically. especially when used
in fringe areas. (cf. the hostage rescue program).
therefore no one was in charge. and no one can
reasonably be held responsible.

baloney. either the programmer or the people who decided to let their

summary in response to dave davis.


i wrote
and who is to say that this interpretation is twisted \? there
are many passages in the bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the christian god behaving in just this way.

in article 1r622c c17@cass.ma02.bull.com ddavis@cass.ma02.bull.com (dave davis) writes
this requires the assumption that all interpretations are equally
valid , that there is no way of reasonably distinguishing among
them. i would n't make that assumption i do n't think it is a
reasonable assumption.

no. it follows from the fact that most christians' choice of
interpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by
the secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully
determined by scripture. whether or not there is some right
interpretation matters not few christians claim the ability to
read the mind of their god. dave davis should note that it was
michael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural
influence in this thread. i think michael is right in this , but
regardless , it should be noted that this has not been a point
of contention between michael and myself.

i have argued beyond michael 's claims that the christian
scriptures are open to so many interpretations including a
wide divergence within the christian tradition that even their
most important themes are vague. again , it does not matter that
there is some right interpretation unless there is a way to
determine what that right interpretation is. it is the lack of
an objective measure , not the presumed lack of an answer , that
puts the force behind the line i argue.

michael , and i , and others , read 'the bible' with christian
glasses. among the things that this should imply is that the
nt informs the ot , even to the point of dominanting it. some
points in the ot (ceremonial dietary laws) are explicitly
abrogated by the nt texts. ...

there are enough christian glasses , varying over a sufficiently
broad range of color , that i can find a few that support my
example.

no , michael , the conservative christians also take the gospel
seriously. what differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel.

russell turpin 's 'no' here is misplaced , not to say inappropriate.
michael 's self description must govern. the equation of radical
liberal , which seems implied by russell turpin is wrong. ...

in my opinion , what makes michael radical is that he fully
acknowledges that christian scripture and tradition fail to
determine the doctrines that so many branches within christianity
hold dear. he is willing to live and practice his religion
within this indeterminacy , and he is willing to acknowledge that
much of his understanding of things christian is influenced by
ideas that are not purely christian. those christians i have
called conservative must also interpret , but they do not
recognize or at least , are unwilling to admit the extent and
importance of this.

russell turpin (in an earlier post) had said that michael (michael 's
theological positions , actually) did n't tell him much about christianity
dean simeon responds (this time gently) 'what do you mean \? ' more
direct , perhaps , would have been 'what could you possibly mean \? '
the implied rhetorical effort , to separate michael from the tradition ,
is a failure. michael is in the tradition. if your idea of the tradition
does n't include him , change your idea of the tradition !

i recognize that michael is part of the tradition. but what does
it tell one about a tradition covering origen , aquinas , jerry
fallwell , and jesse jackson that it also includes michael siemon \?
not very much !

... in short , it is the extra christian principles that make
michael 's christianity beneficial , and i suspect they would
be as beneficial , perhaps moreso , without being filtered by
christian interpretation.

this conclusion does not follow , even in short , from the
argument that goes before. a surprising logical ellipsis.

i think the conclusion does follow. the purely christian
principles that michael has are the ones he shares with others in
the christian tradition or that can be derived from christian
scripture. these , necessarily vague , are not enough to drive his
political stances. that one should love one 's neighbor is a
purely christian principle. that this means showing tolerance
for homosexuality is not .

as to these political stances , they are often at odds with what
is commonly held in most of current christendom , and so i
suspect they could be better pressed outside it. (on the other
hand , i can well understand the counterpoint , that these
political stances become most influential when presented to
those who need them most.)


this is a theological statement worthy of barth.
dr turpin (dd) may wear the black robe of geneva yet ! )

having barely survived the effort to finish in computer science , i
doubt i will attempt a more difficult field any time soon !

i'm curious to know if christians ever read books based on critique
on the religion , classical text such as age of reason by paine ,
or the myth maker by jacobi. sometimes it is good to know your
enemy , and if you want to do serious research you have to understand
both sides , and not solely the one and only right one.

yes , one does. i examined a critique of the book of romans by
i think , benjamin franklin once , a deist. i found it amazing that
benjamin franklin missed the whole boat. i also have the writings
on thomas jefferson sitting on my shelf , and it is amazing how
much he missed. i have studied plato 's theory of forms and
aristotelian hylomorphesism. what a pile of junk. jesus
makes plato and aristotle look like kindergardeners. psychology ,
the id , ego , superego by freud \? elements of truth , but jesus
explained it far better and gave reasons.

thomas paine , benjamin franklin , thomas jefferson are mere men. they
can screw up the bible just as well as any man. i do not put these
men on a pedestal. and if i remember t.j. 's autobiography correctly ,
he thought thomas paine was the most unread man he ever met.

here 's some more circular reasoning to you. paul says to the corinthians
that that the gospel will be foolishness to the world , because it is
spiritually discerned. and so , people without the spirit of god have n't a
clue to what the bible is saying. from your point of view , that 's
incredibly circular and convenient. to me , it is mysteriously and supernaturally
bizarre. i can see it , but you ca n't. this is not arrogance on
my part. trust me. it is as bizarre to you as it is to me. but nonetheless ,
it is a truth , explainable or not.

are any of you color blind to red and green \? i am. remember those
dot tests they do at the optomologist 's \? they put pictures in front
of you and you are supposed to identify the pattern in the dots \? if
your eyes are perfectly normal , you can see letters or numerals
embedded in the dots. they are a slightly different color and stand
out from the background. but if you are color blind to red and green ,
you will not see anything but gray shaded dots. that is how a dot
test appears to me. i do not see a pattern at all.

a normal seeing person will see the patterns. and to him , i seem like a
total anomaly. to him , i appear as if i am missing the universe or something.
it is hard for him to understand why i ca n't see anything
that to him is as plain as day.

that it what it is like with the bible , the word of god , to the believer.
the believer can see the meaning in the words. i can see how the patterns
fit together. there is such depth. such consistency. but then , on the
other hand , i notice the non believer. he does n't see it. he thinks
i am weird because he thinks i am seeing things. i look at him , and
say , no , you are weird. you do not see. then it is time for a sanity
check. i go to another christian and say , do you see this. and
they go , yes. it is an x . and i say , thank god , i see the x
too.

it is truly the strangest thing. it adds a little extra dimension to
the phrase ,

he will make the blind see , and the deaf hear.


i am glad that jesus has enabled me to see. i wish every non believer
could see what they are missing.

kent , i am not accusing you of evil things. jesus is accusing you.
and it is not only you that he is accusing. he is accusing everyone.
me , you and everyone in the world is guilty. whether one
sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with
whether we do evil things. we do them regardless.

kent sandvik responds

hmm , it seems that this is the core of christianity then , you
have to feel guilty . . .

i think i see where you are coming from kent. jesus does n't view
guilt like our modern venacular colors it.

feelings have nothing to do with guilt. feelings arise from the state of
being guilty. feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive. feelings are a
reaction from guilt. jesus is talking about the guilt state , not the
reaction. let me give you an example

have you ever made a mistake \? have you ever lied to someone \? even a
little white lie \? have you ever claimed to know something that you really
did n't know \? have you ever hated someone \? have you ever been selfish \?
are you guilty of any one of these \? the answer is of course , yes. you
are guilty. period. that is it what jesus is getting at. no big surprise.
feelings do not even enter the picture. consider jesus 's use of the word
guilt as how a court uses it.

jesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being
imperfect. the bible calls it the state that we are all sinners. we all do
bad things. even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our
guilt that we are all sinners. it is it in our nature to do bad things.
we are sinners , therefore we do bad things. being a sinner is fact. it is
not a pleasant fact. but it is just a fact. we are not perfect. calling us
sinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a
human being. guilty as charged.

and then there 's this single personality that will save you from this
universal guilt feeling.

you can handle your guilt in one of two ways acknowledge you
made a mistake , learn from it , and try to not do it again in
the meantime , not punishing yourself for it which is the
way jesus wants you to handle or it. this is the healthy way.

or two , the destructive way put yourself down , slap yourself
and feel like crap , never forgive yourself , force yourself to
say a thousand hail marys . . . even to suicide. this the way
jesus does not want us to deal with it. all people fall into this
category to some extent in their lives.

jesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt
feeling. jesus is in the business of showing us how much he
loves us despite our guilt. jesus knows we are guilty. that
is n't new to him. it is no big deal to him. he just wants you to realize
that this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.
that is what he wants you to know. why , because he wants to
have your company. you are immensely valuable to him.
jesus wants a relationship with you , however , in our present
sinful nature , we are incapable of having this relationship.

god is perfect. we are not. you cannot fit a square peg into
a round hole. however , god has provided a way for us to
change our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.
god has provided jesus , so that whosoever just believes in
jesus , will have their nature changed. the holy spirit will
move it. and now divine nature is now within lives our very
being and us and god communicate with each through his
unifying holy spirit. the benefits of this are endless. for
with the divine nature living within us , we can now see
our imperfections better. we can now head them off at the pass. with
the power of the holy spirit living in us , we now have his power
to help us overcome our shortcomings. because the divine nature lives
within us , we can now understand profound bible passages that never before
we could understand. because the divine nature now lives within us , we now
have authority over demonic forces. and lastly , because the divine
nature now lives within us , we have eternal life for the holy spirit
is eternal.

the relationship with jesus is of the utmost importance. because
it is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to
heavenly kingdom , it is your relationship to the living god.
remember what jesus said at the tail end of matthew when he
separated the goats from the sheep . many people in the
last day will ask him , did n't i prophesy in your name and do
miracles , and do good things in your name \? and what did jesus say \?
depart from me , for i never knew you. that is the cornerstone of
christianity , kent. jesus must know you as his friend. it is your
relationship to jesus. if he is your friend and you are his , you will
be counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.

brian , i will tell you a secret , i do n't feel guilty at all ,
i do mistakes , and i regret them , however i 've never had this
huge guilt feeling hanging over my shoulder.

good. it shows that you have a strong self image that you
love yourself. that is the second greatest commandment jesus
taught. if only more people could do as you do. as i said before ,
in the common english venacular , feeling guilty has a
different meaning than the state of guilt.

this all is a very clear indication that you need a certain
personality type in order to believe and adjust to certain
religious doctrines. and if your personality type is
opposite , then you are not that easily attached to a certain
world view system.

i believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego ,
a lot less self centeredness , and a lot more unconditional love.

there are humans that subscribe to the same notion. the nice
thing is that when you finally shake off this huge burden ,
the shoulders feel far more relaxed !

yes. you have stated what jesus said. remember \? come to me ,
take my yoke upon your shoulders , for my burden is light. a yoke
is used to direct oxen to do work. once you have a relationship with
jesus , you and him share the yoke and the burdens of life. having
god at your side is of great advantage.

your bible provides wonderful stories of the things he said and did ,
but i simply do not believe that he still exists as an entity that has
any bearing on this universe or the lives in it , and i similarly do
not believe that the god that you worship exists or has ever existed.

period.

i view religion in general and christianity in specific as a 'cultural
virus' that has been passed down from generation to generation because
people are often too afraid to think for themselves and claim
responsibility for their own fate , so they brainwash themselves and
their children into believing the popular myths , and it goes on from
there. and eventually christianity becomes a given if so many
other people believe in it , it must be right , no \?

i do n't believe in any life after death . i believe that when i die ,
i die , so therefore it 's up to me to try to bring meaning and purpose
to my life in the meantime. i do n't believe that it 's a good thing to
humble myself and view pride as a sin pride , in moderation , is a
constructive thing. i see nothing at all wrong with homosexuality and
nothing inferior about women , and my priests lost a lot of my trust
when they patronizingly tried to explain the 'faults' of these
opinions to me. i do n't believe in 'loving everyone' , especially
people i 've never met while i try to show respect to everyone , my
love and admiration is something not easily earned , and i do not feel
guilty about denying my respect and consideration to someone who has
abused it.

if you want me to take your religion the least bit seriously , stop
trying to show me how the bible makes sense . start trying to show
me that this jesus person is somehow still influencing anyone 's life
here on earth.

the idea of an apostacy did not originate with lucy smith or joseph
smith or the mormons. the idea of a restoration was quite common
in the early 19th century usa. alexander campbell , founder of the
group that now survives with the name disciples of christ preached
that the primitive church had been lost and was attempting to restore

no. zeno 's paradox is resolved by showing that integration or an infinite

nothing can get out of a black hole because
the escape velocity is the speed of light. i do n't know how time dialation
can prevent matter spiraling in from getting to the event horizon. can any
one explain how matter gets in.

well , suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was
sent towards a black hole. as it got closer to the event horizon , the
red shift would keep increasing. the period would get longer and longer ,
but it would never stop. an observer would not observe the probe actually
reaching the event horizon. the detected energy from the probe would keep
decreasing , but it would n't vanish. exp( t) never quite reaches zero.

i guess the above probably does n't make things any more clear , but hopefully

unfortunately , i think you 've got it figured pretty well. i also ask
myself the question why did they plan for so many months. why was
this so important to them \? what was the government really up to \?
why did they seal the warrant \? were they after koresh or were they
after the first and second amendments , among others \?

allow me to play devils advocate a moment jg

did n't expect to find you in the devil 's role , stephen , but these are
the times that try men 's souls.

o what was called many months of planning was probably
the intelligence collecting paperwork and interviews.

nine months , as i understand it. no doubt this accounts for a
significant amount of the time as government efficiency in spending
our tax dollars would certainly seek its absolute minimum in such
an event. but my gut instinct says there is more at hand. it took
some careful preplanning to demonize d.k. to such an extent. the
attack meshes well with more restrictive gun control legislation
that seems to be the agenda of the day. it also fits a pattern of
increased government interference in personal religious beliefs.
randy weaver is now on trial .

o it 's important to them because it justifies budgets.

no quarrel here. the big bang theory is always apt at appropriation
time. they just do n't have to possess a single motive.

o the warrant was sealed to keep from jeopardizing the
the government 's case.

i certainly think publication of the warrant undermines the government 's
case since it makes no claims of illegal action. therefore the federal
judge had reason to seal it. but i am reminded of senator frank church 's
remark that secrecy is the trademark of a totalitarian government.
there is rarely sufficient motive to seal a warrant in a nation of
free people.

o there was probably no one actually exercising oversite.
instead , a system of bureaucratic rules has been set
up for such incidents. like computer programs these
have to be debugged periodically. especially when used
in fringe areas. (cf. the hostage rescue program).
therefore no one was in charge. and no one can
reasonably be held responsible.

how can i argue with irrefutable logic \? i have long suspected that
the government has become a mindless machine and now you go and
confirm my worst fears ! has it become a beast that is programmed
simply to say kiss my toe and you get your piece of the pie \?
i suspect bugs in the program arise when agents or those who love
this critter have independent thoughts.

o what they were after , generally speaking , is protecting
their jobs , budgets , and paychecks.

i do n't accept atoms or gravity as fact either. they are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.
other posters have aptly explained the atomic model. gravity , too , is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected , but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity. gravity , however , is not
a fact. it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects
behave in our physical environment. newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force einstein a wave. both are very useful models that
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith , unless of course you
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly
the way the theory now formulated talks about it. that takes a great
leap of faith , which , of course , is what religion takes. evolution
is no different.

still , without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.
for all of this my president takes full responsibility. what a guy !

the .50cal gun was a semi auto , and was thus legal. the batf

i imagine the authorities know the difference between semi and fully automatic
and probably knew weather the guns were legal as they have access to any relative

we have reached the point in our society when there are certain crimes
that are so heinous that to merely be accused with them one is automaticly
considered guilty and deemed not to have any natural rights much less civil
rights. among these are drug abuse , sexual perversion , and political
incorrectness.
today billary accused koresh of having sex with infants. he had been accused of
a number of differing crimes (inconsistantly) over the last two months , but
this is the first time i have heard that one. i had heard child abuse but
this is somewhat stronger.
it is fairly obvious that koresh was hiding behind the children and ironicly
considering his apocalyptic dread , believed enough in the american people 's
inherent goodness to believe he was protected.
it is truly amazing that all these people who 60 days ago had never heard of
the branch davidian now believe that he was suicidal , crazy , a child abuser and
a immenant danger to others based solely on what the government spokespersons
had said. remember that these people have an awful lot to loose if it is found
that they have screwed up.
but they do n't have as much to lose as david koresh and his followers lost.
for in our society as it stands murder is not one of the heinous crimes.

your body feels pain to let you know something is wrong. it 's your body 's
alarm system informing you that something needs your attention.

a fever tells you that you are sick , and need some sort of care.

guilt can be seen as that emotional or spiritual alarm , just informing you
that there is something that you 've done that requires your attention .

it does n't require a personality type to become a believer. it requires
someone who is willing to listen to themselves , their body soul.

all i know is that i do n't know everything. and frankly speaking
i do n't care , life is fun anyway. i recognize that i'm not
perfect , but that does not hinder me from have a healthy
and inspiring life.

for several years all i knew is i really liked dropping 'cid (lsd).
frankly speaking , i did n't really care. it was fun anyway.

it did n't matter that every child my wife and i want to have are at a
tremendously greater risk of serious birth defects.

for several years all i knew is i really liked having sex with as many women
as i could convice. frankly speaking , i did n't care.

i did n't care that i was putting each one of them at risk (as well as their
future partners).

it did n't matter that for the first decade of my marriage , my wife and i
will have the worry that possibly that last sneeze meant something much
worse than a cold.


there are humans that subscribe to the same notion. the nice

recently , i 've asked myself a rather interesting question what right does
god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god , of course... ! ) \? \?

in his infinite wisdom , he made it perfectly clear that if we do n't live
according to his rules , we will burn in hell. well , with what right can god
make that desicion \? let 's say , for the sake of argument , that god creates
every one of us (directly or indirectly , it does n't matter.). what then
happens , is that he first creates us , and then turns us lose. well , i did n't
ask to be created.

let 's make an analogue. if a scientist creates a unique living creature
(which has happened , it was even patented... ! ! ! ) , does he then have the
right to expect it to behave in a certain matter , or die... \?

dear joakim , let me begin by saying that these are excellent questions ,
but that by asking , you will find as many different explanations as there
are respondents. as a latter day saint , i believe that all of us (you ,
me , etc.) lived once as spirit children of god the father (hebrews 12 9)
in the pre mortal existance. in order to continue our eternal progression ,
an earthly probationary time was required. (to live by faith , not by
sight , to choose good over evil , and to prepare ourselves in all things
to become worthy of a higher order of existance.) we believe that all of
god 's spirit offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of
this earthly sojourn. one third chose for lucifer 's plan , most followed
the firstborn (the pre mortal jesus christ). lucifer 's aspirations ( i
will exalt my throne above the stars of god . . . isaiah 14 12 17 , etc.)
resulted into the rebellion of his followers against the firstborn and
those who followed him , resulting in the casting out of lucifer (who
became satan , the father of lies) and one third of the hosts of heaven
( and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven , and did cast
them to the earth . . . revelation 12 4) as demons (evil spirits).

to get back on our choice to be born on this earth , and to be subject to
god and his plan (for good or bad , based upon our obedience and choices) ,
we made that choice individually. (god speaking to job where wast thou
when i laid the foundations of the earth , . . . when the morning stars
sang together , and all the sons of god shouted for joy \? job 38 4 7). we
lost the knowledge of our pre mortal existance (the veil of forgetful
ness , somewhere in psalms) , in order to live by faith , not by sight.

you may not accept this scenario , neither do quite a few who rely on the
bible alone , which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular
aspect of our existence as individuals , as sons and daughters of god.

who is god to impose its rules on us \? who can tell if god is really so
righteous as god likes us to believe \? are all christians a flock of sheep ,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest \?

hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

(all christians , by definition , are a flock of sheep , following the shepherd
as they understand him ) but in any event , not all christians believe
in the same theology , such as the one latter day saints believe in. (they
will cry heresy and other accusations of perverting the doctrines of
the bible , while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations , as
found in their catechisms and various do it yourself bible study manuals...)

as for me , i have a personal conviction that the pre existance scenario as
explained above , is most in harmony with biblical doctrine , some dead sea
scroll books , the pseudographion , other (jewish) sources , and last but not
least , modern day revelation on the subject.

i just want to point out that this is not sarcasm , i mean it.

how should one deal with a man who is convinced that
he is acting according to god 's will , and who there
jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by
stabbing you in the back \?

assuming the most favorable interpretation of your '1000 degree'
measurement (that the temperature is in centigrade , rather than the
more common in the us fahrenheit) , you are still laboring under at
least 2 misconceptions

1. you seem to believe that steel melts somewhere around 1000 c.
actually , the melting point of most iron alloys (and steels are
iron alloys) is in the neighborhood of 1400 c. even if the gun
were found in area which achieved the 1000 c temperature , the steel
parts of the gun would not be deformed , and it would still be
trivial to identify the nature of the weapon.

2. a fire is not an isothermal process. there are 'hot' spots and
'cold' spots , though 'cold' is purely a relative term. so the
weapon was not necessarily situated in a hot spot , as you seem to
imply. and , even if it was , so what \? it would not have melted
anyway.

non religious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead
classmate (1) to comfort the friends by showing respect to the
deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together , (3)
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school , (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it 's not disruptive later.

yeah , all well and good. the fact is , though , that the pro school
prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way
to get prayer back. at my high school for instance , our dear

i can certainly see opposing the amen but that does n't require

would someone be kind enought to document the exact
nature of the evidence against the bd 's without reference to
hearsay or newsreports. i would also like to know more about
their past record etc. but again based on solid not media
reports.

my reason for asking for such evidence is that last night
on larry king live a so called cult expert was interviewed from
australia who claimed that it was his evidence which led to the
original raid. this admission , if true , raises the nasty
possibility that the government acted in good faith , which i
believe they did , on faulty evidence. it also raises the
possibility that other self proclaimed cult experts were advising
them and giving ver poor advice.

a few years ago anson shupe and david bromley published
strange gods the great american cult scare (beacon , boston , 1981
and the new vigilantes anti cultists and new religions sage ,
beverly hills , 1980. both books suggested the possibility of
tragic results if self proclaimed cult experts were ever taken
seriously. perhaps their diagnosis of the anit cult movement
needs investigating in light of the waco tragedy.

article about no knock searches , arrests


hmm. the police strategy of bursting in with weapons drawn , clearly
marked as officers and yelling police repeatedly. this is used every
day to bust drug houses. the idea is to awe the suspects into
submission with surprise and display of firepowere in order to avoid a
gun fight. as for not knocking , it 's a sad necessity in many cases
since the suspects will attempt to escape or even fight. usually this
strategy works if it did n't , then it would n't be used so commonly , now
would it \?

in general no knock raids are to preserve evidence , like drugs ,
which can be flushed down the toilet. they are not the standard way
to arrest a violent felon like a bank robber. if there is no need to
search or preserve evidence they will just surround the dwelling and
order the suspect to come out with her hands up. if the suspect does
not come out tear gas will be used.


comment on the bd omitted


i merely point out that it is a valid strategy which is used every day.
furthermore , we do n't know of any substitute strategy capable of
apprehending potentially dangerous and armed suspects. do you suggest

it is not a method to apprehend criminals.

that the police always knock with guns holstered and never arrest any
suspects until they have been allowed to inspect the officers 's badges \?
just what should the police do when apprehending potentially dangerous
and armed suspects \? how far can they reasonably go to identity
themselves \? what do you suggest they can do which ca n't be faked by the
competition \?

it is a very dangerous method to obtain evidence that might be
destroyed if a warrant is served in the normal way. it is the most
dangerous way to arrest anyone. the cops are charging into a room
and they do n't know what is in it. it is much safer to surround the
place and announce yourself.


even if you 've got deadly enemies who may pretend to be cops , that 's
not an excuse to murder police. in the case of the bd 's , there was
almost definitely at most the paranoid delusion of deadly enimies who
would pretend to be cops.

cops are not cops until they identify themselves as police officers.


most drug dealers and professional criminals are aware of the
likelihood of arrest but they also know how the system works. if they
are arrested they call their lawyer , post bail and hope for a plea
bargain. if they pull a gun and shoot a cop during a raid they will
be charged with first degree murder if they survive the raid. drug
dealers have guns for protection from their customers and other
criminals , not to shoot cops. cops are shot on no knock drug raids
because the criminals are n't aware that they are cops.

no knock raids on homes occupied by non criminals are more likely to
end in disaster. mom and pop citizen know that they have not
committed any crime , they know that anyone breaking into their house
cannot be a cop because they have done nothing wrong. if they have
the means to defend themselves they may because they know that the
housebreakers are criminals not cops. cops and homeowners may die.

the first reports from waco stated that the atf had a warrant to
search for illegal weapons and also an arrest warrant if the illegal
weapons were found. in this case the no knock warrant was not called
for. it is difficult to flush a gun down the toilet. the atf could
have surrounded the compound. a marked police car could have driven
up to the entrance and uniformed officers could have knocked and
served the warrant usual way. it this had happened and and koresh
refused the warrant or drove the cops off at gun point then most of
the t.p.g folks would have kept quiet.

the oed does not list any etymology for cybele since that is a propper noun ,

blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it is
utterly idiotic.

blindly opposing everything with a flavor of religion in it that is
supported by taxpayer money is the only way to keep christianity from
becoming the official u.s. religion.

please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
actively religious (e.g. actual prayer , amen after a moment of
silence , mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have
possible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of
silence , having the bible on the shelves during reading period) is not
a way to prevent a state religion.

when the fbi started wrecking the place , they could easily have
ruptured the lines. which then would start spreading out through

built with non flamable insulation.

it 's probably more plausible than anything else , that the fire started
mainly as a result of accident or willful negligence on the part of
the fbi , which should have known better (ie. manslaughter).

it 's certain that if the tanks had n't been used that day the fire

definitely included and works like mantak chia 's argued about !

i tend to be a bit critical of any stratification of taoism. i especially
tend to frown on any suggestion that orthodoxy or classics have any
special place in tao.

i think neo taoism should be excluded or get its own group (what i
mean by this is humpty dumpty taoism , in which taoism means whatever
a poster says it means.) this alt.taoism could also be a refuge
for debates about what taoism really means or speculations on sexual
alchemy , etc..

so rather than debate what taoism really means you are suggesting that
we take someone else 's word for it and work thusly \? i 'd rather not , thank
you.

what 's happening is that that the term taoism is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words magic , alchemy ,
zen , etc. , by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they
want. this is seen by the spate of new age books entitled the
tao of this , that , and everything else.

wonderful idea.

it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the

welcome to the peace run

you 're invited to join in
a global relay run... and
help light the way.



why the peace run

there 's a new spirit in the nineties a spirit of oneness , a growing
belief in the possibility of true global peace.

the goal of the sri chinmoy oneness home peace run is simple to
bring this spirit forward in a concrete way , to transform it into
a reality in their own lives.

every other year , thousands of men , women and children from more
than 70 nations passing a flaming peace torch from hand to hand
join together in a relay run that virtually circles the globe.
transcending political and cultural boundaries , they go from
nation to nation across mountains , jungles and deserts carrying
the message of brotherhood to all humankind.

each person who holds or runs with the peace torch lights a path
for those who follow. each time the peace torch changes hands , the
flame of oneness burns a little brighter until one day it will
shine in the hearts and minds of every individual on earth.


making history

the three peace runs since 1987 have achieved some historic break
throughs in the middle east , a landmark run crossed the egyptian
israeli border in europe , a precedent setting run linked eastern
and western europe with russia in the united states , mexico and
canada , entire cities were dedicated to the cause of world peace
and in poland , the peace torch was blessed by pope john paul ii.


speaking as one world
leaders , celebrities and you

the peace run has won the support of leaders the world over
presidents , prime ministers , religious leaders , sports figures and
entertainment personalities.

its message has spread to a half billion people though newspaper
reports , magazine articles and radio and tv broadcasts , including
specials on pbs , mtv and nbc 's today show.

i am happy to support your peace run for justice , peace and
reconciliation. the world must know that god wants us to live
amicably as brothers and sisters , members of one family , the human
family , god 's family. archbishop desmond tutu ,

city on saturday april 17 , converging at various points to lead
up to the opening ceremony outside the united nations dag

were gathered for the fourth lighting of the peace torch.

from there , peace torches are now being transported to over
seventy countries for a series of concurrent international or
cross country relay runs including the united states , canada ,
japan , australia , russia and eastern and western europe. smaller

america , egypt and elsewhere in africa. distance to be covered
31 , 000 miles.

the peace run wil do much to inspire the hearts and stimulate
the minds of those who support , participate in , witness , or hear
about the event. carl lewis ,
six time olympic gold medalist


who 's behind it

the peace run is sponsored by the sri chinmoy marathon team , an
international running organization that believes sports can be a
powerful instrument for promoting world peace. each year the team
puts on hundreds of athletic events , including several world class
ultramarathons , marathons and triathlons , in dozens of countries.

the peace run itself is inspired by the global peace ambassador
sri chinmoy , who has written and lectured extensively on peace ,
offered hundreds of free peace concerts and met with countless
world figures to advance the cause of international harmony.

the run is managed by peace runs international , a non profit
organization based in the united states.


take a step for peace

the peace runs in 1987 , 1989 and 1991 attracted nearly half a
million participants. we 're expecting even more people to join
peace run '93.

you can also join the run carrying the peace torch a few steps ,
a few blocks or a few miles. or you can come out and cheer the
runners as they carry the torch through your community.

you can also join local celebrities and government officials in
one of the thousands of welcoming ceremonies scheduled along the
70 nation route.

your inner support is important too. if you 're a runner , each time
you go out , you can dedicate your run to the cause of world peace.


the next step is yours
make it one for peace

to make it more practical. if i attempted to stick you with a needle you

koresh may have been misguided , only god knows. but the jews at masada
died for what they believed , the three hebrews preferred to die in the
furnace rather than bow down , daniel preferred to die in a lion 's den
rather than stop praying to his god , and as a christian i am prepared to

koresh was not dying for now reason. he had a cause. why should he give
up the children to forces he was convinced were evil. the events are
bizarre but they match his beliefs.

the following partial summary of a theory of the universe includes a
little known description of the creation of our solar system


larsonian astronomy and physics

orthodox physicists , astronomers , and astrophysicists
claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all
of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single
set of laws or equations. but they have been systematically
ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years !

the late physicist dewey b. larson 's comprehensive
general unified theory of the physical universe , which he
calls the reciprocal system , is built on two fundamental
postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of
space and time

(1) the physical universe is composed entirely of one
component , motion , existing in three dimensions , in discrete
units , and in two reciprocal forms , space and time.

(2) the physical universe conforms to the relations of
ordinary commutative mathematics , its magnitudes are
absolute , and its geometry is euclidean.

from these two postulates , larson developed a complete
theoretical universe , using various combinations of
translational , vibrational , rotational , and vibrational
rotational motions , the concepts of in ward and out ward
scalar motions , and speeds in relation to the speed of light
(which larson called unit velocity and the natural
datum ).

at each step in the development , larson was able to
match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the
real physical universe , (photons , sub atomic particles
incomplete atoms , charges , atoms , molecules , globular star
clusters , galaxies , binary star systems , solar systems , white
dwarf stars , pulsars , quasars , etc.) , even objects not yet
discovered then (such as exploding galaxies , and gamma ray
bursts).

and applying his theory to his new model of the atom ,
larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter
atomic distances in crystals and molecules , compressibility
and thermal expansion of solids , and other properties of
matter.

all of this is described in good detail , with out fancy
complex mathematics , in his books.



books of dewey b. larson

the following is a complete list of the late physicist
dewey b. larson 's books about his comprehensive general
unified theory of the physical universe. some of the early
books are out of print now , but still available through
inter library loan.

the structure of the physical universe (1959)

the case against the nuclear atom (1963)

beyond newton (1964)

new light on space and time (1965)

quasars and pulsars (1971)

nothing but motion (1979)
a 9.50 substitute for the 8.3 billion super
collider .
the last four chapters explain chemical bonding.

the neglected facts of science (1982)

the universe of motion (1984)
final solutions to most all astrophysical
mysteries.

basic properties of matter (1988)

all but the last of these books were published by north
pacific publishers , p.o. box 13255 , portland , or 97213 , and
should be available via inter library loan if your local
university or public library does n't have each of them.

several of them , including the last one , are available
from the international society of unified science (isus) ,
1680 e. atkin ave. , salt lake city , utah 84106. this is the
organization that was started to promote larson 's theory.
they have other related publications , including the quarterly
journal reciprocity .



physicist dewey b. larson 's background

physicist dewey b. larson was a retired engineer
(chemical or electrical). he was about 91 years old when he
died in may 1989. he had a bachelor of science degree in
engineering science from oregon state university. he
developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the
physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute
chemical properties based only on the elements used.

larson 's lack of a fancy ph.d. degree might be one
reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him , but it is
not a valid reason. sometimes it takes a relative outsider
to clearly see the forest through the trees. at the same
time , it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox
physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer ,
well enough to point out all their contradictions , ad hoc
assumptions , principles of impotence , in consistencies , etc..

larson did not have the funds , etc. to experimentally
test his theory. and it was not necessary for him to do so.
he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other
researchers' experimental and observational data. and in
many cases , his explanation fit better.

a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox
physicists and astronomers have ! they claim to be looking
for a unified field theory that works , but have been
ignoring one for over 30 years now !

modern physics does not explain the physical universe
so well. some parts of some of larson 's books are full of
quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who
agree. and remember that epicycles , crystal spheres ,
geocentricity , flat earth theory , etc. , also once seemed
to explain it well , but were later proved conceptually wrong.


prof. frank h. meyer , professor emeritus of uw superior ,
was is a strong proponent of larson 's theory , and was (or
still is) president of larson 's organization , the
international society of unified science , and editor of
their quarterly journal reciprocity . he moved to
minneapolis after retiring.



super collider boondoggle !

i am against contruction of the superconducting super
collider , in texas or anywhere else. it would be a gross
waste of money , and contribute almost nothing of scientific
value.

most physicists do n't realize it , but , according to the
comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist
dewey b. larson , as described in his books , the strange goofy
particles ( mesons , hyperons , alleged quarks , etc.)
which they are finding in existing colliders (fermi lab ,
cern , etc.) are really just atoms of anti matter , which are
created by the high energy colliding beams , and which quickly
disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible
with their environment.

a larger and more expensive collider will only create a
few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not
seen there before , and the physicists will be even more
confused than they are now !

are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the 8.3
billion cost \? ! ! do n't we have much more important uses for
this wasted money \? !


another thing to consider is that the primary proposed
location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some
kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground
cables. how much poisoning of the ground and ground water
with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of
the supercollider \? !


naming the super collider after ronald reagon , as
proposed , is totally absurd ! if it is built , it should be
named after a leading particle physicist.



larsonian anti matter

in larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the
physical universe , anti matter is not a simple case of
opposite charges of the same types of particles. it has more
to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the
photons of which they are made , in relation to the
vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light ,
which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum .

in larson 's theory , a positron is actually a particle of
matter , not anti matter. when a positron and electron meet ,
the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their
respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each
other.

in larson 's theory , the anti matter half of the physical
universe has three dimensions of time , and only one dimension
of space , and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our
material half.



larsonian relativity

the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury
has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the
rate of 574 seconds of arc per century. 531 seconds of this
advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational
perturbations from the other planets (venus , earth , jupiter ,
etc.). the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to
help prove einstein 's general theory of relativity .

but the late physicist dewey b. larson achieved results
closer to the 43 seconds than general relativity can , by
instead using special relativity . in one or more of his
books , he applied the lorentz transformation on the high
orbital speed of mercury.

larson totally rejected general relativity as another
mathematical fantasy. he also rejected most of special
relativity , including the parts about mass increases near
the speed of light , and the use of the lorentz transform on
doppler shifts , (those quasars with red shifts greater than
1.000 really are moving faster than the speed of light ,
although most of that motion is away from us in time.).

in larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the
physical universe , there are three dimensions of time instead
of only one. but two of those dimensions can not be measured
from our material half of the physical universe. the one
dimension that we can measure is the clock time. at low
relative speeds , the values of the other two dimensions are
negligible but at high speeds , they become significant , and
the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor.
larson often used the term coordinate time when writing
about this.


in regard to mass increases , it has been proven in
atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near
the speed of light. but the formula for acceleration is
acceleration force mass , (a f m). orthodox physicists
are ignoring the third factor force. in larson 's theory ,
mass stays constant and force drops toward zero. force is
actually a motion , or combinations of motions , or relations
between motions , including inward and outward scalar motions.
the expansion of the universe , for example , is an outward
scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of
the so called big bang (which is yet another mathematical
fantasy).



the universe of motion

i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe
of motion , by dewey b. larson , 1984 , north pacific
publishers , (p.o. box 13255 , portland , oregon 97213) , 456
pages , indexed , hardcover.

it contains the astrophysical portions of a general
unified theory of the physical universe developed by that
author , an unrecognized genius , more than thirty years ago.

it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical
mysteries , including the formation of galaxies , binary and
multiple star systems , and solar systems , the true origin of
the 3 degree background radiation , cosmic rays , and gamma
ray bursts , and the true nature of quasars , pulsars , white
dwarfs , exploding galaxies , etc..

it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all
looking for , if they are ready to seriously consider it with
open minds !

the following is an example of his theory 's success
in his first book in 1959 , the structure of the physical
universe , larson predicted the existence of exploding
galaxies , several years before astronomers started finding
them. they are a necessary consequence of larson 's
comprehensive theory. and when quasars were discovered , he
had an immediate related explanation for them also.



gamma ray bursts

astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching
their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts. they were
originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the
disc of our galaxy. but the new gamma ray telescope now in
earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions
uniformly , and their source locations in space do not
correspond to any known objects , (except for a few cases of
directional coincidence).

gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the
general unified theory of the physical universe developed by
the late physicist dewey b. larson. according to page 386 of
his book the universe of motion , published in 1984 , the
gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the
anti matter half of the physical universe , which larson calls
the cosmic sector . because of the relationship between the
anti matter and material halves of the physical universe , and
the way they are connected together , the gamma ray bursts can
pop into our material half anywhere in space , seemingly at
random. (this is why the source locations of the bursts do
not correspond with known objects , and come from all
directions uniformly.)

i wonder how close to us in space a source location
would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most
life on earth ! there would be no way to predict one , nor to
stop it !

perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past , which
are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids , were
actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts !



larsonian binary star formation

about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the
vicinity of the sun are binary or double. but orthodox
astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory
theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.

but binary star systems are actually a likely
consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of
the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey
b. larson.

i will try to summarize larsons explanation , which is
detailed in chapter 7 of his book the universe of motion
and in some of his other books.

first of all , according to larson , stars do not generate
energy by fusion . a small fraction comes from slow
gravitational collapse. the rest results from the complete
annihilation of heavy elements (heavier than iron). each
element has a destructive temperature limit. the heavier the
element is , the lower is this limit. a star 's internal
temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and
absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays , gradually
reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and
lighter elements.

when the internal temperature of the star reaches the
destructive temperature limit of iron , there is a type i
supernova explosion ! this is because there is so much iron
present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms
and the atom building process , which larson explains in some
of his books better than i can .

when the star explodes , the lighter material on the
outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less
than the speed of light. the heavier material in the center
portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to
the speed of light , because of the high temperature. the
explosion pushes that material over the speed of light , and
it expands outward in time , which is equivalent to inward in
space , and it often actually disappears for a while.

over long periods of time , both masses start to fall
back gravitationally. the material that had been blown
outward in space now starts to form a red giant star. the
material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a
white dwarf star. both stars then start moving back toward
the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r
diagram.

the chances of the two masses falling back into the
exact same location in space , making a single lone star
again , are near zero. they will instead form a binary
system , orbiting each other.

according to larson , a white dwarf star has an inverse
density gradient (is densest at its surface) , because the
material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown
outward) in time. this eliminates the need to resort to
mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter , neutron
stars , black holes , etc..



larsonian solar system formation

if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the
exploding star is relatively small , then , instead of a single
white dwarf star , there will be several mini white dwarf
stars (revolving around the red giant star , but probably
still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected
by its heat , etc.). these will become planets !

in chapter 7 of the universe of motion , larson used all
this information , and other principles of his comprehensive
general unified theory of the physical universe , to derive
his own version of bode 's law.



black hole fantasy !

i heard that physicist stephen w. hawking recently
completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black
holes merging together into a single black hole , and
concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than
the sum of the two original black holes .

such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red
flag , causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black
holes , etc. !

after reading physicist dewey b. larson 's books about
his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical
universe , especially his book the universe of motion , it is
clear to me that black holes are nothing more than
mathematical fantasies ! the strange object at cygnus x 1 is
just an unusually massive white dwarf star , not the black
hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want
to prove their theory.


by the way , i do not understand why so much publicity is
being given to physicist stephen hawking. the physicists and
astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking 's severe physical
problem somehow makes him wiser . it does not !

i wish the same attention had been given to physicist
dewey b. larson while he was still alive. widespread
publicity and attention should now be given to larson 's
theory , books , and organization (the international society of
unified science).



electro magnetic propulsion

i heard of that concept many years ago , in connection
with ufo 's and unorthodox inventors , but i never was able to
find out how or why they work , or how they are constructed.

i found a possible clue about why they might work on
pages 112 113 of the book basic properties of matter , by
the late physicist dewey b. larson , which describes part of
larson 's comprehensive general unified theory of the physical
universe. i quote one paragraph

as indicated in the preceding chapter , the development
of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally
different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.
the electrons , we find , are derived from the environment. it
was brought out in volume i larson 's book nothing but
motion that there are physical processes in operation which
produce electrons in substantial quantities , and that ,
although the motions that constitute these electrons are , in
many cases , absorbed by atomic structures , the opportunities
for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are
limited. it follows that there is always a large excess of
free electrons in the material sector material half of the
universe , most of which are uncharged. in this uncharged
state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension
space , because they are inherently rotating units of space ,
and the relation of space to space is not motion. in open
space , therefore , each uncharged electron remains permanently
in the same location with respect to the natural reference
system , in the manner of a photon. in the context of the
stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron ,
like the photon , is carried outward at the speed of light by
the progression of the natural reference system. all
material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons
similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.
meanwhile there are other processes , to be discussed later ,
whereby electrons are returned to the environment. the
electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth
therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.

note that in larson 's theory , uncharged electrons are
also massless , and are basically photons of light of a
particular frequency (above the unit frequency) spinning
around one axis at a particular rate (below the unit rate).
( unit velocity is the speed of light , and there are
vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light ,
according to larson 's theory.) i might have the above and
below labels mixed up.

larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass
less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of
light !

if this is true , then the electro magnetic propulsion
fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these
electrons , or other particles in space , perhaps giving them a
charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to
achieve propulsion. (in larson 's theory , an electrical charge
is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular
frequency (above the unit frequency) superimposed on the
rotation of the particle.)

the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to
confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is
generated in clouds.



suppression of larsonian physics

the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical
universe developed by the late physicist dewey b. larson has
been available for more than 30 years , published in 1959 in
his first book the structure of the physical universe .

it is totally un scientific for hawking , wheeler , sagan ,
and the other sacred priests of the religion they call
science (or physics , or astronomy , etc.) , as well as
the scientific literature and the education systems , to
totally ignore larson 's theory has they have.

larson 's theory has excellent explanations for many
things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers , such
as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars.

larson 's theory deserves to be honestly and openly
discussed in the physics , chemistry , and astronomy journals ,
in the u.s. and elsewhere. and at least the basic principles
of larson 's theory should be included in all related courses
at uw ec , uw madison , cambridge , cornell university , and
elsewhere , so that students are not kept in the dark about a
worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed.

please consult my cited sources (especially larson 's books).

if you would like to understand better the sort of behavior

recommend reading when prophecy fails , by leon festinger ,
henry riecken , and stanley schachter (available as a harper
torchbook). it goes a long way towards explaining how a
belief system can be so strong as to withstand even overwhelming
disconfirmatory evidence. at least , read the first chapter.
interestingly , just as the branch davidians had roots in the
seventh day adventist movement , the sdas themselves had their
roots in the millerite movement of the first half of the 19th
century a movement that expected the end of the world in 1843 ,
was disappointed when it did not take place , and wound up as
a church.

ho can also be satan. another passage concerning satan 's fall from heaven is
ezekiel 28 12 19.

and separately

devil chose to try to become greater than god.
he wanted to sit on god 's throne.
when the devil was created , he was one of the most beautiful angels in heaven.

we have here three distinct claims concerning the results of the devil 's
decision making , a specific desire , and a physical description. now , in
support (aside from the minor detail that an author seldom writes an unbiased
account of the opposition) we see

isaiah 14 12 15

isa 14 12 how art thou fallen from heaven , o lucifer , son of the
morning ! how art thou cut down to the ground , which didst weaken
the nations !

isa 14 13 for thou hast said in thine heart , i will ascend into

heaven , i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will sit

also upon the mount of the congregation , in the sides of the north

isa 14 14 i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will
be like the most high.

isa 14 15 yet thou shalt be brought down to hell , to the sides
of the pit.


does n't say sits on god 's throne. says will exhault throne above the stars.

daniel 10 12 14

dan 10 12 then said he unto me , fear not , daniel for from the
first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand , and to
chasten thyself before thy god , thy words were heard , and i am
come for thy words.

dan 10 13 but the prince of the kingdom of persia withstood me

one and twenty days but , lo , michael , one of the chief princes ,

came to help me and i remained there with the kings of persia.

dan 10 14 now i am come to make thee understand what shall be
fall thy people in the latter days for yet the vision is for
many days.


see who is being discussed \?


ezekiel 28 12 19

eze 28 12 son of man , take up a lamentation upon the king of

tyrus , and say unto him , thus saith the lord god thou sealest up

the sum , full of wisdom , and perfect in beauty.

eze 28 13 thou hast been in eden the garden of god every pre
cious stone was thy covering , the sardius , topaz , and the dia
mond , the beryl , the onyx , and the jasper , the sapphire , the em
erald , and the carbuncle , and gold the workmanship of thy ta
brets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou
wast created.

eze 28 14 thou art the anointed cherub that covereth and i have
set thee so thou wast upon the holy mountain of god thou hast
walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

eze 28 15 thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou
wast created , till iniquity was found in thee.

eze 28 16 by the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled
the midst of thee with violence , and thou hast sinned therefore
i will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of god and i
will destroy thee , o covering cherub , from the midst of the
stones of fire.

eze 28 17 thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty , thou
hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness i will
cast thee to the ground , i will lay thee before kings , that they
may behold thee.

eze 28 18 thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of
thine iniquities , by the iniquity of thy traffick therefore will
i bring forth a fire from the midst of thee , it shall devour
thee , and i will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight
of all them that behold thee.

eze 28 19 all they that know thee among the people shall be as
tonished at thee thou shalt be a terror , and never shalt thou be
any more.

not we agree with various points of theology therein , a review
would likely provide significant insight into our own love

reading of koresh 's message is that he was not the 'looney

but was quite possibly the friendly , likeable person his
attorney reported him to be.

someone stated that the davidian cult should not be associated
with christianity. well , i read all those four postings , and i'm
now even more convinced that davididians are truly christian
in nature. but sometimes it makes sense to re label the cult ,
especially if the ugliness is too much to handle.

brian kendig also declares

christ means chosen , the person chosen to fulfill the prophesies
of the old testament and bring about a new age of hope and spiritual
growth for mankind.

christ is greek for messiah . messiah means annointed one .
annoint means to rub with oil , i.e. to anoint by impl. to
consecrate the major prophet daniel uses the word messiah
in daniel chapter 9.

how closely did you analyze the bible \? looks as if you did n't

hello ceci

my name is tony and i have a few comments on your rosicrucian
adventure. i hereby state that i am not claiming or denying membership in
any order , fraternity etc. with or without the word rosicrucian in the
name of the organization. i only claim having done some homework )

this is intended as a friendly article and if at times it seems
different , it 's my lack of writing skills showing , nothing else. heck ,
english may be my second language ! (and then again maybe not by now )

i proceed

i had an ehum , interesting experience with the rosicrucians , or at
least rosicrucians of some sort last sunday.

let 's start with the name rosicrucian . i took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a member of a
rosicrucian body and being a rosicrucian. so when you say that you met
some 'rosicrucians' you mean members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian . at least that is what your observation suggests )

i 'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium
rosicrucianum , only because they may be confused , by some readers of this
newsgroup , with the rosicrucian order amorc based (the usa jurisdiction) in
san jose , ca this being the rc org with the most members (last time i
looked). of course , most members does not necessarily mean best .

anyway , the lectorium rosicrucianum claims they
descend (at least in part) from what was the gold und rosenkreuz (golden
and rosy cross) , from the 18th century. there were two golden and rosy
cross , the first (chronologically) more alchemical , the second with
masonic tinges , but their history is the subject of a complete chapter ).

you 'll have to trust me when i tell you that if that
lecture class whatever had been presented by amorc , it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression , i.e. , you 'd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one , imho.

the first guy also said that the r s are a mystical christian order , and
that they base their teachings on the teachings of the kathars
(english \? ) from the thirteenth century.

again , instead of r s , it should be lectorium rosicrucianum ). it
is curious to know that 3 other rc 'orders' (in the usa) claim to be non
sectarian .

the cathars were a 'heretic' christian sect that directly challenged
the 'authority' of the medieval catholic church. they flourished during the
12th century , century which saw the religious zeal expressed in the
crusades and also the growing disillusion with the catholic church and the
worldly ways of its clerics. it was largely in response to the church 's
unseemly pomp and splendor that catharism took root , first in northern
italy , then throughout the south of france.


what made me a bit suspicious , was the way they first said that we all
contained something divine , and could find our way back to divinity ,
then that we could n't become divine as the persons we are currently ,
but if we worked really hard we would reach eternal bliss.

i do n't see nothing fundamentally wrong with us containing
something divine ... and yes i do n't like phrases like eternal bliss
either ! )

how to robotize people and brainwash...

) commercial advertising is produced here in the usa )

into electricity. there is absolutely no way we can build a perfect power

ok , let me narrow the question. is it useful to strive toward a
(nonexistent) objective ethics \?

i 'd guess that it might be.

in what way \?

it may be the case that some people are unable to evaluate complex moral
issues. rather than leaving them to behave immorally , it might be better
to offer them an abstract (nonexistent objective) system of ethics which they
can strive towards , coded into rules which they do n't have to derive for
themselves.

i tend to feel that this is pretty much what we all have as morality
anyway...

the danger of anti cult groups is that while they can expose a lot of
deception , they can also become inquisitors. as one who agrees with
much of what they say , i am also on the receiving end , and it makes me
realize the importance of respecting the freedom of belief of every
individual and also of not jumping to conclusions and making accusations
based on a priori assumptions about an individual or group.

for my money the primary danger of anti cult groups is that they are
every bit as wacky as the groups they oppose and that by and large
they have no compunctions about printing lies , half truths and
misleading innuendos as part of their exposes. a recent book on
cults i picked up by a christian author quite simply mixed in
all non christian religions (except the jews) and various new age
groups with various fringe groups of dubious intent and legality.

on the other hand , the watchman fellowship does a good service in
exposing deceptive practices that are far too common among the
groups they monitor.

given the record of american christianity , any group that falls
into the category of fundamentalist or born again is automatically
into the inquisition business. it is an unavoidable affliction
of those who have a proprietary license on the truth (tm).
and let 's not forget that jonestown and the branch davidians are
just as much a part of the christian tradition as the missouri synod
lutherans , and may in fact be the massadas of true christian believers.

i am far more concerned about the encroachment of overtly christian
indoctrination into public schools than i am about yoga classes there.

recently , i 've asked myself a rather interesting question what right does
god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god , of course... ! ) \? \?


he is god.

in his infinite wisdom , he made it perfectly clear that if we do n't live
according to his rules , we will burn in hell. well , with what right can god
make that desicion \?

he is god.

let 's say , for the sake of argument , that god creates every
one of us (directly or indirectly , it does n't matter.). what then happens , is
that he first creates us , and then turns us lose. well , i did n't ask to be
created.


god granted you the gift of life whether you were sinner or saint.

let 's make an analogue. if a scientist creates a unique living creature (which
has happened , it was even patented... ! ! ! ) , does he then have the right to
expect it to behave in a certain matter , or die... \?


the scientist creates the living creature to examine it , poke and prod it and
learn about its behaviour. he will kill it if it becomes a threat. for
example , let 's say the scientist creates a tyrannosaurus rex and it breaks
free of its confines and starts devouring the population. the scientist
would not hesitate in killing it.

god creates us to be his loving companions. he knows whether we are true in
our love for him or not. and he lets us know the consequences of rejecting him.
god cannot abide by sin. by rejecting god , a person becomes an enemy of god ,
one that must be killed by him. note i say that god and god alone is
worthy to be judge , jury and executioner. we are not called to carry out
such duties because we are not worthy.

who is god to impose its rules on us \? who can tell if god is really so
righteous as god likes us to believe \? are all christians a flock of sheep ,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest \?


god is god. who are we to question the creator \? if you doubt god 's doing
in certain situations , do you claim to know a better solution \? would you
be playing the role of god \?

hmmmmmmmmmmmm.

i just want to point out that this is not sarcasm , i mean it.

how should one deal with a man who is convinced that
he is acting according to god 's will , and who there
jokke fore believes that he is doing you a favour by
stabbing you in the back \?

if you say x statement and give it the authority of fact , i will respond

intent is to convince me that x statement is true , then yes , the burden
of proof is upon you.

if what was being discussed could be established or disproven by
experiment and observation , then i would agree with you , chris.
the burden of proof would belong to bill. but the source
document for christianity , the bible , simply assumes god exists
and makes it clear (to us calvinists , anyway )) that when a person
is in fellowship with god , it is because god has taken the initiative
in revealing himself to that person. so from a christian point of
view , the burden of proof belongs to god. bill is being consistent
with what the bible teaches in relating his own experience with god ,
but it would be an error on his part to assume that there is a direct ,
causal relationship between his testimony and someone else becoming
convinced that god exists and that he needs to be reconciled to god.


if you are merely giving testimony to your beliefs , then you are an egotist.

please excuse me if i missed an earlier part of this thread
in which bill came across like an egotist. what i saw was simply
obedience to the scriptural command to always be ready

for your information , i checked the library of congress catalog ,

earth magic

the neck of the giraffe , or where darwin went wrong

pendulum the psi connection

the world atlas of mysteries

i was extremely careful in this posting not to say anything which
was not factual. i made no judgement about hitching or the quality of
the quotation attributed to him. i have not read any of the books
listed (although i did glimpse briefly at earth magic , i saw nothing
that i would care to comment on). it was solely in response to an
inquiry by warren about hitching , and your assertion that he is a
paleontologist. i do not know whether he is or is not a paleontologist.
i do not claim to know anything about him , except this listing of his
publications.

however , i get the decided impression that i am being included
among the branch atheists on the basis of this post. if that
impression is mistaken , please let me know. otherwise , i should let
you know that the implications are very offensive to me , and i

these laws written for the israelites , god 's chosen people whom god had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world. the israelites were a
direct witness to god 's existence. to disobey god after knowing that god
is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable.
remember , these laws were written for a different time and applied only to
god 's chosen people. but jesus has changed all of that. we are living in the
age of grace. sin is no longer immediately punishable by death. there is
repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ. and not just
for a few chosen people. salvation is available to everyone , jew and gentile
alike.

sorry if this is late for the thread , but...

i thought god was supposed to be constant and never changing. how do
you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above \?


god never changes. he still loves us. sending jesus was one of his
attempts to reconcile with mankind. the nature of god has not changed.


also , while we 're at it

1. how do you reconcile a kind and loving god ! ! with the
judeo christian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable
by death \? was killing people for sinning god 's way of showing
kindness and love \?


sinning in the face of god was punishable by immediate death. there are
several ot passages to back this up. god is god. he cannot tolerate
the prescence of sin in his midst. and the israelites knew this ! and
still , some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed. were these
people kind and loving themselves \? god gave them every break he could
but in the end , he really had no choice in the matter. seeing as how
we were failing to achieve salvation on our own , he sent his son to die
for us to be the ultimate sin offering. now we live in the age of
grace.



2. is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of
having made a mistake \?


he sent his son as a consolation to us , out of love.

3. now that we are living in the age of grace , does this mean that
for our sins , god now damns us to eternal hell after we die , rather
than killing us immediately \? if so , is this eternal damnation an
example of a kind and loving god ! ! \?


hey , let 's be fair for a moment here. kind and loving does not mean
a free ride. there is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.
parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that
children can do whatever they want \? not ! part of being a parent means
administering punishment when the child is at fault. part of being a
parent means giving instruction. god tests us through the trial of
life such that we may grow stronger. he teaches what is right and
what is wrong. the consequences of our actions are made clear to us ,
be it heaven or be it hell. if god did not follow through with what
he has warned us about , he would not be a very good parent.

in parenting , if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through
with it , the children will not take that parent 's words very seriously.
god does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and
what not to do. by life 's trials , we see the folly of doing our own
will rather than his. he warns us about the consequences of rejecting
him when it comes time for judgement. do we follow him \?

i will.

peace be with you ,

the point about its being real or not is that one does not waste time with
what reality might be when one wants predictions. the questions if the
atoms are there or if something else is there making measurements indicate
atoms is not necessary in such a system.

jim and andy both have it incorrect i believe

the facts are what is there , the processes that exist in the
present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured
in the past. these facts exist with or without a theory.

the theory tries and explains the facts and how they relate
to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both
coherent and useful , that it can be used to make predictions.

the facts of gravity , evolution , electromagnetic radiation ,
relativity , atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they
behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain
how they interact... or even why.

a theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict
the existence of a previously unknown fact , and if we find this
fact as the theory predicted we say the theory is supported
by the facts . a theory is a mental construct , a speculation ,
a model. if it is a good model , it may be useful.

in science a theory is something that is supported by the
evidence , considerable evidence , sometimes all of the evidence.
a hypothesis is a new fledgling theory because there is not
yet enough evidence to support it. when a new hypothesis
is proposed to replace an existing theory , it must explain
all of the facts that the current theory explains and at least
some of the facts that the current theory could not and or
predict new facts.

it is so simple.... i'm surprised that this subject gets

dead and periodically appeared to his followers and the fbi over the
next 40 days. living with someone who 's risen from the dead is n't easy ,
as timmy baterman 's father in pet sematary could attest , so after 40
days they did what baterman did shot themselves and burned the place

i am also unhappy (or actually , very suspicious) that the fbi was dismissing
out of hand any chances that they might have accidentally set the blaze
themselves. i mean , i guess we are just supposed to believe that
ramming modified tanks into the walls of a building and injecting
toxic gases into the building are just routine procedures , no way
anything could go wrong.

my core point was , and still is , that 19 children died , and mr.
koresh could just have opened the door and asked the children to
go out before all this happened. you might blaim fbi , atf ,
president clinton , satan , pepsi coke or anything else , but
you ca n't avoid the fact that one single action would have
saved small children from a dreadful and painful death.

1) well , mr koresh allowed other children and adults to leave the compound
during the course of the siege why didnt these children leave then \?
i dont know myself , and certainly havent heard any answers on this here.

2) yes , one simple non action , ie not attacking the compound with
modified tanks , would have prevented this tragedy. i bet you blamed
the move people for the deaths that occurred in adjacent row
houses in philadelphia , not the government which dropped the
firebomb , right \?

recently , i 've asked myself a rather interesting question what right does
god have on our lives (always assuming there is a god , of course... ! ) \? \?

in his infinite wisdom , he made it perfectly clear that if we do n't live
according to his rules , we will burn in hell. well , with what right can god
make that desicion \? let 's say , for the sake of argument , that god creates every
one of us (directly or indirectly , it does n't matter.). what then happens , is
that he first creates us , and then turns us lose. well , i did n't ask to be
created.

i guess i ought not conclude from this , then , that since you did n't ask to
be created , you do n't care if you go to hell. )

let 's make an analogue. if a scientist creates a unique living creature (which
has happened , it was even patented... ! ! ! ) , does he then have the right to
expect it to behave in a certain matter , or die... \?

who is god to impose its rules on us \? who can tell if god is really so
righteous as god likes us to believe \? are all christians a flock of sheep ,
unable to do otherwise that follow the rest \?

i do n't consider myself an unthinking sheep. the bible says god created
us to be in communion and obedience to him. the first and only rule was
to not eat of a certain tree , or else the punishment is distance from him
and physical death. god 's intention in creating us is to have a relationship
with us. the bible documents god 's attempts to have that relationship
culminating in the person of jesus to bear the consequences of all sin so
that all who accept him can have a relationship with god again the purpose
of creation.

who is god to impose rules on us \? he 's god and he created us. i suppose
he has a right based on who he is. above you mention in his infinite
wisdom , and that 's what i 'd say god exemplifies. but if you were being
sarcastic up there , then this whole discussion is irrelevant , eh \? and if
we believe god is infinitely wise , that belief should inform our relationship
with him.

looking at your discussion i would say that you both operate
from your own reference frame. there 's no inside and no outside ,
there are just two polarized views. as for statements inside the
bible , things are still not that clear , we do n't have any indications
for instance why jobs was placed in the old testament , one of the
few books that actually talks about satan. jobs is very much out
of line with the rest of the ot books , and there 's a chance that
someone added this book later into the group of ot scriptures.

now in your sense , kent , of sensing reality that is a different
matter. and to you and to brian , relativity does play a big role.
what we perceive to be true , depends on our vantage point. since i
have read the bible , and brian kendig shows that he has n't , he has
a narrower perspective than mine (at least in the respect

plateau where brian now stands.

this operates the other way around as well. you have to understand
the mind of an atheist , agnostic , or as in my case , a radical
relativist. if you do n't understand the underlying concepts , it is
pretty hard to continue with a dialogue. i'm not a perfect christian ,
however about 20 years of christian teaching should have provided
me with a pretty good picture of the christian mind frame.

a baby 's innocence has nothing to do with whether the baby
is a sinner. innocence and the sin nature are two different attributes.
the baby is innocent , yet the baby is a sinner.
you have two arms and two legs \? why \? because your parents did.
why \? because their parents did. etc. did you do anything to get them \?

the thing is , i know what arms and legs are. it 's therefore generally easy to
tell whether or not someone has arms and legs. this sinful nature , since it
does not require that the baby actually perform any sins , seems to be totally
invisible. as far as i know , maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and
half do n't it 'd look exactly the same , since there is no way to tell the
difference.

we are born sinners. we are born sinners because our parents
were born with it. we got it from them. we did nothing to earn
the title sinner . we get it because our parents had it , their
parents had it , their grandparents had it , etc , infinitum.

bad if it always results in people committing sins , but babies can have it ,
never commit sins , die , and they still have it. so the bad part about ca n't

these laws written for the israelites , god 's chosen people whom god had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world. the israelites were a
direct witness to god 's existence. to disobey god after knowing that god
is real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable.
remember , these laws were written for a different time and applied only to
god 's chosen people. but jesus has changed all of that. we are living in the
age of grace. sin is no longer immediately punishable by death. there is
repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ. and not just
for a few chosen people. salvation is available to everyone , jew and gentile
alike.

sorry if this is late for the thread , but...

i thought god was supposed to be constant and never changing. how do
you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above \?

also , while we 're at it

1. how do you reconcile a kind and loving god ! ! with the

2. is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of
having made a mistake \?

3. now that we are living in the age of grace , does this mean that
for our sins , god now damns us to eternal hell after we die , rather
than killing us immediately \? if so , is this eternal damnation an
example of a kind and loving god ! ! \?

(1) you have no evidence that david koresh or his followers were
packing that heavy weaponry with any intent to use for other that
recreational and self defense purposes.

(2) your statement that the public also has rights is correct only is
parsed as the individuals who comprise the public also have rights.
there is no separate rights bearing entity known as the public .

(3) since the rights of the public of which you spoke are in fact only
rights of individuals , the statement that the rights of the public
should be placed above the rights of the individual has no meaning.

(4) you have artificially created an illusionary conflict of
individuals' rights when you speak of my right to rape your daughter.
no person has the right to rape another person , therefore there is no
conflict.

(5) how do you define society \? do you hold that this society is a
rights bearing entity which is separate from any individual people \? how
do you define a threat to society \? to what extent do you believe that
a person loses his rights when he is declared (by whom \? ) to be such a

brian ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of false dichotomy in stating
that we must accept every thing in the books attributed to peter , or we must
discount every other book of antiquity

(1) peter died two millenia ago. the original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust. if he were alive today and i could

do you question the existence of alexander the great , tilgrath pilisar iii ,
nero , caligula , josephus , cyrus the great , artexerxes \? their documents
have decayed to dust too. brian , why another excuse \?

mr ceccarelli , you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything
written in every historical document. somehow i doubt do that yourself
that. thus since i doubt you accept everything written in every historical
document , i would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith
in the words of the books attributed to peter.

i shall now give an example of a document from antiquity , which i am sure you
reject it dates from the time of ramses ii (this was first presented here by
matthew wiener). these inscriptions were carved soon after a battle , and were
carved with the pharoah 's specific approval so we have true originals , rather
than mere copies. this account records the the battle of kadesh (circa 1285
bc) , which occurred on the river orontes , (about 100 miles south of aleppo).
the egyptians won this battle with the hittites , and ramses had his victory
inscribed all over the place. a few of of these inscriptions have survived in
near perfect form. it is a record of how the pharoah pretty much
single handedly defeated the hittites , after being separated from his troops.

note that the egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person.
the following is from miriam lichtheim`s ancient egyptian literature volume
ii.

my majesty caused the forces of the foes from hitti to fall
on their faces , one upon the other , as crocodiles fall , into
the water of the orontes. i was after them like a griffin
i attacked all the countries , i alone. for my infantry and
my chariotry had deserted me not one of them stood looking
back. as i live , as ra loves me , as my father atum favors
me , everything that my majesty has told i did it in truth ,
in the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.

(note this paragraph records not only ramses divine word , but also that
there were thousands of witnesses to the event. now from the heart of
battle.)

then his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces
of the foe from hitti , being alone by himself , none other
with him. his majesty proceeded to look about him and
found 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...

no officer was with me , no charioteer ,
no soldier of the army , no shield bearer
my infantry , my chariotry yielded before them ,
not one of them stood firm to fight with them.
his majesty spoke what is this , father amun \?
is it right for a father to ignore his son \?
are my deeds a matter for you to ignore \?
do i not walk and stand at your word \?
i have not neglected an order you gave.
too great is he , the great lord of egypt ,
to allow aliens to step on his path !
what are these asiatics to you , o amun ,
the wretches ignorant of god \?
have i not made for you many great monuments ,
...
i call to you , my father amun ,
i am among a host of strangers
all countries are arrayed against me ,
i am alone , there 's none with me !
...
the labors of many people are nothing ,
amun is more helpful than they
i came here by the command of your mouth ,
o amun , i have not transgressed your command !

now though i prayed in a distant land ,
my voice resounded in southern thebes.
i found amun came when i called to him ,
he gave me his hand and i rejoiced.
he called from behind as if near by
forward , i am with you ,
i your father , my hand is with you ,
i prevail over a hundred thousand men ,
i am lord of victory , lover of valor !
i found my heart stout , my breast in joy ,
all i did succeeded , i was like mont.
...
i slaughtered among them at my will ,
not one looked behind him ,
not one turned around ,
whoever fell down did not rise.
...
one called out to the other saying
no man is he who is among us ,
it is seth great of strength , baal in person
not deeds of man are these his doings ,
they are of one who is unique ,
who fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots ,
come quick , flee before him ,
to seek life and breathe air
for he who attempts to get close to him ,
his hands , all his limbs grow limp.
one cannot hold either bow or spears ,
when one sees him come racing along !
my majesty hunted them like a griffin ,
i slaughtered among them unceasingly.

so you see brian , we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous
battle between the ramses and the hittites. do you reject them as being
completely true \? i suspect you do , and if so , then do you also , in your own
words

question the existence of alexander the great , tilgrath pilisar iii ,
nero , caligula , josephus , cyrus the great , artexerxes \?

do you also thereby question all their documents \? that`s the problem with your
all or nothing approach. many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy
with their facts. so for you to say that we must either accept all of peter
(and the rest of the new testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all ,
forces you thereby , to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find
completely credible.

as to your other argument that so many people have testified to jesus , that he
must be true

are you going to just pass off all this testimony as fictiousness \?
are you going to call three thousand years worth of testimony from
shepherds to irs agents to royal officials to kings to computer
programmers , fiction \? with a scoff of your keyboard , with near
complete ignorance of the testimonies , are you going to say that
that is all complete hooey \? would that not be the most audacious
display of arrogance \? do you actually think you know better than
king solomon , king david , or even abraham lincoln \?

i have three points.

first , this is argumentum ad populum (ie appeal to popular opinion) you
cannot vote on truth. for instance , do the millions of hindu 's past and
present who testify to the reality of brahma , constitute actual evidence for
the existence of brahma \? how would you answer your own question in regards to
the testimony of hindus

with a scoff of your keyboard , with near complete ignorance of
the testimonies , are you going to say that that is all complete
hooey \?

if you do so scoff , then how do you objectively justify your own special
pleading \?

second , it is not at all clear that king solomon or king david testified to
jesus. you can claim it to be clear , but that does not make it true.

third , it is quite arguable that abraham lincoln was not christian , and that
he had both a public and a private view of christianity. in fact there was
much discussion about it in his day (yes , he was publically accused of being a
deist. oh my). i am presently collecting a faq for lincoln as i 've
previously done for tyre , jefferson and etc.

later ,

my earlier views of the unsoundness of the christian scheme of
salvation and the human origin of the scriptures , have become
clearer and stronger with advancing years and i see no reason for
thinking i shall ever change them.

bad secular state what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits \?
if the reports are accurate , what iyo does this say about the quality of
his christianity \? or are the allegations just part of the big

thank you , steve. it is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a christian. i only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction. i am not certain what you mean by the fundy part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses. if you refer to

i use it to refer to those christians who take a more
conservative literalist approach to the bible , as distinct from
liberals .

those who actually believe jesus is the messiah and son of god and
wish to follow in his way , then i plead guilty. but what does it

i would use the word christian (unqualified) to describe someone to
whom the above definition applied. btw , it applies to me.

deletia joe gaut indicates his interest in the bd disaster is from a
civil liberties issue , not an attempt to justify koresh 's beliefs
and or practices.

i agree with joe about this if some group wants to believe in
whatever god or invisible pink unicorns and go off and live together
and have group sex , or no sex , or sex only for the leaders (but not
with children) , then , as much as i might believe them to be misguided ,
i think they should have the legal right. and i hope the
investigation will start by determining whether the feds had any
legitimate reason for going after koresh in the first place (before
moving on to consider the wisdom of various tactics used).

joe goes on to dispute the child abuse allegations. i 'll
(provisionally) accept this , unless someone has evidence to support
the allegations \?

actually i was n't thinking about the (alleged) child abuse , but about
the reports that he had sex with , and fathered children by , several
women in the cult. i agree this is not a legal matter consenting
adults and all that but stephen tice seems to be defending koresh 's
beliefs and practices from specifically christian perspective , not a
civil liberties perspective.

i think my question is not really aimed at joe (and possibly not at
ray cote either , who seems to also be taking the political angle) , but
at stephen tice.

bd 's were not contemplating suecide , and there is no reason

no reason \? how about these two

1. some of the survivors claimed that bd members poured fuel along the
corridors and set fire to it. the speed at which the fire spread
is not inconsistent with this claim.

this morning on cnn (tues april 27) , texas cops say arson is suspected
because of two falsh points. cnn also stated that all surviors
claim the fires are fbi set. your argument are made up , untrue
and unverified at best.

2. there was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.
there is a very very good possibility that the fbi did not start this
fire. this is a good reason to believe that the bd 's did.

the day of the attack the fbi claimed to have seen two bd'ers setting
the fire outside of the compound. yesterday , the arson squad said two
flash points at the or near the tank entry points

not good evidence for the fbi hit squad.

3. even if the bd 's were not contemplating suicide , it is very possible that
david koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this
was not suicide. it was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.

is there a difference between thinking that you wo n't survive a confrontation
with the fbi (parnoia \? ) and committing suicide \?


there are three possibilities other than the bd 's self destruction


b. the fire was started by an fbi accident. this is possible , but it would be
foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.
sure , it 's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
which started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
the day near the edge of the complex \? ). it 's anecdotal evidence that
has been contradicted by other escapees.

no , claimed by the escapees not contradicted

what i'm finding interesting is the conflicting reports. fbi says
that bodies have been found with bullet wounds and the texas cornuers

got it in one. similarly , a moral relativist will not judge one moral syste
to be better than another in every possible circumstance. this does not ,
however , preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than anothe
in a specific set of circumstances. nor does it preclude a set of moral
relativists from collectively judging a moral system , from some set of
circumstances which they all agree they are in.

o.k. , this makes sense to me. (i'm serious , you 've explained something
to me which i never understood before). but just for grins , suppose we
almost all agree that we are in a set of circumstances called reality .
what then \?

then we all live happily ever after. )

seriously , if we all agreed on the circumstances we 're in , i suspect we 'd all
agree on the best course of action. unfortunately , i have no confidence that
such a situation will ever arise.

some of us think there 's a big god in the sky , some do n't. some think
they 've been chosen by god , others disagree. some think they are infallible ,
others think otherwise. until those disagreements over circumstances can be
ironed out , there 's little hope of everyone agreeing.

or say , for all practical intents and purposes , there is no frame
of reference in which thus and such is good , is n't that approximately
objective , in the same way that we usually expect a speeding bullet to
outrun a snail \?

yes. i think that , for example , only a vanishingly small number of people
would hold that there 's a frame of reference in which gassing six million
jews is good. so that 's probably about as close to an objective moral value
as i 've encountered in my life so far.

for example , if we hear of a bomb in a crowded area ,
is n't it a rather sensible first guess that this is an immoral act , even
though there conceivably might be some tail end case that would justify it \?

well , i think your example 's poor. if the bomb 's in iraq , for example , and
was dropped by an american plane , many people would hold that it was a moral
act.

and what weasel word do you use to describe that frame of reference , if
it is n't an objective reality for values \?

i'm sorry , i ca n't parse an objective reality for values . could you tr
y
again \?

s an objective reality for values some values are real even in the face
of disagreement

i still do n't quite see what you 're trying to say. i assume by values you
mean moral values , yes \? in which case , what do you mean by real \? what is
a real moral value , as opposed to an unreal one \?

i mean to say that values are as real as horses , whatever you understand
by a horse being real is pretty much what i mean about a value being real.

hmm. so these moral values have a perceptible physical presence \?

if you are saying that some moral systems are better than others , in
your opinion , then all you get is infinite regress.

sorry , but in what way is it an infinite regress \? it looks extremely finite
to me.

i meant that it 's never more than your opinion.

right , and the chain ends right there. the buck stops with me. it 's not an
infinite regress.

you 've clarified this
for me above. my understanding is now that if a supermajority of relativists
agree that thus and such is wrong in almost any or all frames of reference ,
then they 're saying something which is to all practical intents and purposes
no different than what i'm saying.

right. the key point , however , is that there are vanishingly few of these
moral issues where we can get 99.9 of people to agree on the outcome for all
frames of reference (and agree on the frames of reference...)

what you do not get
is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
is inferior to that of the man of peace.

sorry , but that 's not so. i can provide a justification for asserting that
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace.
i just ca n't provide a justification which works in all possible
circumstances.

logically possible , or actually possible \?

i ca n't manage either. killing hitler using a car bomb would have been a
terrorist act , but i have to admit that i could n't exactly condemn it.
although there are tricky philosophical issues to do with hindsight...

by which i mean , are you
stretching possible to include events such as the atoms in my terminal
switching places so that the terminal turns upside down , or do you
think it likely that circumstances will arise in which terrorism is
superior to peace.

i think that circumstances have already arisen where terrorism would have
been better than peace. better in terms of numbers of innocent people
killed. assuming it was successful terrorism , of course.

it should be remembered that all of the first reports came from
the fbi , and that independent observers , i.e. the press , were not
allowed to get close and see things for themselves. official
communiques tend to be self serving for the agencies that issue
them.
people in general tend to believe first reports , as these get
the most and the biggest headlines. corrections are often
overlooked.
an example is the fbi report that several of the bodies found

rick anderson writes

ra robert , you keep making references to orthodox belief , and saying
ra things like it is held that... (cf. kermit thread). on what
ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox \?

orthodox is a compound word. it comes from 'orthos' (straight , true ,
right) and from 'doxa' (opinion , doctrine , teaching). i use orthodox to
refer to 'right teaching.' right teaching is derived from letting god
speak to us through the bible. this can be from reading simple truths
in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible.

ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant \?

i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are
pertinent.

luke 23 43 records christ 's promise to the repentant thief who hung on
an adjacent cross truly i say to you , today you will be with me in
paradise. but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead
and ascended to heaven \? if christ himself was not in heaven until
sunday , how could the repentant thief have been there with him \? the
answer lies in the location of paradise when jesus died.

apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day.

jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and
lazarus as abraham 's bosom , to which the godly beggar lazarus was
carried by the angels after his decease (luke 16 19 31). thus
abraham 's bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed
waited till the day of christ 's resurrection.

it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of
hades (hebrew sheol) , reserved for believers who had died in the faith
but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven
until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary or
even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with
the father.

doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the
repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon. but
on sunday , after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene
(john 20 17) and her two companions (matthew 28 9) , presumably he then
took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise
(including abraham , lazarus , and the repentant thief). we read in
ephesians 4 8 concerning christ ascending on high , he led captivity
captive he gave gifts unto men. verse 9 continues but what does `he
ascended' mean but that he also descended to the lowest parts of the
earth \? i.e. , to hades. verse 10 adds he who descended is the same
as he who ascended above all the heavens. presumably he led the whole
band of liberated captives from hades (i.e. , the whole population of
preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.

ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is
ra challenged , your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra look at the bible in order to see the truth , but what of those who
ra see biblical things differently from you \?

i think that this characterization is faulty. whenever my 'personal
interpretation' is questioned , i usually give a reason.

as for those that see things differently , please , put forward where
there is a valid difference , and we can discuss it.

i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one
views the bible is somehow legitimate , except , or course , for the stuff
that i glean from it. put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can
have a discussion on that topic. but to decry something that i put
forward , without putting forward something else to discuss , and to
dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.

ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra understands it \?

if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is
wrong , then please , show me from scripture where it is wrong. simply
stating that there are other views is not a proof. show it to me from
scripture and then we can go on.

wrong about what \? i think they are correct in thinking that a

maybe what we are seeing here is that chinese cultural genocide
against the tibetans has worked well enough that some tibetans
are now no longer buddhist and are instead willing to behave like
the chinese occupiers. every action is its own reward.

clearly the occupation of tibet has been largely ignored.

full of admiration for the peaceful way that tibetans have put up
with it. and what does it cost us to admire them \? zip.

are tibetans currently people of peace \? do they serve themselves

yes they are , and whether this serves them well or not depends on
whether they want buddhist principles or political independence.
and without political independence can they preserve their cultural

the chinese would certainly refer to them as terrorists , just as
the hitler regime used to refer to european resistance movements

greater attention is focussed on the occupation of tibet by the
chinese , are the tibetans better off as people of peace or
as terrorists \?

better off in what way \? as proponents of pacifism or as
proponents of political autonomy \?

and better off in what time scale \? the soviet empire practised
cultural genocide against something like a hundred small minorities ,
some of which resisted violently , and some of which did not , but
in the end it was the soviet empire that collapsed and at least
some of the minorities survived.

now some of the minorities are fighting one another. is that
because they have to , or because violent resistance to an oppressive
empire legitimized violence \?

the peaceful attempt to serve the warrant was met with gunfire. due process

you think on that.

i am not exactly known as a flower child pacifist , but lets call

the peaceful attempt to serve the warrant consisted of the following
actions , in order

1) batf agents forcing their entry of the compound through second
story windows.

2) batf agents loosing some grenades (allegedly stun or flash
grenades) which promptly detonated.

after which , according to the tapes i have seen , the b d

now exactly how is it that someone breaking into private property
and tossing grenades around is considered peaceful by
anyone \? you think on that.

ra robert , you keep making references to orthodox belief , and saying
ra things like it is held that... (cf. kermit thread). on what
ra exact body of theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox \?

orthodox is a compound word. it comes from 'orthos' (straight , true ,
right) and from 'doxa' (opinion , doctrine , teaching). i use orthodox to
refer to 'right teaching.'

as opposed to universal or catholic or foursquare gosple . i think that
the greek orthodox church would take high offense at your misuse of the
word. your version of christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived
you make claims of bible centricity that are not derivable soley from the
bible. about six seven months ago , you claimed that your primary objection
to the lds was that our doctrine was not bible derived , and now this
(and other) claims can be shown , are also not bible interpeting bible.



right teaching is derived from letting god
speak to us through the bible. this can be from reading simple truths
in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible.

simple truths... oh for example \?

ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant \?

i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are
pertinent.

luke 23 43 records christ 's promise to the repentant thief who hung on
an adjacent cross truly i say to you , today you will be with me in
paradise. but was it not until later that christ rose from the dead
and ascended to heaven \? if christ himself was not in heaven until
sunday , how could the repentant thief have been there with him \? the
answer lies in the location of paradise when jesus died.

apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until easter day.


paradise exalted to heaven

paradise was n't equal to heaven and now it is \? yet you claim that
peeple can not be exalted to heaven , nicht wahr \?


jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and
lazarus as abraham 's bosom , to which the godly beggar lazarus was
carried by the angels after his decease (luke 16 19 31). thus
abraham 's bosom referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed
waited till the day of christ 's resurrection.

when i read the story , i found that abraham 's bosom was n't so much
a place , but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to abraham \?

it was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of
hades (hebrew sheol) , reserved for believers who had died in the faith
but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of god in heaven
until the price of redemption had actually been paid on calvary or
even that none would precede the presence of jesus back to glory with
the father.

gee this is fairly close to what the lds call spirit prison , and what
you have called false doctrine...

doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of jesus and the
repentant thief repaired after they each died on friday afternoon. but
on sunday , after the risen christ had first appeared to mary magdalene
(john 20 17) and her two companions (matthew 28 9) , presumably he then
took up with him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise
(including abraham , lazarus , and the repentant thief). we read in
ephesians 4 8 concerning christ ascending on high , he led captivity
captive he gave gifts unto men.

vers deleted reproduced below quoted from the sunspot gopher archive


presumably he led the whole
band of liberated captives from hades (i.e. , the whole population of
preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.

this part is not supported from scripture , nor does it support your
claim that the paradise where christ descended was exalted.

making such claims on this little evidence ignores the witness of the
scripture

sun ephas
sun 4 8 wherefore he saith , when he ascended up on high , he led captivity
sun captive , and gave gifts unto men.
sun
sun (x ref psalms 68 18)
sun thou has ascended on hight , thout hast led captivity captive thou has
sun recieved gifts for men yea for the rebellious aslo , that the lord god
sun might dwell amoung them
sun
sun ephas
sun 4 9 (now that he ascended , what is it but that he also descended first
sun into the lower parts of the earth \? 4 10 he that descended is the same
sun also that ascended up far above all heavens , that he might fill all
sun things.) 4 11 and he gave some , apostles and some , prophets and
sun some , evangelists and some , pastors and teachers 4 12 for the
sun perfecting of the saints , for the work of the ministry , for the
sun edifying of the body of christ 4 13 till we all come in the unity of
sun the faith , and of the knowledge of the son of god , unto a perfect man ,
sun unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ 4 14 that we
sun henceforth be no more children , tossed to and fro , and carried about
sun with every wind of doctrine , by the sleight of men , and cunning
sun craftiness , whereby they lie in wait to deceive 4 15 but speaking the
sun truth in love , may grow up into him in all things , which is the head ,

using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison , is now changed from
a pre easter postion to post easter by god postion is not supportable.

makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...



ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is
ra challenged , your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra look at the bible in order to see the truth , but what of those who
ra see biblical things differently from you \?

i think that this characterization is faulty. whenever my 'personal
interpretation' is questioned , i usually give a reason.

yes , and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading
of the scriptures. you have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural
proof need to be cross checked. the referencs that you supply often do
not support your postion , if they are read in the context of the scripture.



as for those that see things differently , please , put forward where
there is a valid difference , and we can discuss it.

i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one
views the bible is somehow legitimate , except , or course , for the stuff
that i glean from it. put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can
have a discussion on that topic. but to decry something that i put
forward , without putting forward something else to discuss , and to
dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.

how about that those who have been in paradise , and have accepted
the gosple will be judged of jesus christ , and then return to the
presence of god. is that somehow different from your expressed view
that the paradise spoken of (or abraham 's bosom )

ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra understands it \?

if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is
wrong , then please , show me from scripture where it is wrong. simply
stating that there are other views is not a proof. show it to me from
scripture and then we can go on.

should we go back and discuss your view on why the angle of the lord

i'm not sure that you can distinguish between myth and legend so

non religious reasons for having a moment of silence for a dead

deceased , (2) to give the classmates a moment to grieve together , (3)
to give the friends a moment to remember their classmate in the
context of the school , (4) to deal with the fact that the classmate
is gone so that it 's not disruptive later.

yeah , all well and good. the fact is , though , that the pro school
prayer types have tried to use a moment of silence as a way
to get prayer back. at my high school for instance , our dear
principal ended the moment of silence with amen.
i can certainly see opposing the amen but that does n't require
opposing a moment of silence.
i see it as the camel 's nose.

i 'll back off when they do.

some people use their collections , other people do not. as you state , you

these laws written for the israelites , god 's chosen people whom god had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world. the israelites were a
direct witness to god 's existence. to disobey god after knowing that god is
real would be an outright denial of god and therefore immediately punishable.
remember , these laws were written for a different time and applied only to
god 's chosen people. but jesus has changed all of that. we are living in the
age of grace. sin is no longer immediately punishable by death. there is
repentance and there is salvation through our lord jesus christ. and not just
for a few chosen people. salvation is available to everyone , jew and gentile
alike.

sorry if this is late for the thread , but...

i thought god was supposed to be constant and never changing. how do
you reconcile this common christian view with the paragraph above \?


god never changes.

sorry , but yes he does , by your own description.

he still loves us. sending jesus was one of his attempts to
reconcile with mankind.

humorous , this notion of an all knowing , all powerful god who must
attempt to reconcile with his lowly creations. i realize that it
is not possible to penetrate such logic , but is there any chance that
you might consider that an omnipotent god need not attempt anything ,
and further that an attempt to reconcile implies a lack of
omniscience \?

what you are doing here is projecting human weaknesses onto your god.


also , while we 're at it

1. how do you reconcile a kind and loving god ! ! with the
judeo christian view that sin was at one time immediately punishable
by death \? was killing people for sinning god 's way of showing
kindness and love \?


sinning in the face of god was punishable by immediate death. there are
several ot passages to back this up. god is god.

but all humans are sinners , thus all pre jesus humans should have been
punished with death. we are n't punished with sin now , of course ,
because god has changed. he required a brutal , sadistic sacrifice of
his own blood in order to allow us to sin without immediate death.

he cannot tolerate the prescence of sin in his midst.

yet he does so now. he has changed. the sadistic murder of his own
son has made him more tolerant of our sins.

besides , his midst is everywhere , so your statement is meaningless.
he tolerates sin in hell , which surely is in his midst as well. also ,
given that he is all knowing , he must have eternal knowledge of who
will commit which sins , as well as when and where , so what does
tolerance have to do with anything. all of this is absolute nonsense ,
unless your god is not indeed all knowing and all powerful , or unless
he does n't take the personal interest in everyday affairs that you
claim.

and the israelites knew this ! and
still , some of them chose to disobey and were destroyed. were these
people kind and loving themselves \?

not relevant. the claim of kindness and lovingness was made by you in
reference to your god. the nature of his creations victims is not at
issue.

god gave them every break he could but in the end , he really had no
choice in the matter.

i see an all knowing god who did not know what the ultimate outcome
would be , and an all powerful god who had no choice in the matter.
mindmush.

seeing as how we were failing to achieve salvation on our own , he sent
his son to die for us to be the ultimate sin offering.

did i miss something \? did you give some indication at to why a kind
and loving god should require sadistic human sacrifice to allow his
own botched creations to achieve salvation \?


2. is the fact the he no longer does this an admission on his part of
having made a mistake \?


he sent his son as a consolation to us , out of love.

i note that your answer physically follows my question , but i fail to
discern a connection between the two.

by the way , for what am i being consoled \?

3. now that we are living in the age of grace , does this mean that
for our sins , god now damns us to eternal hell after we die , rather
than killing us immediately \? if so , is this eternal damnation an
example of a kind and loving god ! ! \?


hey , let 's be fair for a moment here. kind and loving does not mean
a free ride.

why not \? by the way , i note for the record that you did n't answer the
questions.

there is an amount of give and take as in any relationship.
parents are supposed to be kind and loving but does that mean that
children can do whatever they want \? not ! part of being a parent means
administering punishment when the child is at fault.

death and or eternal damnation is your idea of correctional
punishment \? i hope you are n't a parent.

part of being a parent means giving instruction. god tests us through
the trial of life such that we may grow stronger. he teaches what is
right and what is wrong.

this is quite an elaborate fantasy that you 've constructed , but sadly
it lacks a basis in reality. it also does not address the questions
that i raised.

the consequences of our actions are made clear to us , be it heaven or
be it hell. if god did not follow through with what he has warned us
about , he would not be a very good parent.

the god that you describe is not a good parent , but a tyrant.

in parenting , if a parent issues a warning but does not follow through
with it , the children will not take that parent 's words very seriously.
god does the same by telling us who have ears to hear what to do and
what not to do. by life 's trials , we see the folly of doing our own
will rather than his. he warns us about the consequences of rejecting
him when it comes time for judgement.

sorry , was that the god of the bible whose rules i am to follow , or
the god of the koran \? the vedas \? the book of koresh \? oh , yes , it 's
all so clear.

do we follow him \?

jesus' comments about how christians have to follow the ot deleted...

i will clarify my earlier quote. god 's laws were originally written for
the israelites. jesus changed that fact by now making the law applicable to
all people , not just the jews. gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
heaven through the saving grace of god. i never said that the law was made
obsolete by jesus.

exodus 31 12 17. how many people have you put to death for working on
the sabbath \?

if anything , he clarified the law such as in that quote you made. in the
following verses , jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon
the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended. if you 'll notice , he
also reams into the pharisees for mucking up the law with their own contrived
interpretations. they knew every letter of the law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts. that is why he points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of heaven. people such as the pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.
they had become legalistic , rule makers religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the law but never really believed in it.

leviticus 17 10. how as that medium rare steak last night \?

i think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of
modern day pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it. what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart \?

leviticus 19 19. what did you wear to work friday \?

christianity is not just a set of rules it 's a lifestyle that changes one 's
perspectives and personal conduct. and it demands obedience to god 's will.

deutromony 18 1. i can you can now justify discrimination.

some people can live by it , but many others cannot or will not. that is their
choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too.

can a theist be truly objective \? can he be impartial
when questioning the truth of his scriptures , or
will he assume the superstition of his parents
when questioning \?

i think that if a theist were truly objective and throws out the notion that
god definitely exists and starts from scratch to prove to themselves that
the scriptures are the whole truth then that person would no longer be a
theist.

it usually all has to do with how the child is
brought up. from the time he is born , the
theist is brought up with the notion of the
truth of some kind of scripture the bible ,
the torah , the qur'an , etc. he is told
of this wondrous god who wrote (or inspired)
the scripture , of the prophets talked about in
the scripture , of the miracles performed , etc.
he is also told that to question this (as
children are apt to do) is a sin , a crime
against god , and to lose belief in the scrip
ture 's truth is to damn one 's soul to hell.
thus , by the time he is able to read the
scripture for himself , the belief in its truth
is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a
matter of course.

you 're missing something here. there are people who convert from
non theism to theism after being brought up in a non theist household. (i
do n't have any statistics as to how many though. that would be an
interesting thing to know.) i think that religion is a crutch. people are
naturally afraid of the unknown and the unexplainable. people do n't want
to believe that when they die , they are dead , finished. that there is
nothing else after that. and so religion is kind of a nice fantasy.
religion also describes things we do n't know about the universe (things
science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of
security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.
that they are being watched over by a higher power and its minions. this
has a very high psychological attraction for quite a few people and these
people are willing to put up with a few discrepancies and holes in their
belief system for what it gains them. this is why i think it 's kind of
useless to try too hard to convert theists to atheism. they are happy with
their fantasy and they feel that other people will be happy with it too
(they ca n't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept
the harsh reality that they are running from).

anyway , i'm getting kind of carried away here. but my point is that theism
does n't have to be ingrained into a child 's mindset for that person to grow
up as a theist (although this happens far too often). theism is designed
to have its own attractions.

tony alicia writes

let 's start with the name rosicrucian . i took me a long time to come
to the conclusion that there is a difference between a member of a
rosicrucian body and being a rosicrucian. so when you say that you met
some 'rosicrucians' you mean members of a group that calls themselves
rosicrucian . at least that is what your observation suggests )


response

this makes much sense to me. this is also true of most religions.
there is a difference between being a member of a group of people
who call themselves 'hindus' or 'christians' or 'pagans' and actually
being any of these. the social groups tend to make very important
requirements about not belonging to other 'religions'. i find that
the ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be
interpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that
'mysticism' is the core of every religion and huxley 's 'perennial
philosophy' is the great secret core of all mystical trads.


tony

i 'd prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the lectorium
rosicrucianum , only because they may be confused , by some readers of this
newsgroup , with the rosicrucian order amorc based (the usa jurisdiction) in
san jose , ca this being the rc org with the most members (last time i
looked). of course , most members does not necessarily mean best .


response

certainly true. i did n't know there were any groups which called themselves
'rosicrucians' that did n't associate with amorc. sure , i 've heard all the
hubbub about the golden dawn and rosae crucis in relation to all these
western esoteric groups , but had n't heard about other 'rosicrucians'.
i 'll admit my bias. i live in san jose.


tony

you 'll have to trust me when i tell you that if that
lecture class whatever had been presented by amorc , it is unlikely that you
would have had the same impression , i.e. , you 'd probably have had a
positive impression more likely than a negative one , imho.


response

this may be slightly off. i 've met some of these rosicrucians and have
a couple friends in amorc. the stories i 've heard and the slight contact
i 've had with them does not give me the hope that i 'd be received with
any kind of warm welcome. i still like to think that most people who
are involved with stratified relationships (monogamy , religion , etc.)
are in deep pain and hope to heal it within such a 'cast'.


tony


it is curious to know that 3 other rc 'orders' (in the usa) claim to be non
sectarian .


response

i 'd like to know at least the addresses of the 'other orders' which call
themselves 'rosicrucians' and especially those which are 'nonsectarian'.
is this 'nonsectarian' like the masons , who require that a member 'believe
in god by his her definition' \?



tony

dear me. this is taken so out of context that it 's hard to know where
to start... the quote starts with material from p 78 , and ends with material

on page 78 , there 's the bit that says (the parts left out in john king 's

... the doubt that has infiltrated the previous , smugly confident certitude
of evolutionary biology 's last twenty years has inflamed passions and
provoked some very interesting thought and research .

eldridge goes on immediately following the butchered quote
in short , evolutionary biology has entered a phase of creativity that is
the hallmark of good , active science.

the material that is on page 81 that is quoted by john king has been
butchered even more severely

i mention this only to illustrate the there is these words not
in the original text prl lack of agreement even within warring camps
things are really in uproar these days , and each of the basic ways
of looking at evolutionary biology has its minor variants. sometimes
it seems as if there are as many variations on each evolutionary theme
as there are individual biologists.

eldridge goes on
but that 's the way it should be this is how science is supposed to operate.

jack

and just a few sentences down

when they creationists misrepresent the exuberant , creative doubt and
controversy permeating evolutionary biology these days , they are actively
promoting scientific illiteracy.

and that , john e. king , is precisely what you have done with eldridge 's

have you pulled it out of some creationist propaganda \? you owe the people

got it in one. similarly , a moral relativist will not judge one moral system
to be better than another in every possible circumstance. this does not ,
however , preclude him from judging one moral system to be better than another
in a specific set of circumstances. nor does it preclude a set of moral
relativists from collectively judging a moral system , from some set of
circumstances which they all agree they are in.

and even that statement assumes an
objective reality independent of our beliefs about it.

i still do n't quite see what you 're trying to say. i assume by values you
mean moral values , yes \? in which case , what do you mean by real \? what is
a real moral value , as opposed to an unreal one \?

if you are saying that some moral systems are better than others , in
your opinion , then all you get is infinite regress.

sorry , but in what way is it an infinite regress \? it looks extremely finite
to me.

what you do not get
is any justification for saying that the moral system of the terrorist
is inferior to that of the man of peace.

sorry , but that 's not so. i can provide a justification for asserting that
the moral system of the terrorist is inferior to that of the man of peace. i
just ca n't provide a justification which works in all possible circumstances.

similarly , i can provide a justification for asserting that bullets move
faster than snails. that justification wo n't hold in all possible frames of
reference , but it will hold in almost all the frames of reference i am ever
likely to be in.

your saying it does not
make it so , and that 's according to your premise , not mine.

i do n't think i agree with this. my saying it does make it so from my
point of view and according to my premises , unless the argument is invalid.
it may indeed not make it so from your point of view , but i never claimed

interestingly , just as the branch davidians had roots in the
seventh day adventist movement , the sdas themselves had their
roots in the millerite movement of the first half of the 19th

orthodox is a compound word. it comes from 'orthos' (straight , true ,
right) and from 'doxa' (opinion , doctrine , teaching). i use orthodox to
refer to 'right teaching.' right teaching is derived from letting god
speak to us through the bible. this can be from reading simple truths
in the scriptures and by using the bible to interpret the bible.

thanks for the etymology lesson , but i actually know what orthodox means.
you 're avoiding my question , however , which was from what body of theology
does your version of orthodoxy come \? you seem to simply be saying that
whatever you understand the bible to say is orthodox.

ra who is that holds that luke meant what you said he meant \?

i think that it is apparent from reading the scriptures that are
pertinent.

you are obviously mistaken , since many , many people have read the bible and
many do not agree with you on this point. once again , robert , is your
interpretation the only correct or orthodox one \?

ra whenever your personal interpretation of biblical passages is
ra challenged , your only response seems to be that one needs merely to
ra look at the bible in order to see the truth , but what of those who
ra see biblical things differently from you \?


i seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one
views the bible is somehow legitimate , except , or course , for the stuff
that i glean from it. put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can
have a discussion on that topic. but to decry something that i put
forward , without putting forward something else to discuss , and to
dismiss what i put forward while giving credence to other alleged views
that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.

this whole string began as a response to your attacks on mormonism no one
is attacking your personal beliefs , only your tendency to present them as
orthodoxy. i do n't much care what you believe about the bible just do n't
present you personal understanding as the only orthodox one.


ra are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really
ra understands it \?

if you believe that something that i have drawn from scripture is
wrong , then please , show me from scripture where it is wrong. simply
stating that there are other views is not a proof. show it to me from
scripture and then we can go on.

i have never attacked your specific beliefs that 's your approach ,
remember \?
stating that other people who depend solely on the bible have other views
is indeed proof that the bible can be interpreted many ways , which has been
my whole point all along. the specifics of your belief are your business
just do n't pretend that they are anything more than your personal
intepretation , and be careful about crying heresy based on your private

me happily picking daisies by the side of the road
bc dancing on the double yellow broken line
come on out and play on the highway !
me why \?
bc the highway was put here for people to be on. we must work towards
fulfilling its purpose.
me but
bc look , the highway has been here for several generations. look , i
have a story about how it was actually created by a divine being !
and several people actually saw elvis bless it !
me but
bc look , are you going to come out here , or not \?
me but
bc you probably think that picking daisies is fun. well , you 're wrong.
me where in blazes did you get this silly idea that you 're supposed to
be playing on the highway \? you 'll get yourself killed !
bc better to be killed on the highway than to live an empty life off
of it. besides , you 're just asking pointless questions. you know
you really want to be playing on the highway too you 're just
denying it.
me if you want to get run over , then fine , but i 'd much rather enjoy
the daisies , if you please.
bc why do you shun me like this \? the creator of the highway will flatten
you with a steamroller if you do n't see the light and come join me !
me well , if he 's gonna be that way about it , maybe i want to get as
far from the highway as i can...

brian c. , do n't you see \? i do not believe that your god is

(a) real , or even

(b) beneficial.

in fact , i believe your religion is imaginary and , carried to
extremes , harmful. i would like to help you see its shortcomings , and
perhaps someday finally become strong enough to see it for what it is
an elaborate lie , kept alive by the elite priesthood to keep the
masses properly submissive to their influences.

please offer me an argument that 's more convincing than you just
do n't believe 'cos you do n't want to. everything you 've said so far
could apply equally to any religion why do you believe yours is the
real one \?

(note that saying it 's the only one that promises eternal life or
something like that is n't an answer to my question , unless you show
that (a) no other religion promises eternal life and (b) it is
unarguably true that eternal life must be a reality.)

simple. take out some physics books , and start looking for statements which
say that there is no objective physics. i doubt you will find any. you might
find statements that there is no objective length , or no objective location ,
but no objective physics \? (consider , for instance , that speed of light in
vacuum is invariant. this sounds an awful lot like an objective
speed of light in vacuum.)

or , you can try not confuse a construct with the constructor. if you take
a look at quantum mechanics , many objective observations can be made
as well. however , physics is not objective. bohr said the randomness
of atomic motion is inherent in the motion itself. einstein said that
nature is deterministic it is our method of observation that inserts the
randomness. they were talking about the exact same results.

but neither of them claimed to have experimental evidence that proved
them right. in a similar vein , there is as yet no experimental evidence
for supersymmetric particles so some physicists believe in them , and
some do n't but all agree that either there is an objectively true
answer to the question.

depends on how you look at it , i guess.

a large portion of the broadcast was about the mountain meadows massacre .
the program very specifically pointed out that brigham young knew nothing
about the incident until long after it had happened (before telegraph) , and
it occured as a result of several men inciting a bunch of paronoid moromn

prosecuted and eccomunicated from the lds church.

for those who think david koresh did n't have a solid structure ,
or sound biblical backing for his hour long tape broadcast ,

i do n't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon.

other than it tells quite a lot about the man himself.

it 's the deaths he 's responsible for that concern most people.

are you the spokesman for most people \?

i 've enclosed a partial list of the sources he cites or quotes
he exactly used. as a christian sermon , it 's pretty good , if not
inspired.

though i differ in part on some of his conclusions , the argument
he presents is well backed which is why it 's taken me this long
to work through still ongoing.

if you thought it was rambling that says far more about you than
it does koresh.

you 've made me curious. what does this say about me \?

that you do n't recognize the biblical commentary used. those in the
church know the language though , and have no such excuse.

first seal in revelation 6 , the entirety of psalms 45 , and the
most of revelation 19 which demonstrated one of his major points
about how the writings in the prophets (including david) , and in
the psalms , and in revelation are all telling the same story when
you understand how they 're related (ie have the key). they largely
explain each other.

charles manson used revelation as well. do we see a pattern here \?
i wonder if koresh liked the beatles \?

you missed the point which is that the prophets , the psalms , and
revelation , all together , provide a very rich view of a very special
event a wedding.

koresh was a nut , okay \? just because he found ways for the bible
to backup his rantings does not make him any less of a kook.

how are you able to make such a conclusion \? please note , that the
first part of revelation makes it clear that the address is to those
in the church. that said , it does n't hurt to try to see what the
prophecies are ahead of time for those outside the church.

seems to me koresh is yet another messenger that got killed
for the message he carried.

i 'll type this very slowly so that you can understand. he either set
the fire himself or told his followers to do so. do n't make him out to
be a martyr. he did not get killed , he killed himself.

so you say. it should be interesting to see what the investigators
conclude , and what the final judgments are.

in the mean time , we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption.
are you surprised things have gotten that rotten \?

the evil was inside the compound. all that thou shalt not kill stuff.

so much for war and government eh.

oh yeah , one last point for the believers philippian 2 14 19.

for the rest of us , could you please post the text \?

very glad you asked , since i goofed it should be philippian 1 14 19
(here from niv)

because of my chains , most of the brothers in the lord
have been encouraged to speak the word of god more
courageously and fearlessly.

it is true that some preach christ out of envy and
rivalry , but others out of good will. the latter do so
in love , knowing that i am put here for the gospel.
the former preach christ out of selfish ambition , not
sincerely , supposing that they can stir up trouble for
me while i am chains. but what does it matter \?

the important thing is that in every way , whether from
false motives or true , christ is preached. and because
of this i rejoice.

my comment stems from the realization that we who love the lord , are
human and imperfect. whatever we preach , no matter how eloquent , or
how corrupted is of little difference. those who know the master 's
voice will recognize him a gem stone amidst rock. such is also the
lesson of the stumblingblock. for those who have an ear to hear.

i was n't sure if this was the right newsgroup to post this to , but i guess
the misc is there for a reason. here goes... i am getting married in june to
a devout (wisconsin synod) lutheran. i would classify myself as a strong
agnostic weak athiest. this has been a a subject of many discussions between
us and is really our only real obstacle. we do n't have any real difficulties
with the religious differences yet , but i expect they will pop up when we have
children. i have agreed to raise the
children nominally lutheran. that is , lutheran traditions , but trying to
keep an open mind. i am not sure if this is even possible though. i feel that
that the worst quality of being devoutly religous is the lack of an open mind.

just a point , i suppose , if open mind means believing anything can be true
or we ca n't for sure know what is definitely true , i'm happy to not be open
minded. if , however , open mindedness means being respectful and tolerant
towards other beliefs , respecting the rights and intelligence and wisdom
of people of other beliefs and giving equal time to alternative ideas , i
try my very best to be open minded. just a thot in passing.... )

anyway , i guess i 'll get on with my question. is anyone in the same
situation and can give some suggestions as to how to deal with this \? we 've
taken the attitude so far of just talking about it a lot and not letting
anything get bottled up inside. sometimes i get the feeling we 're making this
much bigger than it actually is. any comments would be greatly appreciated.
also , please e mail responses since i do n't get a chance to read this group
often. (

not being married , i cannot say too much to you , but from my perspective
having mutually exclusive faiths would be a big enough roadblock for me in
considering marrying someone. making it much bigger than it is \? i suppose
that depends on how serious each of you is in your beliefs. lukewarm atheists
and christians for whom religion is of nominal importance probly would feel
the issue is n't very big. i suppose the more important your beliefs are to
each of you , the more important the issue is.

soapbox on

if it 's ok to pay for legal procedures with gov't money , then let 's get the
government to pay for counselling that provides abortion alternatives.
let 's get the government to pay for adoption fees. let 's get the government
to pay for all the things that make abortion necessary . why not \? they
are certainly legal procedures.

counselling that only provides alternatives to abortion would be just as
biased as counselling that only provides abortion information. how about
providing counselling that will give a woman help in finding what she is
comfortable with.

your adoption funding idea may be a good one. any idea if it is feasable \?


the only way hell is involved is that it is going to be a good skiing resort
before i give in to paying for abortions. i believe it is wrong , and i
wo n't pay for it without a gripe. i'm not for making them unlawful i 'd
rather spend money on saving lives than a bunch of investigations and court
hearings and all this other crap we are spending our time on.

you know who 's really cleaning up on all this abortion stuff \? lawyers. i
say let 's pass laws to make adoption cheaper , easier , and infinitely more
supportive of the birth mother. let 's eradicate the stigma , reduce the
cost , pay the price for life.

making adoption easier on the birth mother may help reduce abortion , but
it will not eliminate the need for it. abortion is not done just because
the mother ca n't care for the child and does n't feel good about giving it
to strangers. abortion is done because the mother can not afford the
pregnancy .

soapbox off


a person has a right to do anything that does not interfere with the rights
of another person.

cool enough. you 'll have more trouble defining the terms in that statement
than getting people to agree to it. for example , i perceive i have a right
not to participate in what i feel is murder. i do n't think the government
should , either. on the other hand , since we are having trouble proving that
it is murder , there is no right to stop someone from doing it if they so
choose , either by legal means or harassment. of course , persuasion is
allowed , but watch that line between persuasive and harassing.

the second part is a definition of a person. a simplistic explanation is
that a person is a member of society. most normal adult human beings are
good examples of people . most children over two years old are people as
well. the simple way of determining this is that you can have a conversation
with them. it is actually more complicated than that , but i have no desire
to spend the time it would take to explain it to you. read the thread why
is bodily autonomy so important \? for more explanation and justification.

but why is your definition authoritative enough for the whoe us \? surely
you can understand there are other definitions with equal right of
consideration \?

then please justify why being human automatically makes something valuable.
and why that includes the unborn.


if the government refused
to fun abortions (due to the qualms of a minority of the population) then
it would then have to pay far more in the delivery of babies whose
mothers wanted an abortion , but could not afford one , and now that baby
will also require care for 18 years.

true. that needs to be fixed. it is part of the problem. if clinton has a
medical program to get underway , let him address this , too. it is cheaper
in the long run to save lives later they will be productive members of
society. at least , if his plan works...

no , they are not guaranteed to become productive members of society. even
if they do that is many years in the future until which they are a burden
on someone , or society. there is also the matter of the mother. forcing
her to carry a pregnancy to term at a critical time in her life could prevent
her from being a productive member of society.

actually , i was refering to the minority that objects to abortion , not
those who object to federal funding. i admit i did not say it very
clearly , and apologize for that.


to refuse to fund abortions ... is to remove that choice from some
women , and add the additional burden to society for no reason.

no. this is really flawed logic. it would be like me saying i was born
with a disfigured face and i want cosmetic repair. it is
discriminatory that i cannot make that choice , and so you must pay for it.

that a person has a right to make a choice does not imply legally or
otherwise that someone else should foot the bill sic for that choice.

ok , look. it 's like this. we are footing the bill. maybe they will
take choice a. maybe they will take choice b. maybe they will take choice
c. they ca n't afford any one of them. if they take choice a we 'd have
to pay them , say 5. if they take choice b it would cost us 20. if they
take choice c it will cost us 20 now and a hell of a lot more for the next
18 years. which one sounds the most realistic for us to be willing to pay
for \? now some people happen not to like choice a. other people happen
not to like choice c (paying for it , that is). c has been around and paid
for for years. even though it means we spend a lot of money , we ca n't in
conscience refuse to pay for it. now a has been around and is perfectly
legal , but it has n't been funded in the past. now a is going to be funded
but some people object. they do n't like the idea of their tax money going
to pay for choice a. so we could refuse to fund a at all. then those
women who ca n't afford any of those choices will be forced to take choice
b or c , which will cost all of us more money. most of us do n't see any
reason at all why more money should be spent to the effect of removing
personal choice from some women. the alternative is to fund a if that is
what the mother chooses. we will also still fund b and even c if that
is what the mother chooses. however , some women will certainly choose a ,
and that will then save us 15 we otherwise would have had to spend. your
taxes are not being raised to fund a choice you object , they are being
lowered because we will fund a choice that is legal , despite your
objections to it. (actually , your taxes are not really going to go down ,
as i'm sure you would point out. but the amount that is saved in that
area can help out in another like our massive debt.)


if you disagree then give us some reasons . given that abortion is
legal and the right to abortion is supported by the majority of the
population ...
...it is not justifiable to refuse abortions to women who can not afford
them , who will simply require even greater funds for the delivery you
would force upon them. i refuse to pay more taxes to remove choice
from those women just because you object to a legal medical procedure.

what \?

i say objection to the procedure is irrelevant. uncle bill does n't pay for
breast augmentation , facelifts , etc... why abortions \? it 's elective
surgery !

those other procedures you mention only cost money. there is no savings
in other procedures that would be required down the road without them.
(in fact , there could be additional costs down the road because of them.)
this is quite different from the case of abortion.

as for your argument , you are enticing a young girl to kill a baby by making
it affordable and refusing to make the alternative affordable too , so you
are just as guilty of removing a choice by withholding funds ! think about
it. a poor girl is pregnant and abortions are federally funded , what 's she
gonna do. what choice have your plans given her. your kind of double
talk really makes me ill.

this is bullshit. we are not refusing to make the alternative affordable
too . if we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth , then
your statement would make sense. but that is not the case , so it does n't.
if clinton tried to block funding for pre natal care and delivery (or left
it out of his health care plan) , i would certainly object. i would also be
quite surprised.


pro choice . ha ! pro abortion really fits in your case.

yes , but probably not your definition of it , or for the reasons you think.

if you 're gonna fund one choice , you have to fund them all , at the very
least.

you stupid fuck ! we do want to fund all the choices. you are the
one who wants to not fund all the choices.

imho if we fund the adoption choice right , (meaning not just
throwing money at it but cutting costs , esp. legal costs) we wo n't need
abortion anymore.

your humble opinion is still wrong. even with easy adoption , there is still
the fact that pregnancy takes several months. months in which a young woman
could need to be getting an education. (like finishing high school , entering
college , finishing college , getting a job...things that are much harder to
do if you have to take a break for a few months...things that have a massive
impact on her future productivity.)


have a right to life . a fetus is not a person. you can not have a
conversation with them.

ah. let 's kill the mentally incompetant as well. or how about people we

you can have a conversation with the mentally incompetant . and even
though you personally may refuse to have a conversation with people
you just do n't like , it is still possible for others to have a conversation
with them. it is not possible for anyone to have a conversation with
a fetus.

they are not biologically independent.

nor was my son at the age of 6 weeks. he was breastfed , and would not take
a bottle. just what does biologically independent mean \? i 'll be happy to
punch any definition full of loopholes.

he was still biologically independent. at least to the same extent you are
now. he consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner. he
breathed his own air. a fetus on the other hand , gets it 's nutrients already
digested by the mother. it gets its oxygen from the mother as well. that
is not biologically independent.

their
awareness is questionable.

aha ! you admit it is questionable. yet you are willing to kill it , even if
it may be very aware. i suggest you re think your viewpoint.

awareness is only part of what makes a member of society . it is the
minimal conceivable requirement , yet many people seem to think that something
without awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing
of a true member of society. i keep asking , but i still have n't seen a real
justification for why the life of a non sentient creature should be worth the
suffering of a sentient being. (i have n't read every response on the threads
i 've been asking on , yet , so we 'll see if i see one later.)

they have no experiences in the real world to make up a personality.

this is also true of quite a few unix programmers. so what. d

i am pleased to announce that a revised version of the easy to read book
of mormon (former title mormon 's book ) by lynn matthews anderson is now
available through anonymous ftp (see information below). in addition to the
change in title , the revised etr bom has been shortened by several pages
(eliminating many extraneous that 's and of 's ) , and many (minor) errors
have been corrected. this release includes a simplified joseph smith story ,
testimonies of the three and eight witnesses , and a words to know
glossary.

as with the previous announcement , readers are reminded that this is a
not for profit endeavor. this is a copyrighted work , but people are welcome
to make verbatim copies for personal use. people can recuperate the
actual costs of printing (paper , copy center charges) , but may not charge
anything for their time in making copies , or in any way realize a profit
from the use of this book. see the permissions notice in the book itself
for the precise terms.

negotiations are currently underway with a mormon publisher vis a vis the
printing and distribution of bound books. (sorry , i'm out of the wire bound
first editions. ) i will make another announcement about the availability
of printed copies once everything has been worked out.

ftp information connect via anonymous ftp to carnot.itc.cmu.edu , then cd
pub (you wo n't see anything at all until you do).

the easy to read book of mormon is currently available in postscript and
rtf (rich text format). (ascii , latex , and other versions can be made
available contact dba@andrew.cmu.edu for details.) you should be able to
print the postscript file on any postscript printer (such as an apple
laserwriter) let dba know if you have any difficulties. (the postscript in
the last release had problems on some printers this time it should work
better.) rtf is a standard document interchange format that can be read in
by a number of word processors , including microsoft word for both the
macintosh and windows. if you do n't have a postscript printer , you may be
able to use the rtf file to print out a copy of the book.

here tis. someone just told me that the old testament books were translated
into greek a long time ago
yes , that 's a famous version called the septuagint. it was a translation
made by greek jews.
and that the originals were destroyed in a fire soon afterward.

no.

i do n't know what you 're referring to here. when the jersusalem temple was
destroyed , some manuscripts may have been lost , but i think our extant hebrew
manuscripts are as good as our greek ones. i do n't know about any originals .
the person who was telling me about the septuagint version said that the greeks
had a wonderful library in alexandria that was full of manuscripts scrolls
and that it was burned soon after the septuagint version was translated
(perhaps to conceal some changes in the different versions , or perhaps just
as part of the typical burning of valuable things that occurs during changes
in power groups , he i dunno).

no. the library at alexandria was perhaps the greatest library ever
built in the world. the greeks had a love of wisdom , philo sophos , and
this great love was reflected in the alexandrian library. the christians
got a hold of it and began modifying and purging texts and then the moslems
invaded and either the christians burned the library to keep it from falling
into moslems hands (far more likely since they were the book burners , not the
moslems) , or it burned in the sack of the city or the moslems burned it.
either way , a tremendous amount of information was lost. the destruction of the
library of alexandria was probably one of the greatest crimes of man
against man.

so , i was just wondering , since i imagine some jewish people somewhere must
have had copies of the earlier hebrew versions , is the hebrew version of the
old testament very different from the greek derived version \?
no. there are a few famous discrepancies (isaiah 's prophecy about a young
woman was changed into a virgin , which was how the new testament writers
read it) , but not many.

actually , the hebrew almah , (young woman) , was translated as the hellenistic
greek parthenos which may or may not be correctly translated into the
modern and technical english term virgin. the jews did not have the type
of virginity cult that the greco romans had in artemis and diana.

well , perhaps this is the answer then.
deleted
if you go to a jewish bookstore , you 'll get a bible translated by jews , so
there will be some differences in interpretation , but the text they 're
translating from is basically the same.

the standard text used by christians and jews is the masoretic text.
jews of course use the text in its original hebrew , without translation.

if you want to read the original , you can buy an interlinear bible. that
contains the hebrew old testament and the greek new testament , with an english
translation written underneath each word.
if you want a bible with a possibly more original basic text , you can try
to find a samaritan bible. (good luck ! i 've never seen one.) the samaritans
(no , not the good samaritans) have their own version of the 5 books of moses.
they claim the jewish bible was altered by ezra.

i can certainly see opposing the amen but that does n't require
opposing a moment of silence.

i already responded to this on one dimension , but afterthoughts cause
me to make another , independent reply. the problem with a moment of
silence is that it is not an even handed way of allowing for religion
amongst students in the public schools. as i noted before , muslims need
more than a moment of silence in order to perform the prayers they are
required by muhammad to do. and (at least orthodox) jewish prayer also
has requirements that are not addressed by this.

there is , in fact , a highly selective bias towards christian prayer in
this moment of silence shit. and that is especially bizarre in that
christian prayer doesn't need this stuff a christain may pray totally
incognito at any time (to some extent , this is true of muslims and jews
as well what i intend in my first paragraph is that there are some
characteristic forms of prayer in these religions which do need special
times and or behavior , which cannot be undertaken without an observer
being able taking note of it.)

a christian may pray , at any time silently and without any trace of
his activity being evident to others. that may or may not be true of the
other religious traditions amongst us certainly , these tend to have some
forms of prayer that would evidence differences from american protestant
mainstream religion.

all that a moment of silence does is to allow that one tradition which
does n't need it , to have a special place set aside in the public schools.
there is nothing in christian prayer that requires public forms , or rugs ,
or phylacteries , or anything else at all visible to the outside world. a
christian student may (and probably does) pray at innumerable times during
the day , without anyone else knowing it. that may also be true of non
christians i am not claimng otherwise . in the moment of silence it
would still be difficult for the jews to gather and daven , for the muslims
to do their ablutions and find qiblah to mecca and engage in the prescribed
forms. but of course christians can do their thing and therefore ,
the provision is nothing but a disguised attempt to encourage just that.

luckily , there is a strong jewish presence in this country (and i , as
a christian , revere some of the jewish teachers i had in public schools) ,
and a growing muslim presence as well. i can only hope that the political
forces consequent on this will prevent the imposition of christian forms
on non christians.

as far as i can see (as a christian) there is nothing in this moment of
silence campaign but an attempt to use public social pressure to force
children to adhere to a pattern that is biased towards christianity. and
as a christian , i must protest such coercion. for what it 's worth , i
suspect that the coercion is not really targeted at the non christians
it is yet another case of failure amongst christian parents in making
their children prayerful , so that they want the public schools to teach
what they cannot manage to teach , despite having all the opportunity in
the world to do so.

if you have taught your children to pray , they do not need a moment of
silence in school. if you have not managed to teach them , the moment
will only embarrass you. give it up.

that is indeed the present consensus. contrary to what dr. fox has
been saying , however , present consensus is not that the longer
passage in josephus about jesus was inserted , but only that it was
modified.
there is no question that it was at least modified (based on what
origen says that josephus did not recognize jesus as the messiah) , but
i do n't think the argument that it appears out of context is a very
good one. (i have n't looked at the context for a while perhaps somebody

in the king james version of the bible there are three differents words
translated into the word hell . these greek words have totally different
meanings. the words are hades , tartaros , and gehenna.

in bibical usage , the greek word hades is used only 11 times in the
new testament , and is roughly the equivalent to the old testament word sheol...
meaning the grave or pit (compare acts 2 27 with psalms 16 10). hades may be
likened to a hole in the ground. (in the bible it has nothing to do with fire ! )

most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the english word hell
to translate hades and sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.

why \? because when seeing the word hell many readers impute to it the
traditional connotation of an ever burning inferno , when this was never
remotely intended in the greek language or in old english !

in its true bibical usage hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of
the dead , but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of
shadowy realm. hades is simply the abode we call the grave. all dead go to
this hell.

the second hell of the bible , tartaros , is mentioned only once in
scripture , 2 pet.2 4 for if god spared not the angels that sinned , but cast
them down to hell (tartaros) , and delivered them into chains of darkness to be
reserved unto judgment...

following their rebellion to unseat god from his throne (isa.14 12 14
rev.12 4) , the archangel lucifer (now satan) and a third of the created angels
(now demons) were ejected from heaven (luke 10 18). they were cast down to
tartaros , a place or condition of restraint that god has imposed on the
mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (jude 6 1 cor.6 3).

tartaros , then , is a hell that applies only to evil , rebellious angels or
demons (it is interesting that the ancient greeks used this word to describe
the place in which zeus confined the rebellious titans). nowhere in the bible
is there any mention of men being put into this particular hell .

the the third word that is translated as hell in the bible is gehenna. it
comes from the hebrew gai hinnom , meaning valley of hinniom. hinnom is a
deep , narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of jerusalem.

in old testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites , including
infant sacrifice (it was there that the apostate kings ahaz and manasseh made
their children pass through the fire to the god molech. the rites were
specifically celebrated in tophet , the place of abhorrence , one of the chief
groves in the valley).

king josiah of ancient judah finally put an end to these abominations. he
defiled the valley , rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 kings 23 10). later
the valley became the cesspool and city dump of jerusalem a repository for
sewage , refuse and animal carcasses. the bodies of dispised criminals were
also burned there along with the rubbish. fires burned continuously , feeding
by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.

aceldama , the field of blood , purchased with the money judas received for
the betrayal of christ (matt.27 8) was also in part of the valley of hinnom.

so what does this valley called gehenna have to do with hell \?

in rev.19 20 the satan inspired political dictator and a miracle working
religious figure , the false prophet , working with him will resist the
re establishment of the government of god by jesus christ at his second coming.
their fate is revealed by the apostle john and the beast was taken , and with
him the false prophet... these both were cast alive into a lake of fire
burning with brimstone.

where will this temporary lake of fire (this hell ) be \?

the prophet isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the beast for
tophet (in the valley of hinnom) is ordained of old , yea for the king it is
prepared , he hath made it deep and large , the pile thereof is fire and wood ,
the breath of the lord , like a stream of brimstone , doth kindle it (isa.30 33).

one thousand years later , satan himself will be cast into this rekindled
fiery lake where the beast and false prophet were cast ! (rev.20 10).

but what of the wicked who have died over the millennia \? does the bible
say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of
fire \?

in the sequence of rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be
thrown into the lake of fire after satan is cast there ! (rev.20 15). what will
become of these wicked \? will they writhe in flames for eternity \?

the wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming gehenna
fire on the earth. they wil be consumed , annihilated , destroyed ! this
punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final). the bible calls it the
second death (rev.20 14 21 8) , from which there is no possibility of a
further resurrection.

the bible does teach eternal punishment , but not eternal punishing.

the prophet malachi provides a graphic description. for , behold , the day
cometh that shall burn as an oven , and all the proud , yea , and all that do
wickedly , shall be stubble , and the day that cometh shall burn them up...
(4 1). to the righteous , god says that the wicked shall be ashes under the
soles of your feet... (mal.4 3).

gehenna was a place of destruction and death , not a place of living
torture ! jesus was talking to jews who understood all about this gehenna or
valley of hinnom. utter destruction by fire was complete. nothing was left ,
but ashes !

every text in the bible translated from this greek word gehenna means
complete destruction , not living torture (not eternal life in torment) ! the
bible says , in romans 6 23 , the wages of sin is death , not eternal life in
torture. the punishment revealed in the bible is death... the cessation of
life.

eternal life is the gift of god !

of you , i 've only started reading t.r.m since the bd disaster. but i
know the cotera is a fundy) and are defending koresh and his beliefs

bad secular state what is your opinion of his reported sexual habits \?
if the reports are accurate , what iyo does this say about the quality of
his christianity \? or are the allegations just part of the big
cover up \?

thank you , steve. it is refreshing to have someone accuse me of being
a christian. i only hope enough evidence can be garnered to get a
conviction. i am not certain what you mean by the fundy part as the
term fundamentalist has a wide variety of uses. if you refer to
those who actually believe jesus is the messiah and son of god and
wish to follow in his way , then i plead guilty. but what does it
matter what i think. the roman circus is over. the lions have been
satisfied for now. the emperor , after the long and gruelling
struggle , sensed the crowd was tiring and gave thumbs down.

with respect to my previous comments about david koresh , i urge you
to re examine my previous posts. i believe you mistakenly assume
that defense of koresh' right to his own personal beliefs and his
right to express them to others implies agreement with koresh'
theology. actually i understand little about the details of branch
davidian teachings and regret so many are hung up on that aspect
of the tragic events of the past few days.

nor do i think koresh' sex life should be of any interest to the
federal government. of course hillary says he had been molesting
infants so it must be true even though such allegations do not
fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government they are
state and local matters and have been thoroughly reviewed at the
local level by proper authorities with no successful charge having
ever been levied against him. under american law , he was innocent
as americans are presumed innocent until proven guilty. at least
that 's how it is suppposed to be. but he was demonized and propa
gandized against by a powerful machine to have him appear as a
lustful beast and therefore deserving of every ill the fates might
bring upon him.

but evidence trickles in that the twenty one children , who left the
building in the early days of the siege , were carefully examined
by qualified authorities for evidence of physical or sexual abuse
and none was found. deguerin , one of the attorneys who met with
davidians several times before the conflagration , reported that
the children seemed well adjusted and showed no sign of abuse.

ultimately , steve , what i think about the heart of david koresh
is quite unimportant. today he is in the benevolent hands of a
most wise and merciful judge who will one day surely judge us all.
so i withhold any judgment of david koresh and defer to the one
who has all knowledge. meanwhile , let 's clean up the mess left
on earth and keep this from happening again by sending a strong
message to the government to respect the inalienable rights of the
people it serves.

(i remain deliberately neutral on the cause of the fire i would n't
put it past koresh to have torched the place himself. on the other
hand , if the propane tank accident story is correct , i would n't put it
past the fbi to try to cover its ass by claiming koresh did it. i
hope your government does a very thorough investigation of the whole
debacle , and i 'll be disappointed if a few heads do n't roll. the
authorities seem to have botched the original raid , and in the matter
of the fire , are guilty of either serious misjudgement , or reckless
endangerment.)

robert , you keep making references to orthodox belief , and saying things
like it is held that... (cf. kermit thread). on what exact body of
theology are you drawing for what you call orthodox \? who is that holds
that luke meant what you said he meant \? whenever your personal interpretation
of biblical passages is challenged , your only response seems
to be that one needs merely to look at the bible in order to see the truth ,
but what of those who see biblical things differently from you \? are we to
simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it \?

rick , i think we can safely say , 1) robert is not the only person
who understands the bible , and 2) , the leadership of the lds church
historicly never has. let 's consider some personal interpretations
and see how much trust we should put in orthodox mormonism , which
could never be confused with orthodox christianity.

in one of his attacks on christians , the mormon apostle bruce r.
mcconkie said they thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify
elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised
messiah. he also said christians are wrong to believe that jehovah is
the supreme deity god the father , and that christ came into
mortality as his only begotten son. mcconkie then stated what mormons
believe today to be the truth about the matter. he said that elohim is
the father and jehovah is the son.

being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists
have gone in defining their three in one god , it comes as no surprise
to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to
identify elohim and jehovah and to show their relationship to the
promised messiah. some sectarians even believe that jehovah is the
supreme deity whose son came into mortality as the only begotten. as
with their concept that god is a spirit , this misinformation about the
gods of heaven is untrue. the fact is , and it too is attested by holy
writ , that elohim is the father , and that jehovah is the son who was
born into mortality as the lord jesus christ , the promised messiah.
(promised messiah , p. 100)

notice that mcconkie said the christians are as wrong about
their three in one god and their belief that god is a spirit as they
are in their understanding of who elohim and jehovah are. before
examining mcconkie 's attack and its validity , we shall read a few more
statements by mcconkie and other mormon sources concerning the words
elohim and jehovah. mcconkie stated

...the chief designation of christ that has been preserved for us in
the old testament , as that ancient work is now published , is the
exalted name title jehovah. (promised messiah , p. 367)

elohim , plural word though it is , is also used as the exalted
name title of god the eternal father , a usage that connotes his
supremacy and omnipotence , he being god above all gods. (mormon
doctrine , p. 224)

agreeing with mcconkie on the question of who elohim and
jehovah are , the apostle james e. talmage stated

elohim , as understood and used in the restored church of jesus
christ , is the name title of god the eternal father , whose firstborn
son in the spirit is jehovah the only begotten in the flesh ,
jesus christ. (jesus the christ , p. 38)

a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve
apostles of the mormon church states that god the eternal father... is
designate d by the exalted name title 'elohim'... (articles of faith ,
p. 466) ...christ in his preexistent , antemortal , or unembodied
state...was known as jehovah... (articles of faith , p. 471)

today mormon leaders teach that elohim in the ot refers to god
the father and jehovah refers to christ. mcconkie attacked christians
for saying jehovah can refer to the father. he stressed that these two
name titles should not be changed around so that christ is called
elohim and the father is called jehovah. ...the father...is elohim ,
not jehovah.... jehovah is christ , and christ is jehovah they are one
and the same person. (promised messiah , p. 111)

in the ot of the kjv of the bible , the hebrew word elohim is
used to refer to the true god , false gods and goddesses , and the judges
of israel. when referring to the true god , elohim is translated with a
capital g. when referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges
of israel , it is translated with a small g. it is translated four
times as judges (exod. 21 6 22 8 9) , once as judge (1 sam. 2 25) ,
twice as mighty (gen. 23 6 exod. 9 28) , once as angels (ps. 8 5) ,
once as godly (mal. 2 15) , once as great (gen. 30 8) , and once as
very great. (1 sam. 14 15)

the word jehovah is the traditional pronunciation of the
tetragrammation yhwh or yhvh with the vowel points taken from the word
adonai. many people believe the true pronunciation of the
tetragrammation was yahweh or yahveh. however , since jehovah rather
than yahweh is the word used by mormonism , this section will also use
jehovah instead of yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of
mormon leaders regarding that name. jehovah , unlike elohim , is never
used of false gods. it is the personal name of the triune god of the
bible. in the kjv , jehovah is rendered primarily lord , sometimes
god , and rarely lord.

now that we understand something about the words elohim and
jehovah and their use by mormon leaders , we shall consider the apostle
mcconkie 's attack on christians for believing the father is jehovah.
in trying to prove that jehovah refers exclusively to christ , mcconkie
cited several verses from the bible. some of these verses and mcconkie 's
interpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.
remember , mcconkie said the father is not jehovah he is only
elohim. the first example we shall consider involves mcconkie 's
interpretation of ps. 110 1. of this verse he stated

of whom spake david when his tongue was touched by the holy spirit
and he testified , the lord said unto my lord , sit thou at my right
hand , until i make thine enemies thy footstool \? (ps. 110 1.) two
lords are here involved one is speaking to the other one is greater
than the other one is making provision for the triumph and glory of
the other. who are they and what message is contained in this
messianic prophecy \?
what think ye of christ \? our lord asked certain of his detractors
toward the end of his mortal ministry. whose son is he \? is christ
the son of god or of someone else \? is he to be born of a divine parent
or will he be as other men a mortal son of a mortal father \? that he
was to be a descendant of david was a matter of great pride to all the
jews. and so they answered , the son of david.
david 's son \? truly he was. but he was more , much more. and so our
lord , with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture ,
asked , how then doth david in spirit call him lord , saying , the lord
said unto my lord , sit thou on my right hand , till i make thine
enemies thy footstool \? if david then call him lord , how is he his
son \? that is , if he is only the son of david , how is it that the
great king , acting under inspiration , calls him lord and worships him
as such \? and we might add who is the other lord , the one who spake
unto david 's lord \? can there be any question as to how jesus is
interpreting the words of the psalm \? he is saying that it means ' the
father said unto the son , elohim said unto jehovah , sit thou on my
right hand , until after your mortal ministry then i will raise you up
to eternal glory and exaltation with me , where you will continue to
sit on my right hand forever.' (promised messiah , pp. 101 102)
(emphasis added)

agreeing with the above statement by mcconkie , the following
remark in the mormon pamphlet what the mormons think of christ , p. 6
reads the lord elohim , the father said unto my lord jehovah , the
son ... (brackets in original)

mcconkie clearly stated that it is elohim the father who is
speaking to jehovah the son in this psalm. however , when one looks at
the hebrew word translated lord , it becomes apparent that either the
first lord is not the father or else the father is jehovah. either
way mcconkie is wrong. the psalm reads

the lord jehovah said unto my lord adon , sit thou at my right
hand , until i make thine enemies thy footstool. (ps. 110 1)

the first lord in this verse is jehovah who mormonism says
is christ , not the father. the second lord is the hebrew word adon
(singular for adonai , meaning master or lord). if the first lord is
the father and the second lord is the son , then the father is
jehovah and the son is adon. however , if the father is not jehovah
as mcconkie claimed , then the first lord is jehovah the son , but
who , then , is adon \? obviously the father is jehovah in this psalm ,
and his son is adon.

another example involves isa. 42 6 about which mcconkie stated
the following

i the lord have called thee in righteousness , isaiah quoted the
father as saying of christ , and will hold thine hand , and will keep
thee , and give thee for a covenant of the people , for a light of the
gentiles. (isa. 42 6.) (promised messiah , p. 81) (emphasis added)

mcconkie said the father was speaking of christ in this passage
which reads

i the lord jehovah have called thee in righteousness , and will hold
thine hand , and will keep thee , and give thee for a covenant of the
people , for a light of the gentiles. (isa. 42 6)

according to mcconkie , i the lord refers to the father , and
thine and thee refer to christ. however , the lord who is speaking
is jehovah which means either mcconkie was wrong about who is speaking
or else the father is jehovah.

another example involves ps. 22 7 8. of these verses mcconkie
stated

the same psalm says all they that see me laugh me to scorn they
shoot out the lip , they shake the head , saying , he trusted on the lord
that he would deliver him let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in
him. (ps. 22 7 8.) the fulfillment , as jesus hung on the cross , is
found in these words the chief priests mocking him , with the scribes
and elders , said , he saved others himself he cannot save. if he be
the king of israel , let him now come down from the cross , and we will
believe him. he trusted in god let him deliver him now , if he will
have him for he said , i am the son of god. the thieves also , which
were crucified with him , cast the same in his teeth. (matt.
27 41 44.) (promised messiah , pp. 530 531) (emphasis added)

ps. 22 7 8 reads as follows

all they that see me laugh me to scorn they shoot out the lip , they
shake the head , saying , he trusted on the lord jehovah that he would
deliver him let him deliver him , seeing he delighted in him.

mcconkie said these verses had their fulfillment as jesus hung
on the cross. that means the person who was scorned in these verses was
christ. who , then , was the lord in whom he trusted \? it was jehovah
the father.

another example involves ps. 31 13 and ps. 41 9. regarding them ,
mcconkie stated the following

with reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our
lord 's arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was they took counsel
together against me , they devised to take away my life. (ps. 31 13.)
as to the role of judas in those conspiracies , the psalmist says
mine own familiar friend , in whom i trusted , which did eat of my
bread , hath lifted up his heel against me. (ps. 41 9.) (promised
messiah , p. 532)

apostle mcconkie said these psalms refer to christ 's arrest and
judicial trials. we shall first consider ps. 31 and then ps. 41. while
mcconkie only quoted verse 13 of ps. 31 , verse 14 will also be included
to give a complete understanding of the matter.

for i have heard the slander of many fear was on every side while
they took counsel together against me , they devised to take away my
life. but i trusted in thee , o lord jehovah i said , thou art my god
elohim . (ps. 31 13 14)

mcconkie said verse 13 referred to jesus christ. verse 14 goes
on to tell that he (christ) trusted in the lord who is called his
god or elohim. mormonism teaches that the god above jesus is
elohim the father. verse 14 , however , reveals that the elohim of the
man jesus is jehovah the father.

in ps. 41 , mcconkie only quoted one verse however , two verses
will be considered in this examination.

yea , mine own familiar friend , in whom i trusted , which did eat of my
bread , hath lifted up his heel against me.
but thou , o lord jehovah , be merciful unto me , and raise me up , that
i may requite them. (ps. 41 9 10)

mcconkie stated above that verse 9 referred to judas' role in
christ 's death. since it was judas who was the familiar friend who
lifted up his heel , the pronouns mine , i , my , and me in verse
9 must refer to christ. notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there
is a change of pronoun to thou , which refers to the lord (jehovah).
then the pronouns me and i which refer to christ are used again.
that means christ was speaking to jehovah the father in these verses.

another example involves mcconkie 's following remark about ps.
110 4.

one of the great messianic prophecies , spoken by the mouth of david ,
says the lord hath sworn , and will not repent , thou art a priest for
ever after the order of melchizedek. (ps. 110 4.) (promised messiah ,
p. 450)

mcconkie admitted this is a messianic prophecy involving christ.
the question is , what in this verse refers to christ \?

the lord jehovah hath sworn , and will not repent , thou art a priest
for ever after the order of melchizedek. (ps. 110 4)

does the lord , which is jehovah , refer to christ \? if
mcconkie is right and jesus is jehovah , but the father is not , then
the lord would have to refer to christ. but who , then , is the one
addressed as the priest forever after the order of melchizedek \? the
bible reveals that the one referred to is jesus christ (heb. 5 8 10
6 20 7) therefore , the lord (jehovah) in ps. 110 4 is the father.

another example involves isa. 53 4 12. of these verses mcconkie
stated

of the atoning sacrifice of the future messiah , isaiah said...
the lord has laid on him the iniquities of us all....
it pleased the lord to bruise him... (promised messiah , p. 234)
(emphasis added)

mcconkie rightly said these verses refer to the atoning
sacrifice of the future messiah. however , what he failed to mention is
that they also prove that the father is jehovah. verse 6 reads all
we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way
and the lord jehovah hath laid on him christ the iniquity of us
all , and verse 10 reads yet it pleased the lord jehovah to bruise
him christ ...

obviously the lord who laid on christ the iniquity of us all
and who bruised him is god the father who is called jehovah in these
verses.

remember , mcconkie stated that some sectarians even believe
that jehovah is the supreme deity , and that christ came into
mortality as his only begotten son. he called this concept
misinformation that is untrue. to prove that it is mcconkie who is
misinformed and believing untruth , two scriptural references (2 sam.
7 14 ps. 2 7) will be examined. mcconkie stated the following regarding
these scriptures

in the midst of a passage that is clearly messianic , the lord says of
the seed of david i will be his father , and he shall be my son. (2
sam. 7 14.) in the second psalm , the whole of which is also clearly
messianic , occurs this statement thou art my son this day have i
begotten thee. (ps. 2 7.) paul quotes both of these statements in
hebrews 1 5 and says they are prophecies that christ would come as the
son of god. (promised messiah , p. 143)

mcconkie cited heb. 1 5 to show that 2 sam. 7 14 and ps. 2 7
refer to christ who would come as the son of god. since mcconkie first
referenced 2 sam. 7 14 , this examination will , too. however , along with
verse 14 , verses 11 13 will also be included.

and as since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people
israel , and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. also the
lord jehovah telleth thee that he will make thee an house.
and when thy days be fulfilled , and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers ,
i will set up thy seed after thee , which shall proceed out of thy
bowels , and i will establish his kingdom.
he shall build an house for my name , and i will stablish the throne of
his kingdom for ever. i will be his father , and he shall be my son. (2
sam. 7 11 14)

these verses teach that the lord (jehovah) would have a son ,
the messiah.
in the second example mcconkie cited ps. 2 7. this examination
will include verse 8. notice that it is the lord (jehovah) who says ,
thou art my son this day have i begotten thee.

i will declare the decree the lord jehovah hath said unto me , thou
art my son this day have i begotten thee.
ask of me , and i shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance ,
and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.

mcconkie said these verses of scripture are clearly messianic ,
and he acknowledged they teach that christ would come as the son of
god. what he is not willing to acknowledge , however , is that these
scriptures also teach that the father is jehovah and that the
sectarians who believe jehovah is the supreme deity whose son is
jesus christ , the only begotten , are right in their belief.

another example involves mic. 5 4. of this verse mcconkie stated
the following

and so , truly , did our lord act during his mortal ministry ! truly ,
this is he of whom it is written he shall stand and feed in the
strength of the lord , in the majesty of the name of the lord his
god... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth. (mic.
5 4.) (promised messiah , p. 182) (emphasis added)

according to mcconkie , the pronoun he at the beginning of mic.
5 4 refers to christ during his mortal ministry. who , then , is the
lord his god \? mic. 5 4 reads

and he christ shall stand and feed in the strength of the lord
jehovah , in the majesty of the name of the lord jehovah his god
elohim ... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

obviously the lord of jesus christ is jehovah the father who
is referred to as jehovah his elohim.

another example involves ps. 2 2 and isa. 61 1. of these verses
mcconkie stated the following

a number of messianic passages speak of the lord , and...his
anointed (ps. 2 2) , signifying that the chosen one was consecrated
and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. jesus
applied these passages to himself by quoting isaiah 's prophecy. the
lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek (isa.
61 1) , and then saying this day is this scripture fulfilled in your
ears (luke 4 21). (promised messiah , pp. 182 183) (emphasis added)

the first source mcconkie quoted ps. 2 2 reads as follows

the kings of the earth set themselves , and the rulers take counsel
together , against the lord jehovah , and against his anointed.

mcconkie said the anointed one was christ. if that is true ,
who was jehovah \? if jehovah is always christ , who was the anointed
one \? obviously jehovah is referring to god the father and the
anointed is indeed referring to christ. the second source mcconkie
cited is isa. 61 1 which states

the spirit of the lord adonai god jehovah is upon me because the
lord jehovah hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek
he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted , to proclaim liberty to
the captives , and the opening of the prison to them that are bound

the one who was anointed to preach , bind up , proclaim , and open
was jesus christ. who , then , was the one who anointed him \? this verse
says the lord (jehovah) did the anointing. again , we face the same
problem. if jehovah does not refer to the father , but only to christ ,
then jesus anointed someone , but who \? as mcconkie pointed out , jesus
applied these passages to himself. therefore , the jehovah who
anointed christ is god the father.

other examples could be cited to show that mcconkie and other
mormon leaders are wrong when they say god the father is not jehovah.
however , these should be enough to expose their error.

now , what about mormonism 's claim that jesus is jehovah , but
he is not elohim \? it is true that jesus is jehovah. the following
scriptures prove this fact

thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel , and his redeemer
the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first , and i am the last and
beside me there is no god. (isa. 44 6)
jesus said ...i am the first and the last i am he that liveth , and
was dead... (rev. 1 17 18)

...saith the lord jehovah ...they shall look upon me whom they have
pierced , and they shall mourn for him , as one mourneth for his only
son... (zech. 12 1 , 10)
behold , he christ cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him ,
and they also which pierced him... (rev. 1 7)

...i am the lord jehovah thy god , the holy one of israel... (isa.
43 3)
...ye denied the holy one christ and the just... (acts 3 14)

and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of
the lord jehovah shall be delivered... (joel 2 32)
...the name of jesus christ of nazareth...there is none other name
under heaven given among men , whereby we must be saved. (acts 4 10 , 12)

behold , the lord god jehovah will come with strong hand...his
reward is with him... (isa. 40 10)
...behold , i christ come quickly and my reward is with me... (rev.
22 12)

...the lord jehovah my god shall come , and all the saints with
thee. (zech. 14 5)
...at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all his saints. (1
thess. 3 13)

the lord jehovah is my shepherd... (ps. 23 1)
jesus said i am the good shepherd... (john 10 14)

...saith the lord god jehovah . i will seek that which was lost...
(ezek. 34 15 16)
...the son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
(luke 19 10)

for i am the lord jehovah thy god , the holy one of israel , thy
saviour... (isa. 43 3)
looking for that blessed hope , and the glorious appearing of the great
god and our saviour jesus christ. (tit. 2 13. see also jer. 42 5 and
rev. 1 5 mal. 3 6 and heb. 13 8 1 kin. 8 28 , 39 and john 2 24 25
isa. 25 8 and 2 tim. 1 10 ps. 107 24 , 29 and matt. 8 26 prov.3 12 and
rev. 3 19)

while mormons are right when they say jesus is jehovah , they
are wrong when they say he is not elohim. the bible reveals that
jehovah is the only true elohim there is all others are false.
remember , jehovah is the personal name of the triune god who has
revealed himself in the bible.

before we consider biblical quotes which show that jehovah and
elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claims let us first note
that not only are both god the father and christ addressed as jehovah
and elohim but so is the holy spirit.

whereof the holy ghost ... said ...this is the covenant that i
will make with them after those days , saith the lord , i will put my
laws into their hearts , and in their minds will i write them and
their sins and iniquities will i remember no more. (heb. 10 15 17)
(emphasis on holy ghost and said added)
behold , the days come , saith the lord jehovah , that i will make a
new covenant with the house of israel , and with the house of judah...
i will put my law in their inward parts , and write it in their hearts
and will be their god elohim , and they shall be my people.... i will
forgive their iniquity , and i will remember their sin no more. (jer.
31 31 , 33 34) (emphasis added)

for the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man but holy
men of god spake as they were moved by the holy ghost . (2 pet. 1 21)
(emphasis on holy ghost added)
the spirit of the lord jehovah spake by me , and his word was in
my tongue. (2 sam. 23 2. see also heb. 3 7 11 with ps. 95 6 11)

let us now continue with the biblical quotes which show that
jehovah and elohim are not two separate gods as mormons claim.

and when the lord jehovah saw that he moses turned aside to see ,
god elohim called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said ,
moses , moses. and he said , here am i.... bruce r. mcconkie
acknowledged that it was christ 's voice that spoke to moses in the
burning bush... promised messiah , p. 394
and the lord jehovah said...
and moses said unto god elohim , behold , when i come unto the
children of israel , and shall say unto them , the god elohim of your
fathers hath sent me unto you and they shall say to me , what is his
name \? what shall i say unto them \?
and god elohim said unto moses , i am that i am and he said , thus
shalt thou say unto the children of israel , i am hath sent me unto
you.
and god elohim said moreover unto moses , thus shalt thou say unto
the children of israel , the lord jehovah god elohim of your
fathers , the god elohim of abraham , the god elohim of isaac , and
the god elohim of jacob , hath sent me unto you this is my name for
ever , and this is my memorial unto all generations. (exod.
3 4 , 7 , 13 15)

and god elohim spake unto moses , and said unto him , i am the lord
jehovah . (exod. 6 2)

i am the lord jehovah , and there is none else , there is no god
elohim beside me i girded thee , though thou hast not known me
(isa. 45 5)

but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim , he is the living god
elohim , and an everlasting king... (jer. 10 10)

thus saith the lord jehovah the king of israel , and his redeemer
the lord jehovah of hosts i am the first , and i am the last and
beside me there is no god elohim . (isa. 44 6)

therefore will i cause you to go into captivity beyond damascus ,
saith the lord jehovah , whose name is the god elohim of hosts.
(amos 5 27)

behold , the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the lord 's
jehovah 's thy god elohim , the earth also , with all that therein
is. (deut. 10 14)

wherefore thou art great , o lord jehovah god elohim for there is
none like thee , neither is there any god elohim beside thee ,
according to all that we have heard with our ears. (2 sam. 7 22)

and he said unto them , i am an hebrew and i fear the lord jehovah ,
the god elohim of heaven , which hath made the sea and the dry land.
(jon. 1 9)

for who is god elohim save the lord jehovah \? or who is a rock
save our god elohim \? (ps. 18 31)

blessed is the nation whose god elohim is the lord jehovah ...
(ps. 33 12. see also ps. 144 15)

hast thou not known \? hast thou not heard , that the everlasting god
elohim , the lord jehovah , the creator of the ends of the earth ,
fainteth not , neither is weary \? there is no searching of his
understanding. (isa. 40 28)

the mighty god elohim , even the lord jehovah , hath spoken , and
called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down
thereof. (ps. 50 1)

sing unto god elohim , sing praises to his name estol him that
rideth upon the heavens by his name jah , and rejoice before him. (ps.
68 4) regarding the word jah , bruce r. mcconkie stated jah
(hebrew yah) is a contracted form of jehovah , jahveh , or yahweh all
of which names have reference to christ , the god of israel. mormon
doctrine , p. 391

and david arose , and went with all the people that were with him from
baale of judah , to bring up from thence the ark of god elohim , whose
name is called by the name of the lord jehovah of hosts that
dwelleth between the cherubims. (2 sam. 6 2)

...the great the mighty god elohim , the lord jehovah of hosts , is
his name. (jer. 32 18)

o my god elohim , make them like a wheel as the stubble before the
wind....
fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name , o lord
jehovah ....
that men may know that thou , whose name alone is jehovah , art the most
high over all the earth. (ps. 83 13 , 16 , 18)

the bible clearly teaches that jehovah is elohim. in fact ,
he is the only elohim there is. he is the true , the living , the
mighty , the great , and the everlasting elohim. he is the elohim
of israel , of all the kingdoms of the earth , and of the heavens. he is
the creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and
all that dwell thereon. jehovah 's name is elohim of hosts. (amos
5 27)

not only is jehovah , elohim , but elohim is jehovah. the
bible reveals that elohim 's name is jah (ps. 68 4) , jehovah (ps.
83 18) , and jehovah of hosts. (2 sam. 6 2 jer. 32 18) the nation
whose elohim is jehovah is blessed. (ps. 33 12) clearly , this is not
the jehovah and elohim of the mormons.

another mormon error regarding elohim and jehovah is the
belief that elohim , not jehovah , is the father of all the spirits ,
including jesus. in the articles of faith by apostle james e. talmage ,
a doctrinal exposition by the first presidency and the twelve apostles
states that god the eternal father...'elohim , ' is the literal parent
of...the spirits of the human race. (p. 466) this doctrinal
exposition also states explicitly that jesus christ is not the father
of the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth ,
for he is one of them. he is the son , as they are sons and daughters of
elohim. (p. 473)

the apostle talmage stated that elohim ...is the name title of
god the eternal father , whose firstborn son in the spirit is
jehovah (jesus the christ , p. 38)

the apostle bruce r. mcconkie stated the following about this
matter ...jehovah christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms
of plant and animal life on the face thereof. but when it came to
placing man on earth , there was a change in creators . that is , the
father himself became personally involved. all things were created by
the son , using the power delegated by the father , except man. in the
spirit and again in the flesh , man was created by the father . there was
no delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was
concerned. (promised messiah , p. 62) (emphasis added)

mormon leaders claim that jehovah christ did not create either
man 's spirit or his body. they maintain that the mormon elohim , who is
the father , created man both in spirit and body. the bible reveals the
truth about who created man.

and moses spake unto the lord jehovah , saying ,
let the lord jehovah , the god elohim of the spirits of all
flesh , set a man over the congregation. (num. 27 15 16. see also
16 20 23) (emphasis added)

...the lord jehovah , which stretcheth forth the heavens , and layeth
the foundation of the earth , and formeth the spirit of man within
him . (zech. 12 1) (emphasis added)

...the lord jehovah ...made us this soul... (jer. 38 16)

for i will not contend for ever , neither will i be always wroth for
the spirit should fail before me , and the souls which i have
made ....
...saith the lord jehovah ... (isa. 57 16 , 19) (emphasis on souls...i
have made added)

behold , i am the lord jehovah , the god elohim of all flesh ...
(jer. 32 27) (emphasis added)

thus saith the lord jehovah , thy redeemer , and he that formed thee
from the womb .
i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things... (isa. 44 24)
(emphasis added)

thus saith the lord jehovah ...
i have made the earth , and created man upon it... (isa. 45 11 12)
(emphasis added)

...god elohim created man upon the earth...
unto thee it was shewed , that thou mightest know that the lord
jehovah he is god elohim there is none else beside him. (deut.
4 32 , 35)

thus saith god el the lord jehovah ...he that spread forth the
earth , and that which cometh out of it he that giveth breath unto the
people upon it , and spirit to them that walk therein. (isa. 42 5)

...thus saith the lord jehovah of hosts , the god elohim of
israel... i have made the earth , the man and the beast that are upon
the ground... (jer. 27 4 5) (most emphasis added)

the bible reveals that it is jehovah who is the elohim of the
spirits of all flesh and of all flesh itself , that it was he who
formed the spirit of man within him , that he made us this soul and
formed us from the womb. he did indeed create man.

if mormon leaders are right when they say jesus is jehovah ,
then they are wrong when they say he did not create man. if they are
right when they say the father is the one who created man , then they are
wrong when they say he is not jehovah.

although mormon leaders teach that jesus did not create man ,
mormon scriptures teach that he did. the bom states the following

behold , i am jesus christ. i am the father and the son....
and never have i showed myself unto man whom i have created , for
never has man believed in me as thou hast....
behold , this body , which ye now behold , is the body of my spirit and
man have i created after the body of my spirit... (eth. 3 14 16)
(emphasis added)

for it is i that taketh upon me the sins of the world for it is i
that hath created them ... (mos. 26 23) (emphasis added)

...the god of abraham , and the god of isaac , and the god of
jacob...is that same god who created the heavens and the earth , and
all things that in them are.
behold he created adam ... (mor. 9 11 12) (emphasis added)

d c , 93 10 states that the worlds were made by him christ
men were made by him all things were made by him , and through him ,
and of him. (emphasis added)

another error by bruce r. mcconkie involving jehovah and his
creation is the belief that jehovah had many pre mortal spirits
helping him create. included in this alleged group was joseph smith , jr.

that he christ was aided in the creation of this earth by many of
the noble and great spirit children of the father is evident from
abraham 's writings. unto those superior spirits christ said we will
go down , for there is space there , and we will take of these
materials , and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell. (abra.
3 22 24.) michael or adam was one of these. enoch , noah , abraham ,
moses , peter , james , and john , joseph smith , and many other noble and
great ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (doctrines
of salvation , vol. 1 , pp. 74 75.) (mormon doctrine , p. 169)

the bible reveals the truth about this matter

thus saith the lord jehovah , thy redeemer , and he that formed thee
from the womb , i am the lord jehovah that maketh all things that
stretcheth forth the heavens alone that spreadeth abroad the earth by
myself. (isa. 44 24)

which alone spreadeth out the heavens , and treadeth upon the waves of
the sea. (job 9 8)

jehovah , by himself , created all things. he had no alleged
preexistent spirit helpers assisting him.

regarding the mormon 'elohim , the apostle mcconkie stated
elohim. plural word though it is , is also used as the exalted
name title of god the eternal father , a usage that connotes his
supremacy and omnipotence , he being god above all gods. (mormon
doctrine , p. 224) he also stated that jesus...is above all save the
father only. (promised messiah , p. 363)

the bible states that the one who is god above all so called
gods is the triune god jehovah.

for the lord jehovah is a great god el , and a great king above
all gods elohim . (ps. 95 3)

for thou , lord jehovah , art high above all the earth thou art
exalted far above all gods elohim . (ps. 97 9)

now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods
elohim ... (exod. 18 11. see also ps. 135 5 deut. 10 17)

if mormon leaders are right when they say jehovah is god the
son and elohim is god the father , these verses from the bible would be
teaching that the mormon son is above his father. however , as mcconkie
clearly stated , mormons believe elohim the father , not jehovah the
son , is the god above all gods that jesus is above all except the
father yet the bible teaches that jehovah is above all elohim.

at a byu dev. on march 2 , 1982 , bruce r. mcconkie made the
following remark about praying to jesus

another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly
to christ because of some special friendship they feel has been
developed....
this is plain sectarian nonsense. our prayers are addressed to the
father , and to him only....
...perfect prayer is addressed to the father , in the name of the son
it is uttered by the power of the holy ghost... (our relationship with
the lord , pp. 19 20)

mcconkie states on p. 335 of his book promised messiah that the
mormons pray to the father , not the son... on p. 306 of the same book
mcconkie states that christ the son is jehovah. this is important to
remember , because although mcconkie said prayer is not to be offered to
the mormon christ who is jehovah , the bible states repeatedly in the
ot that people prayed to jehovah , and he not only heard those prayers ,
but he accepted them as valid requests. the following is but a small
sample of the vast number of times people prayed to jehovah.

in my distress i called upon the lord jehovah , and cried unto my
god elohim he heard my voice out of his temple , and my cry came
before him , even into his ears. (ps. 18 6)

and the lord jehovah said unto him , i have heard thy prayer and thy
supplication , that thou hast made before me i have hallowed this
house , which thou hast built , to put my name there for ever and mine
eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 kin. 9 3)

and said unto jeremiah the prophet , let , we beseech thee , our
supplication be accepted before thee , and pray for us unto the lord
jehovah thy god elohim , even for all this remnant... (jer. 42 2)

o lord jehovah , i beseech thee , let now thine ear be attentive to
the prayer of thy servant , and to the prayer of thy servants , who
desire to fear thy name... (neh. 1 11)

and it was so , that when solomon had made an end of praying all this
prayer and supplication unto the lord jehovah , he arose from before
the altar of the lord jehovah , from kneeling on his knees with his
hands spread up to heaven. (1 kin. 8 54)

he went in therefore , and shut the door upon them twain , and prayed
unto the lord jehovah . (2 kin. 4 33)

go , and say to hezekiah , thus saith the lord jehovah , the god
elohim of david thy father , i have heard thy prayer , i have seen thy
tears behold , i will add unto thy days fifteen years. (isa. 38 5)

i acknowledge my sin unto thee , and mine iniquity have i not hid. i
said , i will confess my transgressions unto the lord jehovah and
thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when
thou mayest be found... (ps. 32 5 6)

notice above in ps. 32 6 that the godly pray to jehovah.
according to mcconkie and other mormon leaders , that is christ the very
one to whom mcconkie said people should not pray.

the bible reveals there is only one true elohim , and his name
is jehovah. all other elohim are false. they are idols that cause
their followers to commit adultery against the true elohim and
idolatry.

for the lord jehovah is great , and greatly to be praised he is to
be feared above all gods elohim .
for all the gods elohim of the nations are idols but the lord
jehovah made the heavens. (ps. 96 4 5)

thou shalt have no other gods elohim before me. (exod. 20 3)

now i know that the lord jehovah is greater than all gods
elohim ... (exod. 18 11)

and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god
elohim , and walk after other gods elohim , and serve them , and
worship them , i testify against you this day that ye shall surely
perish. (deut. 8 19)

thou shalt make no covenant with them , nor with their gods elohim .
they shall not dwell in thy land , lest they make thee sin against me
for if thou serve their gods elohim , it will surely be a snare unto
thee. (exod. 23 32 33)

take heed to yourselves , that your heart be not deceived , and ye turn
aside , and serve other gods elohim , and worship them. (deut. 11 16)

that ye come not among these nations , these that remain among you
neither make mention of the name of their gods elohim , nor cause to
swear by them , neither serve them , nor bow yourselves unto them.
(josh. 23 7)

...neither walk after other gods elohim to your hurt. (jer. 7 6)

but the lord jehovah is the true god elohim , he is the living god
elohim ... (jer. 10 10)

and they forsook the lord jehovah god elohim of their fathers ,
which brought them out of the land of egypt , and followed other gods
elohim , of the gods elohim of the people that were round about
them , and bowed themselves unto them , and provoked the lord jehovah
to anger. (jud. 2 12)

shall a man make gods elohim unto himself , and they are no gods
elohim \? therefore , behold , i will this once cause them to know , i
will cause them to know mine hand and my might and they shall know
that my name is the lord jehovah . ( jer. 16 20 21)

and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord jehovah , choose you
this day whom ye will serve whether the gods elohim which your
fathers served that were on the other side of the flood , or the gods
elohim of the amorites , in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my
house , we will serve the lord jehovah .
and the people answered and said , god elohim forbid that we should
forsake the lord jehovah , to serve other gods elohim . (josh.
24 15 16)

these verses teach that the only true , living elohim in heaven
and on earth is jehovah the triune god who made heaven and earth
and all therein.

jehovah is greater than any elohim , because all other
elohim are idols. the reality behind them is demonic. (deut. 32 17)
jehovah elohim has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding
these false elohim. he told his people not to have any elohim but
him. he told the people that if they left him for the false elohim ,
those elohim would be a snare to them , and they would be hurt and
would perish. he warned the people to take heed that their heart be
not deceived into worshiping , serving , swearing by , and making
covenants with false elohim. jehovah elohim told his people he would
eventually judge all false elohim and their followers.

despite these warnings and guidelines , elohim 's covenant
people forsook him and believed in and worshiped the false elohim 's of
the people they came in contact with. ju. 10 6 states that the children
of israel did evil again in the sight of the lord jehovah and served
baalim , and ashtaroth , and the gods elohim of syria , and the gods
elohim of zidon , and the gods elohim of moab , and the gods elohim
of the children of ammon , and the gods elohim of the philistines , and
forsook the lord jehovah , and served not him.

this examination has shown that the elohim of mormonism , like
the elohim in ju. 10 6 is not the true jehovah elohim. therefore ,
the people who leave the true elohim for the mormon elohim will do
evil...in the sight of the lord jehovah .

although mcconkie attacked christians for their belief in a
triune god who is spirit and for their belief that god the father
jehovah sent his son into the world , these beliefs are true. god is
triune he is spirit he is jehovah and he did send his son into the
world to redeem mankind.

it is obvious from this examination that it is not the
christians who thrash around in...darkness about who elohim and
jehovah are. one wonders what holy writ mcconkie had in mind when he
stated that it attests to the fact that elohim is the father , and that
jehovah is the son. he certainly did not mean the bible which teaches
that the father , son , and holy spirit are all the one jehovah elohim.
he apparently did not mean the d c either , because chapter 109 , verses
1 , 4 , 9 10 , 14 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 29 , 34 , 42 , 47 , 56 , 68 , 77 refer to the father as
jehovah.

summary

obviously joseph fielding smith 's statement that the mormons
have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of god (doctrines
of salvation , 1 279) is not accurate. the mormon gods are not the true
god as mormonism claims , but are idols which cause their followers to
commit adultery against god and idolatry.

in answer to jesus' question , but whom say ye that i am ,
mormons say jesus is someone different from the jesus who is revealed in
the bible and whom the apostles preached. therefore , anyone trusting in
the mormon jesus is believing in another jesus whom paul warned about.

bernard p. brockbank , of the first quorum of the seventy ,
admitted in the may 1977 issue of the ensign , a mormon publication , that
the mormon jesus is different from the christian jesus. he stated that
it is true that many of the christian churches worship a different
jesus christ than is worshipped by the mormons or the church of jesus
christ of latter day saints. (p. 26)

the people who believe in the mormon jesus are committing
adultery against god and idolatry. they do not have the son therefore ,
they do not have the father , and they do not have eternal life. as the
apostle bruce r. mcconkie rightly stated salvation comes only by
worshiping the true god. (promised messiah , p. 163) mcconkie also
rightly stated that the mere worship of a god who has the proper
scriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and
living god , because the true names of deity can be applied to false
concepts of god. (mormon doctrine , p. 270) remember that the apostle
stephen l. richards admitted that joseph smith , jr. , gave a new
conception of god and the godhead. (contributions of joseph smith , p.
1)

it is important for the people who have left the true triune god
revealed in the bible to repent and return to him. they must forsake the
sins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in mormonism.
the bible says

...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed , and they that depart from
me shall be written in the earth , because they have forsaken the lord
jehovah , the fountain of living waters. (jer. 17 13)

and it shall be , if thou do at all forget the lord jehovah thy god
elohim , and walk after other gods elohim , and serve them , and
worship them , i testify against you this day that ye shall surely
perish. (deut. 8 19)

thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods elohim . (exod. 23 32)

...put away the strange gods elohim that are among you , and be
clean , and change your garments. (gen. 35 2)

...flee from idolatry. (1 cor. 10 14)

it is necessary that christians heed the warnings of the bible.
if they do , they will not fall into the sins of adultery against god and
idolatry. remember , to know the only true god is eternal life. (john
17 3)

...their gods elohim shall be a snare unto you. (ju. 2 3. see also
exod. 23 32 33)

emarsh@hernes sun.eng.sun.com (eric marsh) writes
btw , the parallel universe approach implys an element of mind in the
very physical reality of the universe.

this sounds interesting... but what exactly do you mean \?

well , the best thing to do is to read the book parallel universes
by dr. fred wolf.

in essence , dr. wolf says that one interpretation of the sub atomic
particle wave duality is that what we perceive as a wave is actually
an infinate number of parallel universes overlaid , and in each of
these universes there is a particle in a different location. when we
do something to make a particle appear , we are actually causing
all the parallel universes to collapse into one. apparently this is
one line of thought on the nature of qm , that is going through some
of the scientific community.

dr. wolf (and many others) claim that somehow the collapse is caused
by the mental effort of observing the particle. this implys that
mind is more than merely a biological phenomenon. he then extrapolates
that if mind is an integral part of the universe , then perhaps consciousness
is the element that gives order and form to the universe(s) it themself(s).

it all gets rather interesting , but what i find facinating is that
this would explain the phenomenon of magick as practiced in my
religion. dr. wolf speculates that the ordering functionality of mind
could be caused by the selection of a future from an infinite number of
possible futures he says that this might be done by some sort of
communication between ones current , and possible future selves.
i have long speculated that if magick is not merely a form of self
delusion then perhaps it could be caused by some sort of a selection
of one of many possible futures.

i realize that this gets pretty bizarre , but it never hurts to keep
an open mind and at least file it all away as another possibile
explaination of the world in which we find ourselves. after all , the
more we learn about the universe in which we live , the more we learn
that it is truly a very strange place.

the fbi claims , on the basis of their intelligence reports ,
that bd 's had no plans to commit suecide. they , btw , had bugged the
place and were listening to bd 's conversations till the very end.

koresh 's attorney claims that , based on some 30 hours he spent
talking to his client and others in the compound , he saw no
indication that bd 's were contemplating suecide.

the survivors claim it was not a suecide.

it 's not clear that more than one of the survivors made this claim. it is
clear that at least one of the survivors made the contradictory claim that
bd members had started the fire.

no , this is far from clear. we only have the word of the fbi spokepeople that
a survivor made this claim. we have the contradictory word of the lawyers who
spoke with the survivors individually that all of them agreed that they did
not have a suicide pact and did not intentionally start the fire. in the absense
of any more evidence , i do n't see how we can decide who to believe.
furthermore , its quite possible that there was no general suicide pact and that
some small inner circle took it upon themselves to kill everyone else.
with the state of the area now , we may never know what happened.


bd 's were not contemplating suecide , and there is no reason
to believe they committed one.

no reason \? how about these two

1. some of the survivors claimed that bd members poured fuel along the
corridors and set fire to it. the speed at which the fire spread
is not inconsistent with this claim.

again , we have only the word of the fbi on this claim. the lawyers who
have also talked to the survors deny that any of them are making that claim.


2. there was certainly a fire which killed most of the people in the compound.
there is a very very good possibility that the fbi did not start this
fire. this is a good reason to believe that the bd 's did.

i will agree on your assessment as to the relative probabilities. its more likely
that the bd 's started the fire than did the fbi. but there is currently no
way to decide what actually happened based on the publically available evidence
(which is nearly none).


3. even if the bd 's were not contemplating suicide , it is very possible that
david koresh was convinced (and thus convinced the others) that this
was not suicide. it was the fulfilment of a profecy of some sort.

there are three possibilities other than the bd 's self destruction

a. they are not dead , but escaped via bunker , etc. from reports of the
inadequacies of the tunnels and the bodies found , i would rate this
as highly unlikely.

b. the fire was started by an fbi accident. this is possible , but it would be
foolish of us to declare this outright until more evidence can back it.
sure , it 's possible that the armored vehicle knocked down a lantern
which started the fire (why was there a lit lantern in the middle of
the day near the edge of the complex \? ). it 's anecdotal evidence that
has been contradicted by other escapees.

c. the fire was started on purpose by the fbi. this has been suggested by
some on the net , and i would rate this possibility as utterly
ludicrous. this is what we in sci.skeptic would call an
extraordinary claim and wo n't bother refuting unless someone gives
any good evidence to back it up.

d. the fire was an started accidentally by the bds. i am truely amazed that
i have heard (or read) of no one suggesting this possibility.
with all the tear gas and the lack of electical power in the compound and
the adults wearing gas masks , it had to have been chaotic inside.
i can easily image someone leaving a lamp too close to something or
accidentally dropping a lamp or knocking one over. with the winds , it
would have quickly gotten out of control.


so we are left with two reasonable possibilities. that the fire was an fbi
accident and that the fire was started by the bd. i find the latter more
likely based on the evidence i 've seen so far.

no , i think that d is also quite reasonable. i personally ca n't really
asses any relative probablities to either of these 3 probabilities although if
forced to bet on the issue , i would probably take an accident (either fbi or
bd) over intential setting of the fire).

i would also like to add a comment related to the reports that bodies recovered
had gunshot wounds. the coroner was on the today show this morning and categorically
denied that they 've reach any such conclusions. he pointed out that under intense
heat , sufficient pressure builds up in the head that can cause it to explode and
that this can look very much like a massive gunshot wound to the head which is
quite consisted with te reports i 've read and heard.

in short , there 's been almost no evidence corroborating any of the many
scenarios as to what happened on monday. we should remain skeptical until
more information is available.

of biblical passages is challenged , your only response seems
to be that one needs merely to look at the bible in order to see the truth ,
but what of those who see biblical things differently from you \? are we to
simply assume that you are the only one who really understands it \?
just curious ,

rick anderson librba@byuvm.bitnet


when robert refers to the orthodox , he is talking about the historical
position of the christian faith. such things are derived from biblcal
texts through the centuries by the apocolic fathers of the faith.

you are right that people read things differently in the bible , and this
is alright in parts like parables and such forth. however , when it comes
to the essential doctrines of the historical orthodox christan beliefs ,
there is only one correct way to read it. for example , either the
doctrine of the trinity is true , or it is false. yes , people read the
texts differently , but only one position is true. they both cannot be.
according to the text , the doctrine is true and has always existed.

therefore , when people like joseph smith come along with a vision and
thinks he can undo centuries of a doctrine that is supported by the
bible , people consider him a cult.

this is quite different from saying employing force on other people
is immoral , period. unfortunately , from time to time we are obliged
to do this immoral thing for reasons of self preservation , and so
we have to bear the moral consequences of that.

since both statements , to all intents and purposes , say effectively
the same thing ,

are you serious \? two statements , one of which says that use of force
in the given situation is moral , and the other of which says it is
not moral say effectively the same thing \?

yes , when you tag on the unfortunately , ... , then to all intents and
purposes you are saying the same thing.

then delete the unfortunately . now tell me that the two statement
say effectively the same thing.

and to save everyone a couple of trips round this loop , please notice
that we are only obliged to use force to preserve self. we can choose
not to preserve self , which is the point of pacifism.


would you say this of any two statements , one saying x is moral and
the other saying x is immoral \? how would you decided when two
statements x is moral x is immoral actually conflict , and when
they say effectively the same thing .

what they prescribe that one should do is a pretty good indicator.

and in this case they do n't prescribe the same things , so.....


and lead one to do precisely the same thing , then
either both statements are doublespeak , or none.

they might lead you to do the same thing , but the difference is what
motivates pacifism so they obviously do n't lead pacifists to to the
same thing.

that 's not true. you could formulate a pragmatic belief in minimum
force and still be a pacifist. if the minimum is 0 , great but one is
always trying to get as close to 0 force as possible under that belief.
not the same as 'force is immoral , period' , but still tending to pacifism.

if you do n't think the use of force is immoral , why minimise its use \?

bskendig@netcom.com (brian kendig) writes

and i felt torn when i began to disagree with a lot of what the bible
(and my priests) told me

did it start getting a little uncomfortable \? did your style start feeling a
bit cramped \?

yes , that 's exactly what i felt. my heart just felt that what i was
being taught was wrong a basically good message , but framed in
errors. i could not with a clear conscience accept that women were
somehow not equal to men , that homosexuals are guilty of their
lifestyle , that pride in one 's work is a bad thing , that jesus died
for me i do n't want anybody to die for me , especially as an
impersonal act where the person ca n't possibly even know me well
enough to really know if i'm worth dying for or not.

i was never able to accept the bit about jesus 's death being a good
thing. if that means that i'm just not comprehending a basic message
of christianity , then so be it. maybe i'm just not compatible with
christianity. i just refuse to follow rules blindly , and since i
ca n't even convince myself that your god even exists in the way you
describe it , i 've got to just follow my own conscience in these matters.

i know how that goes. knowing i could n't and did n't want to
live up to those impossibleand rather incovenient rules are what kept me
outside , too.

do n't think that my morals are shoddy or nonexistent just because i
do n't believe in your god. i will not steal , and i will not murder
not because i fear divine repudiation , but because these just are n't
in my character. you may think there 's nothing keeping me from just
running around on a murdering spree , stealing things when i'm able ,
insulting people for the heck of it , because i'm not answerable to
anyone but you 'd be wrong. i'm answerable to myself. a life like
that would be a cheap life i happen to want to earn respect in myself.

'till i met the man , that is.

my initial break with christianity came after a lot of soul searching
and a lot of wondering why i could no longer feel the 'presence' of
god with me. i finally decided that i had once felt this presence
just as i had felt my mighty teddy bear beside me when i was a
little tyke , protecting me from the monsters under the bed that i
had believed in god just as i had believed in the teddy bear , as
something of an emotional crutch to protect me from perceived dangers.

since then , i 've never abandoned the possibility that maybe your
supernatural trinity does exist. but there are a few times when , in
my darkened room by my bed , i have set aside everything i believe for
a moment and called out to whatever 's out there , because i want to
know the truth even if it means abandoning everything i know. and i
have not yet received an answer.

only when i truly listened to myself , body and soul , did i realize
that i could no longer honestly keep up the charade of being
christian. there is a higher truth in the universe , and christianity
just ai n't it.

any suggestions on what (or who or where) it might be , and why \?

nope. it may well be unknowable. scientists have suggested that the
universe may be finite and wrap around on itself (the three dimensional
universe may be mapped onto a four dimensional supersphere in the same
way you can map a two dimensional plane onto a three dimensional
sphere see sphereland , the sequel to flatland , for more thoughts
on this). our entire universe might just be an electron in a four
dimensional universe , which in turn may only be an insignificant speck
in a universe above that , and so on and so forth until the variables
become too much for us to even speculate on.

that is , there 's no possible way for us to know exactly how we came to
be , so there 's no reason at all to believe that your god exists nor
had anything to do with it.

ok , you may say. so now , if i'm just being good , am i doing good enough \?

that 's for you to answer. if you feel you 're doing fine , then go ahead and
ignore us foolish little christians. we can present what we 've seen and
experienced (providing our witness) , but it is n't up to us to make that seed
sprout.

christians have provided me with nothing except quotes from your holy
book , and all sorts of tactics to try to get me to believe guilt
trips , insinuations that i'm without morals , arguments from disbelief
( how can you possibly believe that god does n't exist \? ) , and so
forth. all i'm asking is for you to convince me. i want to be convinced ,
but it 's not going to be easy.

so much as you do n't like what we 're selling , there just may be someone
out there that can identify with it. methinks you could give us all a
lesson in tolerance and back off.

having had years upon years of contact with your religion from both
the inside and the outside , i view it as harmful in many ways. it
preys on people who want to find meaning in their lives , and once it 's
got these people , it teaches them to have pity (and sometimes starkly
intolerant) of others who do not share these views. maybe you 'll say
that your religion does n't teach that but i 've got to judge
christianity from the christians i know.

i feel that it is entirely possible and good to have faith in one 's
self , and to be a positive influence on society for no better reason
than that.

so i hope that my words in this newsgroup will at least make some
people think. i want christians to realize that there are perfectly
valid lifestyles and opinions that have nothing to do with their deity
whatsoever , and i want people who are considering christianity to
realize that christianity does not hold the sole key to a happy ,
fulfilled life.

i have known some very nice christians who have done some very nice
things. i think what sets these people apart from the general masses
is that they recognize that their religious beliefs may be wrong , and
they know the weaknesses of their religion , yet they still decide to
believe , but they keep their beliefs to themselves and do not think
any less of people who do n't agree with them.

obviously , the debate on the veracity and reliability of the source of the
christian 's faith is far from conclusive , notwithstanding how vehemently we
propose otherwise.

precisely my point. you 've still not given me a reason to be a
christian instead of a buddhist or a moslem...

the nice thing about religion , if you lose yourself deeply enough in
it , is that eventually you 'll be able to feel justified in most
anything you want to do.

y'know your right. fortunately for everyone around me , i'm not religious.
i'm a christian.

... just as the moslems are n't religious , and the buddhists are n't
religious. who is religious , then \?

these are two conflicting statements. to say one is a clarification of the
other is a breach of logic. i do n't mind people shifting their position on
an issue. it irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change
was made. what about deuteronomy 22 20 25 \? is it wrong now \? did jesus
change that \?

if anything , he clarified the law such as in that quote you made. in the
following verses , jesus takes several portions of the law and expounds upon
the law giving clearer meaning to what god intended.

sure he does this. however , he does n't address the notion of stoning
non virgin brides , because this needs no clarification. are you going to
deny that deuteronomy 22 20 25 is not patently clear in its intent \?


i see what you are getting at (or at least i think i do). correct me if
i am mistaken , but i think you are asking me if i still believe that we
should uphold all of the laws pertaining to capital punishment for such
things as adultery , rape and other heinous crimes. as you may recall ,
jesus was confronted by this same question in regards to the adultress
who was caught in the act and brought before jesus. and his reply , let
he who is without sin cast the first stone. jesus does not deny the
sentence that is to due for this violation of the law. what do you think
of this \?


i think you will agree with me that there are in today 's world , a lot of
modern day pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it. what good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart \?

i 'll agree that there is a lot of modern day pharisees that know the bible
from end to end and do n't believe in it. depending on how they use this
knowledge , they can be scary. they can argue any position they desire , and
back it up with selected parts of the bible. such pharisees include david
koresh and adolph hitler. i will qualify this by saying i do n't know if
they actually believed what they were preaching , but the ends certainly
made the means look frightening.


agreed. )

however , just as scary are those that do n't know much of the bible , but
believe every word. in fact , this is probably scarier , since there are far
more of these people , from what i 've seen. in addition , they are very easy
to manipulate by the aforementioned pharisees , since they do n't know enough
to debate with these people.


agreed also. if one is to use the bible as a reference , one must always be
open to different interpretations. as a christian , i have the spirit of god
to verify what i believe in the word. if what the spirit tells me is not
backed up in scripture then the spirit i am communicating with is not of
god. after all , jesus tells us to test the spirits to know for sure that
it is from god.


christianity is not just a set of rules it 's a lifestyle that changes one 's
perspectives and personal conduct. and it demands obedience to god 's will.

no , it demands obedience to a book. if god came down and personally told
me how i should behave , then i would say that i would be doing god 's will
by doing it. however , if preachers , pastors , and evangelists tell me to
obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to
two millenia (even longer for the ot) , even if i follow everything in it
with my heart , i could scarcely be honest with myself by saying i'm doing
the will of god.


i obey what the spirit of god tells me to do. the spirit will not violate
anything that is written in the bible because that is the word of god. i do
not worship pastors , preachers , my wife , my mother or my father. what they
tell me does not carry the weight of what god tells me to do and his commands
are rienforced in the bible.

some people can live by it , but many others cannot or will not. that is
their choice and i have to respect it because god respects it too.

well , if god respects it so much , how come there is talk in the bible about
eternal damnation for non believers \? i see little respect eminating from
the god of the bible. i see a selfish and spiteful god.


eternal damnation is the consequence of the choice one makes in rejecting
god. if you choose to jump off a cliff , you can hardly blame god for you
going splat at the bottom. he knows that if you choose to jump , that
you will die but he will not prevent you from making that choice. in fact ,
he sent his son to stand on the edge of the cliff and tell everyone of what
lies below. to prove that point , jesus took that plunge himself but he being
god was able to rise up again. i have seen the example of christ and have
chosen not to jump and i'm trying to tell you not to jump or else you 'll
go splat .

you do n't have to listen to me and i wo n't stop you if you decide to jump.
i only ask that you check it out before taking the plunge. you owe it to
yourself. i do n't like seeing anyone go splat .

god be with you ,

i do n't think anyone really cares about the solid structure of his
sermon. it 's the deaths he 's responsible for that concern most people.

i assume you have evidence that he was responsible for the deaths \?

koresh was a nut , okay \?

again , i 'd like to see some evidence.

nut or not , he was clearly a liar. he said he would surrender after
local radio stations broadcast his message , but he did n't. then he
said he would surrender after passover , but he did n't.

the rest of the story seems to be that the agreement for the broadcast
was for prime time , and that koresh never even heard it played. was n't
even tuned in to the radio when it aired so no reason to come out.

if later they had given him a copy of the grossly twisted newswire
transcript i'm certain koresh would think he was at the mercy of
evil itself.

as to coming out after passover , was n't that just one of the lawyer 's

are you truly the master of yourself \?

brian kendig states

not yet . . .

make up your mind.

. . . but my life is the ground i use to practice on. the fun is
in the getting there ! we do n't start out perfect . . . .

and we do not end perfect either. we are never perfect. can you name
one person , young or old , past or present , that you deem perfect \?
good luck.

i know my shortcomings , and i know my strengths , and i live
my life according to the decisions i make , and i am content to abide
with the consequences of my decisions as easily as i 'll accept the
praise for them. there have been times in my life when i 've made
mistakes , yes i try to never make the same mistake twice.

then you lie to yourself. you do not know your shortcomings. i have clearly
shown one of your shortcomings , if not two. that is , ignorance of the bible
and the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its
contents.

i regard christ as a myth.

because you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.
and to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion , i bet you do not
even know what the word christ means. or which prophet used christ to
describe the son of man .

i feel that there are far too many people
offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
did. the only person who can really judge me is me .

yes. i agree with that. so we must learn first. read the bible. come
up with our own interpretation. evaluate what is being said
and by whom. check the history books as well. compare someone else 's
interpretation with your own. then make a judgment. but i tell you the
truth , 99 of what is being said in the bible needs interpretation as
much as a coffee cup needs interpretation.

and remember , the bible is n't a guru 's esoteric guide to metaphysics.
it does n't take a theologian to understand what is being said. the
bible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and i addressed
to people like you and i. these guys wrote down what they saw and heard. is it
their open diary and they want to tell you something. and because they
want you to know something , they make it very clear what they want you to
know. they did n't encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric , but in simple
straight forward language.

i choose the
roads i travel , and i decide whether or not i want to reach the end of
any given road or turn back and as long as i do n't always turn
back , there 's no shame in it. when i need help , i seek out my friends.

you have chosen the road that avoids the bible. you have chosen the
road that avoids a confrontation with the living god because that
road does n't look appealing to you. you rather build your own road. one
that goes far away from that confrontation. but be assured of this ,
you will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly.

and you do n't have a clue about what i'm saying , either. open your
eyes and see open your ears and listen. i'm not just spouting off
empty words. this is my life , this is what gives me meaning.

i see what you mean. i hear what your saying. i am not degrading your
life. but i have heard the same irrational excuses for years. there is nothing
new in what you are saying. and by your own words , you are spouting off
contradictions. if contradictions give you meaning , then your life must
be sad.

i say my mother loves me. how do i know , you ask \? i can point to
definite things she 's done for me , and i can even just bring her to
you so you can ask her , face to face.
you say your deity loves you. how do you know , i ask \?

bingo. for god so loved the world , he gave his only begotton to son
so that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life. i look
what god did . he has given his son , even to his death , so that i can have
hope in his resurrection and know that life is n't for nothing , but has
glorious purpose.

you ca n't even convince me that it exists !

because you turn your eyes away from testimony and history. you choose to
lie to yourself that he does n't exist , for you ignore what has been said for
thousands of years. you sound exactly , almost verbatim , like the lazarus of
jesus 's story starting in luke 16 19. and the conclusion of that story is a
bleak one. lazarus wound up in hell. the story ends like this

for if lazarus does n't even listen to moses and the prophets ,
he wo n't even believe if a man rose from the dead.

if any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot , promising untold
pleasures to me if i 'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
rationality for just this once , then i would choose 'hell'. i can
not lie to myself to placate another being , no matter how powerful
it is.

arrogance at its best. the fact is , you are not rational. several specific
cases have already been cited. and again with this new statement , you show more irrationality with regards to heaven. jesus does tell you something of what to expect
in heaven. jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him. jesus does
not expect you to placate either. jesus wants you to willingly come to him , but not
as his grovelling slave , but rather as his brother who will share in his
glorious riches. why do you not pick up the bible and read it for yourself.
you maintain you have an open mind. see whether you are lying to yourself for
yourself.

why would you want to live a good life \?
to you , you die and that 's it. do n't contradict yourself. you have
no reason to live a good life. it does n't do you any good in the
end. your life does n't do anybody else any good either because
everyone dies anyway. so you have no reason to lead a good life. leading
a good life is meaningless. why do you do such a meaningless thing \?

that paragraph demonstrates that you have n't listened to a single word
i 've said.

i do understand what you said. but that 's is not what i feel went amiss here.

you missed the point. living a good life has no eternal consequences.
once they close the amusement park of life , to you that is the end. to you , it
is over. to you , therefore , your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless.
it has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth.

but then you contradict yourself. from a previous post , you said doing evil things
is bad. to you , it should n't matter if you do evil things or good things. it is
all meaningless in the end anyway. so go rob a bank. go tell someone
you dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag. what 's restraining you \?
life after all , has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.

in the same way , i think life is fun. and i do n't intend to leave the
amusement park of life until they close down for the night ! d

at which time , you are truly not the master of yourself.

i'm sorry , i do n't feel that sacrificing jesus was something any god
i 'd worship would do , unless the sacrifice was only temporary , in
which case it 's not really all that important.

has the resurrection sunk in \? jesus is alive. jesus is not dead.

so you (and your holy book) say. by the same token , therefore , santa
claus delivers toys every xmas. do n't you see \? i have no reason to
believe that what you say is true. please give me some reason that i
ca n't similarly apply to santa claus.

you have every reason to believe that what jesus says and the witnesses
of jesus say are true. but you choose to be unreasonable and ignore the
reasons. by definition , ignorance .

santa claus is said to live at the north pole and have a squad of elves
and flying reindeer. ever see a flying reindeer \? has anyone in human
history seen a flying reindeer \? has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose
blinks red \?

on the other hand , are people born in bethlehem \? was nebuchandezzar really
a king \? was daniel really one of his court officials \? were david and solomon
really kings of israel and judah \? was their really a king called jehoachin \?
did sennecherib really attack jerusalem 600 years before christ \? did
sennacherib really lose his battle and badly \? was there really a
caiaphas who interrogated jesus \? yes , yes , yes . . . history verifies
it. it is nonfiction.

do you have a problem discerning truth from fiction \? perhaps you
ca n't evaluate the context of grimm 's fairy tales apart from
that of the scientific american. i suppose you treat both with equal
truthfulness or equal falsity. is this what you are telling me \? or
is it that just do want to read the scientific american and find out
that it 's not a fairy tale \?

are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book , and cannot be supported without
invoking them \?

get real. have you ever been to zaire \? do you have to go there
to be assured that there really is such a place \? given your
irrationality , i take it you have never used a map in your life.

why do you believe what you believe \?

given the overwhelming evidence as well as my personal experience with the living
god , i 'd be an irrational unreasoning ignorant fool if i did n't follow jesus.
