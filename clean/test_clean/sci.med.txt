hi all , i got several emails and a couple news replies and i guess i
shoulda went into more detail... being my anxiety level is peaking and you
folks have no clue who i am i may as well post the specifics and see what
you people think regarding my previous post.
to recap i applied to 20 schools total , 16 of which were md and 4 do.

as it stands now i have had 13 rejects , 4 interviews( 2 md and 2 do) , the
results of which are 2 waiting lists (1 md and one do)

3 schools i heard nothing from at all.

i have contacted all institutions other than the rejects and they have no
info whatsoever to tell me.

i have taken a good mix to apply to.. 2 3 top schools a bunch of middles
and a few safety (funny that most of my safety schools were the first
to reject me)

my index is at like a 3.5 mcats were r7 p9 b10 wq and r7 p9 b11 wr
i couldnt get the damn reading score up... i never stuff like art
history , politics etc

ive done medical research at the undergrad level , done clinical lab work
for years now , but unfortunately i have no patient contact experience.

i cant think of what else i left out... but thats the summary. what
percent of people are usually called from the waiting lists on an average \?
i felt that my interviews went quite well yet i dont have a firm
acceptance in my hand... anyone have any suggestions as to calm the
mailbox anxiety \?

if you premeds out there or med students have any questions or comments
for me feel free to send them down... typing is a form of anti anxiety

in article 10557@blue.cis.pitt.edu doyle @pitt.edu (howard r doyle) writes
being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
persistent anything. persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical ,
biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic
persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular
carcinoma.

most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (cph) are probably the result of
a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
determined. the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy. it
consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting
plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. but in contrast
to chronic active hepatitis (cah) there is no periportal inflammation ,
bridging necrosis , or fibrosis.

cph has , indeed , an excellent prognosis. if i had to choose between cah and
cph there is no question i would also choose cph. however , as david pointed
out , the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
it. the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal , with biopsies showing
areas compatible with both cph and cah. maybe it is a sampling problem. maybe
it is a continuum. i do n't know.

darn. just when i think i understand something someone who knows the
pathology has to burst my bubble ( we 'd better not start talking about
glomerular diseases , then i 'll really get depressed.

seriously though , i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting a
biopsy in the first place \? my understanding (and feel free to correct me)
is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated , with overall normal
hepatic function. i would think that the only clue might be a history of
prior hepb infection and a positive hepb sag. or is it indeed on a
continuum with cah , and the distinction merely one of pathology and
prognosis , but otherwise identical clinical features \?

earth to sci.med....if it looks like a duck...and quacks like a duck......

this is a total scam. since the beginning of chiropraxis , the chiropractor has
tried to sell the subluxation as the problem and then sell themselves and
their adjustments as the solution. the chiropractic subluxation is a delusional
diagnosis and the adjustments of subluxations by extension constitute a
delusional medicine.

the wide spectrum of chiropractic techniques all have their own methods for
detecting spinal demons and unique methodolgies for excorcizing them. the
computer approach is an attempt to 'sell with science' but this device is
nothing more than a 'high tech' subluxation detector.....and in the end...

chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver
biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months
after a bout of acute viral hepatitis , or when someone is found to have
persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. the degree of
elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial , or as much as ten times
normal. other blood chemistries are usually normal.
as a rule , patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease.
chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic , at
least initially , and that 's why it 's important to tell them apart by means of
a biopsy. the patient with cph only needs to be reassured. the patient with
cah needs to be treated.

the prozac gave very bad anxiety jitters and insomina , it was impossible to

i tried prozac a few months ago , and had some insomnia from it , but no
anxiety or jitters. i probably could have lived with the insomnia if the
prozac had done any good , but it only provided a tiny benefit. maybe
because the person who prescribed it did n't know much and gave up after a
20mg dose did n't work.

now i'm seeing a psychiatrist who has put me on zoloft (another serotonin
reuptake inhibitor like prozac). one pill day (50mg) seemed to help some.
now i'm trying 100mg day. zoloft has fewer and milder side effects than
prozac. i think my doctor said that only 4 of the people taking zoloft
have to discontinue it because of side effects. the only problem i'm
having is some minor gi distress , but nothing too annoying. hopefully the
zoloft will work. maybe your friend should try this one next.

my psychiatrist 's strategy seems to be to first try one of the serotonin
drugs , usually prozac. if that works , great. if it works but has too many
side effects , try zoloft or maybe paxil. if the serotonin drugs do n't work
at all , try one of the tricyclics like desipramine.

...suggestions as to the next step \?

having a doctor who knows something about antidepressants can make a big
difference. my psychiatrist claims that most gps and fps do n't have much
experience in this area , and from what i 've seen i'm inclined to believe
him. i think i know more about antidepressants than the people at my

for his next experiment , he cut the leaf in half , put one half down

the disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis. it is a protozoan that
lives and multiplies within cells. in cats , the protozoan multiplies in the
intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat 's feces. the protozoa can
cross the placenta to infect the fetus. the disease may be asymptomatic
after the baby is born , or it may be very severe. toxo may cause blindness
and mental retardation.

having a cat in the same apartment should not be a problem however , pregnant
women should not scoop or change the cat 's litterbox. in addition , whoever
does empty the litterbox should thoroughly wash his her hands before handling
anything else , especially food.

do i assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy
of cancer \? i was just wondeing , since you mentioned thhat she has an
oncologist.

a bone scan is a nuclear scan. thperson receivving the scan is gven a
dose of a radioactive tracer , and an imaging device is used to track the
distribution of the tracer wwithin the body. the tracer is usually given
intravenously. (iv) this means that the physician or his assistant will
insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein.

after a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the
body , the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high
concentrations of the tracer. the radiologist or doctor is looking for
areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it.

as far as pain , the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required
to start the iv line.

what the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may
have resulted from cancer. this is also why i was wondering if your mother
has had cancer , since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the
skeletal system.

i hope i have answered some of your questions. feel free to e mail me if
you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related
to your mother 's care. i'm a newly graduated nurse , and i enjoy sharing
information with other people to help them understand things that they did
not know about before.

i 've sent gordon r. my posts on protein , vitamin c and vitamin a prior to
posting on internet as a professional courtesy. somehow i 've managed to
delete my vitamin a post from my text file. gordon r. had promised to send
it back to me but he 's pretty mad at me right now so i 'll just retype it.
since digging through all my references is very time consuming(took me all
day for that pms post) , i'm not going to cite any references(gordon r. has
them). i'm going to include some of the material from weinsier and
morgan 's new nutrition textbook(which was not in my original material) to
point out that what i'm going to say has some support in the medical
community.

diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very , very long
time. protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i 've
already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection.
now i'm going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in
the u.s. as far as infection is concerned(vitamin a).

when vitamin a was originally discovered , it was commonly referred to as
the anti infection vitamin. many people(linus pauling being one) have
decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c
(which i 've already covered). big mistake(in my opinion). vitamin a is
also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin(with good reason).
the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if
vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well. it 's role in
both cancer and infection is almost identical(but not quite).

vitamin a comes in two completely different forms(retinol and
beta carotene). retinol is the animal form and it 's toxic , beta carotene
is the plant form and it 's completely nontoxic. both retinol and beta
carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present
(60 80 ). the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other
tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein(rbp). a normal human
adult liver should have 500 , 000iu to 1 , 000 , 000iu of retinol stored. we
are born with 10 , 000iu in our liver. u.s. autopsy has shown that about
30 of americans die with the same(or less) amount of vitamin a as they
were born with. if you do n't believe that nutritional reserves(like that
of retinol in the liver) are important , then this low vitamin a reserve is
not going to affect you. but if you believe(like i do) that the nutrient
reserves are important , then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u.s.

the u.s. rda for vitamin a in an adult male is 1 , 000 re or 5 , 000iu of
vitamin a. for adult feamles its 800 re or 4 , 000iu of vitamin a. diet
surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a
(either retinol or beta carotene) from their diet. but the nrc(national
research council) was going to release a new rda table in 1985 that had the
rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised(c to 90mg per day and a to
7 , 500iu per day for adult males). that report and it 's recommendations was
killed. why \? concern over the increasing supplementation was the main
reason. rdas are set to prevent clinical disease , not to keep nutrient
reserves full. many scientist in the u.s. feel that the time has come to
move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move
towards the promotion of optimum health concept , especially since we have
some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely
important during periods of stress. the nutritonal concervatives won that
battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the
1989 rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the
dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the
1940 's(get enough to prevent clinical pathology , but not enough to fill
the reserves).

we know from autopsy that only about 10 of americans have a liver with a
normal vitamin a reserve(500 , 000iu to 1 , 000 , 000iu). i preach nutrient
reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients.
but for vitamin a , only a liver biopsy(or autopsy data) will tell you how
much somebody has stored. we can tell very easily if someone has
overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol
level(levels above 450ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your
liver with vitamin a and it 's time to stop taking retinol). the normal
range of serum retinol will be 20 100ug dl. hypervitaminosis a is
diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2 , 000ug dl or higher(interpretation
of diagnostic test , wallach , m.d. , a little brown series book). this level
of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to
vitamin a toxicity. weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative
approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach , as you will see later in
this post. between 450ug dl and 2 , 000ug dl you should have plenty
of warning that it 's time to eliminate the retinol from your diet(headache ,
redness of the skin , hair loss , joint pain).

i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they
had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear
signs that the liver is full. you will never really know if the patient
needs the vitamin a(because you can not measure the pool in liver) but you
will always know when it 's time to stop(just like in those vitamin a for
pms studies).

beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will
never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to
retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down(stops in the
liver and slows down in the gut) when your liver is full of retinol. but
taking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to
fill the liver up(i 've seen estimates of 20 30 years) if you are in the 30
that only has as much as you were born with in your liver(10 , 000iu). one
other problem with beta carotene , if you have a zinc deficit , you will not
convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the
enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc. in addition , the release of
retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will
cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a.

now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection \? the body
uses vitamin a(retinol) for many different things. vision(the first to be
nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology) uses the aldehyde
(retinal) and alcohol(retinol) form of vitamin a. reproduction uses the
retinol form and some retinal. infection and cancer protection uses
retinoic acid. how do you convert retinol(which your white blood cells
and the mucosal cells get from blood) to retinoic acid \? you use enzymes ,
one of which requires vitamin c(this is why pauling has tried to pull the
title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a). vitamin c does play
a role in infection(interferon production for example) but it 's biggest role
is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid. if you increase your intake
of vitamin c , you will increase your formation of retinoic acid. but
retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol(as retinal can) and once
it 's formed , it 's used and then lost to the body. this is why the 1985 nrc
group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda 's.

most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are
helping themselves. if they do n't have much vitamin a in their liver and
they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a , they actually do
themselves more harm than good.

retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation.
in the mucus membrane , it is the main factor in promoting good mucus
production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from
entering the blood system. the mucus membrane is referred to as the first
line defense against infection. for cancer , retinoic acid has been shown
to act as a cell brake(it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which
stimulate cells to divide). cancer has two distinct steps , dna alteration
and cell promotion. for cells that normally divide all the time , promoters
are not that important. but for lung and breast tissue which does not
normally divide , promoters are real important in the malignant process.
this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials
in progress using retinol and or beta carotene.

chronic infection(irritation) of the mucus membranes is a signal that
vitamin a may not be adequate. i tell my students that any patient who
walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be
worked up for vitamin a(along with the other factors that medicine already
has on it 's list of causes for chronic infection). i drive this home in my
course at the osteopathic college in tulsa , when i teach at the allopathic
medical school in tulsa(ou 's branch campus) and when i give cme lectures.

dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night
vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50 , 000iu of retinol. the
serum level of retinol can also be used , but it does not drop until liver
reserves drop below 10 , 000 to 20 , 000iu. asking a patient if they have
trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen(if cataracts are ruled
out). in one study done on u.s. spanish americans where serum retinol levels
were measured , 25 of the sample population had a serum retinol level below
20ug dl.

as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of
the u.s. that have had a history of high infection rates , we will probably
see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low
serum retinol levels.

what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a \? here are excerpts
from their book

vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol , it is necessay for
growth and differentation of epithelial tissue , and is required for
reproduction , embryonic development , and bone growth. protein calorie
malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption , transport , and
metabolism of vitamin a. retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid ,
which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not
in reproduction or vision. the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a
status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum. the normal
range for vitamin a content for a child is 20 to 90ug dl. lower values are
indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores. serum levels greater
than 100ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a. dark adaptation
tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to
perform on young children. rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to
vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state. the
bronchorespiratory tract , skin , genitourinary system , gastrointestinal
tract and sweat glands are adversely affected. a daily intake of more than
7.5mg(about 37 , 000iu) of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts
over 20mg(100 , 000iu) can result in a dry and itching skin , desquamation ,
erythematous dermatitis , hair loss , joint pain , chapped lips , hyperostois
(bony depositis) , headaches , anorexia , edema and fatigue.

they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a
deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults. their toxic serum retinol
level is very conservative. i recommend that my students try 25 , 000iu in
adults that are having problems with chronic infection. they have to rule
out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run(or if their clinical
lab ca n't run it , i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest , give
them the zinc along with the vitamin a. at 25 , 000iu per day , toxicity
should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the
patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol.

both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a.
recall that the pms papers were using 100 , 000iu to 200 , 000iu of vitamin a.
i do n't suggest that my students use these high doses. if you wanted to
fill the liver up fast(as part of a clinical trial) and were monitoring the
serum retinol level , then you would be okay. but my knowledge of the
vitamin a literature suggests to me that 25 , 000iu for patients with a
demonstrated vitamin a deficit(dark adapatation test or serum retinol) will
provide a good and steady improvement(as long as zinc and vitamin c status
are good) without having to worry about toxicity. if they want to get more
agressive , fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol. but
vitamin a(retinol) should never be given in high dose to women who could
become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human
fetus. the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is
18 , 000iu of retinol per day. beta carotene will never have this effect on
the human fetus.

could just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help \? yes
but the effect will take a long time to develop. my advise is to use
retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it
full. vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to
prescription by doctors. but when we have the m.d. 's in this newsgroup
jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a
supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress , i
think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market
but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general
public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation.

subject resound hearing aid theory as i understand it
organization university of oregon
lines 41
distribution world
nntp posting host rhaller.cc.uoregon.edu

the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in
hearing instruments. i would appreciate any comments about this and other
'new' technology for hearing aids.

the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at t and
appears to take a different approach from other aids. it appears to me that
a new 'programmable' aid like the widex just uses a more flexible (and
programmable) version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of
the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help
out in 'noisy' situations.

the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the
spectrum into low and high frequencies (splitting point is programmable) ,
apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in
the low frequencies , while the important consonant information
(unfortunately for me) is in the high frequencies. the two bands then are
treated with different compression schemes which are programable. they have
also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call
'abnormal growth of loudness'.

this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience , though i
think the phrase is missleading. what appears to be the case is that as you
exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss , the deficit
becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach
the 'too loud' point the sensitivity curves appear to converge. this means
that if you just boost all sound levels , you are overloading at the high
end for people with hearing losses. hence what you want is progressively
less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point.
you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially
differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum (specially
for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls
off a cliff).

aids with simple compressors do n't descriminate between energy in the low
and high frequencies and can therefor 'compress' useful high frequency
information because of high volume of low frequency components.
particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech
and in simulated restaurant noise situations.

any opinions on burzynski 's antineoplastons or information about the current
status of his research would be appreciated.

burzynski 's work is not too promising. none of his a 1 through a 5
antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against
experimental cancer. the nci conducted tests of a 2 and a 5 against
leukemia in mice , with the result that doses high enough to produce
toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth
of the tumor or killing it. (these were in 1983 and 1985)

burzynski claims that a 10 is the active factor common to all of a 1
and a 5 (something which he has not shown , a 10 has only been
extracted from a 2. he also has n't shown that a 1 through a 5 are actually
distinct substances). the nci conducted a series of tests using a 10
against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines
from tumors in the following classes leukemia , non small cell and
small cell lung cancer , colon cancer , cancer of the central nervous
system , melanoma , ovarian cancer and renal cancer. a 10 exhibited
neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested.

it is necessary to process a 10 since it is not soluble (burzynski 's
theory requires soluble agents) , but this basically hydrolizes it to
pag (which he calls as 2.5). pag is not an information carrying
peptide , something which byrzynski claims is necessary for
antineoplastic activity. as 2.1 (also derived from a 10) is a 4 1
mixture of pa and pag. pa (also not a peptide) can be purchased at a
chemical supply houses for about 0.09 a gram. a 10 is chemically
extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide , both of which are
habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy. the nasty effects
of thalidomide are widely known. in spite of this similarity , a 10
does not appear to have been tested for it 's potential to induce
teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy.

many of burzynski 's statements about the origin of his theory , early
research , past and present support by others for his work have been
shown to be untrue.

assuming that the wax is causing hearing loss , congestion or popping

may even make things worse. (my wife would disagree , she does it
successfully every six months or so.) in any case do not attempt
anything with q tips ! ! !

i 'll agree with your wife. while i was a student , i had doctors remove
rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple
times , usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason , and
said something like gee , you 've got a lot of wax in there . in my case ,
removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing , and
i 've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with
warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months. you can buy little
bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store
i do n't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.

one question i do have a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water said he told swimmers to do this after swimming , too. it
works , but it stings like the devil , so i 've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get

allergy medicine , huh \? is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or

then fine , otherwise you just suffer. one doctor did prescribe me imigran (costs

up for four solid days and could n't even drink water but i got taken off it
again when i moved and had to change doctors. reasoning they did not know what
the side effects were because it was new. ok , fine but it has passed the
safety tests to get on the prescription list , and anyway i was prepared to take
the risk to have quality of life now. the only alternatives i have is to get it
prescribed privately , which i cannot afford , or to pay a private allergy
specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid. i am fairly certain i am
allergic to more than one chemical additive , as a lot of things i ca n't eat have
nothing in common except things i know are safe , so testing myself is n't really
an option there are too many permutations.

hi.

my wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp \? ) deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep , coldness and proneness
to gaining weight. she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary ( \? )
tests and her values were regarded as low. the doctor (and my wife) are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the
gland , giving life long dependency to the drug (hormone \? ).

...
my questions are has anyone had heard of success in using this approach \?
her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking , any comment on the
probability of improvement \? although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally' , my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illness condition , may this
affect the treatment , development \?


there are several different types of thyroid diseases which would cause
a hypothyroid condition (reduction in the output of the thyroid , mainly
thyroxin). except for ones caused by infections , the treatment is
generally thyroxin pills. hypothyroid conditions caused by infections
usually disappear when the infection does...this does n't sound like the
case with your wife.
thyroxin orally does shut down the thyroid through a feedback loop
involving the pituitary (i believe). the pituitary thinks that the
correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it does n't have to
tell the thyroid to produce more. this process is reversable ! i have
hashimoto 's thyroiditis (an autoimmune condition) and was on thyroxin
for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested i not take the pills
for 6 wks. when i was retested for thyroxin levels , they were normal.
i still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear.
the pills are safe and have very few side affects ( those mostly at
beginning of treatment). having a baby might be a problem and would at
least require closer monitoring of hormone levels.
thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness , coldness ,
and weight gain. there is also water retention (possibly around heart) ,
changes in vision , and coarser hair and skin among other things.

i am not a doctor , so i'm sure i mistated something , but the important
thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they
are n't corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body. get a
second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him her explain
things in detail to you and your wife.

hi ,
i'm an avid dieter and the new miracle drug seems to involve thermo
genics. the drug is claimed to stimulate the brown fat to burn food
creating eat as opposed to the fat being stored. there are all sorts of
warnings about fevers , elevated blood pressure and heart rate , ect..
the silver lining is that apparently some weight loss does not
require a change in diet. is this possible \? are the pills dangerous or just

that unless a person is willing to drop down and masturbate whenever the

with tv programs about boobs (seinfeld) and masturbation (again seinfeld)
and with condoms being handed out in high schools and with the teenage

not assume that we american 's are frightened of sex. rather we are a bit

last year , i was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an
inguinal hernia. i could n't remember doing anything that would have
caused it. that is , i had n't been lifting more than other people do ,
and in fact probably somewhat less. eventually the thing became more
painful and i had the repair operation.

this year i developed a pain on the other side. this turned out to be
another inguinal hernia. so i go back to the hospital monday for
another fun 8 ) operation.

i do n't know of anything i'm doing to cause this to happen. i'm 38
years old and i do n't think i'm old enough for things to start falling
apart like this. the surgeon who is doing the operation seems to
suspect a congenital weakness , but if so , why did it suddenly appear
when i was 37 and not really as active as i was when i was younger \?

does anyone know how to prevent a hernia , other than not lifting
anything \? it 's rare that i lift more than my 16 month old or a sack
full of groceries , and you may have noticed that your typical grocery
sack is fairly small these days. is there some sort of exercise that
will reduce the risk \?

our 20 month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care. he was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once. now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month. most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well , with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4. i know kids in day care fall sick more often , but we
are beginning to wonder how often more often really is , whether our
son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average , what the
longer term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are ,
and what we can do to build up his resistance. he really enjoys his day
care and we think it 's great too , but we are beginning to wonder whether
we should think about getting a nanny.

are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions \?

how often do kids in their first , second and third years fall sick \?
how often do they get colds , flus , ear infections \? is there any data on
home care vs. day care \?

does being sick build immunity (leading to less illness later) ,
does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) , or does it
not have any long term effect \?

does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects \?

how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal , and what does one do about it \?

is there any way to build immunity and resistance \?

any data , information or advice relating to this would be much

as for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons , the fact that the nih did n't

tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after

is there any relation between thyroid deficiency and depression \?

perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic
depression , or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get
depressed , but i know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the
thyroid that would cause depression. note that weight gain is usually
a symptom of both. simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid
condition is present.

i do n't know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output ,
but i would tend to doubt it. as far as i know clinical depression is
caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain , and that chemical
imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body. a regular
everyday depression imho should not cause a chemical imbalance in the
body at all.

the pituitary bases its secretions of thyroid stimulating hormone (tsh)
on the level of circulating thyroxin (there are two types t3 and t4
one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other active form in
the liver). the ratio of t3 t4 can be affected by a number of other
hormones (estrogen , for example). naturally , changing activity of the
body 's cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin , but
the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in
short order.

good sources for info on the thyroid are the merk manual (a physician 's
reference book ) although reading it is enough to get one depressed )
and the encyclopedia brittanica (should be available in your local
library).

i hope this has been of some help.

for a very long time i 've had a problem with feeling really awful
when i try to get up in the morning. my sleep latency at night is also
pretty long , ranging from 30 min to an hour. i get about 7 hours of
bedtime (maybe 6 of actual sleep) a night and more on the weekends. i
will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if i can , because
i feel so tired when i wake up , even more tired than i was when i
went to bed , which is usually too tired to work.

anyway , i recently had a really bad flu , so i called a friend to
get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant
but he got vicks formula 44m which has everything but an expectorant. so
i used that anyway , and the three nights i used it , i fell asleep rapidly
and felt that i got really good quality sleep that is , i actually
felt refreshed the next morning.

so , i am now trying to look into , both in the literature and
experimentally , the use of antihistamines as sleep aids , since i am
presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect. the
antihistamine in vicks formula 44 is chloriphenamine maleate , so i bought
some generic tablets of that , and tried one last night and did n't
notice any improvement. i might try one with a little alcohol (about
1 beer) to see if it is a synergism effect. also , library research
seems to show that benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest
sedative effect of what is availible otc. so i might also buy a generic
form of that and try that the pdr seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good
dosage level to try.

for other medical information , i have allergies but rarely have
an allergic reaction living in new mexico. i also have chronically dry
eyes , which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants. i did
guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia , so i made some
changes in my diet consistent with that , and it did n't help , so i
went back to a normal diet (pretty diverse , also taking vitamin supplements)

anyway , i am looking for advice for the use of
antihistamines as sleep aids , and if there are any dangers of such use
(seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
millions). i do n't want to try bzs , because bz addiction seems to be
a serious threat , and from what i hear , bz sleep quality is not good ,
whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me. i have
tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff , and that also seems to
lower sleep quality , i seem to wake up around 4 00 or so and be in some
kind of mental haze until 7 00 or 8 00. also , i would be interested in
any other advice for helping my problem. (although i 've already tried
many of the non pharmacological solutions)

hi all ,

would anyone out there in 'net land' happen to have an
authentic , sure fire way of making this great sauce that
is used to adorn gyro 's and souvlaki \?

thanks ,

i have a receipe at home that was posted to me by one of our fellow
netters about a month ago. i am recalling this from memory but
i think i'm fairly close (by the way it was great ! )

1 pint of plain yogurt
1 2 med. sized cucumber finely shredded
3 cloves of garlic (more or less by taste)
1 4 tsp dill weed

the yogurt is dumped into a strainer lined with a coffee
filter and allowed to drain at least 2 hours (you can
adjust the consistancy of the sauce by increasing this time
up to 24 hours)

the shredded cuc is drained the same way

mix it all together and let it steep for at least
2 hours (it 's better the next day) and enjoy !

last week i went to see a gastroenterologist. i had never met this
doctor before , and she did not know what i was there for. as soon as i
arrived , somebody showed me to an examining room and handed me a gown.
they told me to undress (from the waist down , to be exact) and wait for the
doctor. is this the usual drill when you go to a doctor for the first
time \? i do n't have much experience going to doctors (knock on wood) , but
on the couple of occasions when i 've gone to a new doctor , i met him
with my clothes on. first , he introduced himself , asked what i was there
for and took a history , all before i undressed.

are patients usually expected to get naked before meeting a doctor
for the first time \? personally , i 'd prefer to meet the doctor on
something remotely resembling a condition of parity and to establish an
identity as a person who wears clothes before dropping my drawers. if
nothing else , it minimizes the time that i have to spend in the self
conscious , ill at ease and vulnerable condition of a person with a bare
bottom talking to somebody who is fully clothed.

does anybody besides me regard this get naked first and then we can talk
attitude as insensitive \? also , is it unusual \?

recently i 've come upon a body of literature which promotes colon
cleansing as a vital aid to preventive medicine through nutrition. in
particular , dr. bernard jenssen in his book colon cleansing for
health and longevity the title actually escapes me , but it is very
similar to that claims that regular self administered colonics ,
along with certain orally ingested debris loosening agents , boosts
the immune system to a significant degree.

he also plugs a unique appliance called the colema board , which
facilitates the self administration of colonics. it sells for over
100 from a california based company. he also plugs vitra tox
products as his chemical agents of choice these include volcanic ash ,
supposedly for its electrical charge , and psyllium powder , for its
bulkiness.

if anyone knows anything about colon cleansing theory , its
particulars , or the colema board and related products , i 'd be very
interested to hear about research and personal experience.

this article is crossposted to alt.magick as the issue touches upon
fasting and cleansing through a ritual system of purification.

looking in the evolution of anaesthesia by m.h. armstrong davison
(pub williams wilkins , baltimore 1965) i found the following
chronology

1853. charles gabriel pravaz (1791 1853) , inventor of the
galvanocautery , describes a glass syringe with tapered nozzle. this
syringe was intended to be used with a special trocar for injecting
ferric chloride into aneurysms , and thus to heal them by coagulation.

1853. alexander wood (1817 84) of edinburgh invents the hypodermic
needle and adapts pravaz 's syringe for use with it.

you might also be interested to read about the experiments of sir
christopher wren in 1656 , described by oldenberg clarck in the
philosophical transactions of the royal society in 1665. using a
sharpened quill and a pig 's bladder he injected opium , wine and beer

sumatripton (i have no idea of the actual spelling) that supposedly
utilizes a chemical that trips neuro transmitters. my mother has
regular migraines and nothing seems to help does anyone know anything
about this new drug \? is it in a testing phaze or anywhere near
approval \? does it seem to be working \?

i just got back from the american academy of neurology annual meeting ,
where the consensus was that sumatriptan (imitrex) has no advantages
over dhe 45 nasal spray , which is much less expensive , has fewer side
effects , is as effective , and works more quickly (5 10 minutes vs. 30).
besides , who wants to give themselves a shot (sumatriptan) when a nasal
spray works \? dhe nasal spray is not widely available yet it has to
be mail ordered from one of a few pharmacies in the country but most
neurologists now know about it and know how to order it.

do i ever ! ! ! ! ! ! after 2 years of having health problems that had been
cleared up w allery shots , and not knowing why , i went and was re tested.
i actually did better than when i had been tested 2 years ago....
then putting 2 2 together , i realized that it all started back up
when the laser printer came into the office. i kept track of the usage , and
on hi use days , i was worse. i got better over the weekends....

the laser printer is gone , i'm 100 better ! ! ! ..... whether it is the toner
dust or chemicals , i dont know (i am highly allergic to dust...) , but
it definitely was the laser printer....

hi all ,

my skin is very dry in general. but the most serious part is located
from knees down. the skin there looks like segmented. the segmentation
actually happens beneath the skin. i would like to know if there is any
cure for this.

at the supermarkets or pharmacies , there are quite a lot of stuffs for
dry skins , but what to chose \?

thanks in advance for all advices and hints.

reply by email preferred.

as a matter of fact , i just saw a dermatologist the other day , and while i
was there , i asked him about dry skin. i 'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams , lotions , and other dry skin treatments.
he said all i needed was a large jar of vaseline. soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for 10 minutes (only 10 minutes ! ) then massage in the vaseline ,
to trap the moisture in. that will help. i have n't tried it yet , but you
can bet i will. the hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly. if it 's not done right , you remain greasy and stick
to your clothes.
try it. it 's got to be cheaper then spending 30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'
lotion.

vaginitis , annals of internal medicine , 3 1 92 116(5) 353 7. do you
have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than
capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results) \?

the study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of
yogurt. there was a marked decrease in infections while women were
ingesting the yogurt. problems with the study included very small
numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only
21 patients were analyzed). still , the difference in rates of infection
between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
believable.

pregnancy to occur intercourse. these days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques , but we 're speaking of
natural acts here. it is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is

...i'm not asking anyone here to buy into the yeast connection book
because i do n't know what 's in that book , plain and simple. and to be honest
with you , i'm beginning to wish that it was never written.

i agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way
it was. my doctor who claims to have introduced dr. crook to the
possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in
1961 (i have no reason to doubt him on this) does not like the book
because 1) it makes too many unfounded claims , and 2) is horribly written
from a scientific viewpoint. on the other hand , my doctor has always kept
an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the yeast
connection .

but , i believe there is some truth to the book. hopefully the right
clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction. in
the meantime , i 'd still encourage people who have incurable chronic sinus
problems (especially if they overused antibiotics) , to find a doctor to
administer a systemic type anti fungal such as itraconazole (along with
liver panels before , during and after treatment just to play it safe). it
is an empirical approach for sure , but when all else fails , and your ent
says sorry , you 'll just have to live with it , it is time to step out and
try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence
(dr. ivker) , supported by plausible theories (outlined by marty). at
this stage you have little to lose , particularly if you use itraconazole and
have the proper monitoring the health risk has been shown through extensive
clinical studies both in europe and the u.s. to be very minimal with
relatively healthy (i.e. , non aids) patients. i'm glad i did this , since i
saw remarkable results after only one week on sporanox (itraconazole). of
course , your mileage may vary a lot everyone is different so it may not
work for you. talk to your doctor.

(i 've already heard from a couple who said they had it and it did n't

i am a moderately severe asthmatic. ent doc says large percentage see some
relief of their asthma after sinus surgery. also he said it is not unheard of
that migraines go away after chronis sinusitis is relieved.

did your ent also tell you that this procedure may remove warts from the soles
of your feet and improve your sex life \?

actually , severe headaches due to stopped up sinuses (plugged ostia) are
possible , and sinus surgery which widens the ostia from the normal 2
mm to about 10 mm should relieve this. there are non surgical ways ,
however , to keep the ostia open (however , in a few individuals , their
ostia are naturally very small) , and dr. ivker 's book talks about this.
the underlying cause of chronic sinusitis is not cured by this kind of
sinus surgery , though.

about asthma , that 's a little more controversial. dr. ivker , in his book ,
sinus survival , speculates (and says it 's not proven) , that many cases
of asthma are triggered by chronic sinusitis due to the excessive drainage
(postnasal drip) from the sinuses. he 's had many patients who 've found
relief from asthma when the chronic sinusitis is reduced or eliminated
not clinical proof , but compelling anecdotal information of this speculation.

before doing any sinus surgery , first get the book it discusses surgery ,
as well as a good non surgical treatment program for chronic sinusitis.

i 've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays. in the examples i 've seen , drugs were
definitely involved.

my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital. he was fifty three at the time , and he was on 21 separate
medications. the family protested , but the doctors were adamant , telling
us that none of the drugs interact. they even took the attitude that , if
he was disoriented , they should put him on something else as well ! with
the help of an md friend of the family , we had all his medication
discontinued. he had a seizure that night , and was put back on one drug.
two days later , he was his old self again. i guess there are n't many
medical texts that address the subject of 21 way interactions.

i do n't mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession. it is an
aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me. docs seem to believe
that , because they have close control of you , it 's quite all right to
take your bodily equilibria into their own hands. that control reduces
the chance that the patient will make a mistake , but health care
providers can make mistakes too , and mistakes can be deadly under those
circumstances.

i grant you that sometimes there 's no choice. nevertheless , i suggest
you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting , and discuss
it with an independent doc. her problems may not be the effect of haldol
at all. haldol may have been used validly , or it may have been
prescribed because other medication confused her , and because the
hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly.

just my opinion ,

claude , i 've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin a(
retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by
high sound levels , but also occassionally due to severe infection). the
types of cells that vitamin a regulates are the general epithelial cells
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing
process. the hair cell nerve like epithelial cells in the ear may respond
to vitamin a during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but i do n't
know if they are still capable of responding in adults. if they are
capable of responding with new hair growth , this would be a very major
breakthrough in hearing loss. with all of the medical interest in vitamin
a , it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using
vitamin a to reverse hearing loss. but with only a news announcement to go
on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad) , i ca n't comment on
your question anymore than i already have. if one study has been done ,
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin a and hearing

no , they do not work well. my doctor started using one recently , and i
thought the concept was so amazing that i bought one too.

the thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum.
the ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls , so you have to point
the thing very carefully. this means tugging on the top of the ear
to straighten out the ear canal , then inserting the thing snugly , then
pushing a button. unfortunately , there are many things that can go wrong.
it is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on
yourself. i get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees ,
and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees.

i talked to one of the nurses in my doctor 's office recently about this ,
and she said she did n't like them either , for same reasons. she did give
me some instruction on how to tug on my ear , and what correct insertion
feels like , but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly
on one 's self. she also said that she and other nurses had complained to
the company about inaccurate readings , and that someone from the company
had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end
of the probe with alcohol from time to time. she demonstrated this prior
to reading my temperature , and managed to get a reading within 0.5 degree
of the oral temperature i took at home before driving to the dr 's office.

i have also noticed tha some nurses click the button , then remove the
probe immediately. this causes wrong readings. in my experience , you
have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button
to get a good measurement. the nurse i talked with agreed. i suspect
that many people do n't realize this , and therefore get bad readings for
yet another reason.

in short , it 's a great idea. it may work for some folks , but i believe
it does n't work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature.

hi stephen
ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections , both by preventing
a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties. too much can block the
external auditory canal (the hole in the outside of the ear) and cause some
hearing problems. it is very simple , and safe , to remove excess wax on your
own , or at your physician 's office. you can take a syringe (no needles ! ) and
fill it with 50 warm water (cold can cause fainting) and 50 otc hydrogen
peroxide. then point the ear towards the ceiling ( about 45 degrees up)
and insert the tip of the syringe (helps to have someone else do this ! ) and
firmly expell the solution. depending on the size of the syringe and the
tenacity of the wax , this could take several rinses. if you place a bowl
under the ear to catch the water , it will be much drier ). you can buy
a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy , or just use whatever
you may have. if wax is old , it will be harder , and darker. you can try
adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up
the wax. do this for a couple days , then try syringing again. it is also
safe to point your ear up at the shower head , and allow the water to rinse
it out.
good luck

food products can get through breast milk and cause allergies in the

bottle feedings , but rather eliminate foods from mother 's diet. your

smart drugs (i.e. nootropics) should post to this group. the two groups

smart nutrients. we may lower that groups burden as well.

i beg to disagree with you on this subject. if i recall correctly ,
alt.drugs was being flodded by posts like how do i grow mj how do i
use a bong \? wow , man , i just had the coolest trip etc... there were
quite a few people out there who were versed in pharmacology and biology
who wanted to discuss centrally active substabces at a higher level
without all the other crap filling the bandwidth. i would suggest
that you proceed to create a newsgroup dedicated to nootropics if you
must have one dedicated to them , and leave alt.psychoactives to the
discussion of psychoactives (including nootropics , which are but a small
portion of the realm of centrally active substances).

i was wondering if a group called 'sci.pharmacology' would be relevent.
this would be used for a more formal discussion about pharmacological
issues (pharmacodynamics , neuropharmacology , etc.)

send a copy to the clinician under whose care your friend was

complaints until the patient becomes litigious. clinicians may not
have been informed of the complaint and are very surprised to find

if there is no response within a week send a follow up letter.
attach a photocopy of the original letter. do this weekly until you
do get a response.

cat scans are non invasive but they can be very scary. the scanner
can be a bad place for the claustrophobic. there was an interesting
study in the bmj , about 10 years ago , which found that around 10 of

never have another. this compares with 15 who said the same about a

biological alchemy

( another form of cold fusion )

( alternative heavy element creation in universe )

a very simple experiment can demonstrate (prove) the
fact of biological transmutations (reactions like mg o
ca , si c ca , k h ca , n2 co , etc.) , as
described in the book biological transmutations by louis
kervran , 1972 edition is best. , and in chapter 17 of the
book the secret life of plants by peter tompkins and
christopher bird , 1973

(1) obtain a good sample of plant seeds , all of the same
kind. some kinds might work better that others.

(2) divide the sample into two groups of equal weight
and number.

(3) sprout one group in distilled water on filter paper
for three or four weeks.

(4) separately incinerate both groups.

(5) weigh the residue from each group. the residue of
the sprouted group will usually weigh at least
several percent more than the other group.

(6) analyze quantitatively the residue of each group for
mineral content. some of the mineral atoms of the
sprouted group have been transmuted into heavier
mineral elements by fusing with atoms of oxygen ,
hydrogen , carbon , nitrogen , etc..


biological transmutations occur routinely , even in our
own bodies.

ingesting a source of organic silicon (silicon with
carbon , such as horsetail extract , or radishes) can speed
healing of broken bones via the reaction si c ca , (much
faster than by merely ingesting the calcium directly).

some mineral deposits in the ground are formed by micro
organisms fusing together atoms of silicon , carbon , nitrogen ,
oxygen , hydrogen , etc..

the two reactions si c ca , by micro organisms ,
cause stone sickness in statues , building bricks , etc..

the reaction n2 co , catalysed by very hot iron ,
creates a carbon monoxide poison hazard for welder operators
and people near woodstoves (even properly sealed ones).

some bacteria can even neutralize radioactivity !


all of these things and more happen , in spite of the
currently accepted laws of physics , (including the law
which says that atomic fusion requires extremely high
temperatures and pressures.)

robert ,

i'm so glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion. i 've
been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci. med.
i did n't know how to respond since i had not seen one of your posts(just
like i have n't read the yeast connection ).

let me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers of
recent years are now in scientific exile(i believe that one has actually
left the country). scientific fraud is rare. i'm still not sure that if a
review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually
proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation.

your sources do not seem to be research articles. they are more like lay
texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area(just like the food
combining and life extension texts). robert , i try to keep an open mind.
but some things i just ca n't buy(one is taking sod orally to prevent
oxidative damage in the body).

your experiment , if conducted by readers of this news group , would prove
that you are right(more ash after seed sprouting than before). unless you
use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature(above 600 degrees
i believe) , you will get organic residue in the ash. even the residue in
commercial incinerators contains organic residue. i remember doing this
kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i
could n't find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i'm really
guessing at 600 degrees f , it may actually be much higher. the point is
that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to
produce only a mineral ash. they also could not measure the minerals so
they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct.

chemical reactions abound in our body , in our atmosphere , in our water and
in our soil. are these fusion reactions \? yes many of them do involve
fusing oxygen , nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics. do we
really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with
silicon \? not in my book robert.

silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet. i 've seen speculation
that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon
based life form. i like reading science fiction , as many people do. but i
know enough about biochemistry(and nutrition) to be able(in most cases) to
separate the fiction from the fact.

silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in
humans. we have several grams of the stuff in our body. what 's it doing
there \? only the lord knows right now. but i will tell you what i do know
about silicon and why , as you state , it helps bone healing(and it is not
because silicon is transformed into calcium).

almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective
tissue(collagen and elastin). there have been studies published which show
that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective
factor against atherosclerosis(the higher the silicon content in elastin ,
the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity
which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as
part of the ageing process in humans).

for bone fracture healing , the first step is a collagen matrix into which
calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts. a high level of silicon
in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation. this first step in the
bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going.
electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming
cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in
the gap(or gaps) between the ends of the broken bone. a vitamin c deficiency
(by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of
defective collagen) does slow down both bone and wound healing. zinc is also
another big player in bone and wound healing. and so is silicon(in an
undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not
transformation of silicon to calcium). for you to take this bone healing
observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into
calcium is an interesting little trick.

but robert , i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press(and
yes even some scientific papers). is the explanation reasonable \? without
a very good science knowledge base , you and most readers of this news group
are flying blind(you have to take it on faith because you do n't know any
better).

if the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base ,
i'm inclined to consider it(this usually means trying to find other sources
that come to the same conclusion). if the idea(like a candida bloom) seems
to make sense to me , i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that i'm
going to give is n't going to really mess somebody up. if this makes us
kindred souls robert , then i guess i 'll have to live with that label.

for the physicians who have decided to read my response to robert 's
interesting post , i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric
neurosurgeon last night on u.s. tv. i ca n't remember the network or his
name(like many nights , i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv in
our den where i have my computer setup). this neurosurgeon takes kids with
brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional
treatments(his own words). he says that he has a 70 success rate. the one
case that i heard him discussing would normally use radiation(conventional
treatment). he was going to go in and cut. you guys complain about the
cost of the anti fungals. what do you think the cost difference between
radiation treatment and surgery is guys \?

i'm going to ask you guys one more time , why blast a physician who takes the
chronic sinus sufferer(like jon) and the chronic gi sufferer(like elaine)
and tries to help them using unconventional treatments \? treatments which
do not result in death(like those that the neurosurgeon uses \? ). is it
because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are \?
how about quality of life guys \? may the candida demon never cross your
sinus cavity or gut(if it does , you may feel differently about the issue).

hi ,

it started to hurt when i lay on my right side , and then it hurt
no matter what position i was in. next , i noticed that when i
ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had
turned to stone , and the pain in the area got worse. however if
i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it
was n't as much of a problem.

so the doctor says i have cholistatis , and that i should avoid
fatty foods. this makes sense , and because i was already aware
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have
been avoiding these foods on my own. but i'm still able to eat
foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.

but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet. this means no meat
except fish and chicken w o skin (i do this anyway). no nuts ,
fried food , cheese etc. i am allowed skim milk. she said i
should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas). also i must only
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (
potatoes , pasta , rice) ! she said i ca n't even cook vegetables in
a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or
steamed. i'm concerned because i understand you need to have
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process. and if

g

for one week , she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. if it
changes anything.

you can live on the diet but you need to up your non fat calories. where
before you had a pat of butter , now you need a medium apple (probably microwave
cooked). smaller meals but more of them. not terrific amounts of meat , it 's
hard to digest anyway. first , even fish , fowl and breads have fat. second ,
the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. third , your
body , like most peoples , was n't bred to live on a high fat , modern diet.
if you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about
the luxury of eating fat , how people enjoyed it. this was because it was so
rare. even cows did n't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that
they do now.

for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. is the
baby still coming up. is it starting to push or rub under your ribs \? how
tight are your clothes. you should n't be wearing any clothing that compresses
your middle. be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting , again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract.

try laying on your sides , back ,
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.
easier on your legs (circulation) as well. you might try letting the baby
turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.
when you are shortwaisted it 's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram , especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. if i had my
second one to do over again i think i 'd have tried to loosen up since he
did n't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.


maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way. especially if she 's young.
but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible. you do n't want to become ill with it while you
are pregnant. if you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the
baby. (it is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest
of the population , a good part of it is that they are willing to do the
dieting , etc that helps them avoid surgery. also , i do n't think the surgery
lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )

nausea , etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. my
first pregnancy was miserable. during the second i had very little trouble.
some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here)

good luck

i 've read that exercise makes the heart pump more blood at a stroke , and
that it also makes the heart pumb slower , in order to make up for the
greater volume. my internist , who diagnosed my av block , slow heart rate
and pvc 's , told me something different. she says that heart rate is
associated with the electrical properties of the hear muscle , not its
size. exercise lowers heart rate and increases stroke volume , but the
effects are unrelated except for their common source. the av block , she
asserts , is another electrical effect , which is irreversable even when
exercise is dicontinued. pvc 's are also common in runners.

could anyone give me information on umbilical hernias.
the patient is over weight and has a protruding hernia.

surgery may be risky due to the obesity.
what other remedies could i try \?


unless the patient has a very short life expectancy , the possible complications
from a hernia that has n't been repaired far outweigh the risks of surgery.
the risks of surgery , anyway , are minimal. unless they are exceedingly large ,
hernias can be fixed under local anesthesia.
do n't forget that hernias are one the leading causes of small bowel obstruction.
and the smaller the hernia is , the higher the chances that a loop of bowel will
become incarcerated or strangulated.

that 's fine. these words have multiple meanings.

as a self proclaimed atheist , i believe that some conceptions
of god are inconsistent or in conflict with fact , and i lack
belief in other conceptions of god merely because there is no
reason for me to believe in these. i usually use the word
agnostic to mean someone who believes that the existence of
a god is unknown inherently unknowable. note that this is a

potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis. if i recall
correctly , the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves n hydroxylation to n acetyl benzoquinoneimine , which
is a highly reactive intermediate , which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione. when hepatic
glutathione is used up , this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis. the insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay (2 4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage. this is not a nice way to die.

nice explanation except that it is n't n hydroxylation that causes the
formation of the n acetyl p benzoquinone imine (napqi) , but rather a
direct two electron oxidation. in addition , there is one school of thought
that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein
is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen.

as far as drug toxicities go , acetaminophen has and continues to be one
of the most intensely scrutinized. an excellent recent review of the topic
can be found in

vermeulen , bessems and van de straat.
molecular aspects of paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity and its
mechanism based prevention. drug metabolism reviews , 24(3) 367
407 (1992).

(acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in europe)

i could n't agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic
dose of acetaminophen causes. i 've heard a number of descriptions by
physicians associated with poison control centers , and they describe a
lingering very painful death.

my brother 's affine has recently been diagnosed with sweet 's

this syndrome started after she had had iodine 131 treatment for
hyperthyroidism. she 'd been reluctant to have treatment for the
hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion
from it.

i understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level
but she 's is n't being treated by an endocrinologist. her previous
endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital. she entered the
hospital because of the sweet 's syndrome symptoms (skin lesions).

i 've looked through the last two years of medline and did n't find an
abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and sweets. .

i checked a handbook which said that sweet 's was associated with leukemia.

i 'd like a reccomndation for experts who are in new york city or who travel
to new york city. for the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology.

any information that might help. apparently there has n't been much

absence of hiv transmission from an infected orthopedic surgeon journal of
the american medical association (04 14 93) vol. 269 , no. 14 , p. 1807 (von
reyn , c. fordham)

the risk of hiv transmission from an hiv positive surgeon to patient is
extremely low , provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal
infection control procedures , write c. fordham von reyn et al. of the
dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon , n.h. the researchers contacted
2 , 317 former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performed
invasive procedures between january 1 , 1978 and june 30 , 1992. the
orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive
for hiv. a total of 1 , 174 former patients underwent hiv testing ,
representing 50.7 percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon
performed invasive procedures during the 13.5 year period. patients were
tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure. all
patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent
assay. two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery.
the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect
cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients. the estimated cost of
the initial patient notification and testing was 158 , 000 , with the single
most expensive activity being counseling and testing. this accounted for 37
percent of the total expense. the patient notification and testing were
conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who
was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study.
notifying patients of the infected surgeon 's hiv status is both disruptive
and expensive and is not routinely recommended , the researchers conclude.

269 , no. 14 , p. 1795 (smith rogers , audrey et al.)

the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be
quantified only by gathering data from multiple , methodologically similar
investigations , writes audrey smith rogers et al. of the johns hopkins
university school of medicine in baltimore , md. the researchers identified a
total of 1 , 131 persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical
procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the hiv positive surgeon was
listed as the operating surgeon. the aids case registries were reviewed for
all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were
obtained. among the 1 , 131 patients , 101 were dead , 119 had no address , 413
had test results known , and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. no
study patient name was found in reported aids case registries. one newly
detected , hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probably
infected in 1985 during a transfusion. there was no hiv transmission in 369
person hours of surgical exposure , suggesting that hiv transmission to
patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person hours
of surgical exposure. the researchers determined there is no evidence to
suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection control
guidelines over 50 percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to
be tested , and of those whose results were revealed , only one person was
found to be infected with hiv. the study patient 's infection was probably
the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985. as a result ,
there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positive
surgeon to any patient transpired , the researchers conclude.

drug concerns to share aids data new york times (04 20 93) , p. c10
(kolata , gina)

a total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided , in a highly
unusual move , to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are
undergoing early clinical testing. dr. edward scolnick , president of the
merck research laboratory in rahway , n.j. , arranged the collaboration. he
said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it
had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective
in fighting hiv than any drug used alone. the researchers are hopeful that
hiv , when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at
different sites for resistance to develop , will be unable to evolve all the
mutations at the same time. therefore , several drugs taken together or one
after the other could halt the spread of hiv. currently , the drug companies
do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing. the new
agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data
on new aids drugs. an agreement like this will greatly facilitate

hicnet medical newsletter page 39
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

companies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a
much more efficient way , said scolnick. he also said that the
collaboration would not violate antitrust laws. in creating the agreement ,
merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups , including act up.
dr. daniel hoth , director of the division on aids at the national institute
of allergy and infectious disease said , we 're delighted to see the
pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the
information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for
aids. related stories wall street journal (04 20) p. b1 philadelphia

the next step in aids treatment nature (04 08 93) vol. 362 , no. 6420 , p. 493
(maddox , john)

although azt was found to be ineffective in prolonging the lives of
people infected with hiv , the findings do not indicate that azt should not be
administered in people with full blown aids , writes columnist john maddox.
azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on
the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of
t cell counts. however , a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should
not be used early in the course of disease. while the cd4 counts of the 877
people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving
only placebo , the first three years of follow up have shown that the
proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to
death were not significantly different at roughly 18 percent. the
conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected
individuals , and that cd4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the
progression to aids in infected people. but nothing is implied by the study
of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already
appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment , at least on the
evidence now available. it is much more alarming that the cd4 count has
proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv
infection. aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the
beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of
disease. the general application of such an assay will probably in itself
provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids , concludes
maddox.

infective and anti infective properties of breastmilk from hiv 1 infected
women lancet (04 10 93) vol. 341 , no. 8850 , p. 914 (van de perre , philippe
et al.)

a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm
type in the mother 's body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of
hiv 1 from mother to child , write philippe van de perre et al. of the

hicnet medical newsletter page 40
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

national aids control program in kigali , rwanda. the researchers hypothesized
that transmission of hiv 1 through breastmilk could be favored by the
presence of infected cells , by deficiency of anti infective substances in
breastmilk , or both factors. a total of 215 hiv 1 infected women were
enrolled at delivery in kigali , rwanda milk samples were collected 15 days , 6
months , and 18 months post partum. hiv 1 igg , secretory iga , and igm were
assayed by western blot , for the latter two after removal of igg with
protein g. in the 15 day and 6 month samples , the researchers sought viral
genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of
primers (gag , pol , and env). at 15 days , 6 months , and 18 months post
partum , hiv 1 specific igg was detected in 95 percent , 98 percent , and 97
percent of breastmilk samples iga in 23 percent , 28 percent , and 41 percent
and igm in 66 percent , 78 percent , and 41 percent. in children who survived
longer than 18 months the risk of infection was associated with lack of
persistence of igm and iga in their mothers' milk. the presence of hiv 1
infected cells in the milk 15 days post partum was strongly predictive of
hiv 1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.
the combination of hiv 1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm
response was the strongest predictor of infection. igm and iga anti hiv 1 in
breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv , the researchers
conclude.

firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce
(04 21 93) , p. 7a

a total of fifteen u.s. and european pharmaceutical companies announced
tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids
research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv
infection and aids. the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily
from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies
since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual
aids drug. edward scolnick , president of merck co. research laboratories ,
led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come
together , said participants. in addition to merck , the other companies
involved in the inter company collaboration for aids drug development are
bristol myers squibb co. , burroughs wellcome , glaxo inc. , hoffman la roche ,
eli lilly co. , pfizer inc. , smithkline beecham , ab astra , du pont merck ,
syntex inc. , boehringer ingelheim , miles inc. , and sigma tau. the
participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they
were aware of had joined the collaboration , and that any company actively
involved in hiv anti viral development may participate. scolnick said the
collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong
scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical

hicnet medical newsletter page 41
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

and early clinical data. the american foundation for aids research (amfar)
was pleased with the news of the collaboration , which it hopes will lead to
the development of drug combinations that will reduce viral resistance.

the united kingdom 's department of health recently followed the advice

among health care workers. following recent highly publicized reports of
health professionals who contracted hiv , the department issued revised
guidelines on the management of such cases. dr. kenneth calman , chief

workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv
infection , including , if appropriate , diagnostic hiv testing. he said ,

i used to be on lopid. it did a good job of reducing cholesterol (295
down to around 214) , as well as ldl and triglycerides. then , i got
pneumonia , and for some reason , the lopid stopped working very well
cholesterol and triglycerides soared. the levels might have stabilized
over time , but a new doctor had me quit , wait a month , then switch
to mevicore.

on mevicore , my total cholesterol was down to 207 , ldl was 108 ,
and hdl was 35 but the trig 's were still
very high , around 318 , and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal ,
sgot 83 (n 1 35) , ggtp( \? hard to read copy) 42 (n 0 35).

he said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him
concern , and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol
figures. he had me stop the mevicore to allow the liver to heal ( just
to be extra cautious , though i'm sure it 's not a problem. ) ,
and wants me to go back on it after that. i suggested maybe lopid might
be the better choice , and he said that he would n't object if that 's what
i want to do. but lopid has one particular side effect i'm not fond of.

should the above liver and trig figures be feared \? what happens to
folks with high trig levels \? is my liver in danger with the above
results \? would i be better off on lopid , despite its inconvenient
side effect , or , perhaps , some other drug \? (niacin affected my
liver , too).

in article 10600@blue.cis.pitt.edu doyle @pitt.edu (howard r doyle) writes
chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver
biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months
after a bout of acute viral hepatitis , or when someone is found to have
persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests. the degree of
elevation (in the serum transaminases) can be trivial , or as much as ten times
normal. other blood chemistries are usually normal.
as a rule , patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease.
chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic , at
least initially , and that 's why it 's important to tell them apart by means of
a biopsy. the patient with cph only needs to be reassured. the patient with
cah needs to be treated.

i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis. it seems
that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis , whereas
there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah (viral ,
drugs , alcohol , autoimmune , etc.). physicians seem to have a variety of
thresholds for electing to biopsy someone 's liver. personally , i think
that if the patient is asymptomatic , with only slight transaminitis and
normal albumin and pt , one can simply follow them closely and not add the
potential risks of a biopsy. others may well biopsy such a patient , thus
providing these samples for study. it would be interesting to see if
anyone 's done any decision analysis on this.

i pity those who hope that medical knowledge can resolve issues
such as this. this issue has been rehashed in sci.med time and
time again. the bottom line is this in normal circumstances ,
both the medical advantages of and the medical risks of
circumcision are minor. this means that the decision is left to
the religious , cultural , ethical , and aesthetic mores of the
parents , at best , or to the habit of the concerned hospital or
caregivers , at worst.

as (prospective) parents , you should do what you want in this
regard and not worry about it too much. in terms of decisions
you make for your child , it will have far less importance than
many such as which schools you choose that most parents
think about only a little.

this question will undoubtedly push the buttons of people who

(p.s. , may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories , such as the yeast theory , should create your own moderated group.

why \? is there some reason why you feel that it should n't be pointed out
in sci.med that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the
existence of systemic yeast syndrome \?

i do n't know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist.
no scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question. noring has pointed out
the catch 22 that if the crazy theory were true , you probably could n't
find any direct evidence of it that you could n't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there. noring and the
fellow from oklahoma (sorry , forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences
namely , that when people with certain conditions are given anti fungals ,
many of them appear to get better.

so , if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for example ,
controlled double blind studies showing that the anti fungals do n't do any
better than sugar water then let 's hear it. if you do n't , then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side , and abject
disbelief on the other. in which case , please , there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.

and i understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight , making wild claims with no evidence , and always refusing to do
controlled studies. but that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti fungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases. there are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase , in spite of the fact that it 's
completely broken down in the guts , but this does n't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage. same thing. just cause there are candida quacks , that
does n't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis. if there 's some
other reason (besides the quacks) , if only anecdotal , to think it could be
true , then that is what has to be considered , that is what the net people
have been talking about.

but again , there is no point in arguing about it. there is anecdotal
evidence , and there is no convincing evidence , and there are also some
candida quacks out there , i hope everyone can agree on all of that. thus ,
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double blind
study of antifungals (or else , forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test , just carry it out themselves ! ) and also , whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

now has the same symptoms. she has been to a skin specialist ,
but he has merely prescribed various medicines (one

anti histamines worked on both of them , but looks like

actually i am entering vet school next year , but the question is
relevant for med students too.

memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically.
since this is a major portion of medical education anatomy ,
histology , pathology , pharmacology , are for the most part mass
memorization i am a little concerned. as i am sure most
med students are.

can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization \? i
have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like
thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things. but i have
never applied them to large amounts of data .

has anyone had luck with any particular books , memory systems , or

can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques \? being an
older student who returned to school this year , organization (another

first off , if i'm not mistaken , only hibernating animals have brown fat ,
not humans.

secondly , your description sounds just like 2 , 4 dinitrophenol. this is an
uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation. put in layman 's
terms , it short circuits the mitochondria , causing food energy to be
turned into heat.

2 , 4 dnp was popular in the 1930 's for weight reduction. in controlled
amounts , it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the
reduced amount of useful energy available. it is very dangerous.
it would be wiser to adjust to your present body form , rather than
play around with 2 , 4 dnp.

but if you insist , i suggest you look up the literature in your own
university library. you can obtain 2 , 4 dnp by taking a first year
organic chemistry lab course and swiping it from the supplies (it 's
a commonly used reagent).

here is a press release from huntington medical research institutes.

new method for diagnosing alzheimer 's disease discovered at
huntington medical research institutes results to be reported
to national desk , health writer
contact john lockhart or belinda gerber , 310 444 7000 , or
800 522 8877 , for the huntington medical research
institutes.

los angeles , april 28 a new method for diagnosing
and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain
which lead to alzheimer 's disease and other dementias has been
discovered by researchers at the huntington medical research
institutes (hmri) in pasadena , calif. results of their research
will be reported in the may issue of the scientific journal ,
radiology.
using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging (mri)
called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) , a research team led
by brian d. ross , m.d. , d. phil. , conducted a study on 21 elderly
patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of
dementia. the exams used standard mri equipment fitted with special
software developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs. clinical
proton mrs is easily applied , giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses
in less than 30 minutes. an automated version of clinical proton
mrs called proton brain examination (probe) reduces the examination
time yet further , providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10
minutes. by comparison , the current standard of care in testing
for alzheimer 's disease calls for lengthy memory function and
neuropsychological tests , which can be very upsetting to the
patient , are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy.
in addition to alzheimer 's disease , the new clinical proton mrs
exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias , including
aids related dementia , parkinson 's disease and huntington 's
disease.
we 've developed a simple test which can be administered quickly
and relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fitted
with either the mrs or probe software , said dr. ross , adding ,
this will help physicians to diagnose alzheimer 's earlier and
intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease
causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain.
dr. ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in the
brain known as inositols , and myo inositol (mi) acted as a marker
in the study. in comparison to healthy patients , those diagnosed
with alzheimer 's showed a 22 percent increase in mi , while their
level of another chemical called n acetylaspartate (naa) was
significantly lower , indicating a loss of brain stimulating neurons
believed to be associated with the progression of the disease.
current drug therapy for alzheimer 's disease is widely
considered to be inadequate. this is attributable , dr. ross
believes , to the theory that alzheimer 's is caused by an
interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to
the nerve cells. this belief has been adhered to over the last 15
years , and consequently , most drugs to treat alzheimer 's were based
on the changing receptors for acetylcholine.
physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate
alzheimer 's from other dementias , to provide the patient and his or
her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment
protocols for the treatment of this disease. for this reason , we
consider this test a major advancement in medicine , said bruce
miller , m.d. , a noted neurologist at harbor ucla , mrs researcher
and a co author of the study.
other members of the hmri research team included rex a. moats ,
ph.d. , truda shonk , b.s. , thomas ernst , ph.d. , and suzanne woolley ,
r.n. the probe software can be fitted on the approximately 1 , 200
general electric mri units currently in use in the united states ,
and will be configured for other manufacturers' mri units soon.
for interviews with dr. ross , advance copies of the radiology
may issue , and other information , please contact john lockhart or
belinda gerber for hmri at 310 444 7000 or 800 522 8877.

q a on alzheimer 's disease

what is alzheimer 's disease and how is it caused \?
alzheimer 's disease (ad) is an incurable degenerative disease of
the brain first described in 1906 by the german neuropathologist
alois alzheimer. as the disease progresses , it leads to loss of
memory and mental functioning , followed by changes in personality ,
loss of control of bodily functions , and , eventually , death.
how many people does it affect \?
alzheimer 's disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in
the united states and is the fourth leading cause of death , taking
approximately 100 , 000 lives each year. while alzheimer 's
debilitates its victims , it is equally devastating , both
emotionally and financially , for patients' families. ad is the
most common cause of dementia in adults. symptoms worsen every
year , and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset.
what are its signs and symptoms \?
although the cause of ad is not known , two risk factors have
been identified advanced age and genetic predisposition. the risk
of developing ad is less than one percent before the age of 50
yars old , but increases steeply in each successive decade of life
to reach 30 percent by the age of 90. in patients with familial
ad , immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of
developing ad. one of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness
caused by short term memory loss. dr. herman weinreb of the school
of medicine at new york university says whether forgetfulness is
a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and
suggests the following criteria

forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is
normal.
forgetting the name of a loved one is serious.
forgetting where you left your keys is normal.
forgetting how to get home is serious.

doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be
evaluated in order to rule out alzheimer 's disease and other forms
of dementia.

hoss@panix.com writes
hi all , ive applied for the class of 93 at quite a number of schools (20)
and have gotten 13 rejects , 4 interviews and 3 no responses.

three possible results after interview
1) rejection outright
2) acceptance outright
3) the infamous 'wait list'...

if you are on a 'wait list' , your entrance into medical school
is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their
acceptance. this can happen as late as day 1 of starting
classes.

any one know when the heck these people send out their acceptance letters \?
according to the med school admissions book theyre supposed to send out
the number of their class in acceptances by mid march. whats going on... i
am losing my sanity checking my mailbox every day.

you can always call the admissions office. the secretaries
should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your
application. be calm , respectful , and friendly secretaries
have more power than you might realize , and you never know
could be the dean of admissions answering the phone.

also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in , i

if you do n't get in this year , sit down and re evaluate
yourself your motives , desires , and goals that are directing
you into medicine your academic and extracurricular
accomplishments. make a decision about whether you really
want to be a medical doctor. i had classmates who dropped out
in the first semester of med school because they found it was
not what they wanted to do i have friends who applied four
years in a row before they were accepted. medicine as a
career is a choice you must make for yourself don't be
pushed into it because of your parents family significant
other.

if you still want to be a medical doctor , determine how you
can improve your application. a letter of recommendation from
a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive
recommendation is far better than one from a 'big shot' famous
professor who only vaguely remembers your face. also , do n't
be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest
and positive recommendation give them a chance to say 'no ,
sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no , sorry'. i
have turned down writing recommendations for some students
because i did not know them well enough to make any meaningful
comments , and some because i honestly could not recommend them
at that point.

rewrite your personal statement take it by an english
professor or some other friendly person with skill and
experience in writing and proof reading and get their
criticism , both about what you are saying as well as how you
say it.

review your academic accomplishments. if your grades are poor
in some area , do n't be afraid to spend some time in further
coursework. evidence of determined committment will help
here. if you filled your pre medicine curriculum with gut
courses , it usually shows.

look at your extracurricular involvements. participating in
local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus
substantial leadership roles in an organization help also.
beware of 'resume padding' such things are not difficult to
spot and weed out.

overall , a clear conception of where you wish to head and why
you want to get there , combined with an honest self appraisal
of skills and aptitude , will be the best path to take in
applying to any program , medical or what have you.

good luck with the process as tom petty says , 'the waiting
is the hardest part' , at least emotionally. )

i have a problem with wasps they seem to love me. last summer i
could n't spend more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time in my garden
before one or several wasps would come for me. i am asking for advice
on how to repel wasps.

this year the wasps have built their nest under a stone next to one
of my tiny ponds. the caretaker (poor fellow ! ) will have to take care
of them , and that will give me a head start on them. last year we
could n't find any nest. even after the caretaker has gassed the nest
in my tiny garden of 30 square meter , other wasps will most likely vie
for the territory. is there anything i can grow , rub on my skin or
spread on the soil that will repel the black and yellow bastards \?
never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved
plants , i want to be able to spend time in my garden like everyone
else.

would it help to remove the ponds and the bird bath \? the wasps seem
to come to drink at them , and i suppose that their prey will breed in
them. the black tits seem to be afraid of the wasps , because as soon
as the wasp season starts , they stop coming to have their bath.

even when i am not trying to win back my patio from 15 20 wasps , they
seem to love me. the advice i usually get when i ask what to do about
wasps , is to stand still and not wave my arms. i 've got some painful
stings when trying to follow that advice. i have also tried to use
hygienic products without perfumes , to no avail. they still love me ,
and come for me , even when i'm in the middle of a crowd. so far only
two things seem to work to kill it dead or to run into the house and
close all doors and windows.

nb i do n't have a problem with bees or bumble bees , just wasps.

colonics were a health fad of the 19th century , which persists to this day.
except for certain medical conditions , there is no reason to do this.
certainly no normal person should do this.

frequent use of enemas can lead to a condition in which a person is unable
to have normal bowel passage , essentially a person becomes addicted to
enemas. as i understand it , this is a very unpleasant condition , and it
would be best to avoid it.

i 've seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and
demented during hospital stays. in the examples i 've seen , drugs were
definitely involved.

my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the
hospital. he was fifty three at the time , and he was on 21 separate
drugs...

no wonder he became confused ! with so many drugs , it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem. and because some drugs
potentiate the effect of each other , they can make the side effects
all the worse , and even dangerous. (kinda like mixing alcohol and
antihistamines ! )

...he was disoriened the doctors thougt they should put him on something
else as well !

unfortunately , doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving. if one drug they are taking causes
the patient 's blood pressure to go up , many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of re evaluating the need for the original drug.
this is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home ! ! ! !

....procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting , and discuss
it with an independent doc. her problems may not be the effect of haldol
at all. haldol may have been used validly , or it may have been
prescribed because other medication confused her , and because the
hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly.

i fully agree. in addition , she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can re evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.
i ca n't remember the guidelines i either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture , but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug re evaluated regularly. if her current physician
is unwilling to do this , find one who will. either check the phone
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology ,
or contact a physician referral line or the american medical society.
by finding a geriatric specialist , he (she) will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.

my friend has been diagnosed as having a severe case of depression requiring
antidepressants for a cure. the main problem is the side effects of these.
so far she has been prescribed prozac , aurorix , and tryptanol all with
different but unbearable side effects.

the prozac gave very bad anxiety jitters and insomina , it was impossible to
sit still for more than a minute or so.

the aurorix whilst having a calming effect , all feelings were lost and the
body co ordination was similar to a drunken person. her brain was clouded
over.

the tryptanol gave tremors in the legs and panic attacks along with unco
ordination occurred. she did not know what she was doing as her brain was
closed down .

has anyone had similar problems and or have any suggestions as to the next
step \?

it really is a decision that is up to the parents. some parents use
the reasoning that they will look like daddy and like their friends
as justification. there is nothing wrong with this just be sure it is
what you want to do , since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise
a male , although a major surgical procedure exists.

how about the pregnant woman sitting in a tub of water \? we 've heard
stories of infection , etc. how about after the water has broken \?

as long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any
problems with your pregnancy , it should be ok to sit in a tub of water.
however , i would recommend using your own bathtub in your own home !
it is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of public
hot tubs. a nice warm bath can be very relaxing , especially if your back
is killing you ! and it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath
soap , esp. if you are prone to yeast infection.

hope these tips help you some.

in article 1993apr29.003406.55029@ux1.cts.eiu.edu , cfaks@ux1.cts.eiu.edu (alice sanders) writes
a student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones , a
cyst on one kidney , and a kidney infection. she was upset because her
condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall , and she has been ill all
this time. during her most recent doctor 's appointment at her parents'
hmo clinic , she said that about forty ! x rays were made of her kidney.
when she asked why so many x rays were being made , she was told by a
technician that they need to see the area from different views , but she
says that about five x rays were made from each angle. she could n't help
feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something. she
is a pre med student and feels she could have understood what was
happening if someone would have explained. when nobody would , she got
worried.
also , she is told that thre are 300 ! surgery patients ahead of her
and that they cannot do surgery until august or so. it is now april...
she is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids. but she has to go to
classes. she wonders why they have given her no medicine. she plans to
call back her doctor 's office clinic and try to get answers to these
questions. but i told her i would also write in to sci.med and see what i
could find out about why there were so many x rays and whether it seems
o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this
or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care. she does plan to
get a second opinion , too.

i will pass info on to her. it never hurts to get information
from more than one source.

you can e mail me or post.

thanks.

my opinion(for what it 's worth) is that 40 x rays is way too many.
guidleines have been set on the number of dental x rays and chest x rays
that one should have over a given period of time because of all the
environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans , ionizing radiation
is one of the most potent(splits dna and causes hydroxyl free radical
formation in tissue cells). ultasound(like that used in seeing the fetus
in the uterus) has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors
in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder. but kidney tissue may
be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones(any radiologists care
to comment \? ).

most stones will pass(but it 's a very painful process). unlike gallstones ,
i do n't think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the
kidney stone(which is probably calcium oxalate). vitamin c and magnesium
have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the
aterial wall. i have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could
speed up the process of kidney stone passage(but i'm pretty confident that
a diet change and or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance). if surgery
is being contemplated , the stone must be in the kidney tubule. a second
opinion is a good idea because there are better(less damaging) ways to break
up the stone if it 's logged within the kidney(sonic blasts). hmo 's are
notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments.
my condolences to your friend.

i am writing this to find out the following

1.) any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis.

2.) the name(s) of a doctor(s) who specialize in such surgery.

3.) information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer.

my boyfriend , age 34 and otherwise in good health , was diagnosed with
reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago. at that time he
saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers (mylanta ,
tagamet) , as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed.
these treatments were not effective and because the damage was
worsening , he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago. he was told
there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem a nissen
wrap and a hill repair . he opted for the hill repair . he recovered
very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse
and in addition he now has trouble swallowing (including saliva).

the doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him
that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre cancerous condition
which he called barrett 's syndrome . if he ca n't avoid having reflux will
he necessarily get cancer \?

basically , if anyone has any information on what he should do now , i 'd

oh yes , i did have a point. a few years ago an md with a thriving
practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommended that
i take such treatments to clear up a skin condition. (not through his
office , i might add.) although i'm sure that 's not conclusive , it was
sure an unusual prescription !


the bacteria in your gut are important. but colonic flushes are not the
way to improve gut function. each person has almost a unique mix of
bacteria in his her gut. diet affects this mix as does the use of
antibiotics. a diet change is a much better way to alter the players in
your gut than is colonic flushes. cross contamination has been a real
problem in some of the outfits that do this treatment since the equipment
is not always cleaned as well as it should be between patient treatments .
dental drills have me a little concerned about hiv infection and i 've
picked a dentist that uses both chemical and autoclave sterilization of his
instruments(more clostly but much safer). full sterile technique is
also used just like that practiced in an or(mask , gloves and gowns worn and
disposed of between patients). each visit costs me 15 dollars more than
the standard and customary fee so i have to pay it out of pocket. his much
higher fees do not drive away patients.

i can not think of any good reason why someone should subject themselves to
this colonic flush procedure. for very little , if any benefit , you
subject yourself to hepatitis , cholera , parasitic disease and even hiv.
just ask yourself why someone might resort to this kind of treatment \?
could they be having gi distress \? could this distress be due to a
pathogenic organism \? could i get this organism if the equipment is not
cleaned properly between patients \? do i really want to take this risk \?

in a previous article , banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu () says
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u.s. it 's really
too bad that most u.s. medical schools do n't cover nutrition because if
they did , candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the
medical profession.

case western reserve med school teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. b12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy , b12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia) , yet i sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis , and , in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like aids and cancer patients ,
systemic candida infection. i think the yeast connection is
a bunch of hooey. what does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught , anyway \?

elisabeth , let 's set the record straight for the nth time , i have not read
the yeast connection . so anything that i say is not due to brainwashing
by this hated book. it 's okay i guess to hate the book , by why hate me \?
elisabeth , i'm going to quote from zinsser 's microbiology , 20th edition.
a book that you should be familiar with and not hate . candida species
colonize the mucosal surfaces of all humans during birth or shortly
thereafter. the risk of endogenous infection is clearly ever present.
indeed , candidiasis occurs worldwide and is the most common systemic
mycosis. neutrophils play the main role in preventing a systemic
infection(candidiasis) so you would have to have a low neutrophil count or
sick neutrophils to see a systemic infection. poor diet and persistent
parasitic infestation set many third world residents up for candidiasis.
your assessment of candidiasis in the u.s. is correct and i do not dispute
it.

what i posted was a discussion of candida blooms , without systemic
infection. these blooms would be responsible for local sites of irritation
(gi tract , mouth , vagina and sinus cavity). knocking down the bacterial
competition for candida was proposed as a possible trigger for candida
blooms. let me quote from zinsser 's again however , some factors , such as
the use of a broad spectrum antibacterial antibiotic , may predispose to
both mucosal and systemic infections . i was addressing mucosal infections
(i like the term blooms better). the nutrition course that i teach covers
this effect of antibiotic treatment as well as the cure . i guess that
your nutrition course does not , too bad.


here is a brief primer on yeast. yeast infections , as they are commonly
called , are not truely caused by yeasts. the most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a
yeast like fungus.

well , maybe i'm getting picky , but i always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in , the other being the
mold form. many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds ,
depending on environment. candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment. should we maybe
call it a mold infection \? a fungus infection \? maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold like fungus.

my , my elisabeth , do i detect a little of steve dyer in you \? if you
noticed my faculty rank , i'm a biochemist , not a microbiologist.
candida is classifed as a fungus(according to zinsser 's). but , as you point
out , it displays dimorphism. it is capable of producing yeast cells ,
pseudohyphae and true hyphae. elisabeth , you are probably a microbiologist
and that makes a lot of sense to you. to a biochemist , it 's a lot of
greek. so i called it a yeast like fungus , go ahead and crucify me.

you know elisabeth , i still have n't been able to figure out why such a small
little organism like candida can bring out so much hostility in people in
sci. med. and i must admitt that i got sucked into the mud slinging too.
i keep hoping that if people will just take the time to think about what
i 've said , that it will make sense. i'm not asking anyone here to buy into

my friend insists that ny quil can be deadly if enough is taken he
suggested something like 20 30 of the night time gelcaps would do someone

have a very hard time believing it. they are

250 g acetaminophen

30 mg pseudoephedrine hcl
10 mg dextromethorphan hbr
6.25 mg doxylamine succinate
(per softgel)

can someone settle our bet (a package of ny quil of course ) what
effect would 20 30 of these babies have \?

the acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this
otc medication. a single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater
can cause hepatotoxicity , and doses of 25 grams or more are
potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis. if i recall
correctly , the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses
involves n hydroxylation to n acetyl benzoquinoneimine , which
is a highly reactive intermediate , which then reacts with
sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione. when hepatic
glutathione is used up , this intermediate then starts
attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic
necrosis. the insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the
delay (2 4 days) between ingestion and clinical signs of liver
damage. this is not a nice way to die.

as to taking 20 30 of these tablets , that comes to 5 7.5 grams
of acetaminophen. in a normal adult , this would probably
cause nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , and loss of appetite.

who take the technique to a far extreme , invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique.

in the case of massage , there is a technique called deep abdominal massage
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines !
the notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies , releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes. by this vigorous and painful procedure , it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.

i just ca n't believe this idea has any truth behind it ! the human intestine
is not a new york city sewer pipe ! and even if it were , you eat half of
a small box of triscuits , and there ai n't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
inner surface of your intestine )

whether this does n't really measure anything and the computer voice

a student told me today that she has been diagnosed with kidney stones , a
cyst on one kidney , and a kidney infection. she was upset because her
condition had been misdiagnosed since last fall , and she has been ill all
this time. during her most recent doctor 's appointment at her parents'
hmo clinic , she said that about forty ! x rays were made of her kidney.
when she asked why so many x rays were being made , she was told by a
technician that they need to see the area from different views , but she
says that about five x rays were made from each angle. she could n't help
feeling that something must be wrong with the procedure or something. she
is a pre med student and feels she could have understood what was
happening if someone would have explained. when nobody would , she got
worried.
also , she is told that thre are 300 ! surgery patients ahead of her
and that they cannot do surgery until august or so. it is now april...
she is supposed to rest a lot and drink fluids. but she has to go to
classes. she wonders why they have given her no medicine. she plans to
call back her doctor 's office clinic and try to get answers to these
questions. but i told her i would also write in to sci.med and see what i
could find out about why there were so many x rays and whether it seems
o.k. to wait in line 3 or more months for surgery for something like this
or whether she should be looking elsewhere for her care. she does plan to
get a second opinion , too.

i will pass info on to her. it never hurts to get information
from more than one source.

a while , and i used ice and medicine again. can anybody explain why this
particular activity , which does not seem to stress me very much generally ,
should cause this shoulder problem \?

you need to use your shoulder muscles to push the mower. if you have n't been
doing much exercise , as i suppose you have n't , then a constant 20 minute

one possible reason is that file' is made with sassafras leaves , while root

there is also some sort of treatment which putatively removes saffrole from

i saw a printed up flyer that stated the person was a
licensed herbologist and iridologist
what are your opinions \?
how much can you tell about a person 's health by looking into their eyes \?


its bogus. see the sci.skeptic faq (i edit it).

you can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes. glaucoma is the
classic example , but there are probably others.

iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes. by
looking at the patterns , striations and occasional blobs in the irises
you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body.

the two questions to ask any alternative therapist are

1 how does it work \?

2 what evidence is there \?

the answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to
evaluate. i do n't know about iridology , but i 've read a book on
reflexology , which is a remarkably similar notion except that the
organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet. there are
supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or
energy of some sort. anatomists have found no such structures.
(always beware the words channel and energy in any spiel put out
by an alternative practitioner.)

the answer to question 2 is rather simpler. if all they have is
anecdotal evidence then forget it. ask for referreed papers in
mainstream medical journals. ignore any bull about the conspiracy of
rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners. studies are done
and papers are published. some of them are even positive.

the word licensed in the flyer is an interesting one. licensed by
whom \? for what \? it is quite possible that the herbology is real and
requires a license you can kill someone by giving them the wrong
plants to eat , and many plants contain very powerful drugs (foxglove
and willow spring to mind). it is not clear whether the license
extends to the iridology , and i suspect that if you ask you will be
told that it means (licensed herbologist) and iridologist .

btw , the usual term is herbalist . why use a different word \?

one of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after
having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old).
otherwise , she is in fine health. the discovery was made via cat scans.

she then had mri scans done , where small cancerous areas were discovered
in her lungs. biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma. one spot is
in the lungs , and another in the pneumothorax. the oncologists believe
the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked
until four years ago).

my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the

medications. the family protested , but the doctors were adamant , telling
us that none of the drugs interact. they even took the attitude that , if
he was disoriented , they should put him on something else as well ! with
the help of an md friend of the family , we had all his medication
discontinued. he had a seizure that night , and was put back on one drug.
two days later , he was his old self again. i guess there are n't many
medical texts that address the subject of 21 way interactions.

i saw the same thing happen to my father , and i can more or less validate your
take on hospitals. it seems to me that medical science understands precious
little about taking care of the human machine. drugs are given as a
response to symptoms (and i guess that makes sense since all the studies that
validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow
assessment of the degree of particular symptoms). but there seems
to be very little appreciation for the well being of a person
outside of the numbers that appear on a test. i watched my dad
wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue
while in the hospital. there is something a little crazy about a
system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every
latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you
have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue. it is
really , really bizarre.

i arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned
from the ct. she was in tears. evidently the technicians in the ct
lab had been very unpleasant to her.

to begin with , they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the
machine itself , and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the
machine , without any explanation. imagine this. you worried you may
have a deadly disease , and next thing you know you 're being put into
this big scary machine , without a word of explanation about what is
going to happen to you. i believe this is inexcusable. she waved her
hand as if to say what are you doing to me , and they responded with
annoyance and anger. next they inserted , or tried to insert , an iv
catheter. apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained
of the pain. the technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare
without any words of explanation.

is there anything i can do about these pigs \?

i realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day
out. and that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative.
but this is simply no excuse. their purpose for existing is to help
sick people , and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior.
fortunately my friend is fine. but i imagine a large proportion of the
people who get ct scans are not fine at all. they have cancer and that
sort of thing. they do n't need this kind of shit.

sodium magnesium calcium phosphorus ratios are , in my opinion , still
the most reliable indicators for the cause , treatment , and prevention

i , for one , will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
one 's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
stones of either type and they definitely wo n't include an increase

srebrenica's doctor recounts town's living hell

by laura pitter
tuzla , bosnia , reuter neret mujanovic was a pathologist
when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged muslim
town of srebrenica last august.
but after treating 4 , 000 mangled victims of bosnia 's bloody
war , he considers himself a surgeon.
``now i'm a surgeon with great experience although i have no
license to practice. but if i operate on a person and he lives
normally that 's the greatest license a surgeon could have.''
evacuated by the u.n. this week to his home town of tuzla ,
the muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of
the horrors of the year long serb siege of srebrenica and the
suffering of the thousands trapped there.
``i lived through hell together with the people of
srebrenica. all those who lived through this are the greatest
heroes that humanity can produce , '' he told reporters.
mujanovic , 31 , had practiced for two months as an assistant
at a local hospital in tuzla , but before going to srebrenica he
had never performed a surgical operation on his own. now he says
he has performed major surgery 1 , 396 times , relying on books for
guidance , amputating arms and legs 150 times , usually without
anesthetic , delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean
sections.
he worked 18 to 19 hour days , slept in the hospital for the
first 10 weeks after his arrival last aug. 5 and treated 4 , 000
patients.
he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from
tuzla , 60 miles northwest of srebrenica. about 50 other people
carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him
through guerrilla terrain , he said.
his worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven serb shells
landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football
field , killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102. half of
the dead were women and children.
the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the
children were playing soccer. ``there was no warning ... the
blood flowed like a river in the street , '' he said.
``there were pieces of women all around and you could not
piece them together. one woman holding her two children in her
hands was lying with them on the ground dead. they had no
heads.''
before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were
deplorable , he said. many deaths could have been prevented had
the hospital had surgical tools , facilities and medicine.
the six general practitioners who had been operating before
he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did. ``they

once he arrived the situation improved , he said , but by
mid september he had run out of supplies.
``bandages were washed and boiled five times ... sometimes
they were falling apart in my hands , '' he said. doctors had no
anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain
because it increased bleeding.
``people were completely conscious during amputations and
stomach operations , '' he said. blood transfusions were
impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types.
``i felt destroyed psychologically , '' mujanovic said.
the situation improved after dec. 4 , when a convoy arrived
from the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres.
but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in
mid december after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in the
region. ``every day we had air strikes and shellings.''
then the hunger set in.
between mid december and mid march , when u.s. planes began
air dropping food , between 20 and 30 people were dying every day
from complications associated with malnutrition , he said.
``i know for sure that the air drop operation saved the
people from massive death by hunger and starvation , '' he said.
according to mujanovic , around 5 , 000 people died in
srebrenica , 1 , 000 of them children , during a year of siege.
mujanovic plans to return to srebrenica in three weeks after
visiting his wife , who is ill in tuzla.
``they say i'm a hero , '' he said. ``there were thousands of

columbus was indeed a crank , but not in the manner you think.

the fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail. it was
also well known that the circumference was about 25k miles , and that you could
not reach asia bo going west with current technology you would neither be
able to carry enough supplies , nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing
weather. nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world. instead ,
they expected him to die at sea.

columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16k miles ,
making the trip practical.

unfortunately for columbus and his shipmates , the earth 's circumference is
indeed 25k miles.

fortunately for columbus and his shipmates , there was a stopping place right
about where asia would have been had the circumference been 16k miles.

organization computer science department , stanford university.

i'm a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better. i applied
to about 20 schools , got two interviews , got one offer , and am waiting to
hear from the other school.

let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical
school admissions process. numbers (gpa , mcats) are not everything ,
but they are probably more important than anything else. in fact , some
schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look
at your other qualities. of course , when this happens , do n't expect a refund
on your 50 application fee.

but , the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers
and are very well qualified academically. you mentioned one response , was it
an acceptance , denial , or wait list \? if i assume the worst , that it was a
denial , then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere. how
did your interviews go \?

as for how long you have to wait , i 've called a few schools who never contacted
me for anything. many of them told me that the interview season for them was
over and that if i have n't heard by now , i can assume a denial. many rejection
letters are not sent out until may or as late as june. but some schools are
still interviewing. i really do n't think you should worry. do n't become
fixated on the mailbox , go out , have fun , be very proud of yourself.

what do people think of the medical school admissions process \? i had a very
mediocre gpa , but high mcat scores , and i have been working as a software
engineer for two years. i majored in computer science at stanford. still ,
i think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted
is something like this

very important

gpa 3.5 or better
mcat top 15 in all subject

medium importance

writing speaking ability
maturity
motivation for going into medicine
activities

less important

college or university
major
work experience
anything else you want them to know


anyway , you are in good shape. i think admissions committees are bound in
many ways by the numbers , but would like very much to understand each
person as an individual. sometimes thats just not practical. but getting
four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers. hopefully , you
were able to impress them with your character.


good luck ,

in article c5snww.5ga@tripos.com , homer@tripos.com (webster homer) writes...
i recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific
brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them.

the principle underlying these devices is a well establish principle in
psychology called 'entrainment , ' whereby external sensory stimuli
influence gross electrical patterns of brain function.

they are 'experimental' in that people experiment with them and they
are not widely (if at all) used in medicine for therapeutic purposes.
given the exception of tens and similar units used for external electrical
stimulation , usually for pain relief , not really a light and sound machine.

they are not experimental in the sense of a specific medical
category to that effect , as with experimental drugs , as the fda does not
specifically regulate medical devices in the way it does pharmaceuticals.

i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful ,

there are few reliable studies of therapeutic or enhancement effects
for mind machines , other than those relaxation related effects found with
meditation or self hypnosis as well. reported benefits are mostly anecdotal and
subjective so far , so it 's hard to generalize about their potential value.

a pretty good general non technical introduction to a wide variety
of these devices may be found in would the buddha wear a walkman \?
some interesting background material , names of suppliers , and capsule reviews
of specific equipment.

do these mind machines (aka light and sound machines) work \? can they induce
alpha , theta , and or delta waves in a person wearing them \? what research if
any has been done on them \? could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer \?
or are they just another bit of quackery \?

a more important question might be whether they have enough additional
value to be worth investing in. 'biofeedback' was found to be a legitimate
and reliable effect experimentally under certain conditions , (in that
it demonstrated that we can influence physiological processes previously
considered purely autonomic) but never panned out as a particularly valuable
therapeutic tool because of the skill level required and the subtlety and
temporary nature of the effects in most cases. maybe someone else
has more , there used to be a whole mailing list devoted to mind machines ,
somewhere on the net.

banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu writes

to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics \? gorden
rubenfeld , through e mail , has assured me that most physicians recognize
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to
restore competetion for candida in the body. i do not believe that this is
yet a standard part of medical practice.

nor is it mine. what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly
understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections
which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections.
marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and
biochemists. anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns
this. at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel
decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt
to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group. i also
use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may
be in part due to alterations in gut flora). however , it is not part of
my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after
antibiotics. i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
fungal infections in at risk patients. whether or not it is a logical
extension from the available observations i 'll leave to those of you who
base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
clinical trials.
one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
recalcitrant cases of c. difficile colitis (not a fungal infection). there
are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate
the patients flora. do n't try this at home.

not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams. since candida
colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area , gi symptoms should be more common
than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use.

except that it is n't. at least symptomatically apparent disease.

medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way. there
has always been the use of conventional wisdom. a very good example is
kidney stones. conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been
done to come up with an effective prevention) , was that restricitng the
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones
from forming. clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to
breakdown the stone once it formed. through the recent new england j of
medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong ,
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is
restricting calcium intake.

seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal
conventional wisdom (a euphemism for no data) and doing a good clinical
trial , like

au dismukes w e. wade j s. lee j y. dockery b k. hain j d.
ti a randomized , double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the
candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments
so n engl j med. 1990 dec 20. 323(25). p 1717 23.
psychological tests. results. the three active treatment regimens
and the all placebo regimen
significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms (p less than
0.001) , but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms
significantly more than placebo. . . .
conclusions. in women with presumed candidiasis
hypersensitivity syndrome , nystatin does not reduce systemic or
psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. consequently ,
the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such
women appears to be unwarranted.

does this trial address every issue raised here , no. jon noring was not
surprised at this negative trial since they did n't use sporanox (despite
crook 's recommendation for nystatin). maybe they did n't avoid those
carbohydrates . . .

the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to
be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.
if it makes sense for livestock , why does n't it make sense for humans
david \? we are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider
yogurt dangerous). if this were a standard part of medical practice , as
gordon r. says it is , then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast
infections should decline.

marty , you 've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric
itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic
hypersensitivity symptoms (noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin
therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (elaine palmer syndrome) with
systemic symptoms. there is significant difference between the cost and
risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials. are we talking about real
candida infections , the whole yeast connection hypothesis , the efficacy
of routine bacterial repopulation in humans , or the ability of anecdotally
effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm
an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc). we ca n't seem to
focus in on a disease , a therapy , or a hypothesis under discussion.

professional regulatory body. the guidelines also emphasize the significance
of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an

properties of an hiv 'vaccine' nature (04 08 93) vol. 362 , no. 6420 , p. 504
(volvovitz , franklin and smith , gale)

the questions raised by moore et al. about recombinant gp160 envelope
glycoprotein precursor from hiv 1 produced by microgenesys are advantages
rather than disadvantages , write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of
microgenesys in meriden , conn. moore et al. says that gp160 in a baculovirus
expression system does not bind strongly to the cd4 receptor , and that this
recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv 1 virus
does in natural infection. but vaccination with recombinant gp160 in
patients infected with hiv 1 broadens hiv 1 specific envelope directed immune
responses , including crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and cd4 and
cd8 cytotoxic t cell responses. volvovitz and smith claim that they never
intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein. antibody
responses against native hiv 1 proteins , including the types described by
moore et al. , exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent

progression of hiv disease. in addition , the binding of gp120 or gp120
antibody complexes to cd4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific
activation of cd4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro , which
may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection. the absence of cd4
binding by the microgenesys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added
safety feature. phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd4 counts ,
stimulation of cytotoxic t cells , and the suggestion of restoration of immune
function. based on these and other clinical results , microgenesys gp160 was
chosen by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first
phase iii vaccine therapy studies , conclude volvovitz and smith.

hiv 1 infection breast milk and hiv 1 transmission lancet (04 10 93) vol.
341 , no. 8850 , p. 930 (mok , jacqueline)

there are still more questions than answers regarding hiv 1 positive
women breastfeeding their babies , writes jacqueline mok of the lancet. the
anti infective properties of milk are well documented. while the numbers of
leukocytes , concentrations of lactoferrin and iga , and lymphocyte mitogenic
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to
barely detectable levels , lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to
twelve months , with 90 percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga.
breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory
illnesses , in both normal and uninfected children born to hiv positive
mothers. the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv
1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than
bottlefed infants (9.7 months). breastfed children also had a slower
progression to aids. there is no agreement on which antibodies offer
protection against hiv 1 infection. studies of the biological properties of
milk from 15 hiv 1 infected women showed the presence of igg and iga
antibodies against envelope glycoproteins , as well as iga antibodies against

et al. of the university of miami school of medicine in miami , fla. the
researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with aids and
attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing. living patients
with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed , and dna sequence analysis
was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the
dentist. death certificates were obtained for deceased patients , and the
medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug
abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail.
there were 1 , 192 patients who had undergone 9 , 267 procedures , of whom 124
were deceased. an examination of the death certificates of patients
identified five who had died with hiv infection , all of whom were either
homosexuals or iv drug users. the researchers were able to detect 962 of the
remaining 1 , 048 patients , and 900 agreed to be tested. hiv infection was
reported in five of the 900 patients , including four who had clear evidence
of risk factors for the disease. one patient who had only a single
evaluation by the dentist denied high risk behavior. comparative dna sequence
analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients
were not closely related. the study suggests the potential for hiv
transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting
in which universal precautions are strictly observed , conclude dickinson et
al.

aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb , study says washington
post (04 22 93) , p. a13

tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once , which makes the
resurging health hazard harder to control , according to a study published in
today 's new england journal of medicine. people who contract tb usually
develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria
again. but a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight
off a new tb infection , doctors found. peter m. small of the howard hughes
medical institute at stanford university , director of the study , said that in
order to protect against reinfection , it may be necessary for some people to
use tb medicines permanently. the study examined the genetic makeup of tb
bacteria and how the germs changed over time in 17 patients at kings county
hospital in new york.

hiv 1 infection breast milk and hiv 1 transmission lancet (04 10 93) vol.
341 , no. 8850 , p. 930 (mok , jacqueline)

there are still more questions than answers regarding hiv 1 positive
women breastfeeding their babies , writes jacqueline mok of the lancet. the
anti infective properties of milk are well documented. while the numbers of

hicnet medical newsletter page 44
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

leukocytes , concentrations of lactoferrin and iga , and lymphocyte mitogenic
activity decline sharply during the first two to three months of lactation to
barely detectable levels , lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to
twelve months , with 90 percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga.
breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory
illnesses , in both normal and uninfected children born to hiv positive
mothers. the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv
1 infected children had a longer median incubation time (19 months) than
bottlefed infants (9.7 months). breastfed children also had a slower
progression to aids. there is no agreement on which antibodies offer
protection against hiv 1 infection. studies of the biological properties of
milk from 15 hiv 1 infected women showed the presence of igg and iga
antibodies against envelope glycoproteins , as well as iga antibodies against
core antigens. binding of hiv 1 to the cd4 receptor can be inhibited by a
human milk factor. in the developing world , where infectious disease and
malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality , breast milk is
still the best food for infants , regardless of the mother 's hiv status.
transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early
milk have been expressed and discarded. the possibility remains that breast
milk could protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and
may even delay progression to aids , concludes mok.

hiv and the aetiology of aids lancet (04 10 93) vol. 341 , no. 8850 , p. 957
(duesberg , peter)

because there is no proof that hiv is the cause of aids , the hypothesis
that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the
physiologically (azt) and psychologically (positive aids test) toxic public
health initiatives , writes peter duesberg of the university of california
berkeley. in the lancet 's march 13 issue , schechter et al. call duesberg 's
hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to
aids , a hindrance to public health initiatives. however , their hypothesis
that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits.
the u.s. government spends 4 billion annually , but no vaccine , no therapy ,
no prevention , and no aids control have resulted from work on this
hypothesis. schechter et al. conclude that hiv has a key role in cd4
depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies
against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals
from vancouver. however , their survey neglects to disprove duesberg 's drug
aids hypothesis , because it does not provide controls i.e. , confirmed drug
free aids cases and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt
use altogether. to refute duesberg 's hypothesis schechter would have to
produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to 10 years
hiv positive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same
aids risks as positives who do not do so. the 10 year period is claimed by

hicnet medical newsletter page 45
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids.
alternatively , they could show that hiv free individuals who have used drugs
for 10 years never get aids defining illnesses , concludes duesberg.

rapid decline of cd4 cells after ifna treatment in hiv 1 infection
lancet (04 10 93) vol. 341 , no. 8850 , p. 959 (vento , sandro et al.)

interferon (ifn) , which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases
in some settings , may hasten cd4 t cell loss in some hiv 1 infected
individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions ,
write sandro vento et al. of the a. pugliese hospital in catanzaro , italy.
the researchers report three asymptomatic hiv 1 infected individuals with
hepatitis c virus related chronic active hepatitis (cah) who had a rapid ,
profound decline of cd4 cells after ifn. all three patients throughout the
observation were consistently negative for serum hiv p24 antigen and had
circulating antibodies to p24. sera from all three patients , obtained at the
end of ifn treatment and testing in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ,
contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the
aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens ,
homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv 1 gp41.
these autoantibodies , which also recognize native class ii molecules and
may contribute to the elimination of cd4 t cells in vivo , were at low tires
(50 100) in all three patients six months after stopping ifn. such
autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with hiv infection and
hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd4 t cell loss
in some hiv 1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful
autoimmune reactions. the subjects had a1 b8 dr3 and b35 , dr1 hla
antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd4 cell
counts and clinical progression of hiv 1 disease. ifn can induce a very
rapid decline of cd4 cells and should be used cautiously in patients with
these hla haplotypes , the researchers conclude.

tb makes a comeback state government news (04 93) vol. 36 , no. 4 , p. 6
(voit , william and knapp , elaine s.)

although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the united
states , it is emerging again among the homeless , aids patients , immigrants ,
minorities , and prisoners. dr. lee b. reichman , professor of medicine at the
university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung
association , said , right now , it 's a big city problem , but potentially it 's
everyone 's problem. the ala predicts that 10 million americans are infected
with tb , and about 10 percent of them will develop the disease because their
immune systems are depressed , especially those with aids or hiv. gene

hicnet medical newsletter page 46
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

tammes , a centers for disease control expert , said that is why the cdc has
issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids with tb
patients. state health officials believe the tb is also spreading because
those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with
treatment. in addition , the increase is attributed to a shortage of public
health services. in new york city , tb is an epidemic because the number of
cases is increasing faster than we can treat people , said dr. george
diferdinando , director of the new york state tb control. according to
diferdinando , curbing the spread of tb entails keeping 85 percent or more of
diagnosed tb cases in treatment. about 40 percent of infected new york city
residents do n't complete therapy. when tb patients do n't finish taking their
medication , multi drug resistant tb can develop , which requires taking more
expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to
treat.

increasing frequency of heterosexually transmitted aids in southern
florida artifact or reality \? american journal of public health (04 93) vol.
83 , no. 4 , p. 571 (nwanyanwu , okey c. et al.)

the alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired aids cases in
southern florida was partially related to misclassification of risk , write
okey c. nwanyanwu et al. of the centers for disease control in atlanta , ga.
the researchers investigated 168 such aids cases from broward and coastal
palm beach counties. all of these cases attributed to heterosexual
transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men , injecting drug users ,
or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route
of hiv transmission. medical records of patients , in addition to records
from social services , hiv counseling and testing centers , and sexually
transmitted disease (std) clinics were reviewed. if no other hiv risk factor
was found from medical record review , patients were interviewed using a
standardized questionnaire. once std clinic and other medical records were
reviewed , 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into other hiv transmission
categories. after adjustments were made for the reclassification , the
percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties
between january 1 , 1989 , and march 31 , 1990 , that was attributed to
heterosexual transmission decreased from 10 percent to 6 percent among men
and from 33 percent to 28 percent among women. while the percentage of
heterosexually transmitted aids cases in southern florida decreased after
adjustment was made for reclassified cases , it still remained above the
national average , the researchers conclude.

hello ,
i heard that a certain disease (toxoplasmosys \? ) is transmitted by cats which
can harm the unborn fetus. does anybody know about it \? is it a problem to
have a cat in the same apartment \?


see the rec.pets.cats faq or any doctor or vet for more information.

i am not any of the above , but we do have a couple of cats.

it is transmitted through the fecal matter , so a pregnant woman should
avoid cleaning the cat tray and you should both wash hands before
preparing or eating meals. the latter is sound advice at any time of
course.

apart from that , its no great problem. you certainly do not need to
get rid of your cats.

paul.

i have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex wife. she has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on ritalin , tofranil , and now
wants to try lithuim at the local doctors suggestion. i would like to
know whatever is important that i should know. i worry about this sort of
thing and would like pros cons regarding lithium therapy.

i get antsy about posts like this. is the concern more for son or about ex w
ife \? \? \? the standard impartial procedure is to ask for a second opinion
about son 's condition.
then too , is son acting out games between divorced parents \? \? \? \?

precisely. one wonders what unusual strain the boy might be under that
could be causing difficulty with his behavior . standard practice would
be to get a second opinion from a child psychiatrist. one would want to
rule out the possibility that the bad behavior is not psychiatric
illness at all.

in a previous article , jeffs@sr.hp.com (jeff silva) says
i was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (yes ,
by a male doctor , so i'm sure some of you women will disagree). i 'd
really like to know the truth in this , so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.



i 've had three children and the pain was different in degree for each. i
think it just depends. i was impressed by how awful a kidney stone seemed
to be , when i saw a relative with one. i bet they depend , too some are
probably worse than others.

hi.

my wife has aquired some thyroidal (sp \? ) deficiency over the past year
that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep , coldness and proneness
to gaining weight. she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary ( \? )
tests and her values were regarded as low. the doctor (and my wife) are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the
gland , giving life long dependency to the drug (hormone \? ). the last couple of
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp \? ) and been given
some drops to re activate either her thyroidal gland and or the
'message center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language ,
but i have n't got many clues to what the english terms are , but the
brain area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)

my questions are has anyone had heard of success in using this approach \?
her values have been (slowly but) steadily sinking , any comment on the
probability of improvement \? although the doctor has told her to 'eat
normally' , my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels
that is part of keeping an edge over the illness condition , may this
affect the treatment , development \?

i can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested , and i
will greatly value any information opinion experience on this topic.

i do n't intend this post to be either a flaming of the established
medical profession or a praise for alternatives , i am just relaying
events as they have happened.

millipedes , i understand , are vegetarian , and therefore almost

carnivorous , and although i do n't have any absolute knowledge on this , i
would tend to think that you 're in no danger from anything but a

not sure of this but i think some millipedes cause a toxic reaction (sting \?

as a child i can remember picking up a centipede and getting a rather painful
sting , but it quickly subsided. much less painful compared to a bee sting.
centipedes have a poison claw (one of the front feet) to stun their prey , but
in my single experience it did not have a lot of bite to it.

not everything that goes in comes out , and personaly i do n't mind giving
my body a hand once in a while.

just my experience ,

george paap

i 've got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery ,
and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme. ordinary massage
is intended to make a person feel better , especially if they have muscular
or joint problems. but like chiropracty there are some practitioners
who take the technique to a far extreme , invoking what seems to me to be
quack science to justify their technique.

in the case of massage , there is a technique called deep abdominal massage
in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines !
the notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the
intestines and putrifies , releasing poisons which cause various disease
syndromes. by this vigorous and painful procedure , it is alleged that
these deposits can be loosened up and passed out.

i just ca n't believe this idea has any truth behind it ! the human intestine
is not a new york city sewer pipe ! and even if it were , you eat half of
a small box of triscuits , and there ai n't gonna be nothin' sticking to the
inner surface of your intestine )

mark , this is the most reasonable post that i 've seen in sci. med. on the
topic of colonic flushing. i'm in a profession that uses manipulation(a
very refined form of massage) to treat various human diseases. proving
that manipulation works has been extremely difficult(as the md 's delight in
pointing out). the osteopathic profession seems to be making better
progress than the chiropractors in proving(scientifically) that their
techingues work. the jaoa recently had a study on the use of manipulation
to relieve mensrual cramps in women with results that were as good or
better than drug treatment(using physiological measurements , and not just
the woman 's preception of improvement). this study was hailed by the jaoa
editors as the turning point in the profession 's long struggle to prove
itself to the medical community.

i'm currently trying to get the aoa(american osteopathic association) which
has supported most of the osteopathic research in the u.s. to also support
nutrition education and research. i 've pointed out , in a grant proposal ,
that the founder of osteopathic medicine(a.t. still) embraced both diet and
manipulation to set himself apart from the md 's of his time who were pushing
only drugs(still was himself an md who got real dissillusioned with drugs
during his service in the civil war). he decided that there had to be a
better way to treat human disease since he saw the cure(drugs) as being
worse than the disease. through his many years of study of the human body ,
he developed his manipulation techniques that he then taught to his
students in the u.s 's first osteopathic medical school. we now have 17.
still used manipulation to treat(and also diagnose) human disease but he
used diet to prevent human disease. i'm trying to get the osteopathic
profession to return to it 's roots and beat the md 's to the punch(so to
speak). both do 's and md 's in current medical practice have very little
understanding of how diet affects human health. this has to change.

sure there are quacks. there are quacks who do n't treat and quacks who
treat. one 's that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly.
there are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks. smart quacks and dumb ones.

there are people ahead of their time , with unprobable or unproven theories
and rationals. there are ill reasoned , absurd , theorists.

sometimes it 's hard to tell who 's who.

reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
quacks in babylon.

arguments abound when there are n't any firm answers. plenty of illnesses
are n't , or ca n't , be diagnosed or treated. but i think it 's better to argue
against the theory , as was originally done with postings on candida a month
or so ago. stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
opinion about someone 's competency. and you ca n't convince everybody.

sometimes a correct diagnosis
takes years for people they do n't run into a doctor who recognizes the
disease , they have n't developed something recognizable yet , or they have
something that no one is going to recognize , because it has n't been
described yet. sometimes they get a cure , sometimes the illness wears out ,
sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment ,
sometimes they find it 's incurable.

there is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an
illness. unless it 's a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it 's is
more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking.

maybe one of you can explain this. from time to time i experience

can be best described as the feeling of losing gravity , like that one
experiences in a descending elevator. needless to say , it is not
enjoyable. it sometimes comes with shortness of breath and extreme
fatigue. it lasts from a few minutes to an hour and when it lasts
that long , it makes me sweatening.

initially i called it palpitation (spelling \? ) until i later learnt that
the terminology has been reserved for the self awareness of heart beats.

so , is there a specific term for this feeling , or am i a stragne person \?

our 20 month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care. he was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once. now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month. most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well , with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4. i know kids in day care fall sick more often , but we
...

sounds pretty familiar. i posted similar cries about last september when
caroline just entered daycare. she was two , then , and have been with
continuous colds since until last march. as spring approaches , her colds
slowed down. meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds.
only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she
had antibiotics. (the other time was due to sinus infection , and i wished
that i did not give her that awful septra.)

are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions \?

there are the 'net studies' that is , if you read this newsgroup often ,
there will be a round of questions like this every month. there might
be formal studies like that , but bear with my not so academic experience.
okay \?

how often do kids in their first , second and third years fall sick \?
how often do they get colds , flus , ear infections \?

gee , i bet 50 50 you 'll hear cases in all these catagories.

is there any data on home care vs. day care \?

i am pretty sure , an insulated child at home sicks less. but , that child
still will face the world one day.


does being sick build immunity (leading to less illness later) ,

that 's what i believe and comfort myself with. caroline will get more
and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other
kid 's mouth nor let other kids do the same. cold virus mutate easily.
however , i hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these
diseases , so she would be less severely affected. everytime she has a cold ,
we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her dorcol or dimetapp
at night so she can have good rest (thanks to some suggestions from the net).
that 's about all the care she needs from us. i try very hard to keep her
off antibiotics. twice her ped. gave me choice to decide whether she would
have antibiotics. i waited just long enough (3 4 days) to see that she
fought the illness off. i do understand that you do n't have much choice if
the child is in pain and or high fever.

does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) , or does it
not have any long term effect \?

if the child does n't rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime ,
then the child should be stronger.


does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects \?

i 'll leave this to expert.

how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal , and what does one do about it \?

if your child just entered daycare , i'm pretty sure the first 6 months will be
the hardest. (then , you get more used to it. boy , do i hate to see me typing
this sentence. i recall when i read something like this last september , i said
to myself , 'oh , sure.' but , i do get used to it , now.) however , i do hear
people say that it does get better after a year or two. i am looking forward
to a healthier next winter. as it gets warmer , i hope you do get some break
soon.

is there any way to build immunity and resistance \?

eat well , sleep well. try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary.

good luck.

fda approves depo provera , injectable contraceptive
p92 31 food and drug administration
for immediate release susan cruzan (301) 443 3285


the food and drug administration today announced the approval of depo provera ,
an injectable contraceptive drug.

the drug , which contains a synthetic hormone similar to the natural hormone
progesterone , protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection.
the hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is
released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy. it is more than 99 percent
effective.

this drug presents another long term , effective option for women to prevent
pregnancy , said fda commissioner david a. kessler , m.d. as an injectable ,
given once every three months , depo provera eliminates problems related to
missing a daily dose.

depo provera is available in 150 mg. single dose vials from doctors and
clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive
protection. if a patient decides to become pregnant , she discontinues the
injections.

as with any such products , fda advises patients to discuss the benefits and
risks of depo provera with their doctor or other health care professional
before making a decision to use it.

depo provera 's effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive
studies by the manufacturer , the world health organization and health agencies
in other countries. u.s. clinical trials , begun in 1963 , also found depo
provera effective as an injectable contraceptive.

the most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain. in
addition , some patients may experience headache , nervousness , abdominal pain ,
dizziness , weakness or fatigue. the drug should not be used in women who have
acute liver disease , unexplained vaginal bleeding , breast cancer or blood
clots in the legs , lungs or eyes.

the labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the
drug , due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug.

hicnet medical newsletter page 14
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

recent data have also demonstrated that long term use may contribute to
osteoporosis. the manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this
potential effect.

depo provera was developed in the 1960s and has been approved for
contraception in many other countries. the upjohn company of kalamazoo , mich. ,
which will market the drug under the name , depo provera contraceptive
injection , first submitted it for approval in the united states in the 1970s.
at that time , animal studies raised questions about its potential to cause
breast cancer. worldwide studies have since found the overall risk of cancer ,
including breast cancer in humans , to be minimal if any.

new rules speed approval of drugs for life threatening illnesses
p92 37 food and drug administration
monica revelle (301) 443 4177

the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new
rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life
threatening illnesses , such as aids , cancer and alzheimer 's disease.

these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious
illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would
otherwise be possible , said hhs secretary louis w. sullivan , m.d. the effort
to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long term commitment and
indeed a hallmark of this administration.

these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to
approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers. they apply when the
drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies. such
endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in
themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified
scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient.

use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval
earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or
prevention of disability and death from the disease are used.

the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and
effectiveness , based on surrogate endpoints , can be reasonably established.
the drug 's sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct
postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug 's effect on the surrogate
endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness.

one new drug zalcitabine (also called ddc) was approved june 19 , using a
model of this process , for treating the human immunodeficiency virus , hiv , the
cause of aids.

accelerated approval can also be used , if necessary , when fda determines that
a drug , judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease , can be used
safely only under a restricted distribution plan.

the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process
without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight , said fda
commissioner david a. kessler , m.d. while drug approval will be accomplished
faster , these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and
effectiveness standards required by law.


hicnet medical newsletter page 16
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if the
postmarketing studies do not verify the drug 's clinical benefit , if there is
new evidence that the drug product is not shown to be safe and effective , or
if other specified circumstances arise that necessitate expeditious withdrawal
of the drug or biologic.

research shows promise for preventing or slowing
blindness due to retinal disease

national retinitis pigmentosa foundation

neutrophilic factors rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests

baltimore , md researchers at the university of california san francisco
and regeneron pharmaceuticals , inc. nasdaq regn have discovered that
certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can
prevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the eye. the
degeneration of these cells , known as photoreceptors , is a major cause of
visual impairment
this research , published to in the december issue of the proceedings of
the national academy of science (pnas) , holds promise for people who may lose
their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently , no drug
treatment for retinal degeneration exists. it is estimated that 2.5 million
americans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and
100 , 000 americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus , a hereditary disease
that causes blindness. in addition , each year more than 15 , 000 people undergo

eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their
photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light
exposure. brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) and ciliary neurotrophic
factor (cntf) were particularly effective in this model without causing
unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor (ngf) and
insulin like growth factor (igf 1) were not effective in these experiments.
discussing the research , dr. jesse m. cedarbaum , regeneron 's director of
clinical research , said , bdnf 's ability to rescue neurons in the retina that
have been damaged by light exposure may hold promise for the treatment of age
related macular degeneration , one of the leading causes of vision impairment ,
and for retinal detachment. following detachment , permanent vision loss may

result frorn the death of detached retinal cells. it is possible that bdnf
could play a role in rescuing those cells once the retina has been reattached
surgically.
retinitis pigmentosa is a slowly progressing disease that causes the
retina to degenerate over a period of years or even decades. vision decreases
to a small tunnel of sight and can result in total blindness. it is our hope
that research on growth factors will provide a means to slow the progression
and preserve useful vision throughout life , stated jeanette s. felix , ph.d. ,

affluent diet increases risk of heart disease

research resources reporter
written by mary weideman
nov dec 1992
national institutes of health


high fat , high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary
heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have
traditionally consumed diets low in fat. these findings , according to
investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland , have
serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing
countries.
this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and
have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. it shows also the
importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body
weight , thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing
countries and affluent nations as well , explains principal investigator dr.
william e. connor , head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid
metabolism at oregon health sciences university.
over the past 25 years dr. connor and his team have characterized the
food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico , while
simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism.
these native mexicans number approximately 50 , 000 and reside in the sierra
madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua. the tarahumaras have
coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing. probably as a result , coronary
heart disease , which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations , is
virtually non existent in their culture. loosely translated , the name
tarahumara means fleet of foot , reflecting a tribal passion for betting on
kickball races , in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more
while kicking a machete carved wooden ball.
the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans , tortillas ,
and pinole , a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water ,
together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables. the tara humaras
also eat small amounts of game , fish , and eggs. their food contains
approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority (69
percent) is of vegetable origin. dietician martha mcmurry , a coinvestigator
in the study , describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while
low in cholesterol and fat.
the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg dl ,
low density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol levels of 72 mg dl , and high density
lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg dl. all of those values
are in the good , low risk range , according to the researchers. elevated
cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart

hicnet medical newsletter page 20
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

disease. hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial. in previous studies the
tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease , although
able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl
cholesterol.
clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria
teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school
building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi. food
was weighed , cooked , and fed to the study participants under the
investigators' direct supervision , ensuring that subjects ate only food
stipulated by the research protocol. fasting blood was drawn twice weekly ,
and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr. connors laboratory for
cholesterol , triglyceride , and lipoprotein analyses. regular measurements
included participant body weight , height , and triceps skin fold thickness.
thirteen tarahumaras , five women and eight men , including one adolescent , were
fed their native diet for 1 week , followed by 5 weeks of an affluent diet.
in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40
percent of total calories. this is the prototype of the holiday diet that
many americans consume a diet high in fat , sugar , and cholesterol , low in
fiber , elaborates dr. conners. such dietary characteristics are reflected in
the cholesterol saturation index , or csi , recently devised research dietitian
sonja conner working with dr. connor. the csi is a single number that
incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in
the diet. csi indicates the diet 's potential to elevate the cholesterol
level , particularly the ldl , dr. connor explains. the tarahumaran diet
averages a very low csi of 20 dr. connor 's affluent diet used in the study
ranks a csi of 149.
the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of
establishing baseline plasma lipid levels , typical of the native diet , before
exposing subjects to the experimental diet. the standard curve relating
dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off , or
plateau , for consumption of large amounts of fat. changes in dietary fat
and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels. you
must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put
into the experimental diet. the framingham study , for example , did not
discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease
because the diet was already high in fat. all subjects were already eating on
a plateau , dr. connor says.
after 5 weeks of consuming the affluent diet , the subjects' mean plasma
cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent , primarily in the ldl
fraction , which rose 39 percent. hdl cholesterol increased by 31 per cent ,
and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little. plasma triglyceride
levels increased by 18 percent , and subjects averaged an 8 pound gain in
weight. according to dr. connor , lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon ,
yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35
days.

hicnet medical newsletter page 21
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized
nations. we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amount
of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic
study. in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary
cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption.
in the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total
calories. we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects
the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary
cholesterol. hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat , and it increased
quite a bit in this study , dr. connor explains.
low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of
coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of
fat or cholesterol. hdl remains an important predictor to americans because
of their usual high fat intake.
dr. connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20
percent of total calories as fat , less than 100 mg of cholesterol , and a csi
around 20 , varying in accordance with caloric needs. such a diet is low in
meat and dairy fat , high in fiber. dr. connor also comments on recent
suggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet. the original
mediterranean diet , in its pristine state , consisted of a very low intake of
fat and very few animal and dairy products. we are already eating a lot of
meat and dairy products. simply to continue that pattern while switching to
olive oil is not going to help the situation.
the world health organization (who) is focusing much attention on the
emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies
undergoing technological development. dr. connor says that coronary heart
disease starts with a given society 's elite , who typically eat a different
diet than the average citizen. if the pattern of afluence increases , the
entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease ,
which places a termendous health care burden on a society. who would like the
developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease , so they can
concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public
health measures to improve general well being , rather than paying for
unnecessary , expensive medical technology , dr. connors says.
the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move
their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a
very short time by an affluent , excessive diet. the present rate of coronary
heart disease in the united states is 30 percent less than it was 20 years
ago , so a lot has been accomplished. we are changing rapidly , he concludes.

recently heard that there is some suspicion that the mercury is a breeding
ground for bacteria that will be resistant to antibiotics.

my dentist wants to use an amalgam filling for me in a place where i have
two cavaties in one tooth and wants to use one filling to cover both.
he says that composite filling do n't hold up well when they are large.
so , i would like to know if there are any other choices besides amalgam
and composite. and , should i really even be worried about amalgam \? i
heard that some scandanavian country does not even use them any more
is this true.

any information you can give me will be greatly appreciated.

i am neither a real believer , nor a disbeliever when it comes to
so called paranormal stuff but as far as i'm concerned , it is just
as likely as the existence of , for instance , a god , which seems to be
quite accepted in our societies without any scientific basis.

i am convinced that it is a serious mistake to close your mind to
something , anything , simply because it does n't fit your current frame
of reference. history shows that many great people , great scientists ,
were people who kept an open mind and were ridiculed by sceptics.

how did you get the idea that skeptics are closed minded \? why do n't you
consider the possibility that they came to their conclusions by the
proper methods \? besides , one can come to a conclusion without closing
one 's mind to other possibilities.

i you do n't agree with a person , please ask him why he thinks like that ,
instead of insulting him. perhaps he 's right. follow your own advice ,
be open minded.

if you do n't post a bit of evidence for your claims , i 'll complain that

reply to ohandley@betsy.gsfc.nasa.gov
organization nasa goddard space flight center greenbelt , md usa
lines 49

can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the
following two health problems

first , i was recently diagnosed (using a ugi series) as having a
schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia. as i understand it ,
the hernia is a relatively minor problem , though i do occasionally
have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it. the schatzki
ring , on the other hand , is causing swallowing difficulty. in particular ,
if i'm not careful about eating slowly , and thoroughly chewing food ,
food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach. this results
in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction.
fortunately , the food has always managed to pass , but this is annoying ,
and causes frequent discomfort.

my doctor wants to dilate the ring using the
following procedure use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach
for any inflammation , then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing
some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous. i would like to know
if anyone out there has had this (or a similar) procedure done if so ,
was it painful , successful , etc. also , can anyone comment on
safety , advisability , and success rate of this procedure \? has it become
a common procedure \? i am kind of leery of having such an invasive sounding
procedure performed for a (currently) non threatening condition such as this ,
especially considering the possible side effects (bleeding , perforation ,
reaction to anesthesia).

the second issue for the past 3 4 years i have had a large number
of extra heartbeats. in particular , during the past month or so there
has been a dramatic increase a holter monitor recently showed 50 pvc 's in 24
hrs , along with a few pac 's. (many days , there are far more than this ,
however five to ten per hour). all of them were isolated , and the cardiologist
indicated that such a number was normal . it certainly does n't
feel normal. in the past there have also been a couple of episodes of
extended runs of these beats , one of which lasted long enough to cause
severe light headedness. i am relatively young (30 ish) , thin and in good
health (recent bloodtests were all normal) , and do not smoke , use drugs or
caffeine , etc. i'm willing to accept the extra beats as normal , but do n't
want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. the number
of pvc 's seems to increase throughout the day , and with exercise (or something
as simple as climbing some stairs). also , if i get up after sitting or lying
down for a while , i tend to get a couple of extra beats. could they possibly
be related to the esophagous problems \? both seemed to develop at about the
same time.

thanks for any help advice !

hi ,

i 've just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few
concerns that maybe y'all can help me with. i 've been seeing
her every 4 weeks for the past few months (i'm at week 28)
and during the last 2 visits i 've gained 9 to 9 1 2 pounds every
4 weeks. she said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period.
as it stands i 've thus far gained 26 pounds. also she says that
though i'm at 28 weeks the baby 's size is 27 weeks , i think she
mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus. when i was 13
weeks the baby 's size was 14 weeks. i must also add , that i had
an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i 've had no
problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain
in my pelvic region during the pregnancy , and i have a very
difficult time moving , and the doc has recommended i not walk or
move unless i have to. (i have a little handicapped sticker for
when i do need to go out.)

anyway that 's 1 2 of the situation the other is that almost from
the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick (throwing up) about
2 3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.
(i told her about this). i know this because i was n't eating
very much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'. well
now i only get sick about once every 1 2 weeks , and it is still bile
related. but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my
upper right abdomen , just below the right breast , usually when i
was lying on my right side. it began to get worse though because
it started to hurt when i lay on my right side , and then it hurt
no matter what position i was in. next , i noticed that when i
ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had
turned to stone , and the pain in the area got worse. however if
i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it
was n't as much of a problem.

so the doctor says i have cholistatis , and that i should avoid
fatty foods. this makes sense , and because i was already aware
of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have
been avoiding these foods on my own. but i'm still able to eat
foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.

but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet. this means no meat
except fish and chicken w o skin (i do this anyway). no nuts ,
fried food , cheese etc. i am allowed skim milk. she said i
should avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas). also i must only
have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day (
potatoes , pasta , rice) ! she said i ca n't even cook vegetables in
a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or
steamed. i'm concerned because i understand you need to have
some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process. and if
i'm not taking in fat , is she expecting the baby will take it
from my stores \? and why this restriction on carbohydrates if
she 's concerned about fat \? i'm not clear how much of her
recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on
cholistatis , which i ca n't seem to find any information on. she
originally said that i should only gain 20 pounds during the
entire pregnancy since i was about 20 lbs overweight when i
started. but my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and
she 's taken it all off and has n't had any problems. she also
asked if any members of my family were obese , which none of them
are. anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain ,
and feel like i'm being 'punished' by a severe diet. she did
want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be
temporary for that one week.

what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet \? i
would understand if she had said low fat diet , since i'm trying
that anyway , even if she said really low fat diet. i think she
assumes i must be eating a high fat diet , but really it is that
because of the endometriosis and the operation i'm not able to
use the energy from the food i do eat.

any opinions , info and experiences will be appreciated. i'm
truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet
because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few
minutes and i 'll end up having to eat constantly. thus far i
do n't find any foods satisfying.

thanks

for one week , she probably wants to see how you react to the diet. if it
changes anything.

you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories. where before you
had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple (probably microwave
cooked). smaller meals but more of them. not terrific amounts of meat , it 's
hard to digest anyway.

for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or
rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn. maybe
smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area. is the
baby still coming up. is it starting to push or rub under your ribs \? how
tight are your clothes. you should n't be wearing any clothing that compresses
your middle. be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting , again it
will put pressure on the digestive tract.

try laying on your sides , back ,
and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive.
easier on your legs (circulation) as well. you might try letting the baby
turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months.
when you are shortwaisted it 's easy for that baby to end up right under the
diaphram , especially if you have tight abdominal muscles. if i had my
second one to do over again i think i 'd have tried to loosen up since he
did n't turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous.


maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe
she just nags all her patients this way. especially if she 's young.
but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something
to be avoided if possible.

nausea , etc. can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy. my
first pregnancy was miserable. during the second i had very little trouble.
some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better
chance of carrying their baby. (grain of salt here)

good luck

adults. the change in environment can cause problems. anesthetic
agents
can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out
of
the body as easily.

the original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital
but i can answer a few general points.

elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after
being in hospital for a few days. the drastic change of environment
will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home. even
young people find the change unsettling.

though we have thought that this decrement in function after say
anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip (a common event in the
elderly) was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the
change of situation is much more important. some hospitals have
tried a 'rapid transit' system for hip fractures , aiming to have the
patient back at home within 24 hours of admission. the selection of
the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these
patients early.

anaesthetists who work with the elderly (which is almost all of us)
generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to
the individual patient. even so , there is some evidence that full
mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return. this is
the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult
tasks , not the gross change that the original poster noted.

haloperidol (haldol tm) is a long acting drug. the plasma half life
of the drug is up to 35 hours. if the decanoate (a sort of slow
release formulation) is used it may be weeks. the elderly are
sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons. without knowing
more it is hard to comment.

my wife has requested that i poll the sages of usenet to see what is
known about the use of chromium in weight control diet suppliments.
she has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind
real information.

my first impulse was yuck ! a metal ! but i have zero data on it.

what do you know \?


henry melton

i 'll tell you all that i know about chromium. but before i do , i want to
get a few things off my chest. i just got blasted in e mail for my kidney
stone posts. kidney stones are primarily caused by diet , as is heart
disease and cancer. when i give dietary advise , it is not intended to
encourage people reading this news group(or sci. med. nutrition where i do
most of my posting) to avoid seeing a doctor. nothing can be further from
the truth. kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to
be ruled out. but once it is , diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance.
same thing with heart disease and cancer , if you suspect that you may have
a problem with one of these diseases , do n't use what i'm going to tell you
or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor. you have to go.
hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help
you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment
program(but the odds are that you will not and that 's why i'm here). when
my wife detected a lump in here breast i did n't say , do n't worry my vitamin
e will take care of it. any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician ,
plan and simple. if it 's begnin(which most are) fine , then maybe a diet
change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring.
but let me tell you right now , if you have tried diet and supplementation
and another lump returns , get your butt into the doctor 's office as fast as
your little feet can carry you(better yet , have a mammography done on a
regular basis , my wife kept putting her 's off , both myself and her
gynocologist told her she needed to have one done). her gynocologist even
scheduled one , but she did n't show up(too busy running the operating room for
the biggest hospital in tulsa).

one more thing , i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist. this group uses
high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease. there is
absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have
drug actions in the body. but you talk about flying blind , man this is
really blind treatment. no drug could ever be used as these vitamins and
minerals are being used. i'm not saying that some of this stuff could n't
be right on the money , it may well be. but my approach to nutrition is a
lot like that of weinsier and morgan , the two m.d 's who wrote the new
clinical nutrition textbook. my push is the nutrient reserves and the lab
tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet
changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you
handle stress. that 's where i'm coming from folks. blast away if you want ,
i'm not going to change. put me in your killfile if you want , i really
do n't care. i'm averaging 8 10 e mail messages a day from people who think
that i 've got something important to say. but i'm also getting hit by a
few with an axe to grind. that 's life.

chromium is one of the trace elements. it has a very limited(but very
important) role in the body. it is used to form glucose tolerance factor
(gtf). gtf is made up of chromium , nicinamide(niacin) , glycine , cysteine
and glutamic. only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to
form gtf. some foods already have gtf(liver , brewers or nutritional yeast ,
and black pepper). when chromium is in gtf , a pretty good absorption is
seen(about 20 ). but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral
chelate(chromium picolinate) it 's absorption is much lower(1 to 2 , lowest
for all the minerals). i 've been posting in misc. fitness and chromium has
come up there several times as a fat burner . chromium is among the least
toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really
do any harm. i would n't do it though. the adequate and safe range for
chromium is 50 to 200ug per day. the average american is getting about
30ug per day from his her diet. chromium levels decrease with age and many
believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency. i
can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in
type ii diabetes but i'm not going to because for each positive one , there
also seems to be a negative one as well. i'm convinced that the problem is
bioavailability. when yeast(gtf) is used , good results are obtained but when
chromium itself is used the results are usually negative. in addition to
type ii diabetes , chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and
glucoma , again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is
concerned

since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease ,
this possible link with chromium is n't too surprising. glucoma is a little
more interesting. muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin
responsive glucose driven metabolic function. if this eye focusing activity
is impaired(by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response) , intraocular
pressure is believed to be elevated. in a fairly large study of 400 pts with
glaucoma , the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium. j. am. coll.
nutr. 10(5) 536 , (1991). but this one preliminary study should not prompt
people to go out and start popping chromium supplements. for one thing ,
just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unless
they have been taking chromium suppleemnts(yeast). since glucoma is often
found in older people , it 's not too surprising that chromium was low in the
rbc 's. if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma , that would
prompt some attention. i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to
check out this possible chromium link to glucoma.

you could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbc
chromium test or hair analysis. most clinical labs are not going to run a
rbc chromium. there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail
analysis for you , but i would n't use them. there is just too much funny
business going on in these unregulated labs right now.

here 's weinsier and morgan , advise on chromium. they do not consider
chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is
available(they do n't like the hair and nail analysis labs either , and they
also recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is not
routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs). this has to change
and as more labs run a rbc chromiuum , it will. what then do they suggest \?
make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical
response to chromium(run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium
supplementation). once you make the diagnosis , put the patient on 200ug of
crcl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day.

what 's my advise \? do n't take chromium supplements to try to loose weight
(they just do not work that way). if you want to take them and then
exercise , that would be great. do include yeast as part of your diet(most
americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet). if you do have
a poor glucose tolerance , ask your doctor to check your chromium status.
when he or she says , what in the world are you talking about , just say ,
please get a copy of weinsier and morgan 's new clinical nutrition textbook
and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose
tolerance. if you ca n't do that , i 'll find a doctor who can , thank you
very much.

summary two important clarifications to previous post of mine ...


this is to followup my previous reply on this topic , which it has been
pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots.

1. i stated that psychotherapy (meaning talking therapy and so on) was used
to treat obsessive compulsive disorder , which though sometimes true is
misleading. it is not often found effective , particularly by itself.
primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug
therapy. the most current theories of this condition attribute
it to more to biological causes than psychological , in places where this
distinction becomes important.

2. i mentioned that the dsm iiir mentions 'impulses' as a possible
diagnostic marker. however , this might look like something
people associate with psychotic conditions , uncontrollable or
unpredictable behaviors , which is not the case with ocd.
one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individual
can and does suppress some of their 'impulses , ' although they
are an unending source of anxiety.
the obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with
ocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable , closer to
a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part.

use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due
to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics \?

i guess i'm still not clear on what the term candida bloom means ,
but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.
this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome , the quack
diagnosis that has been being discussed.


found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida. women have been known
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and
not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams.

lucky how \? since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of
oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis , i 've mentioned to a
number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily. it turns out most would
rather just use anti fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

yogurt dangerous). if this were a standard part of medical practice , as
gordon r. says it is , then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast
infections should decline.

again , this just is n't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about , and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.
there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy do n't seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea , but i do n't think anyone would view this as a
quack therapy.

david rind

yogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus and l. bulgaricus. l.
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free. most of
the commercial yogurt sold in the u.s. has a very low l. acidophilus and l.
bulgaricus count. neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem. gordon r. has told
me through e mail that he gives his patients l. acidophilus and several
different obligate anaerobes(which set up shop in the colon) but he has n't
told me which ones yet. the lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative
anaerobes and will set up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a
chance(mouth , anus , sinus cavity and vagina). having these good bacteria
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal
region or the vagina. i have not proposed a systemic action for candida
blooms. i know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from
the evil yeast blooms in the body. i'm not ready to buy that yet. i do
believe that complications at specific sites(vagina , anal and maybe lower
colon , sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.
restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get
rid of the problem. anti fungals , a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin a
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the
ph to basically starve the candida out.

subject resurgence of infectious disease concerns cdc
date thursday april 15 , 1993

atlanta (upi) a resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly
emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation 's
health care system , federal health officials said thursday.

the centers for disease control and prevention , reporting its latest
findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that
sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four , said it will
put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases.

part of that emphasis includes a new series titled emerging
infectious diseases to be featured in the cdc 's morbidity mortality
weekly report , which has a wide circulation in the health community.
the issue also will top the agenda of a two day meeting of scientific
counselors to update the cdc 's draft plan for dealing with the growing
threat of infectious ailments.

this is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility
to deal with it , said dr. ruth berkelman , deputy director of the cdc 's
national center for infectious diseases.

there were more cases of malaria in the u.s. in 1992 than in any year
since the 1960s , and latin america is experiencing a cholera epidemic ,
the first in this century , she said.

resistance of disease causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem.
we are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past
berkleman said. she said even common ear infections frequently seen in
children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment.

despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases
would soon be eliminated as a public health problem , infectious diseases
remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness
and death in the united states , the cdc said.

it cited the emergence since the 1970s of a myriad of newly
identified pathogens and syndromes , such as escherichia coli o157 h7 , a
deadly bacterial infection the hepatitis c virus hiv , the virus that
causes aids legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome.

the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control ,
such as cholera , malaria and tuberculosis , have increased in many areas ,
the cdc said. it said efforts at control and prevention have been
undermined by drug resistance.

headline lyme disease ruling raises liability issues

the tick that causes lyme disease may have found a new way to cause
damage legal liability.

a federal judge 's decision holding a property owner liable for not
doing enough to protect workers from lyme disease is getting as much
attention as the latest medical study on the disease , a flu like
illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in
rare instances death. the decision last week has put property owners
on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from
the ticks they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if
someone becomes infected while on the property.

the decision by u.s. district judge robert j. ward in new york came
after a week long trial in a case involving four track workers for the
long island railroad. judge ward found that the workers contracted the
disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job. he ordered
the new york state owned commuter line to pay the workers more than
560 , 000 to compensate for pain and suffering , in addition to medical
expenses and lost wages.

summer camps , schools , companies with facilities in rural or
semirural areas , and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the
groups that need to be worried about this ruling , says stephen l.
kass , an attorney at new york law firm berle , kass case , who wrote a
legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential
liability. even a family that invites friends over for a backyard
barbecue might be potentially liable.

lawsuits for insect bites , while rare , are n't unheard of. a summer
vacationer in southampton , n.y. , last year sued the owner of the home
she rented , claiming that a tick on the property gave her rocky
mountain spotted fever. in 1988 , also on long island , a jury ordered
an outdoor restaurant to pay more than 3 million to a patron who was
stung by a bee , causing an allergic reaction and permanent
quadriplegia. the judge later threw out the award , citing no evidence
that a beehive was near the restaurant.

but lawyers say that the attention to lyme disease throughout the
country it 's most prevalent in new england , the middle atlantic
states , wisconsin , minnesota and the northwest may make this
particular insect bite a particularly litigious one.

the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the
courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will
cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not
diagnosing the disease.

lawyers say worker 's compensation claims related to lyme disease
have become common in some states in recent years. payments in
worker 's compensation cases , however , are limited to medical costs and
lost earnings.

the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more
lucrative avenue for damages , because it involved the question of
negligence. unlike the worker 's compensation process , the law governing
injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and , as a
result , for additional payments for pain and suffering. property
owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many
other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the
disease.

ira m. maurer , a partner at new york law firm elkind , flynn
maurer , who represented the rail workers , says the decision will help
to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect
against lyme disease.

lawyers caution that despite judge ward 's decision , winning a
lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult. for
one thing , victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when
and where they got the tick bite. judge ward found that the plaintiffs
in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned
by the railroad , even though none of the men remembered being bitten.
the workers , who were n't outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to
the insects , said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded
some work sites.

a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that
the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is
considering an appeal. the railroad also disputes judge ward 's finding
that it did n't do enough to protect employees. the spokeswoman says
the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special
pants to protect against bug bites.

debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up
some legal defenses for property owners , such as questioning whether a
victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness.
earlier this week , the journal of the american medical association
reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease.
and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical
disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes.

because of health and safety concerns , some groups and companies
already take special measures to protect against lyme disease. last
year , at its headquarters in franklin lakes , n.j. , becton , dickinson
co. began using damminix , a pesticide made by ecohealth inc. of boston
that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease. the medical
supply company 's headquarters include a 120 acre park , and the company
was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might
get infected.

ruth lister , a spokeswoman for the american camping association in
indianapolis , says that many youth camps accredited by her
organization also have begun to check children for ticks. and carole
katz , a member of the board of the fire island pines property owners
association , says her group spends 30 , 000 each year to treat their
100 acre site off the coast of new york with the tick killing
pesticide.



title urinary dysfunction in lyme disease.
authors chancellor mb mcginnis de shenot pj kiilholma p hirsch ih ,
department of urology , jefferson medical college , thomas jefferson
university , philadelphia , pennsylvania.
reference j urol 1993 jan 149 (1) 26 30

lyme disease , which is caused by the spirochete borrelia burgdorferi , is
associated with a variety of neurological sequelae. we describe 7 patients
with neuro borreliosis who also had lower urinary tract dysfunction.
urodynamic evaluation revealed detrusor hyperreflexia in 5 patients and
detrusor areflexia in 2. detrusor external sphincter dyssynergia was not
noted on electromyography in any patient. we observed that the urinary tract
may be involved in 2 respects in the course of lyme disease 1) voiding
dysfunction may be part of neuro borreliosis and 2) the spirochete may
directly invade the urinary tract. in 1 patient bladder infection by the
lyme spirochete was documented on biopsy. neurological and urological
symptoms in all patients were slow to resolve and convalescence was
protracted. relapses of active lyme disease and residual neurological
deficits were common. urologists practicing in areas endemic for lyme
disease need to be aware of b. burgdorferi infection in the differential
diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction. conservative bladder
management including clean intermittent catheterization guided by urodynamic
evaluation is recommended.

with inanimate objects.

true.. but what about showing the missing part of a leaf \? is this
corona discharge \?

yup. the demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates , and taking a kirlian photograph of it. you then cut off part of
the leaf , put the top plate back on , and take another kirlian photograph. you
see pretty much the same image in both cases. turns out the effect is n't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs. seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity. surprise , surprise !

a from some of the replies to my original posting , it 's evident that some
a people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected

include small amounts of hot , spicy foods with your meals. it 's
not a cure , but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus.
you may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water
(consult your doctor first ! ) , which is available otc in canada.
if you have a sedentary lifestyle , exercising sometimes helps.

a from environmental influences (ie , dry air). but i 've had no responses
a from anyone with experience with rutin. is there another newsgroup that

a might have specifics on herbal remedies \?
a
a robert allison

i tried to e mail you , but our board is having internet problems ,
so i'm not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not.

rutin is not a herb , but part of the bioflavonoid complex. you should
generally not take rutin by itself , but take the whole bioflavonoid
complex instead. if you do n't (and there are some exceptions to that)
you 'll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency , which is the other
major component of the bioflavonoid complex.
i found out the hard way years ago when i recommended rutin , after it
showed deficient in patients who were not deficient in hesperidin be
fore. a later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in
hesperidin , which , from then on , made me always add bioflavonoids
to anyone that had very low levels of rutin.
most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin , so
there is really no reason to take rutin by itself , but use the whole
bioflavonoid complex instead.

i have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that
they had been helped with hemorrhoids , varicose veins , chronic nose
bleeds , aneurysms , gastro intestinal bleeding (due to drugs) , etc...
one patient in desperation took a whole bottle (100 's) in one day
for his painful , bleeding hemorrhoids , without any ill effects.

they are also non toxic in very high amounts , that 's why they can
be safely recommended. if you are allergic to citrus fruit (they are
made from their peels) , pine bark sources are available as well.

about 90 of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency ,
with the average daily dosage needed being about 1 2 , 000mg.
for major complaints , 4 6 , 000mg day is common.

in case they cannot be taken , because of their size and taste (they
are big , and they do n't taste that great) , a product made from pine
bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite
small and taste much better , however the cost is about seven times
higher for the equivalent effect. one 25mg tablet of the pine bark
extract gives you about the same effect as 1 , 000mg of bioflavonoids.
the name for the pine bark product is 'pycnogenol.'

some canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are

quest.............1 , 000mg big , bitter , not chewable
swiss herbal........600mg smooth , easier swallowing
jamieson............500mg medium , bitter , chewable

sisu.................25mg (pycnogenol) small , easy swallowing

give them a try and see what happens.....and good luck !

i have osteoarthritis , and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes
(type ii , i guess no insulin).


i 've been trying to read up on these two conditions , and what really
surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known.
losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for
arthritis (at least , for women with arthritis) , but , of course , the very
conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the
weight gain.

for myself , i'm almost afraid to lose weight , because no matter how gentle
and sensible a diet i use (the last one was 1800 2000 calories , in about
eight small meals) , the weight wo n't go off gradually and stay off.
instead , it drops off precipitously , and then comes back on with much
interest , like bread on the waters.


with this experience , it 's hard to be encouraging to my husband. all i can
suggest is to make it as gradual as possible.

meanwhile , some experts recommend no sugar , others , no fat , others , just a
balanced diet. it 's almost impossible to tell from their writings which
parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition , and
which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty.

is it my imagination , or are these very old conditions very poorly
understood \? is it just that i'm used to pediatrician talk ( it 's strep
give him this and he 'll get well. ) and so my expectations are too high \?

here is a press release from the american federation of state ,

unions point to deadly workplaces afscme , other unions
commemorate workers memorial day
to national desk , labor writer
contact janet rivera of the american federation of state , county
and municipal employees , afl cio , 202 429 1130

washington , april 23 the american federation of state ,
county and municipal employees (afscme) and other unions
of the afl cio on wednesday , april 28 , will commemorate the fifth
annual workers memorial day a day to pay homage to the 6
million workers who are killed , injured , or diseased on the job.
this year , afscme will focus its workers memorial day efforts an
the dangerous environment in which corrections officers must work.
earlier this month , an afscme corrections officer , robert
vallandingham , was killed by inmates who overtook the corrections
facility in lucasville , ohio.
the law and order agenda of the 1980s has resulted in a steady
increase in the prison population for the past five years. on
jn. 1 , 1992 , the prison population was 709 , 587. projections
show a continued increase in the number of inmates , with an
expected prison population of 811 , 253 in 1994.
the conditions which this burgeoning prison population has
created for corrections officers is partially reflected in the
number of assaults by inmates against staff. assaults against
staff increased dramatically between 1987 and 1989 , and remain
high. in 1987 , there were 808 assaults by inmates against staff ,
compared to 9 , 961 such assaults in 1991.
the increased number of inmates has brought on the dangerous
combination of overcrowding and understaffing. for example in ohio
officer to inmate ratio is 1 to 8.4 the second worst ratio in
the nation. the national average is 1 to 5.3. other health and
safety issues facing corrections officers include aids , hepatitis
b , tuberculosis , stress , and chemical hazards.
afscme has more than 50 , 000 members who work in the nation 's
federal , state and local correctional facilities.
correction officers are not alone in performing their jobs under
life threatening conditions. every year , 10 , 000 american workers
die from job related injuries , and tens of thousands more die from
occupational disease. public employees do some of the nation 's
most dangerous jobs. perilous occupations include

highway workers highway workers are often injured and
frequently killed by moving traffic because work zones are
not barricaded or do n't have proper lighting.
health care workers hospitals have the highest number of
job related injuries and illnesses of any private sector
employer and nursing homes ranked fifth. there were more
than 325 , 000 job related illnesses and injuries in private
sector hospitals in 1991 , up almost 10 percent over the
previous year. it is generally believed that health care
workers employed at public sector hospitals and nursing homes
have a significantly higher rate of injuries and illnesses
than do their private sector counterparts. health and safety
issues facing health care workers include exposure to
tuberculosis and the hiv virus , back injuries , and high
levels of stress.
social workers social workers who work in mental health
institutions are often the victims of assaults and ,
sometimes , fatal attacks. for instance , last october , a man
carrying a semiautomatic handgun walked into the schuyler
county social services building in watkins glenn , n.y.
and fatally shot social services workers , before turning the
gun on himself. there are two basic problems. first is a
growing lack of support services for people who do n't have
the help they need. because workers are overworked , some
clients are not given the adequate amount of counselling.
such conditions may cause clients to become more frustrated.
the quality of the clients is also becoming more violent ,
as more are moved out of the institutions.

nearly 2 million workers have been killed by workplace hazards
since osha was passed. moreover , as afscme president gerald w.
mcentee explains , osha does not provide workplace safety
protections for public employees.
more than 1 , 600 public employees are killed each year on the
job , yet 27 states still provide no federally approved osha
coverage for public employees , said mcentee. this , despite the
fact that public employees highway workers , health care workers ,
corrections officers , to name but a few do some of the most
dangerous work in our society. this year we are fighting for
passage of osha reform legislation to give all workers greater
rights and protections , and finally guarantee all public employees
safe workplaces. we need the public support to be successful.
government workers suffer 25 percent more injuries than private
sector workers , and these injuries are almost 75 percent more
severe.
public employees were exempted from osha when the law was passed
in 1970 and today , public employees in more than half the states
have no osha coverage.

it sounds as though you might want to try a product such as super glue .
the active ingredient is cynoacrylate , the same compound used to reconstruct
bones. i have successfully used superglue for a number of procedures on many
different species of animal. if you are simply trying to adhear something
to bone for several months , this would be ideal. it bonds almost immediatly ,
is resistant to infection , and is non irritating to surrounding tissue.

the best thing to do is leave it , it will work its own way out to the surface.

the anesthisiologist (sp \? ) and asked him to help prep me for surgery.

after , watching me go through a couple contractions , the anes (or anus as
i like to refer to him) said , well , i am off duty now. (still staring
between my legs at that). the ob asked to go call whomever it was who
was on duty and ask him her how long it would take...and if it was going
to take more than a few minutes , to please stay even though he was off duty.

the anes. went out , supposedly to call the on call anes. in a couple of
minutes the nurse came running in to tell the ob that the anes. had left
without even trying to get ahold of the on call. it was the only time
during my labor that i swore. the on call anes. took 20 minutes to get
there.

come to find out , the anes. had only just gone off duty (about 2 minutes
before) and technically was supposed to stay in the hospital until the
next on call got there. good thing for all of us (especially him) that
it was not a critical emergency. but boy would i love to knock that

were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not !

my wife is concerned about this. she saw a tv show a couple months
back (something like 20 20 or dateline nbc , etc.) where an expert
on fetal ultrasounds (a radiologist) was showing all the different
deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound.

should my wife be concerned \? should we take the pictures to a
radiologist for a second opinion \? (and if so , where would we find
such an expert in chicago \? ) we do n't really have any special medical
reason to be concerned , but if a radiologist will be able to see
things the ob gyn ca n't , then i do n't see why we should n't use one.

any thoughts \?

as far as i can see if your obstetrition has an ultrasound in his rooms
and is expirienced its use and interpretation , he should be just as
capable of reading it as any radiologist. all doctors are qualified to
read x rays , u s , ct scans etc. it is just that a radiologist does nothing
else , and thus , is only better at reading them because of all this time
spent doing this (skill in reading x rays etc. just comes from plenty of
practice). if your obstetrition reads heaps of obstetric ultrasounds he
should be able to pick up any abnormalities that can be demonstrated by
this technique.

subject seeking info on retinal detachment
organization acadia university
lines 40

i am quite near sighted.

i 've recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal
holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment. in my
left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the
laser was used to weld this back in place as well.

my right eye seems fine. in my left eye i was seeing occasional
flashes of bright light prior to the treatment. since the
treatment (two weeks) these flashes are now occuring more often
several each hour.

the opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the
vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it. he
says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own
accord if it tugs enough i may well face retinal detachment.

i am seeking (via sci.med) additional info on retinal detachments.
the dr. did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations
so i appreciate any further details anyone can provide. of most
interest to me

if my retina does detach what should be my immediate course
of action \?

if conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is
the procedure like and what kind of vision can i expect
afterwards.

do the symptoms (fairly frequent flashes) imply that detachment
maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm.

does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine , or the two in
combination , can reduce the body 's ability to make use of
available water \? i had kind of an odd experience on a group hike
recently , becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous
hiking despite having brought 1 1 2 gallons of water (c. 6 liters).
i drank close to twice as much as anyone else , and no one else was
dehydrated. i do n't think general physical condition was an issue ,
since i was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general
stamina , so far as i could tell.

it may be that i just plain need more water than most people. but i am
wondering if theophylline and or ephedrine might be aggravating things.
i took a couple of primatene tablets during the hike to control asthma
(24 mg. ephedrine , 100 mg. theophylline). i gather that both those
drugs are diuretics. so now i'm wondering does that mean they can
reduce the body 's ability to utilize available water \? would it be a

do you believe that any quacks exist \? how about quack diagnoses \? is

a quack , or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack ,

david rind

i do n't like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician david.
questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).
i 'll give you some examples.

1. prescribing controlled substances to patients with no
demonstrated need(other than a drug addition) for the medication.

2. prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid
function for the purpose of quick weight loss.

3. using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has
been shown to be ineffective and dangerous(cyanide release) by
the nci.

these are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should
not committ but sometimes do. there are also errors of omission(some of
which result in malpractice suits). i do n't think that using anti fungal
agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be
having a problem with candida(or another fungal growth) is an error of
commission or omission. healers have had a long history of trying to
relieve human suffering. some have stuck to standard , approved procedures ,
others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a
chance that it will help the patient. the key has to be tied to the
healer 's oath , i will do no harm . but you know david that very few
treatments involve no risk to the patient. the job of the physician is a
very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed. each
physician deals with this risk benefit paradox a little differently. some
are very conservative while others are more agressive. an agressive
approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long
as the motive is improving the patient 's health and not an attempt to rake
in lots of money(through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in
the medicare fraud cases) , i do n't see the need to label these healers as
quacks or even unethical.

what do i reserve the term quack for \? pseudo medical professionals.
these people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the
frustrated patient to fall into their lair. some of these individuals are
really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine. but
many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a
few fast bucks. while a patient can be reasonably assured of getting
competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted , this alternative
care area is really a buyer 's beware arena. if you are lucky , you may find
someone who can help you. if you are unlucky , you can loose a lot of
money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo
medical professional to diagnose disease(which is the fortay of the
liscened physicians).

i hope that this clears things up david.

flavorings .

from kiran@village.com (kiran wagle)

the reaction came the time the msg was in the food
that was the only difference
same restaurant same ingredients ! ! !

how do you know this \?

in order to demonstrate your claim , you would have had to supervise the
preparation on both occasions. perhaps they used msg both times , and lied
about it. perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil , and
produced some bizarre toxin that you 're allergic to.

well , i had had similar reactions many times. that was when i really
started watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what 's in
there reaction to lawry 's season salt guess what 's in there

i 'll give you a hint i 've had enough problems with many many many
different products with msg that i figured out one thing.

unless i plan on getting sick i wo n't eat the stuff without my
seldane. and did i ever learn to read labels.

please note that i am not saying you are making it up , i am just
trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it
might seem.

which was why i started checking every time i got sick. and every
time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products.
and consider there were no other similar ingredients (to my knowledge)
it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own
personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most
importantly it 's enough proof for me to avoid it (and enough proof
that my incredibly frugal fiance did n't flinch when i literally threw
out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg
and he always flinches when there 's waste but it was a simple
explanation i wo n't eat this stuff , i won't cook with this stuff , so
i can either throw it out or give it away.)

from pattee@ucsu.colorado.edu (donna pattee)

my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg ,

probably lawry 's seasoning salt. i love the way that tastes.

i'm not saying i never consume anything with msg. i 've noticed that i
have a certain tolerance level like a (small) bag of bbq chips once
a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips will
bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of
the chinese restaurants the day before.

from kelley@healthy.uwaterloo.ca (catherine l. kelley)


all that 's needed now is that final step , a double blind study done
on humans. there is n't even an ethical question about possible
harm , as this is a widely used and approved food additive.

but some say that only 2 of the population has a problem with msg
some say it 's more like 20 but let 's say that it 's 5 . how many
people would have to be tested that would have a problem \? also i
know i have a problem with it , and i would n't volunteer for a test.
like thanks guys but i do n't want to get sick. also i'm sure that
most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at
different times. if i have a cold i'm much more susceptible to the
reaction than when i'm healthy (as proven today when i'm stuffy but
for some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbq
chips ).

from kiran@village.com (kiran wagle)

because too many of you (generic rhetorical 'you , ' not 'you cathy') go
around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome , thus suggesting to the
people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food.
msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese food thats why i
suggested calling this diner syndrome.

cathy does n't i have n't saved all my postings but i never called it
chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only from
chinese food. i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my
personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold (or
not hold) the msg. i ca n't call up whoever makes doritos and ask them
to make me one back of chips without msg.

on the other hand , if one complains about potatoes from a mix , or
restaurant spice mixes , i'm going to believe them , and if anyone says they
got (msg )sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party , i'm
really going to believe them.

restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and steak

antihistamines have been the active ingredient of otc sleep aids for
decades. go to any drugstore and look at the packages of such sleep
aids as sominex , nytol , etc. the active ingredient is
diphenhydramine , the same antihistamine that 's in benadryl.

i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss. a recent rough test
showed a gently sloping loss to 10 20db down at 1000cps. then it falls off
a cliff to 70 80dbs down from 1500cps on. this type of loss is difficult
to fit. i am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which
keep me roughly functional , but leave a lot to be desired.

recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q8 behind the ear aids for
several weeks. these have four independent programs which are intended to
be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed. i
found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about
to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of
another programmable system called resound.

unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office for
about 30 minutes and i could n't compare them 'head to head' with the widex.
nevertheless , it did appear to me that they were superior and i was
impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which i
will give in a separate posting. they also carry the widex aids and had one
patient (presumably wealthy) who decided to go ahead and get the resound
even though he had purchased the widex only 6 months ago.

the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as the
widex and other programmable aids. i could take a trip to europe on the
difference ! being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money , i am
having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds. i would
appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections
about when and if i might see improvements in technology that are n't quite
so expensive.



your hearing curve sounds a lot like mine (thanks , uncle sam ! ). i 've been
wearing miracle ear canal aids for about 5 months now and i find them to be
acceptable. they are molded to the shape of your ear canal , and tuned to
your hearing curve. they are comfortable to wear and almost invisible , if
you 're worried about that (although if you 're currently wearing behind the
ear models , that 's not an issue). the cost i paid 1200 each for mine ,
through the miracle ear counter at sears. i 've heard that there is a
substantial discount for senior citizens , but i have n't researched that , because
i'm not a senior citizen , yet !

give them a try you might be pleasantly surprised !

i do believe that depression can have a dietary component.

depression can also have various chemical (environmental) components.
i noticed that i became depressed in various buildings , and at home
when the air conditioning was on. subsequent testing revealed that
i was allergic to stemphyllium , a mold commonly found in air conditioners.
after i began taking antigens , that problem disappeared.

i posted about a pulse of (relaxation) electricity . i now think
it more like a pulse of relaxation or comfort than a pulse of
electricity. it is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling
of comfort , such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful.

another thing. when you sleep , you lie down facing up , with your
palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed. then you
relax , and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh. so ,
you feel a shiver below the surface of the skin (not heart beat).
then this shiver increases , and comes up to your head , and the roam you
hear loudens. (note that you always hear a high pitch when you lie down
in bed this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear.) this
roam is different from the high pitch , but follows the shiver of your
body.

shiver is not the word. it may be called a mild vibration or quake.
what is this shiver and roam \? can i use this to induce out of body
experience \?

apart from this issue , i was somewhat disappointed to find out

you might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual
drops instead of shots for treatment. (you are given a small bottle of
antigens 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) my
allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. throughout the treatment
process i had to return to the doctor 's office every month for re testing
and a new bottle of antigens. after the allergy was completely neutralized
a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual
drops are then taken 3 times per week) , and costs 20. so the cost is
less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.

first , i'm sorry to hear that you have had to see your grandmother go
through this. i know it has to have been tough.

there are many things that can cause long term confusion in elderly
adults. the change in environment can cause problems. anesthetic agents
can cause confusion because the body cannot clear the medicines out of
the body as easily. in addition , medications and interactions between
medications can cause confusion.

as far as whether or not haldol can have long lasting effects even after
the drug has been discontinued , i do not know. i have not seen anything
to that effect. however , i also had not been looking for that information.
i can see what i can find...

i can tell you that haldol is an antipsychotic drug , and , according to
the nursing93 drug handbook , it is especially useful for agitation
associated with senile dementia (p. 400). it also should not be
discontinued abruptly. it did not say anything about long lasting
effects.

because so many things can cause confusion , it is hard for me to know
what else was going on at the time if i had more history , i might be able
to answer you better. if you want to send me e mail with more information ,
i would be happy to try to help you piece together what might have

(maybe in some cases with good reason). in this post on depression , i'm
laying it all out. i 'll continue to post here because i think that i have
some knowledge that could be useful. once you have read this post , you
should know where i'm coming from when i post again in the future.

in article 123552@netnews.upenn.edu , lchaplyn@mail.sas.upenn.edu (lida chaplynsky) writes

a family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on
by menopause as well as a mental break down. she is being treated with
halydol with some success but the treatments being provided through her
psychiatrist are not satisfactory. someone suggested contacting a
nutritionist to
discuss alternative treatment. since she is sensitive to medication , i
think this is a good suggestion but do n't know where to begin. if anyone
can suggest a philly area nutritionist , or else some literature to read ,
i 'd appreciate it.

lida ,
i can emphasize with your situation. both my wife and i suffered from
bouts of depression. her 's was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a
rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and
chemotherapy. lida , i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through
her six months of chemotherapy(with the approval of her oncologist). when
severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped , i tried to
use supplements to bring her out of it. i had cured her pms using
supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet
in depression to take care of her depression as well. it did n't work and
she was put on prozac by her oncologist. two winters ago(three years after
by wife 's breast cancer) i got hit with severe depression(pretty typical and
one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another
stressor). i tried to take care of it for several months with
supplementation. did n't work. my internist ended up putting me on prozac.
i was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using
b6 , niacin , folate and b12 to cure depression. i'm not going to do that
because all you would be doing is flying blind like i was.

lida , i do believe that depression can have a dietary component. but the
problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use
an approach which will fix the problem. for chemotherapy , i knew exactly
what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be
affected. same thing for pms. i was flying blind for both of these
stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was
pretty good. depression is just too complicated. what you really need is
a nutritional scan. this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your
bodies nutrient reserves. for every vitamin and mineral(except vitamin c) ,
you have a reserve. the rda is not designed to give you enough of any
nutrient to keep these reserves full , it is only designed to keep them from
being emptied which would cause clinical pathology. stress will increase
your need for many vitamins and minerals. this is when your reserves become
very important.

lida , without your permission , i'm going to use your post as a conduit to
try to explain to the readers in this group and sci. med. where i'm coming
from. i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic
medical schools for ten years now. i 've written my own textbook because
none was available. what i teach is not a rehash of biochemistry. i
preach nutrient reserves(yes my lectures in this course are referred to by
my students as sermons). here is what i cover

indroduction and carbohydrates lipids

proteins i proteins ii

energy balance evaluation of nutritional
status i , a clinical

vitamins d and k vitamin c

thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine

pantothenic and folic acids biotin and b12

other nutrient factors enteral nutrition

parenteral nutrition

every three years i spend my entire summer reviewing the medical literature
to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook. i last did this
in the summer of 1991. i read everything that i can find and then sit down
and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books
that have 217 , 237 and 122 pages. opposite each page of written text(which
i write myself) i 've pulled figures , tables and graphs from various
copyrighted sources. since this material is only being used for
educational purposes , i can get around the copyright laws (so far). i can not
send this material out to newsgroup readers(as i 've been asked to do).

i am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition
assessment lab. this is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need
to make my education program complete. this lab will let me measure the
nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to
be required in humans. the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to
design supplement programs for their cancer patients. cancer treatment
centers of america , which is a private for profit organization with
hospitals in illinois and oklahoma(tulsa) also operates a
nutritional assessment clinical lab. i also believe that the pritikin
clinic in california has a similiar lab setup.

for physicians reading this post , i would suggest that you get the new
clinical nutrition textbook that has just been published(feb) by mosby. i
have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeutics(a little brown
series book) as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more
to residency training. two m.d 's have written this new clinical nutrition
textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it
does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a
patient 's nutritional status. let me quote a few sentences from the
preface of this new text

so called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists ,
hematologists , or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge
of nutrition as it related to their field of practice.

unfortunately , about two thirds of the medical schools in the united
states require no formal instruction in nutrition.

but times and medical practice have changed. more than half of the
leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related.

... this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives (1) it
should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of
nutrition to your medical practice and (2) it should heighten your
awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important
for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially
every organ system.

roland l. weinsier , md , drph

lida , my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find
a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals
(yes even magnesium may play a role in depression) play in depression and
who could get a nutritional profile run. menopause is often a time when
women suffer depression. there are a lot of hormonal changes that are
occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms. a
nutritionist may also be able to help. not too long ago a poster mentioned
that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red
cell glutathionine peroxidase test(the specific test for the selenium
reserve). most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to
try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified. there are
also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral
analysis but these labs are not regulated. checks of these labs using
certified standards , and also those doing water lead analysis , showed some
pretty shoddy testing was going on. if you or anyone else finds someone
who will run these speciality nutrition tests , make sure that they are
using a lab that has been certified under clia(the clinical laboratory
improvement act).

a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown
to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging
and software analysis(nutritionist iv and other software programs). but
there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not
show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status.
until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the
u.s. and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional
profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses
diet changes and supplementation , anti depressants will probably continue
to be the best approach to depression.

can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease
and a chronic one \? for example , persistent hepatitis vs chronic
hepatitis.

i do n't think there is a general distinction. rather , there are
two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic
persistent hepatitis. i ca n't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.

much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent
sound fuzzy , the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well.

i beg to differ. chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active , and generally leads to liver failure. at the very
minimum , the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some
call transaminitis ). chronic persistant hepatitis simply means that
the patient has hbsag in his her blood and can transmit the infection , but
shows no evidence of progressive disease. if i had to choose , i 'd much
rather have the persistant type.


being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic
persistent anything. persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical ,
biochemical , or histologic evidence of liver disease , or they may have chronic
persistent hepatitis , chronic active hepatitis , cirrhosis , or hepatocellular
carcinoma.

most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis (cph) are probably the result of
a viral infection , although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be
determined. the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy. it
consists of findings of portal inflammation , an intact periportal limiting
plate , and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis. but in contrast
to chronic active hepatitis (cah) there is no periportal inflammation ,
bridging necrosis , or fibrosis.

cph has , indeed , an excellent prognosis. if i had to choose between cah and
cph there is no question i would also choose cph. however , as david pointed
out , the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have
it. the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal , with biopsies showing
areas compatible with both cph and cah. maybe it is a sampling problem. maybe
it is a continuum. i do n't know.

persistent hepatitis. i ca n't think of any other disease where the
term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic.

much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent
sound fuzzy , the actual distinction between the two conditions
is often fairly fuzzy as well.

i beg to differ. chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease
remains active , and generally leads to liver failure. at the very
minimum , the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes (what some
call transaminitis ). chronic persistant hepatitis simply means that
the patient has hbsag in his her blood and can transmit the infection , but
shows no evidence of progressive disease. if i had to choose , i 'd much
rather have the persistant type.

marty , you 've also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric

hypersensitivity symptoms (noring syndrome) to the yoghurt and vitamin
therapy of undocumented candida enteritis (elaine palmer syndrome) with
systemic symptoms. there is significant difference between the cost and
risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials. are we talking about real
candida infections , the whole yeast connection hypothesis , the efficacy
of routine bacterial repopulation in humans , or the ability of anecdotally
effective therapies (challenged by a negative randomized trial) to confirm
an etiologic hypothesis (post hoc ergo propter hoc). we ca n't seem to
focus in on a disease , a therapy , or a hypothesis under discussion.

i'm lost !

point 1

i'm beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole
yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings
of words. medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon ,
necessary for precise communication within their field (which i'm fully
cognizant of since i , too , speak jargonese when with my peers). for the
situation in sci.med , many times the words or phrases used by doctors can
have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the
world at large , causing significant miscommunication. one example word ,
and very relevant to the yeast discussion , is the exact meaning of systemic .
it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific , much
more so than its meaning to a non doctor. there is also the observation of
this newsgroup that both doctors and non doctors come together on essentially
equal terms , which , when combined with the jargon issue , can further fan
the flames. this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get
really beat up by non doctors for their views on medicine , which they
otherwise do n't see much of in their practice except for the occasional
difficult patient.

point 2

i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not
prescribe any treatments therapies for their patients unless such treatments
have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well constructed
clinical trials (usually double blind) , or that such treatments therapies are
part of an approved and funded clinical trial. to these doctors , to do any
differently would , in this belief system , be unethical practice. and it
follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non
therapy it does not even exist , nor does the underlying hypothesis or
theory have any validity , even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation
of what is currently known. anecdotal evidence has no value , either , from
a treatment point of view.

and by and large , as a scientist myself , i am glad that medical practice
science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment. however , as
also being a human being (last i checked) , and having been one of those people
that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment , where
standard medicine was not able to help me , has caused me to sit back and
wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in
itself unethical from humanitarian considerations. after all , the underlying
intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of
the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient , so the
patient should come first when considering treatment.

what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both
the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints. in an earlier post i
outlined a crazy idea for doing just that. the gist of it was to give any
physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe
alternate , not yet proven therapies (maybe supported by anecdotal evidence)
for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted
(and not until then). the patient would be fully informed that such
therapies treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that
there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived
from them.

this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor. it also satisfies
the humanitarian needs of the patient. and the reality is that many patients
who have reached a dead end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted
medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the
doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing
their license , or worse , to non doctors who have not had the proper medical
training. this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control
more within orthodox medicine , with the benefits that the information gleaned
could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most
productive way. everybody wins in this admittedly rose colored approach i'm
sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presented
more as a strawman to stimulate discussion.

hopefully what i write here may give the sci.med doctors a better idea as to
why i am open to alternative therapies , as well as why i have real
difficulty (read apparent hostility ) with the coldness of the 99.9 pure
scientific approach to medicine. i believe the best approach to medical
treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and
by the scientific aspects. anything else is just not good medicine , imho.
just my 'nf' leanings , i guess. )

2. what possible side effects are there. how can they be mimimized \?

please respond via e mail to rme1@cornell.edu

thanks ,
renee

edta(chelation therapy) has been used by some physicians to try to remove
calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system(not approved for such
use). there is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung
disease has become calcified(chest x rays would show this). there are side
effects to the use of edta because it is not specific for calcium(it also
binds other minerals). i think that there have been some deaths when
edta chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that
were not detected and corrected. in animal studies , the best way to remove
calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin c
and magnesium(rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin c , the extra
vitamin c was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium
from the plaques).

the calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably
can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form. most patietns
with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium.

1. magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease a review
am j clin nutr 27(1) 59 79(1974). supplementation with
magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels.

2. the importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular
disease am. heart j 94 649 57(1977). the need to measure the
serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be
overemphasized. this is a review article.

in cholesterol fed rabbits atherosclerosis 10 732 7(1990).
magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of
plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1 by weight cholesterrol

since edta will also bind magnesium , i 've never really liked it 's use for
the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients.

our 20 month son has started falling sick quite often every since he
started going to day care. he was at home for the first year and he did
not fall sick even once. now it seems like he has some sort of cold or
flu pretty much once a month. most of the time the cold leads to an ear
infection as well , with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics
3 weeks out of 4. i know kids in day care fall sick more often , but we
are beginning to wonder how often more often really is , whether our
son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average...
are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions \?

when kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade , infection
incidence was much lower because exposure was lower. some studies suggest
that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial
because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and
mortality(mumps , measles. etc.).

how often do kids in their first , second and third years fall sick \?
how often do they get colds , flus , ear infections \? is there any data on
home care vs. day care \?

daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care.

does being sick build immunity (leading to less illness later) ,
does it make kids weaker (leading to more illness later) , or does it
not have any long term effect \?

exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity. but many viruses
mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response(
new antibody production). in addition , antibody levels tend to decline
with time and re innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high.
chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression
but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children.

does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long
term effects \?

yes , chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good
bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body. health effects
of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the
medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects
of chronic antibiotic use( a view that i do not support).

how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than
normal , and what does one do about it \?

chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up( in my
opinion). but most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is
normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many
infectious diseases. i do not share this view and there are some
physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection
frequency and severity. exposure to an infectious agent does not have to
result in a severe infection. a strong immune response can minimize the
length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms
associated with the infection.

is there any way to build immunity and resistance \?

there are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong
immune response to infectious agents. they are protein , vitamin c ,
vitamin a , iron and zinc. the american diet is not low in protein so this
is rarely a problem. but vitamin a , vitamin c , iron and zinc are often low
and this lack of an adequate pool(nutrient reserve) can impair the immune
response. iron is know to be low in most kids(as is vitamin a). there are
distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of
these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe
infection. serum ferritin for iron status , dark adaptation for vitamin a
status , red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for
vitamin c status. i have attempted to work up posts on these five
nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the
others that i participate in. i can e mail you what i 've worked up so far.
but my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the
critical role that diet plays in the human immune response. you may also
be able to get help from a nutritionist. anyone can call themselves a
nutritionist so you have to be very carefull. you want to find someone(
like myself) who has had some formal training and education in nutrition.
many ph.d. programs in the u.s. now offer degrees in nutrition and that 's
what you need to look for. some dieticians will also call themselves
nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training
needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests. they are very good
for getting general dietary advice from however.

any data , information or advice relating to this would be much
appreciated. thanks a lot.

questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical(in my opinion).

3. using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has

the nci.

hmm. this is certainly among the things i would refer to as quack
therapy and would tend to refer to any practitioner who prescribed
laetrile (whether licensed or not) as a quack. there are unethical
behaviors (such as ordering unneccessary tests to increase fees)
which i would not lable as quackish , but prescribing known ineffective
therapies seems to me to be one of the hallmarks of a quack.

david rind

one of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical
literature to keep up with changes in medical practice. all the clamor
over laetril resulted in the nci spending quite a bit of money on clinical
trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against
cancer. a physician who continued to use it , when better , more effective ,
treatments are available , may deserve to be called a quack. anti fungals
are in a different class. the big question seems to be is it reasonable to
use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due
to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics \? gorden
rubenfeld , through e mail , has assured me that most physicians recognize
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to
restore competetion for candida in the body. i do not believe that this is
yet a standard part of medical practice. he deals with critical care
patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just
because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that
all physicians do this. i think that aspergillis is more likely to be
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida. women have been known
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and
not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams. since candida
colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area , gi symptoms should be more common
than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use.

the problem we have here david is proof that gi discomfort can be caused by
a candida bloom. the arguement is that without proof , no action is
warrented.

medicine has not , and probalby never will be , practiced this way. there
has always been the use of conventional wisdom. a very good example is
kidney stones. conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been
done to come up with an effective prevention) , was that restricitng the
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones
from forming. clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to
breakdown the stone once it formed. through the recent new england j of
medicine article , we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong ,
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is
restricting calcium intake.

the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to
be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.
if it makes sense for livestock , why does n't it make sense for humans
david \? we are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider
yogurt dangerous). if this were a standard part of medical practice , as

nor is it mine. what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly

marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and

this. at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel
decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt
to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group. i also
use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea (that may
be in part due to alterations in gut flora). however , it is not part of
my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after
antibiotics. i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating
fungal infections in at risk patients. whether or not it is a logical
extension from the available observations i 'll leave to those of you who
base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of
clinical trials.
one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly
recalcitrant cases of c. difficile colitis (not a fungal infection). there
are case reports of using stool (ie someone elses) enemas to repopulate
the patients flora. do n't try this at home.

conclusions. in women with presumed candidiasis
hypersensitivity syndrome , nystatin does not reduce systemic or
psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo. consequently ,
the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such

candida can do that to you. ) gordon , i think that the best clinical
trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal
candida blooms l. acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the
frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the
candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l. acidophilus
should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the
intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to
oxygen(just like it does in the vagina). as much stuff as there is in the
lay press about l. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections , i'm really
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.


the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all
conventional wisdom out the window. where would medicine be if
conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard
medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials \?
the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene(and a very
important one). the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria
after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason
to dismiss it out of hand , especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply
and safely(like it is in animal husbandry).

one could also imagine that complications arising from circumcision

of penile cancer it is purported to prevent.


ca n't imagine what it 's like to have a penis , much less a foreskin. i
guess if american medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male , then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance...

the penile cancer thing has been completely debunked...she must be
going to school on a south pacific island. tell her to check the journal
or urology for circumcision articles. i remember at least 1 on an old
jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....i mean , if the
cancer risk was that great , the europe who have been circumcising like
crazy , too. teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that 's just way too much like
mastubation. so you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary.

anyway , i am looking for advice for the use of
antihistamines as sleep aids , and if there are any dangers of such use
(seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by
millions). i do n't want to try bzs , because bz addiction seems to be
a serious threat , and from what i hear , bz sleep quality is not good ,
whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me. i have
tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff , and that also seems to
lower sleep quality , i seem to wake up around 4 00 or so and be in some
kind of mental haze until 7 00 or 8 00. also , i would be interested in
any other advice for helping my problem. (although i 've already tried
many of the non pharmacological solutions)

well , i think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with
sleep disturbances , because antihistamines only help induce sleep when
they 're used intermittently they lose their sedative effect if they 're
used on a nightly basis. their anticholinergic effects (drying of secretions ,
relaxing effects on smooth muscle) can be problematic in some people , such as
those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement.

antihistamines like diphenhydramine (benadryl) or doxylamine (unisom)
are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally. chlorpheniramine
(chlor trimeton) is said to be less sedative , but 8mg seems to work
well in some people. both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long
half lives compared to diphenhydramine , and so may produce a residual
hangover or drugged feeling the next morning.

do you believe that any quacks exist \? how about quack diagnoses \? is

true focus of the medical profession. the ama and the boards should focus
on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on 'search and
destroy missions' to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non
traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients
that traditional accepted medicine cannot help.

if i prescribe itraconazole for a patient 's sinusitis neither the ama ,
fda , state licensing board , nor abfp will be knocking on my door to ask
why. this is a specious argument.

on their backs and pee pee on themselves in obedience. what do they teach
you in medical school how to throw your authority around \?

among other things , how to evaluate new theories and treatments.

let me put it another way to make my point clear quack is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision. its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand.

funny , i thought it meant one who fraudulently misrepresents his
ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or
the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers (dorland 's
27th). certainly more precision than conveyed by chronic yeast .

the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency and coming
from any medical doctor (or wanna be) , where competency is expected , is real
scary.

the inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous
representations is far more frightening. it is fraud to promote a
treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it
and the quacksalver knows so , or error if the honest practitioner
does n't know so. failure to speak out against either bespeaks
incompetency.

(p.s. , may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories , such as the yeast theory , should create your own moderated group.

may i reply seriously that if the practitioners and proponents of
non scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts
of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out , they should
learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing
hierarchy and divisions.

subject pms can it be prevented by a diet change \?
lines 274
nntp posting host vms.ocom.okstate.edu
organization osu college of osteopathic medicine

this question came up in sci. med. nutrition and i'm posting my answer
here. only 22 medical schools in the u.s. teach courses on human
nutrition. we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do
when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community.
i think that the best example of where u.s. medicine is really missing the
mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms. so many women(and
their husbands) suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that
most physicians in the u.s. are not taught that pms is primarily caused by
diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening. before shooting
your flames , read the entire article and then decide if flaming is
justified.

from a poster in sci. medi. nutrition
in a psychological anthropology course i am taking , we got
sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms. some rumors shared
by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels , sugar
intake , and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms.
is there any data on this , or is it just so much hooey \?

many thanks ,

michael , i 've wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i got
side tracked with candida. pms is a lot like candida blooms , most
physicians do n't recognize it as a specific disease entity. here is
everything that you would ever want to know about pms.

premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups

pmt a(anxiety) pmt d(depression)
anxiety depression
irritability forgetfulness
insomnia confusion
depression lethargy

pmt c(craving) pmt h(hyperhydration)
craving for sweets weight gain
increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness
sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness
1. headache edema of the face and extremities
2. palpitations
3. fatigue or fainting

pmt a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low
progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women 's cycle.

pmt c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple
carbohydrates. during the luteal phase of a women 's cycle , there is
increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose
challenge. the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt c are
a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e1. this condition of hypoglycemia
is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of
hypoglycemia , magnesium and pge1 seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia.
a. am. j. psychiatry 147(4) 477 80(1990).
unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar , magnesium
supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation(increased to 5 6 of
the total calories) using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources
of alpha linoleic acid.

pmt d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal
phase of a women 's cycle. another cause of pmt d has been found to be lead
toxicity(in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal
phase). effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human
endometrial cystol fertil. steril. 28 312 18(1972).

pmt h is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated
serum aldosterone level. salt restriction , b6 , magnesium and vitamin e
for breast tenderness have all been effective in treating pmt h

this general discussion of the pms syndromes came form

a. management of the premenstrual tension sundromes rational for
a nutritional approach . 1986 , a year in nutritional medicine.
j. bland , ed. keats , publishing , 1986.

b. nutritional factors in the etiology of premenstrual tension
syndromes , j. reprod. med.28(7) 446 64(1983).

c. premenstrual tension , prob. obstet. gynecol. 3(12) 1 39(1980)

treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can
find a doctor who will treat you for pms(just about as hard as finding one
that will treat you for candida blooms). while progesterone will work ,
supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better. there really
has been an awful lot of research done on pms(much more than candida
blooms). many of these studies have been what are called experimental
controlled studies(the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to
see done).

here are a few of these studies

carbohydrate experimental controlled study , effect of a low fat ,
high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy lancet
2 128 32(1988). 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy
of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive
specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15 of total calories
and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary
advise with no training. after 6 months , there was a significant
reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in
the trained group as reported by self reported symptoms as well as
physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling ,
tenderness and nodularity.

vitamin a experimental controlled study , the use of vitamin a in
premenstrual tension acta obstet. gynecol scand. 39 586 92(1960).
218 pts with severe recurring pms received 200 , 000 to 300 , 000iu
vitamin a daily or a placebo. serum retinol levels were monitored
and high dose supplementation was discontinued when evidence of
toxicity occured(serum retinol above 450ug ml). the intent of the
study was to load the liver up with vitamin a and get a normal pool
size(500 , 000iu to 1 , 000 , 000iu) and then see if this
normal vitamin a pool could prevent pms. 48 getting the high dose
vitamin a had complete remission of the symptoms of pms. only 10
getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of pms sysmptoms.
10 of the vitamin a treated group reported no improvement in pms
symptoms.

experimental controlled study , premenstrual tension treated with
vitamin a j. clinical endocrinology 10 1579 89(1950). 30 pts
received 200 , 000iu of vitamin a daily starting on day 15 of their
cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of pms symptoms.
after 2 6 months , all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in
pms symptoms. vitamin a supplementation was stopped once evidence of
toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year
after high dose vitamin a supplementation was stopped. pms symptoms
did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the
vitamin a supplementation was stopped.

most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver.
these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal
store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms. of all the vitamins
given for pms(vitamin a , b6 , and vitamin e) , vitamin a has shown the best
single effect. this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid
(estrogen progesterone) metabolism in the liver. getting your liver full
of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent
the symptoms of pms. but vitamin a is toxic and you do n't want to be trying
to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin
a toxicity.

vitamin b6 experimental double blind crossoverr study , pyridoxine
(vitamin b6) and the premenstrual syndrome a randomized crossover
trial j.r. coll. gen. pract. 39 364 68(1989). 32 women aged 18 49
with moderate to severe pms randomly received 50mg b6 daily or placebo.
after 3 months the groups were switched and followed for another
3 months. b6 had a significant effect on the emotional aspects of
pms(depression , irritability and tiredness). other symptoms of pms
were not significanttly affected by b6 supplementation.

experimental double blind study , the efects of vitamin b6
supplementation on premenstrual sysmptoms obstet. gynecol
70(2) 145 49(1987). 55 pts with moderate to severe pms received
150mg b6 daily or placebo for 2 months. analysis of convergence
showed that b6 significantly improved premenstrual symptoms related
to the autonomic nervous system(dizziness and vomiting) as well as
behavior changes(poor mental performance , decreased social interaction)
anxiety , depression and water retention were not improved by b6
supplementation.

vitamin b6 is below the rda for both american men and women. birth control
pills and over 40 different drugs increase the b6 requirement in man.
women on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10 15 mg of b6 per
day. the dose should be increased if symptoms of pms appear. dr. david r.
rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of nimh was quoted in
clin. psychiatry news , december , 1987 as stating that b6 should be
considered the first line drug for pms(over progesterone) and if the
patient does not respond , then other treatments should be tried. vitamin
b6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if consumed in doses of 500mg or more each
day.


vitamin e experimental double blind study , efficacy of alpha
tocopherol in the treatment of premenstrual syndrome j. reprod.
med. 32(6) 400 04(1987). 35 pts received 400iu vitamin e daily for 3
cycles or a placebo. vitamin e treated pts had 33 who reported a
significant reduction in physical symptoms(weight gain and breast
tenderness) while the placebo group had 14 who reported a significant
reduction in physical symptoms. the vitamin e group reported that 38
had a significant reduction in anxiety versus 12 for the placebo
group. for depression , the vitamin e group had 27 with a significant
decrease in depression compared with 8 for the placebo group.

experimental double blind study , the effect of alpha tocopherol on
premenstrual symptomalogy a double blind study j. am. coll. nutr.
2(2) 115 122(1983). 75pts with benign breast disease and pmt randomly
received vitamin e at 75iu , 150iu , or 300iu daily or placebo. after
2 months of supplementation , 150iu of vitamin e or higher significantly
improved pmt a and pmt c. the 300iu dose was needed to significantly
improve pmt d. no dose of vitamin e significantly improved pmt h
(other studies have shown that a higher vitamin e doses will relieve
pmt h symptoms).

magnesium experimental double blind study , magnesium prophylaxis
of menstrual migraine effects on itracellular magnesium headache
31 298 304(1991). 20 pts with perimenstrual headache received 360 mg
daily of magnesium as magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid or a
placebo. treatment was started on the 15th day of the cycle and
continued until menstruation. after 2 months , the pain total index
was significantly lower in the magnesium group. magnesium treatment
was also assocoiated with a significant reduction in the menstrual
distress questionnaire scores. pretreatment magnesium levels in
lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes were significantly lower
in this group of 20 pts compared to control women who did not suffer
from pms. after treatment , magnesium levels in these cells was raised
into the normal range.

experimental double blind study , oral magnesium successfully
relieves premenstrual mood changes obstet. gynecol 78(2) 177 81(1991).
32pts aged 24 39 randomly received either magnesium carboxylic acid
360mg of mg per day or a placebo from the 15th day of the cycle to the
onset of the menstrual flow. after 2 cycles , both groups received
magnesium. the menstrual distress questionnaire score of the cluster
pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle(month) for the
magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were
switched to magnesium supplementation. in addition , the total score on
the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by
magnesium supplementation. the authors suggest that magnesium
supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes
that occur during pms.

there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the
medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder
that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature. but
since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci. med.
to be anecdotal in nature , i have not bothered to cite them. there are
also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on
multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms. i 've chosen the
best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out
that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder. but doctors do n't recognize
nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology(beri beri ,
pellagra , scruvy , etc.). pms is probably the best reason why every doctor
being trained in the u.s. should get a good course on human nutrition. pms
is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional
disorders. it 's time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses.

here 's some studies which show the importance in multivitamin mineral
supplementation and or diet change in preventing pms.

experimental study , effect of a nutritional programme on
premenstrual syndrome a retrospective analysis , complement. med.
res.5(1) 8 11(1991). 200pts were given dietary instructions and
supplemented with optivite(r) plus additional vitamin c , vitamin e ,
magnesium , zinc and primrose oil. the dietary instructions were to
take the supplements and switch to a low fat , complex carbohydrate
diet. on a retrospective analysis , 96.5 of the 200pts reported an
improvement in their pms symptoms with 30 of the sample stating that
they no longer suffered from pms.


experimental double blind study , role of nutrition in managing
premenstrual tension syndromes , j reprod. med. 32(6) 405 22(1987).
a low fat , high complex carbohydrate diet along with optivite
supplementation significantly decreased pms scores compared with diet
change and placebo. after 6 months on the experimental program , the
vitamin mineral supplementated group had significantly decreased
estradiol and increased progesterone in serum during the midlutel
phase of their cycle.

experimental double blind study , clinical and biochemical effects
of nutritional supplementation on the premenstrual syndrome , j.
reprod. med. 32(6) 435 41(1987). 119pts randomly given optivite(12
tablets per day) or a placebo. the treated groups showed a
significant decrease in pms symptoms compared to the placebo. another
group of 104pts got optivite(4 tablets per day) or placebo. for this
second group of patients , no significant effect of supplementation on
pms symptoms was observed.

yes , this is a common and safe procedure. the majority of schatzki 's

of pvc 's seems to increase throughout the day , and with exercise (or something
as simple as climbing some stairs). also , if i get up after sitting or lying

i' not an expert on heart problems , but pvc 's are common and have been

history an build you do (related to the heart , that is) , is that my pvc 's
come and go , with some months causing anxiety. taking on more fluids
seems to help , and they seem worse in the summer. remember that a slow
heart rate will allow more pvc 's to be apparent , so perhaps it is an
indication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that
last point , especially)

i guess i'm still not clear on what the term candida bloom means ,
but certainly it is well known that thrush (superficial candidal
infections on mucous membranes) can occur after antibiotic use.
this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome , the quack
diagnosis that has been being discussed.


found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida. women have been known

women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and

lucky how \? since a recent article (randomized controlled trial) of

number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they
could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily. it turns out most would
rather just use anti fungal creams when they get yeast infections.

yogurt dangerous). if this were a standard part of medical practice , as
gordon r. says it is , then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast
infections should decline.

again , this just is n't what the systemic yeast syndrome is about , and
has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed.
there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with
bacteria after antibiotic therapy do n't seem to be very helpful in
reducing diarrhea , but i do n't think anyone would view this as a

involves taking photographs of corona discharges created by attaching the
subject to a high voltage source , not of some aura. it works equally well
with inanimate objects.

true.. but what about showing the missing part of a leaf \? is this
corona discharge \?

yup. the demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between
the plates , and taking a kirlian photograph of it. you then cut off part of
the leaf , put the top plate back on , and take another kirlian photograph. you
see pretty much the same image in both cases. turns out the effect is n't
nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between
photographs. seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place
conducts electricity. surprise , surprise !

this is true , but it 's not quite the whole story. there were
actually some people who were more careful in their methodology
who also replicated the 'phantom leaf effect.'

one of the most influential critics of kirlian electrophotography
is a theosophist (and threfore presumably willing to entertain the
hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura , electromagnetic
or otherwise) , professor of electrical engineering at london 's
city university , and a past president of the society for psychic research
named a. j. ellison.

after years of studying the method and the claims , ellison
came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we
calls 'lichtenberg figures , ' an effect of intermittent ionization of
the air around the object. it 's a bit more complicated than
'not wiping off the plates , ' but it comes down to the same thing
in the end , kirlian electrophotography has much more limited
value (if any) than was previously widely thought. electrical and
magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be
of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and
usually also tracer chemicals.

ca n't imagine what it 's like to have a penis , much less a foreskin. i

male , then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance...

the penile cancer thing has been completely debunked...she must be
going to school on a south pacific island. tell her to check the journal
or urology for circumcision articles. i remember at least 1 on an old
jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....i mean , if the
cancer risk was that great , the europe who have been circumcising like
crazy , too. teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that 's just way too much like
mastubation. so you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary.

first off , use some decent terms if ya do n't mind. this is sci.med , not
alt.sex.

secondly , how absolutely bogus to assume that american 's are just too hung
up on the penis....blah , blah . i think most american 's do n't care about
anything so comlicated as that. they just think it looks nicer . ask
a few of them and see what response you get. others still opt for
circumcision due to religious traditions and beliefs. some think it is
easier to clean. still others do it because daddy was .

dont' be so naive as to think american 's are afraid of sexuality.

my son is not circumcised , and i can vouch for the argument that it is
more difficult to keep clean than a circumcised kids'. not so much that
the foreskin is difficult to pull back (it is n't) but because my son
does n't want to wait long enough for a thorough check for smega or misplaced
feces. so , many times it just gets a once over dab. it worries me
that he might get an infection due to his lack of cooperation. i am
sure , however , that he will be able to handle cleaning under the foreskin
himself once he is old enough. until , there is always the decision at
each diaper change...is this the time to clean or can we wait till next
time.

the rules are that the person must be a canadian citizen. they do n't have
to be born in canada or even live in canada , but they must have (or have
had , if they are dead) canadian citizenship while they are were great
canadian scientists.

about 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the
end of this posting.

i'm not quite sure what should constitute greatness , and there may be a
gray area here. if you have any ideas on criteria for greatness , i would be
pleased to hear them. in any event , please nominate people even if you are
not sure they are great. i would like as big a list as possible.

please give me a name and email address , phone number or mail address , so
that i can contact the person. if you do n't know any of the above , then
give me their last known whereabouts. also please give your reason for why
you think the person should be considered a great canadian scientist.

after i have the list , i will choose about six of the most interesting ones
and do in depth biographies of those individuals in the style of tracy
kidder 's soul of a new machine or some other dramatic technique.
the rest of the great canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with
one paragraph biographies.

if you have any other ideas about this project , i am interested to hear

boxes all around on the following subjects vital statistics and photo of
the scientist , personal statement from the scientist , narrative of a few
moments in the life of the scientist , what i was doing when i was 12 ,
so you want to be a insert kind of scientist , experiment you can do. there
will be an appendix with 100 200 more scientists with one paragraph
biographies who did n't quite make it to the double spreads. the whole thing
will then be published on cd rom with video and sound clips for added
richness. i am looking for a cd rom publisher as well. the text part may
also be available on the canarie electronic highway being developed in
canada as well.

i am still looking for a publisher though penguin canada came close
to being it. hope to find one soon.

i would like to again ask for more nominations , especially in the
pure sciences of physics , chemistry and biology. also criticisms of
the list are welcomed. also women and french canadian scientists are needed.

i hope this posting will get others to nominate more great canadian

hi all ,

my skin is very dry in general. but the most serious part is located
from knees down. the skin there looks like segmented. the segmentation
actually happens beneath the skin. i would like to know if there is any
cure for this.


as a matter of fact , i just saw a dermatologist the other day , and while i
was there , i asked him about dry skin. i 'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams , lotions , and other dry skin treatments.
he said all i needed was a large jar of vaseline. soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for 10 minutes (only 10 minutes ! ) then massage in the vaseline ,
to trap the moisture in.

that is the standard advice in dermatology texts.
the soak part greatly increases the inconvenience. do n't bother unless
it does n't work otherwise.

the hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly.

exactly , but it adds to the ritual aspect , which is important for
us suggestible patients. (posters , do n't bother to repeat the
rationale for the soak.)

if it 's not done right , you remain greasy and stick

greasy no matter what. vaseline (generically , petrolatum) is
famous for that. one text states that the more greasy a dry skin
cream is , the more effective.

try it. it 's got to be cheaper then spending 30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'
lotion.

try usp lanolin , at least for maintenance (preventive) therapy. usp
lanolin is natural and much less greasy and cheap (do n't buy the more
expensive perfumed lanolin mixture). as i 've commented before , petrolatum
is a poorly characterized mixture of hydrocarbons which are not found in
biological systems (that is not inherently bad , but smell it up close ,
even on your hand) , are partially absorbed into the body and remain there
for months or more , and have associations with cancer. do n't panic , but
also do n't believe it 's god 's gift to the human skin.

there 's no cure for stupidity of poll on doctors' salaries

by mike royko
tribune media services


on a stupidity scale , a recent poll about doctors' earnings
is right up there. it almost scored a perfect brain dead 10.
it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called
families usa.
the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe
that doctors make too much money.
the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for
physicians. those polled said , oh , about 80 , 000 a year would be
ok.
how generous. how sporting. how stupid.
why is this poll stupid \? because it is based on resentment
and envy , two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign
and are still simmering.
you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that
earns 100 , 000 plus and get the same results. since the majority
of americans do n't make those bucks , they assume that those who
do are stealing it from them.
maybe the berlin wall came down , but do n't kid yourself.
karl marx lives.
it 's also stupid because it did n't ask key questions , such
as do you know how much education and training it takes to
become a physician \?
if those polled said no , they did n't know , then they should
have been disqualified. if they gave the wrong answers , they
should have been dropped. what good are their views on how much
a doctor should earn if they do n't know what it takes to become a
doctor \?
or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how
much should a person earn if he or she must (a) get excellent
grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order
to (b) be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking
courses heavy in math , physics , chemistry , and other lab work and
maintain a 3.5 average or better , and (c) spend four more years
of grinding study in medical school , with the third and fourth
years in clinical training , working 80 to 100 hours a week , and
(d) spend another year as a low pay , hard work intern , and (e)
put in another three to 10 years of post graduate training ,
depending on your specialty and (f) maybe wind up 100 , 000 in
debt after medical school and (g) then work an average of 60
hours a week , with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or
more until they retire or fall over \?
as you have probably guessed by now , i have considerably
more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and
clinton , and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have
called together to remake america 's health care.
based on what doctors contribute to society , they are far
more useful than the power happy , ego tripping , program spewing ,
social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is
to health what clinton 's first budget is to frugality.
but propaganda works. and , as the stupid poll indicates ,
many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the
major cause of high medical costs.
of course doctors are well compensated. they should be.
americans now live longer than ever. but who is responsible for
our longevity lawyers , congress , or the guy flipping burgers in
a mcdonald 's \?
and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become
a nation of self indulgent , lard butted , tv gaping couch
cabbages.
ah , that is not something you heard president clinton or
super spouse talk about during the campaign or since. but
instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain ,
they might have been more honest if they had said
let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest
problems we have. that problem is you , my fellow american. yes ,
you , eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you
guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at 2.50 a pack
getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the
microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into
the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot
victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease
while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure.
you and your habits , not the doctors , are the single
biggest health problem in this country. if anything , it is
amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do.
in fact , i do n't understand how they can stand looking at
your blubbery bods all day.
so as your president , i call upon you to stop whining and
start living cleanly. now i must go get myself a triple cheesy
greasy with double fries. do as i say , not as i do.
but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid ,
there is another solution do n't use them.
that 's right. you do n't feel well \? then try one of those
spine poppers , needle twirlers , or have rev. bubba lay his hands
upon your head and declare you fit.
or there is the do it yourself approach. you have chest
pains \? then sit in front of a mirror , make a slit here , a slit
there , and pop in a couple of valves.
you 're going to have a kid \? why throw your money at that
overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house
than you will ever have (while paying more in taxes and
malpractice insurance than you will ever earn) \?
just have the kid the old fashioned way. squat and do it.
and if it survives , you can go to the library and find a book on
how to give it its shots.
by the way , has anyone ever done a poll on how much
pollsters should earn \?

when i was a school boy , my biology teacher told us of an incident
in which a couple were very passionate without actually having

cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation.

was my biology teacher misinforming us , or do such incidents actually
occur \?

sperm deposited near the entrance of the vagina has been known to cause
pregnancy , even in the presence of a hymen. i doubt that sperm could make
it through a layer of cloth then find the right path to a waiting ovum ,
but it might be possible.

so , it is possible for a woman to be both virgin and pregnant.
also , some hymens are sufficiently loose to allow near normal intercourse
without rupturing. the problem when investigating these phenomenae is ,

in a previous article , banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu () says
least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u.s. it 's really
too bad that most u.s. medical schools do n't cover nutrition because if
they did , candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the
medical profession.

case western reserve med school teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. b12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy , b12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia) , yet i sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis , and , in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like aids and cancer patients ,
systemic candida infection. i think the yeast connection is
a bunch of hooey. what does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught , anyway \?

here is a brief primer on yeast. yeast infections , as they are commonly
called , are not truely caused by yeasts. the most common organism responsible
for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a
yeast like fungus.

well , maybe i'm getting picky , but i always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in , the other being the
mold form. many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds ,
depending on environment. candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment. should we maybe
call it a mold infection \? a fungus infection \? maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold like fungus.

i do n't know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist.
no scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question.
the burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence
of this syndrome . to date , these claims are unsubstantiated
by any available data. hopefully , as a scientist , you would
take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based
upon their data.

beasties with present methods even if they were there. noring and the
fellow from oklahoma (sorry , forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences
namely , that when people with certain conditions are given anti fungals ,
many of them appear to get better.
gee , i have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about
myself , my friends , and my family , but in the practice of
medicine i expect and demand more rigorous rationales for
basing therapy than aunt susie 's brother in law ... .

anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis ,
but rarely proves anything in a positive sense. and unlike
mathematics , boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical
issues , and so evidence of 'exceptions' does not usually
disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease.

so , if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for example ,
controlled double blind studies showing that the anti fungals do n't do any
better than sugar water then let 's hear it. if you do n't , then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side , and abject
disbelief on the other. in which case , please , there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.
i would characterize it not as 'abject disbelief' but rather
'scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions'.

it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double blind
study of antifungals (or else , forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test , just carry it out themselves ! ) and also , whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.
i have no problem with such an approach but this is not what
is happening in the 'trenches' of this diagnosis.

hello , a friend is under going kemotherapy(sp \? ) for breast cancer. i'm
trying to learn what i can about it. any info would be appreciated.
thanks.

you 've asked a toughie of a question. there are many different drugs which
are used for chemotherapy.

the overall purpose of chemotherapy (do n't worry about the spelling. some of
these crazy medical words are impossible to spell ! ) is to either destroy
cancer cells or to keep them from growing. different drugs have different
effects on cancer cells , and therefore , it is not uncommon to use more than
one drug at a time.

some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle
of a cell. others work only at specific times during the cell cycle.

the first phase of the cell cycle is g1 it is when the protein synthesis
and rna systhesis occurs. in the second phase , s , synthesis of dna occurs.
the third phase is g2 the dna splits and rna and protein are synthesized
aagain. in the fourth phase , m (or mitosis) , the cell may divide.

there are drugs which are effective in each phase. some stop dna synthesis.
others stop the cell from dividing. others wreck protein synthesis.
at any rate , the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells
to stop growing.

if what you are seeking is practical advice , i apologize for rambling
on the techno stuff. some side effects are pretty common. chemo. drugs
are rather nasty. it can cause a person to lose their appetite and to
experience nausea and vomiting. things to help this include eating small
frequent meals. it is also suggested that if nausea vomiting (hereafter
known as n v) occurs that the person notify the doctor there are medicines
tthat help nausea. diarrhea can be an effect. antidiarrheal medications
can be given , and good skincare and fluid intake are important.

probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss. this does not always
happen. it depends on what drugs are being given , and on the person
themself. different people taking the same drug can and do have different
side effects. i have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug
headband and or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss , presumably
by reducing blood flow to the scalp. if anyone has seen research on this
too , i would love to see it , and possibly some bib data.

i highly recommend making contact with the american cancer society.
they have a vast selection of literature and information. in addition ,
if your friend has had a mastectomy , i highly recommend reach for recovery .
it is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast
because of cancer. they can offer some excellent support and suggestions.

if you have further questions , please send me e mail. i hav some good
access to information , and i enjoy trying to help other people.

i wish the best to you and your friend.

when i was a school boy , my biology teacher told us of an incident
in which a couple were very passionate without actually having
sexual intercourse. somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm
cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation.

was my biology teacher misinforming us , or do such incidents actually
occur \?

sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg. there is only one way for
pregnancy to occur intercourse. these days however there is also
artificial insemination and implantation techniques , but we 're speaking of
natural acts here. it is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is
deposited just outside of the vagina (i.e. coitus interruptus) , but that 's
about at far as you can get. through clothes no way. better go talk

i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion
one way or another on hidden candida infections. i can
understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with
various general kinds of symptoms , while there is a lack of solid
demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms.
(to understand this skepticism , one only needs to know of past
failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of
hidden candida infection. there have been quite a few , and the
proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical.)

on the other hand , i am happy to read that some people are
sufficiently interested in this possibility , spurred by
suggestive clinical experience , to research it further. the
doubters may be surprised. (it has happened before.)

i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may
not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or

b marty b.

marty , i personally would n't be so quick and take that nejm article
on kidney stones as gospel. first of all , i would want to know who
sponsored that study.
i have seen too many nutrition bulletins over the years from
local newspapers , magazines , to tv guide , with disclaimers on the
bottom informing us that this great health news was brought to us
compliments of the dairy industries.
there are of course numerous other interest groups now that thrive
financially on the media hype created from the supposedly enormous
benefits of increasing one 's calcium intake.

secondly , were all the kidney stones of the test subjects involved
in that project analysed for their chemical composition \? the study
did n't say that , it only claimed that most kidney stones are large
ly calcium.
perhaps it wo n't be long before another study comes up with the exact
opposite findings. a curious phenomenon with researchers is that they
are oftentimes just plain wrong. it would n't be the first time.

sodium magnesium calcium phosphorus ratios are , in my opinion , still
the most reliable indicators for the cause , treatment , and prevention
of kidney stones.
i , for one , will continue to recommend the most logical changes in
one 's diet or through supplementation to counteract or prevent kidney
stones of either type and they definitely wo n't include an increase
in calcium if the stones have been identified as being of the calcium
type and people 's chemical analysis confirms that they would benefit
from a phosphorus raising approach instead !

ron roth

ron , you are absolutely right. not all kidney stones have calcium and not
all calcium stones are calcium oxalate. but the vast majority are calcium
oxalate. calcium is just one piece of the puzzle. i cited that nejm article
as a way of pointing out to some of the physicians in this group that
conventional wisdom is used in medicine , always has been and probably
always will be. if one uses conventional wisdom , there is a chance that
you will be wrong. as long as the error is not going to cause a lot of
damage , what 's the big deal(why call a physician who gives anti fungals to
sinus suffers or gi distress patients a quack \? ).

on the kidney stone problem. i 'd want a mineral profile run in a clinical
chemistry lab. balance is much more important than the dietary intake of
calcium. i know that you use an electrical conductance technique to
measure mineral balance in the body. i know that you do n't think that the
serum levels for minerals are very useful(i agree). if i can get a good
nutritional assessment lab setup where i can actually measure the tissue
reserve for minerals , i 'd like to do a collaborative study with you to see
how your technique compares with mine.

oxygen(just like it does in the vagina). as much stuff as there is in the
lay press about l. acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections , i'm really
amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out.

i 've mentioned this study a couple of times now ingestion of yogurt
containing lactobacillus acidophilus as prophylaxis for candidal
vaginitis , annals of internal medicine , 3 1 92 116(5) 353 7. do you
have a problem with the study because they used yogurt rather than
capsules of lactobacillus (even though it had positive results) \?

the study was a crossover trial of daily ingestion of 8 ounces of
yogurt. there was a marked decrease in infections while women were
ingesting the yogurt. problems with the study included very small
numbers (33 patients enrolled) and many protocol violations (only
21 patients were analyzed). still , the difference in rates of infection
between the two groups was so large that the study remains fairly
believable.

david rind

david , this study looks like a good one. gordon rubenfeld did a medline
search and also sent me the same reference through e mail. since
commercial yogurt does not always have a good lactobacillus a. or
bulgaricus culture , a negative finding would not have been too informative.
this is often the reason why lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are
recommended rather than yogurt.

i guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria
back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the
anus was not serving as a candida reservoir(a fact that gordon r. vehementy
denys) \? i see two possible theories. one , the l. acidophilus , which is a
facultatively anaerobic bacterium , could make it through the gut and
colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida. this would not explain
the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion
was stopped though. the other is that the additional bacteria in the
intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida
looses it 's major food source.

getting lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract(where it is
normally found) would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal
yeast blooms though. an acetic acid , lactobacillus acidophilus douche has
been used to get this effect but i 've not seen any such treatment reported in
the medical literature. this would be an example of physicians conducting
their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their
patients. when this is done in private practice , the results are rarely , if
ever published. it was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age
emerged with clinical trials. it really raises a big question. does the
medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to
help patients or does it look the other way.

this particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous
therapy is involved(even the anti fungals are not all that dangerous). but
there are some areas(like edta chelation therapy) , where the fire is pretty
hot and somebody could get burned. it 's really tough. do i follow only
well established protocols and then give up if they do n't work that well or
do it try something that looks like it will work but has n't been proven to
work yet \?

my stand is to consider other treatment possibilities , especially if they
involve little or no risk to the patient. getting good bacteria back into
the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility. the other
is getting l. acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a
problem with recurring yeast infections.

there is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss. the
few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher
ently biased (the investigators were making money from marketing it).
theoretically it really doesnt make sense either. the claim is that chromium
will increase muscle mass and decrease fat. of course , chromium is also used t
o cure diabetes , high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes(just
as well as anabolic steroids). sounds like snake oil for the 1990 's )



where are your references \? i have been unable to find studies that state
that chromium cures diabetese . it can reduce the amount of insulin you
have to take. high blood pressure i have never heard of this claim
before. ... anabolic steroids i have also never heard of this claim
before. sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth
for god knows what reason. did somebody piss you off at one time \?



on the other hand , it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet , and place
bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic...



i agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself is n't likely
to make a fat person thin. but it can be the decisive component
of an overall strategy for long term weight control and make an
important contribution to good health. it is important to
exercise (11 , 12) and also avoid fat calories (9 , 10).

chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase
lean muscle (1 , 2 , 3). i will not bore you with the
statistics. you would n't believe these anyway.

chromium picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of
the essential mineral chromium. chromium plays a vital role
in sensitizing the body 's tissues to the hormone insulin.
weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity
to insulin and thus , in turn , makes it harder to lose
weight (4).

insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards
protein breakdown in muscles (5 , 6). this protein sparing
effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets
as insulin levels decline , which results in loss of muscle
and organ tissue. by sensitizing muscle to insulin ,
chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters
so that they burn more fat and less muscle. preservation
of lean body mass has an important long term positive
effect on metabolic rate , helping dieters keep off the
fat they 've lost.

chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding
the thermogenic (heat producing) effects of insulin.
insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability
of food calories , so it 's not at all surprising that insulin
stimulates metabolism (4 , 7 , 8). note that i did not say
that chromium picolinate increases metabolism.

in summary , you need to change your life style in order to
loose weight and stay healthy

a. reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20 of calories.
eating fat makes you fat.

b. increase dietary fiber
low in calories high in nutrients.

c. get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week
burn calories.

d. take chromium picolinate daily
lose fat keep muscle

rates of cesarean delivery united states , 1991

source mmwr 42(15) date apr 23 , 1993

cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the
approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986
(table 1). the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among
21 reporting countries , exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico (1). this
report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc 's national hospital
discharge survey (nhds) for 1991 and compares these data with previous years.
data on discharges from short stay , nonfederal hospitals have been
collected annually since 1965 in the nhds , conducted by cdc 's national center
for health statistics. for 1991 , medical and demographic information were
abstracted from a sample of 274 , 000 inpatients discharged from 484
participating hospitals. the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior
cesarean (vbac) presented in this report are based on weighted national
estimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31 , 000 (11 ) women discharged
after delivery. the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were
calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from
national vital registration data. therefore , estimates of the number of
cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based
solely on the nhds (2). stated differences in this analysis are significant at
the 95 confidence level , based on the two tailed t test with a critical value
of 1.96.
in 1991 , there were 23.5 cesareans per 100 deliveries , the same rate as
in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986 1989 (table 1). the primary cesarean
rate (i.e. , number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no
previous cesareans) for 1986 1991 also was stable , ranging from 16.8 to 17.5.
in 1991 , the cesarean rate in the south was 27.6 , significantly (p 0.05)
higher than the rates for the west (19.8) , midwest (21.8) , and northeast
(22.6). rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years
than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or
government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger
hospitals and for deliveries for which blue cross blue shield and other
private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of
payment (table 2). the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries.
since the early 1970s , the number and percentage of births to older women
increased however , if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained
the same as in 1986 , the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23.3 ,
essentially the same as the 23.5 observed.
based on the nhds , of the approximately 4 , 111 , 000 live births in 1991 , an

hicnet medical newsletter page 1
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

estimated 966 , 000 (23.5 ) were by cesarean delivery. of these , an estimated
338 , 000 (35.0 ) births were repeat cesareans , and 628 , 000 (65.0 ) were primary
cesareans. since 1986 , approximately 600 , 000 primary cesareans have been
performed annually. in 1986 , 8.5 of women who had a previous cesarean
delivered vaginally , compared with 24.2 in 1991. of all cesareans in 1991 ,
35.0 were associated with a previous cesarean , 30.4 with dystocia (i.e. ,
failure of labor to progress) , 11.7 with breech presentation , 9.2 with fetal
distress , and 13.7 with all other specified complications.
the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2.8 days. in
comparison , the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4.5 days ,
and for a repeat cesarean , 4.2 days nearly twice the duration for vbac
deliveries (2.2 days) or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs (2.3
days). in 1986 , the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3.2 days , for
primary cesareans 5.2 days , for repeat cesareans 4.7 days , and for vbac and
non vbac vaginal deliveries 2.7 and 2.6 days , respectively.

reported by office of vital and health statistics systems , national center
for health statistics , cdc.

editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from
1965 through 1986 however , the findings in this report indicate that rates
have been stable since 1986 (3). because there is little evidence that
maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because
cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of
childbirth , a national health objective for the year 2000 (4) is to reduce the
overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary
cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries (objective 14.8).
postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections
may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries
than for vaginal births (5). moreover , the prolonged hospital stays for
cesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs. for example , in
1991 , the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and
4720 , respectively. the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes
611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges (6). if the cesarean
rate in 1991 had been 15 (the year 2000 objective) instead of 23.5 , the number
of cesarean births would have decreased by 349 , 000 (617 , 000 versus 966 , 000) ,
resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospital
charges.
despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 , several factors may
impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean
delivery. for example , vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women
offered trial of labor , which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 (7).
of women who are offered a trial of labor , 50 70 could deliver vaginally (7)
a level already achieved by many hospitals (8). trial of labor was routinely
offered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 (the most recent year for which

hicnet medical newsletter page 2
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

national data are available) (9) when the vbac rate (according to nhds data)
was 5.7 . the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35 , based on all
women who had a prior cesarean , regardless of whether a trial of labor was
attempted. to reach the overall cesarean rate goal , however , increases in the
vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary
rate.
one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by
applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean
delivery , by requiring a second opinion , and by instituting a peer review
process (10). other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates
include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing
reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of
physician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public
awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns ,
which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean
delivery (4).

malaria among u.s. embassy personnel kampala , uganda , 1992

source mmwr 42(15) date apr 23 , 1993

the treatment and prevention of malaria in africa has become a
challenging and complex problem because of increasing drug resistance.
although the risk of acquiring malaria for u.s. citizens and their dependents
stationed overseas generally has been low , this risk varies substantially and
unpredictably. during may 1992 , the office of medical services , department of
state (oms dos) , and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases
among official u.s. personnel stationed in kampala , uganda. a review of the
health records from the embassy health unit (ehu) in kampala indicated that 27
cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june
1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991. ehu , oms dos , and
cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and
identify potential risk factors for malaria among u.s. embassy personnel. this
report summarizes the results of the investigation.
malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case patients were
available for review by oms dos and cdc. a case of malaria was confirmed if
the slide was positive for plasmodium sp. of the 25 persons , 17 were slide
confirmed as having malaria.
a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to
obtain information about residence , activities , use of malaria
chemoprophylaxis , and use of personal protection measures (i.e. , using bednets
and insect repellents , having window and door screens , and wearing long
sleeves and pants in the evening). of the 157 persons eligible for the survey ,
128 (82 ) responded.
risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in
kampala. although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less
than or equal to 15 years (6 32 19 ) than among persons greater than 15
years (11 94 12 ) , this difference was not significant (relative risk
rr 1.6 95 confidence interval ci 0.6 4.0). eighty two percent of the
cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for 1 5 years ,
compared with those living there less than 1 year. travel outside of the
kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for
malaria.
four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who
participated in the survey mefloquine , chloroquine and proguanil , chloroquine
alone , and proguanil alone. in addition , 23 (18 ) persons who responded were
not using any malaria chemoprophylaxis. the risk for malaria was significantly
lower among persons using either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil (8 88
9 ) than among persons using the other regimens or no prophylaxis (9 37
24 ) (rr 0.4 95 ci 0.2 0.9). twelve persons not using prophylaxis reported
side effects or fear of possible side effects as a reason.
the risk for malaria was lower among persons who reported using bednets

hicnet medical newsletter page 5
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

all or most of the time (2 27 7 ) than among persons who sometimes or rarely
used bednets (15 99 15 ) (rr 0.5 95 ci 0.1 2.0). the risk for malaria was
also lower among persons who consistently used insect repellent in the evening
(0 16) , compared with those who rarely used repellent (17 110 15 ) (rr 0
upper 95 confidence limit 1.2). risk for malaria was not associated with
failure to have window or door screens or wear long sleeves or pants in the
evening.
as a result of this investigation , ehu staff reviewed with all personnel
the need to use and comply with the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis
regimens. ehu staff also emphasized the need to use personal protection
measures and made plans to obtain insecticide impregnated bednets and to
provide window and door screens for all personnel.

editorial note in uganda , the increase in malaria among u.s. personnel was
attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis
regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased
malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub saharan
africa. the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and
continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in
malaria endemic areas preventive measures that are also important for
short term travelers to such areas.
mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most
other areas with chloroquine resistant p. falciparum however , in some areas
(e.g. , thailand) , resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness. in
africa , the efficacy of mefloquine , compared with chloroquine alone , in
preventing infection with p. falciparum is 92 (1 ). mefloquine is safe and
well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2 year period. the risk
for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis
(e.g. , psychosis and convulsions) is low (i.e. , 1.3 1.9 episodes per 100 , 000
users 2) , while the risk for less severe adverse reactions (e.g. , dizziness ,
gastrointestinal complaints , and sleep disturbances) is similar to that for
other antimalarial chemoprophylactics (1).
doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine , but the need
for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen
(3 , 4). chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense
chloroquine resistance (e.g. , southeast asia and africa). in africa , for
persons who cannot take mefloquine or doxycycline , chloroquine and proguanil
is an alternative , although less effective , regimen. chloroquine should be
used for malaria prevention in areas only where chloroquine resistant p.
falciparum has not been reported.

fda approval of use of a new haemophilus b conjugate vaccine and a
combined diphtheria tetanus pertussis and haemophilus b conjugate
vaccine for infants and children

source mmwr 42(15) date apr 23 , 1993

haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) conjugate vaccines have been
recommended for use in infants since 1990 , and their routine use in infant
vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of hib
disease in the united states (1 3). vaccines against diphtheria , tetanus , and
pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the
united states since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than
90 reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these
organisms. because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely
recommended for infants , a high priority is the development of combined
vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate
injections.
the food and drug administration (fda) recently licensed two new products
for vaccinating children against these diseases 1) the haemophilus b
conjugate vaccine (tetanus toxoid conjugate , acthib trademark) , for
vaccination against hib disease only and 2) a combined diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine (dtp) and hib conjugate vaccine
(tetramune trademark) , a combination of vaccines formulated for use in
vaccinating children against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and hib disease.

acthib trademark

on march 30 , 1993 , the fda approved a new haemophilus b conjugate
vaccine , polyribosylribitol phosphate tetanus toxoid conjugate (prp t) ,
manufactured by pasteur merieux serum et vaccins and distributed as acthib
trademark by connaught laboratories , inc. (swiftwater , pennsylvania). this
vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three dose primary
vaccination series administered at ages 2 , 4 , and 6 months. previously
unvaccinated infants 7 11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months
apart. previously unvaccinated children 12 14 months of age should receive one
dose. a booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all
children. previously unvaccinated children 15 59 months of age should receive
a single dose and do not require a booster. more than 90 of infants receiving
a primary vaccination series of acthib trademark (consecutive doses at 2 , 4 ,
and 6 months of age) develop a geometric mean titer of anti haemophilus b
polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug ml (4). this response is similar to
that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed
haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in
prospective trials. two u.s. efficacy trials of prp t were terminated early
because of the concomitant licensure of other haemophilus b conjugate vaccines

hicnet medical newsletter page 8
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

for use in infants (4). in these studies , no cases of invasive hib disease
were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with prp t. these and
other studies suggest that the efficacy of prp t vaccine will be similar to
that of the other licensed hib vaccines. tetramune trademark
on march 30 , 1993 , the fda approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus
toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine (dtp) and haemophilus b conjugate
vaccine. tetramune trademark , available from lederle praxis biologicals (pearl
river , new york) , combines two previously licensed products , dtp (triimmunol
registered , manufactured by lederle laboratories pearl river , new york) and
haemophilus b conjugate vaccine (hibtiter registered , manufactured by praxis
biologics , inc. rochester , new york).
this vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months 5 years
for protection against diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , and hib disease when
indications for vaccination with dtp vaccine and haemophilus b conjugate
vaccine coincide. based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody
responses to each of the components of the two vaccines , tetramune trademark
is expected to provide protection against hib , as well as diphtheria , tetanus ,
and pertussis , equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other
dtp and haemophilus b vaccines.
the advisory committee for immunization practices (acip) recommends that
all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed haemophilus b
conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12
15 months (5). the acip also recommends that all infants receive a four dose
primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 ,
4 , 6 , and 15 18 months of age , and a booster dose at 4 6 years (6 8). a
complete statement regarding recommendations for use of acthib trademark and
tetramune trademark is being developed.

international workshop explores oral manifestations of
hiv infection

nidr research digest
written by jody dove
march 1993
national institute of dental research

at the second international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv
infection , held january 31 february 3 in san francisco , participants explored
issues related to the epidemiology , basic molecular virology , mucosal
immunology , and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection.
the workshop was organized by dr. john greenspan and dr. deborah
greenspan of the department of stomatology , school of dentistry , university of
california , san francisco. an international steering committee and scientific
program committee provided guidance.
the conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries , including
asia , africa , europe , central america , south america , as well as the united
states and canada. support tor the workshop was provided by the national
institute of dental research , the national cancer institute , the national
institute of allergy and infectious diseases , the nih office of aids research ,
and the procter and gamble company.
among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics ,
professional responsibility , and public policy occupational issues provision
of oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission and
mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and
women 's issues.

recommendations

recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association
between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv , to
establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions , to look for
more effective treatments for oral manifestations , to expand molecular biology
studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral
lesions , and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions.

epidemiology

since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv
infection was convened five years ago , the epidemiology of hiv infection has

hicnet medical newsletter page 11
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

radically changed. in 1988 , hiv infection was detected and reported largely
in homosexual and bisexual males , intravenous drug users , and hemophiliacs.
today , more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in
children and adolescents.
while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa , a
major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well.
five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more
are appearing all the time.
researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions
such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis. they also are beginning to explore
the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression
and prognosis.

social political issues

discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection
focused on changing the public 's attitude that aids is retribution for
indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use. speakers also addressed health
care delivery for hiv infected patients , and the need to educate the public
about what aids is , and how it is acquired.

saliva and salivary glands

conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitory
activity of saliva , the strength of which varies among the different salivary
secretions. whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular
secretions , which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid
secretions. research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible
for salivary inhibitory activity. they attributed the hiv inhibitory effect
of saliva to the 1) aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva , which may both
promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell , and 2)
direct effects on the virus or target cells.
other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease
in hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity.

pediatric issues

pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest. with
early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment , the life expectancy of hiv
infected children has tripled. the prevention of transmission of hiv from
mother to child may be possible in many cases , particularly if the mother 's
sero status is known prior to giving birth.

periodontal and gingival tissue disease


hicnet medical newsletter page 12
volume 6 , number 11 april 25 , 1993

oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and
gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection. recommendations made at
the workshop include the standardization of terminology , refinement of
diagnostic markers , standardization of study design , and proper consideration
of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy.

occupational and treatment issues

occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv infected individuals
and treatment rendered by hiv infected health care professionals still command
considerable attention. factors under consideration include the cost benefit
of hiv testing , patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infection
and the reverse , and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the
treatment of hiv infected patients.
conference participants anticipate that a third international workshop on
the oral manifestations of hiv infection will be held in five years or less.
proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the quintessence
company in late 1993.

there is the possibility that there is some degree of constipation causing
chronic straining which has caused the bowel movements. the classic
problems that are supposed to be looked for in someone with a hernia are
constipation , chronic cough , colon cancer (and you 're not too young for
that) and sitting for long periods of time at the computer , reading news.

good luck with your surgery !

steve holland

well , that post was not that accurate. people with early life hernias
are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias.
the hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining.
however , the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is
high enough that it ought to be repaired. the risk of cancer is probably
no higher than the general population , but since you are near 40 , it would
be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening , such as a flexible
sigmoidoscopy. sorry for the misleading info.

i saw this a few years ago on tomorrow 's world (low brow bbc

electrocuted because de ionised water does not conduct). these waves are
focused on the kidneys by a parabolic reflector and cause the stone to

writes
i need information on the medical (including emotional ) pros and
cons of circumcision (at birth). i am especially interested in
references to studies that indicate disadvantages or refute studies
that indicate advantages. a friend who is a medical student is
writing a survey paper , and apparently the studies she has run into
are all for circumcision , the main argument being a lower risk of
penile cancer.

please email responses as i am not a frequent reader of either group.
i will summarize to the net.

i'm very surprised that medical schools still push routine circumcision
of newborn males on the population. since your friend is not a man , she
ca n't imagine what it 's like to have a penis , much less a foreskin. i
guess if american medicine did an artistic job of circumcising every
male , then the visual result would be somewhat more natural in
appearance...

the penile cancer thing has been completely debunked...she must be
going to school on a south pacific island. tell her to check the journal
or urology for circumcision articles. i remember at least 1 on an old
jewish man (cut at birth) who developed penile cancer....i mean , if the
cancer risk was that great , the europe who have been circumcising like
crazy , too. teaching a boy how to keep his cockhead clean is the issue a
little proper hygiene goes a long way americans are just too hung up on
the penis to consider cleaning it that 's just way too much like
mastubation. so you have surgical intervention that is basically
unnecessary.

the second issue summarized he has had extra heartbeats for the past
3 to 4 years , and once was symptomatic from them , with some
lightheadedness.
he is young , (30 ish) , thin and in good
health (recent bloodtests were all normal) , and do not smoke , use drugs or
caffeine , etc. i'm willing to accept the extra beats as normal , but do n't
want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom. the number
of pvc 's seems to increase throughout the day , and with exercise (or something
as simple as climbing some stairs). also , if i get up after sitting or lying
down for a while , i tend to get a couple of extra beats. could they possibly
be related to the esophagous problems \? both seemed to develop at about the
same time.

i' not an expert on heart problems , but pvc 's are common and have been
overtreated in the past. my personal experience , and i have the same
history an build you do (related to the heart , that is) , is that my pvc 's
come and go , with some months causing anxiety. taking on more fluids
seems to help , and they seem worse in the summer. remember that a slow
heart rate will allow more pvc 's to be apparent , so perhaps it is an
indication of a healthy cardiac system (but ask an expert about that
last point , especially)

i too have had premature ventricular heartbeat , starting in 1974. (these
are not , by the way , extra heartbeats. this is how they feel , and
this is how i described them initially to the doctor , but they 're
actually premature heartbeats. i would sometimes experience a lapse
after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time ,
making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again.)

i had them persistently for eighteen years. then i went on a low fat
diet , and they just stopped. i have n't had a single episode of pvh
for almost two years. i know correlation does not imply causation.
this is just fwiw.

is there a right eye dominance (eyedness \? ) as there is an
overall right handedness in the population \? i mean do most
people require less lens corrections for the one eye than the
other \? if so , what kinds of percentages can be attached to this \?
thanks.


yes , there is such a thing as eye dominance , although i am not sure if
this dominance refers to perscription strength.

as i recall , if you selectively close your dominant eye , you will percieve
that the image shifts. this will not happen if you close your other eye.

i believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness , but i
ca n't recall the relation at the moment.

barry d. benowitz

i read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. so there is one
book out there..at least one ).

there were several types of eye dominance. where a person looks in their
memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc another type is related to
coordination activities like hitting a ball. another for reading.

i did n't read one that discussed prescription strength. although people
with bad vision , near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
eye.

pk115050@wvnvms.wvnet.edu

first off , i would consider the severity of the pain. i had stones
several years ago , and there 's now way i could have made it without
heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
hospital. i was told that there was nothing that i could take that would
dissolve them. if the stones are passible , the best thing she could do
is drink lots of water , and hope that they pass , but every time they
move a little , the pain will be excrutiating. i was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (yes ,
by a male doctor , so i'm sure some of you women will disagree). i 'd
really like to know the truth in this , so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.

does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly \? does
short term use of the drug ever produce long term side effects after
the use of the drug \? my grandmother recently had to be hospitalized
and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks. although the
drug has been terminated , she has changed from a perky , slightly
senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone
and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance. it
seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the
course of just one and one half months. i have to believe that the
combination of the hospital stay and some drug(s) are in part
catalysts for this. any comments \?

hello ,

just one quick question
my father has had a back problem for a long time and doctors
have diagnosed an operation is needed. since he lives down in
mexico , he wants to know if there is a hospital anywhere in
the united states particulary famous for this kind of surgery ,
kind of like houston has a reputation for excellent doctors
in eye surgery. any additional info or pointers will be
appreciated a whole lot ! ...

there is one hospital that is here in new york city that is famous for its
orthopedists , namely the hospital for special surgery. they are located on
the upper east side of manhattan. if you want their address and phone let
me know , i 'll get them , i dont know them off hand.

she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary ( \? )
tests and her values were regarded as low. the doctor (and my wife) are
not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the

this is ridiculous , and your doctor sounds like a nut , if what is
reported here is what the doctor actually said. if your wife 's
pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic , she 'll
need insulin replacement. that does n't mean she 's dependent on
insulin , anymore than she was beforehand if her body does n't make
enough , she 'll have to get it elsewhere. oral thyroid replacement
hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism , and
it 's really the only effective therapy available anyway. plus , it 's
cheap. taking thyroid hormone when it is n't needed does cause your
thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone , but that 's a
feature , not a bug , and it 's irrelevant in any case in the face of
hypothyroidism , because her problem that her gland is n't producing
enough. there is n't a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency
caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone
analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of
prolonged administration of corticosteroids , so there should be no
worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland.

the last couple of
monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath (sp \? ) and been given
some drops to re activate either her thyroidal gland and or the
'message center' in the brain (sorry about the approximate language ,
but i have n't got many clues to what the english terms are , but the
brain area is called the 'hypofyse' in norwegian.)

homeopathy is nonsense. tell her to stop wasting her money , health and time ,
and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make
a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy.

i was just wondering if exercises specific to particular regions of the
body (such as thighs) will basically only tone the thighs , or if fat
from other parts of the body (such as breasts) would be affected just as
much.

there are two different mechanisms here toning of muscles and reduction of
fat. exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles
exercised (example look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching
arms and non pitching arms in major league pitchers). however , if exercise
also leads to reduction of body fat , the loss of body fat will be equally
distributed over the entire body. there is no way to spot reduce body fat
other than surgically , through liposuction. distribution of body fat is
genetically determined. sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like fat ,
so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may appear as though the fat
is changing into muscle , but really fat and muscle tissues are totally
separate , and one does not ever change into the other.
