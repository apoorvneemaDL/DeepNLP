a program that generates these pictures. there 's a company in texas that makes them but i
doubt if they 're giving the program away. any help would be appreciated.

there is a program included with the book virtual reality playhouse which
will let you generate these pictures. it 's not a very powerful program but
it does an acceptable job for experimentation purposes.

lines 46

a great many computer programmers read dr. dobb 's journal . in a recent
issue , there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read. it
said

there 's nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer
industry. the industry needs an ibm for the 90 's.

where has the hacker ethic gone \? not the cracker ethic , which is something
entirely different and bad , but the hacker ethic , which tells us to value the
free distribution of information and yield to the hands on imperative \? why is
it that people and corporations like bill gates , ibm , and intel are able to
have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry \? why is it that , if a person
like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks ,
crannies , and idiosyncrasies of a computer system , they are not given any
useful information by those who know , just a badmouthing \? (or are completely
ignored) why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to
make truly innovative products \? i ask those of you who call yourselves
hackers , why is this \? and further , how can you let it go on \? it is a fact
that the computer industry has changed the world , and shall continue to do so
for a long time to come. it has allowed the propagation of information in a
volume unheard of even twenty years ago , and has made this world even smaller
than it was before. i shudder to think what that world will be like if the
corporations are allowed to have their way , perpetuating more drivel like the
286 , windows , and the ibm product line on the computer using public.

that is not to say i am against business per se people who profit off of
innovative , intelligent , creative designs do not bother me. in fact , i applaud
it that is the american way. but those who manage to sell kludgy , uncreative
systems to the public , and profit off of them , are the ones who are the
problem. and , unfortunately , because they have enough money to make up for
blunt stupidity , they can keep doing it for a very long time.

i put it to you thus where has the hacker ethic gone \? if it still exists ,
where \? and , if it does exist , why are those who call themselves hackers
allowing this to perpetuate itself \? why are they not creating new , innovative ,
interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry \?

i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence.

lines 43

dear netters


i am looking for c source code to test if a 3d point lies within a

concave polyhadra. i have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist parity counting and angle sumation. both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. so i wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

another 'rough' solition (do n't care special cases) is ray casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(m. tamminen , et. al. , 1984. ray casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index . computer aided designs. 4 , 1984 , 60 65).
but the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. how this could be done in practice \?
i have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. how could i ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra \? the paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


i have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. it says if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra... . again how to make
sure \?


any pointers are welcome \?

windowsvga 24 , a true color 24 bit graphics accelerator card that
delivers up to 16.8 million colors at speeds faster than the
competition. plus it offers a full range of resolutions , high
refresh rates as well as unique proprietary performance features.
the card is available in both 16 bit isa bus and 32 bit vesa local
bus versions (models 8500 and 8500vl).
with 1mb dram on board , the windowsvga 24 card offers
maximum resolution up to 1 , 280 x 1 , 024 and supports a refresh rate
of 72hz at 800 x 600 and resolution up to 1 , 024 x 768
non interlaced. both models provide performance many times greater
than standard svga boards , yet conform to all current video
standards.
windowsvga 24 features genoa 's flickerfree(tm) technology ,
which eliminates screen flash and flicker to make viewing much more
comfortable. the cards also come with safescan(tm) , a utility
developed by genoa to eliminate the black border around the screen
and thereby provide 100 percent screen use for overscanning monitors.
windowsvga model 8500vl takes full advantage of the speed
offered by the new vesa local bus technology. most vl bus cards
will only handle data transfers up to 33mhz , but the 8500vl will
transfer data at the full speed of the cpu , up to 50mhz. genoa is
also offering this card in the turbobahn combination packaged
with their turboexpress 486vl motherboard.
built around the cirrus logic gd 5426 gui accelerator ,
windowsvga 24 offers the user an exceptional price performance
value. genoa 's advanced proprietary drivers act to turbocharge
the chip , thereby providing an affordable accelerator card with
power and performance that surpass many of the more highly priced
chip cards. the genoa user will enjoy optimal speed and
reliability for such programs as windows , autocad , autoshade , 3d
studio , os 2 , orcad and more. driver updates and product bulletins
are available on genoa 's bbs at (408) 943 1231.

greetings this is a general call for information regarding image
processing. i am looking for any material related to the field , and am
also trying to get my hands on some easy to use packages related to the
field. in particular source code for general use packages.

i already have several texts on the subject , but would appreciate more
input from people more knowledgable in the field than myself. i'm not
mathematically literate (ie. i do n't have a degree in mathematics) , so
any material that is suggested i would prefer that it was not
mathematically intensive.

the best book i have found on the subject at the moment is

practical digital image processing
by rhys lewis
isbn 0 13 683525 2
published by ellis horwood (c)1990.

likewise i am trying to get a fair sample of programs that demonstrate
image processing techniques. so far i have 'xv' , and 'khoros' for unix.
'dcview 2.1' for the ibm pc , and various related smatterings of c code
to help describe topics like , contrasting , dithering , image enhancement
via convolution etc.

if anyone could kindly supply me with some public domain software
pertinent to this area , or better still if they could tell me where i am
most likely to find it on the aarnet (internet). if i can i would prefer
source code in c or turbo pascal that includes some image processing
code algorithms , that i can readily alter manipulate for the purposes of
demonstration it would be most helpful.

all the above information will contribute to my post graduate studies ,
and will be liberally used in my paper , and seminar on the subject.

subject tangent vectors of kochanek bartels splines
organization university of trondheim
lines 33

i'm working on a system which uses a given set of 3d key frame
positions (x , y , z) to control an imaginary camera movement. i'm
using kochanek bartels splines (as described in the siggraph '84
proceedings) to create a variable number of inbetweens between
the key frames. i want the inbetweens to be given in the form
(x , y , z , dx , dy , dz) where the last three argumentsa are the x , y and
z component of the viewing direction vector of the camera when
positioned at (x , y , z).

the method presented by kochanek and bartels only deals with the
positions of the inbetween view points to be generated. i 've
tried to set the viewing direction at a view point equal to the
chord between the two adjacent view points (which in general are
not key frames) , but this causes a sligt discontinuity of the
viewing direction vector at the key frame positions (although
the spatial movement seems to work fine and i'm quite certain
i think ) that i 've not simply made an implementation
error...)

now i wonder if anyone out there has used this spline form for
similar purposes and how they decided the viewing vectors.
i 'd appreciate replies to be emailed to me at
iharkest@lise.unit.no
anyone else interested in the answer will be sent a summary of
the replies if they contact me.

hello ,

we are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our unix operating system
(a sequent running dynix 3.2). this graphics package must
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices
(pc 's running a terminal emulator , primarily).
at this point , x11 graphics is not an option.

this graphics program should , if possible , support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements)

1) complicated axes (log , linear , etc.) with fairly
precise axis labels (multi line labels , etc.)
major and minor tickmarks on axes , etc.

2) it would be nice if some limited amount of color
plotting were available , if the output device
supported it.

we have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it , but
gnuplot has some limitations. we are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

at this point , i'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems. if you have any information , please
contact me at the above email address. if the product you know
about is a commercial software package , please send a phone number
or email address so that i can contact them about pricing , etc.

labview 2

labview is used as a framework for image processing tools. it provides a
graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
program with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
wiring tool to create the block diagram (program). functions that the
block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
filtering , numerical analysis , statistics , etc. the tool allows any
virtual instrument (vi , a software file that looks and acts like a real
laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
instrument.

national instruments markets plug in digital signal processing (dsp)
boards for macintoshs and pc compatables that allow real time
acquisition and analysis at a personal computer. new software tools for
dsp are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. the
tools range from low level debugging software to high level block
diagram development software. there are three levels of dsp programming
associated with the nb dsp2300 board and labview
use of the nb dsp2300 analysis library ffts , power spectra , filters
routines callable from think c and macintosh programers workshop (mpw) c
that execute on the nb dsp2300 board. there is an analysis virtual
interface library of ready to use vis optimized for the nb dsp2300.

use of the national instruments developers toolkit that includes an
optimizing c compiler , an assembler and a linker for low level
programming of the dsp hardware. this approach offers the highest level
of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

use of the national instruments interface kit software package which has
utility functions for memory management data communications and
downloading code to the nb dsp2300 board. (this is the easiest route for
the development of custom code.)

ultimage concept vi

concept vi by graftek france is a family of image processing virtual
instruments (vis) that give labview 2 (described above) users high end
tools for designing , integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
a vi is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
instrument. typical applications for concept vi include thermography ,
surveillance , machine vision , production testing , biomedical imaging ,
electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

ultimage concept vi addresses applications which require further
qualitative and quantitative analysis. it includes a complete set of
functions for image enhancement , histogram equalization , spatial and
frequency filtering , isolation of features , thresholding , mathematical
morphology analysis , density measurement , object counting , sizing and
characterization.

the program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64 , a pixel
depth of 8 , 16 , or 32 bits , and one image plane. standard input and
output formats include pict , tiff , satie , and aipd. other formats can
be imported.

image enhancement features include lookup table transformations , spatial
linear and non linear filters , frequency filtering , arithmetic and logic
operations , and geometric transformations , among others. morphological
transformations include erosion , dilation , opening , closing , hole
removal , object separation , and extraction of skeletons , among others.
quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection , measurement , and
morphological distribution. measures include area , perimeter , center of
gravity , moment of inertia , orientation , length of relevant chords , and
shape factors and equivalence. measures are saved in ascii format. the
program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
modules.

a 3 d view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot. the histogram tool can
be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. the twenty eight
arithmetic and logical operations provide for masking and averaging
sections of images , noise removal , making comparisons , etc. there are
13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
intensity. these include high pass filters for contrast and outlines.
the frequency data resulting from fft analysis can be displayed as
either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase , magnitude)
data. the morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

the transformations include thresholding , eroding , dilating and even
hole filling.

the program 's quantitative analysis measurements include area ,
perimeter , center of mass , object counts , and angle between points.

iplab spectrum

iplab spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
graftek franceus ultimage concept vi. using scripting tools , the user
tells the system the operations to be performed. the problem is that far
too many basic operations require manual intervention. the tool
supports ffts , 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration , and a
movie command for cycling through windows.

the tool supports rtrue colors with 24 bit images or 256 levels of grey
scale. once an image has been imported it can be rre toucheds with
various editing tools typical of those used in macintosh based rpaints
applications. these include an eraser , pencil , brush and air brush.
advanced rpastes tools that control the interaction between a pasted
selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated. for
example , all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
being pasted. photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100 ,
allowing you to create ghost overlays. rphoto editings tools include
control of the brightness and contrast , color balancing , hue saturation
modification and spectrum equalization. images can be subjected to
various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image ,
blur edges , or locate edges. image scaling is also supported.

for storage savings , the images can be compressed using standard
algorithms , including externally supplied compression such as jpeg ,
availlable from storm technologies. the latest version of adobe
photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including epsf ,

colorstudio and imagestudio

colorstudio is an image editing and paint package from letraset that has
more features than adobe photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
therefore more difficult to use. several steps are often required to
accomplish that which can be done in a single step using photoshop. the
application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
easily end up with images in the 30 mb range. the program provides a
variety of powerful selection tools including the auto selection tool
which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color , close
hues , color range and mask.

digital darkroom

the latest release of digital darkroom has five new selection and
editing tools for enhancing images. one such feature allows the user to
select part of an image simply by painting it. a new polyline
selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
selections. a brush lets the operator paint with a selected portion
of the image. note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
this tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey scale
images only. it should be noted that digital darkroom is not as
powerful as either adobe photoshop or colorstudio.

dimple is compatable with mapii. the latest version is 1.4 and it is in
the beta stage of testing. dimple was initially developed as a teaching
tool and it is very good for this purpose.

dimple runs on a colour macintosh. it is a product still in its
development phase.. i.e. it does n't have all the inbuilt features of
other packages , but is coming along nicely. it has its own inbuilt
language for writing programs for processing an image , defining
convolution filters etc. dimple is a full mac application with pull down
menus etc... it is unprotected software.

image analyst

an image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
data from video images. image analyst lets users configure
sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
necessity of knowing a programming language. it is designed for such
tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
cameras attached to microscopes , or enhancing and measuring distances in
radiographs.

image analyst provides users with an array of field proven video
analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
instructions to enhance feature appearance count objects determine
density , shape , size , position , or movement perform object feature
extraction and conduct textural analysis automatically. image analyst
works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera , or
a disk stored image.

within minutes , without the need for programming , the image analyst user
can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi automatically
generated from tiff or pict files or from captured video tape images.
image analyst recognizes items in images based on their size , shape and
position. the tool provides direct support for the data translation and
scion frame grabbers. a menu command allows for image capture from a vcr
video camera or other ntsc or pal devices.

there are 2 types of files , the image itself and the related sequence
file that holds the processing , measurements and analysis that the user
defines. automated sequences are set up in regions of interest (roi)
represented by movable , sizable boxes atop the image. inside a roi , the
program can find the distance between two edges , the area of a shape ,
the thickness of a wall , etc. image analyst finds the center , edge and
other positions automatically. the application also provides tools so
that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. it also
supports histograms and a color look up table (clut) tool.

or (non anonymous) internet ftp. documentation (postscript mostly)
available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103) ,
directory pub aips and pub aips text publ. installation requires building
the system and thus a fortran and c compiler.
this package can read and write fits data (see sci.astro.fits) , and is
primarily for reduction , analysis , and image enhancement of radio astronomy
data from radio telescopes , particularly the very large array (vla) , a
synthesis instrument. it consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution , e.g. via maximum entropy.
there is an x11 based image tool (xas) and a tek compatible xterm based
graphics tool built into aips. the xas tool is modelled after the hardware
functionality of the international imaging systems model 70 display unit and
can do image arithmetic , etc.
the code is mostly fortran 77 with some system c language modules , and is
available for suns , ibm rs 6000 , dec ultrix , convex , cray (unicos) , and
alliant with support planned for hp 9000 7xx , solaris 2.1 , and maybe sgi.
there is currently a project aips underway to rewrite the
algorithmic functionality of aips in a modern setting , using c and an
object oriented approach. whereas aips is proprietary code (licensed for
free to non profit institutions) owner by nrao and the nsf , aips will be
in the public domain at some level , as it is an international effort with
contributions from the us , canada , england , the netherlands , india , and

disimp

(device independent software for image processing) is a powerful
system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
interactive times.

feature description

disimp incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
spatial data options. all functions can be easily accessed via the
disimp executive. this menu is modular in design and groups image
processes by their function. such a logical structure means that
complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
modules.

processes include image rectification , classification (unsupervised and
supervised) , intensity transformations , three dimensional display and
principal component analysis. disimp also supports the more simple and
effective enhancement techniques of filtering , band subtraction and
ratioing.

host configuration requirements

running on unix workstations , disimp is capable of processing the more
computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
disimp is available in both runtime and programmer 's environments. using
the programmers environment , utilities can be developed for specific
applications programs.

graphics are governed by an icon based display panel which allows quick
enhancments of a displayed image. manipulations of look up tables ,
colour stretches , changes to histograms , zooming and panning can be
interactively driven through this control.

a range of geographic projections enables disimp to integrate data of
image , graphic and textual types. images can be rectified by a number of
coordinate systems , providing the true geographic knowledge essential
for ground truthing. overlays of grids , text and vector data can be
added to further enhance referenced imagery.

the system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
to determine their own working environment , including the amount of help
required. disimp comes fully configured with no optional extras. the
purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
processing of remote sensed data.

global imaging software

we use global imaging software to process avhrr data , from the dish to
the final display. select a chunk of five band data from a pass ,
automatic navigation , calibrate it to albedo and temp , convert that to
byte , register it to predesigned window , all relatively automatically
and carefree.

it has no classification routines to speak of , but it is n't that
difficult to write your own with their programmer 's module.

very small operation one designs , one codes , one sells. been around for
a number of years , sold to weather service and navy. runs on hp9000
with hp ux. supports 24 bit display

hips

(human information processing laboratory 's image processing system)

michael landy co wrote and sell a general purpose package for image
processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
processing applications (robotics , medical , satellite , engineering , oil
exploration , etc.). it is called hips , and deals with sequences of
multiband images in the same way it deals with single images. it has
been growing since we first wrote it , both by additions from us as well
as a huge user contributed library.

feature description

hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide
a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research ,
system development and teaching. it handles sequences of images
(movies) in precisely the same manner as single frames.

programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image
transformations , filtering , convolution , fourier and other transform
processing , edge detection and line drawing manipulation , digital
image compression and transmission methods , noise generation , and image
statistics computation. over 150 such image transformation programs
have been developed. as a result , almost any image processing task
can be performed quickly and conveniently. additionally , hips allows
users to easily integrate their own custom routines. new users
become effective using hips on their first day.

hips features images that are self documenting. each image stored in
the system contains a history of the transformations that have been
applied to that image. hips includes a small set of subroutines
which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header , and
a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix
``filters''. it comes complete with source code , on line manual
pages , and on line documentation.

host configuration requirements

originally developed at new york university , hips now represents
one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing
environments currently available. it runs under the unix operating
system. it is modular and flexible , provides automatic documentation
of its actions , and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and
microvax , sun , apollo , masscomp , ncr tower , iris , ibm at , etc.
for image display and input , drivers are supplied for the grinnell and
adage (ikonas) image processors , and the sun 2 , sun 3 , sun 4 , and
sun 386i consoles. we also supply user contributed drivers for a
number of other framestores and windowing packages (sun gfx , sun
console , matrox vip 1024 , iti ip 512 , lexidata , macintosh ii , x
windowing system , and iris). the hipsaddon package includes an
interface for the crs 4000. it is a simple matter to interface hips
with other frame stores , and we can put interested users in touch with
users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max
video. hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices
because 98 of hips is machine independent.

availability

hips has proven itself a highly flexible system , both as an
interactive research tool , and for more production oriented tasks. it
is both easy to use , and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. hips
is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format (either reel to reel or
sun cartridge) , and comes with source code , libraries , a library of
convolu tion masks , and on line documentation and manual pages.

mira

please don't confuse that with the thalmanns animation system from
montreal. these are altogether different beasts ! nfotis

mira stands for microcomputer image reduction and analysis. mira gives
workstation level performance on 386 486 dos computers using svga cards in
256 color modes up to 1024x768. mira contains a very handsome functional
gui which is mouse and keystroke operated. mira reads writes tiff and fits
formats , native formats of a number of ccd cameras , and uncompressed binary
images in byte , short integer , and 4 byte real pixel format in 1 or 2
dimensions. the result of an image processing operation can be short integer
or real pixels , or the same as that of the input image. mira does the
operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
and accuracy of the pixel format. over 100 functions are hand coded in
assembly language for maximum speed on the intel hardware. the entire
graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
the speed of windowing operations. windows for 2 d image and 1 d image data
display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
value in real time as you move the mouse. there are also smooth , real time
contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
the displayed image(s) , all operated by the mouse. a wide selection of
grayscale , pseudocolor , and random palettes is provided , and other
palettes can be generated.


supported functions include such niceties as the following

o image image interpolation
o image constant
o unary operations abs value , polynomial of pixel value , chs , 1 x , log ,
byteswap , clip values at upper lower limits , short real or real short.
o combine images by mean , median , mode , or sum of pixel values , with or
without autoscaling to mean , median , or mode of an image section.
o convolutions filters laplacian , sobel edge operator , directional gradient ,
line , gaussian , elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters , unsharp
masking , median filters , user defined filter kernel. ellipse , rectangle ,
line , gradient , gaussian , and user defined filters can be rotated to
any specified angle.
o ccd data reduction flat fielding , dark subtraction , column over underscan
bias removal , remove bad pixels and column defects , normalize to
region target mean , median , or modal value.
o create subimage , mosaic m x n 1 d or 2 d images to get larger image ,
collapse 2 d image into 1 d image.
o plot 1 d section or collapsed section of 2 d image , plot histogram of
region of an image.
o review change image information header data , rename keywords , plot
keyword values for a set of images.
o luminance photometry elliptical or circular aperture photometry ,
brightness profile , isophotal photometry between set of upper lower
luminances , area and luminance inside traced polygon. interactive
background fitting and removal from part or all of image , fit elliptical
aperture shape to image isophotes.
o interactive with 2 d image contrast brightness , x y or diagonal plot
of pixel values , distance between two points , compute region stats , `
centroid , pan to x , y location or image center , zoom 1 16 to 10 times ,
change cursor to rectangle crosshair , full image crosshair , or off , and

lines 34

in article 9304271755.aa23355@enet gw.pa.dec.com you write
anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex has n't dealt with
cgm , asn.1 , cda , dca , sgml , or any one of a number of other
very successful file format. people seem perfectly capable
dealing with these others.

well , yeah , but unlike tiff they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps. and the others are hardly trouble free. i hear that
it is quite common for cgm implementations not to interoperate.

the annoying thing about tiff is that is that along with the 50 useful
options , there are 100 stupid options. the most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all tiff files , byte and bit order are options and all tiff readers on
all machines , no matter what their natural byte order , have to be prepared
to do byte swapping. there are four slightly different fax formats
again , any one of them would have been adequate. rgb images can be stored
by pixel or by component , complexity without function , etc , etc. i also
note that the tiff doc says that aldus' experiments show that lzw reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the fax formats , suggesting that
none of the fax formats are really useful.

what 's worse , a lot of the formats are n't even implemented very well ,
e.g. , lzw limits code words to 12 bits , while 14 or 16 bits would have
provided substantially better compression. and the lzw method compresses
bytes rather than pixels.

but the absolute worst thing about tiff is that any vendor can register
proprietary tiff codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.
this means that there is no way to write a tiff reader that can reliably
read all incoming tiff files. some standard.

keywords 3 d widget , manipulation , feedback , user interface design system

i am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
3 d interactive applications what types of 3 d widgets you would
like to have in your applications.

a 3 d widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3 d objects of the
application. it may let you

manipulate application data , the camera ,
3 d objects in the scene and so on , or
view the status of the application or 3 d objects
via the widget 's shape , color , position , orientation and so on , or
do whatever i missed but you think is possible.

for example , a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
partially transparent sphere) super imposed on the object to be rotated.
a feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects. the length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance. a widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback. for example , the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis.


please e mail me or post your opinions on 3 d interaction. the information
i gathered will help me design a 3 d ui construction tool.

progress in neural networks
special volume on shape analysis


omid m. omidvar minsoo suk
series editor volume editor



significant progress has been made recently in shape analysis using
neural networks and the energy minimization concept. ablex publishing
corporation is planning a special volume on shape analysis , scheduled
for this year.

this volume will be a part of progress in neural networks , an annual
book series reviewing research in modelling , analysis , design and
application of neural networks. the primary aim of this volume is to
present , in a single volume , the most important achievements made on
this important topic , which are otherwise scattered in diverse literature.

authors are invited to submit original manuscripts detailing recent
progress. suggested topics include , but are not limited to shape modelling ,
shape estimation , shape recovery , shape representation , shape matching ,
surface reconstruction and surface decomposition. research work utilizing
neural networks directly or based on energy minimization techniques such as
markov random field , mean field annealing , simulated annealing , graduated
non convexity algorithms and resistive networks are most welcome.

the paper should be tutorial in nature , self contained and preferably ,
but not necessarily , about fifty double spaced pages in length. please send
electronically (if you prefer , you can send a hardcopy to the address below)
an abstract and an outline to
msuk@ima.enst.fr

i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave self intersecting polygons.
this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave multi outline
algorithm , but not tremendously faster. i spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors , and the convex turned out about 10 faster. this is
all c (on hp pa risc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as
fast as possible , as far as i could tell). for any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time , and can be made all convex. definitely the
way to go.


ok , thanks for help everyone ! i still have n't found quite what i'm looking for ,

i was wondering if anyone knows of a graphics package for the pc that
will do compositing of a series of pictures \?

what i mean by compositing is , say i have a live video clip
(digitized) panning around a living room , and a computer generated
bird flying around the screen. i want to combine these two series of
pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black , i want
the living room picture to show through. yes , i realize i can do this
with a genlock , and i do own a genlock , but i want to be able to do
manual compositing also. it 's ok if i have to composite one frame at
a time i assumed i 'd have to do that anyway. but being able to
composite a series of frames would be even better.

i 've looked around and i have n't found a pc package that will perform
this. help , please !

if you can get the live animation and the computer generated animation
into autodesk animator .fli or .flc format , autodesk animator will do
this for you. it can take one animation , make a certain color
clear , and overlay it over another animation. i do not have a way
right now to convert .avi or .mpg files to animator files. animator
will also import a series of .gif files to create an animation , so if
your video capture stuff can create this is might work.

x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl8


in an attempt to do animation with pov i have created two little
programs. one is a c program that will perform a morph between
any two points given the amount of frames for the morph. and then
it will write the points , and the function (translate , rotate , etc.) out
to a file. then i have a perl script that will read the list of functions
and insert them into a .pov file at a given line. i had hoped this would
let me do simple animation. however , i have discovered that simply
performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary
object but will actually rotate the object about the axis. now i know
an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the
origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there
must be another way around this. i had thought perhaps it was because
i had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new
point and then done the rotation , which could cause this behavior. however
this occurs on objects that are not translated at all. any help is
appreciated.

and no , siggraph 93 has not skipped town we 're preparing the best
siggraph conference yet !

speaking of siggraph , i just went through the ordeal of my annual registration
for siggraph and re upping of membership in the acm last night , and was i ever
grossed out ! the new prices for membership are almost highway robbery !

for example

siggraph basic fee went from 26 last year to 59 this year for the same
thing , a 127 increase. those facile enough to arrange a trip to the
annual conference could reduce this to 27 by selecting siggraph lite ,
which means siggraph is charging an additional 32 (or so) for the
proceedings and the art show catalog , essentially.

toplas went up 40 in cost , way outstripping the current inflation rate.

basic sigchi fees remainded the same , but whereas before sigchi
membership included uist and human factors conferences proceedings ,
these are now an extra cost option. bundling that back into the basic
rate , equivalent services have gone up 100 in cost.

sigois membership cost has up 33 , but they 've also split out the
computer supported cooperative work conference proceedings that used to
be included with membership. adding that cost back in means this sig
also has doubled its membership fee.

what really galls me is that the acm sent out brochures a couple months ago
touting their new approach to providing member services , and tried to make it
sound like they were offering new services. but with the exception of a couple ,
like siggraph , all the plus services appear to be just splitting the costs
into smaller piles so that they do n't look so big. but their recommended
changes to my membership would have me paying 90 more than last year for a 31
increase in services (measured by cost , not by value) , and , curiously , a 31
inflation rate on the publications i got last year.

is anyone out there as galled by this extortion as i am \?

recent discussion about xv 's problems were held in some newsgroup.
here is some text users of xv might find interesting.

(i have also minor ideas for 24bit xv , e mail me for them.)

deleted for space basically complaints that xv is an 8 bit program and that
making several modifications to the rgb sliders is slow because of screen updates.

in reverse order

1) try clicking in the auto apply box to switch it off. then make your mods. then
click on apply. there is no problem as stated it has already been solved if you
look carefully.

2) yes xv is an 8 bit program. this is not a bug. you can edit individual pallette
entries or do global colour changes crop , scale etc. clearly the program must
save out the altered image else all your work would be thrown away. so yes it
saves out 8 bit images of course !

xv can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. this is a handy
facility , not a bug.

how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file \? how would you group
'related' colours to edit them together \? only global changes could be done
unless the software were very different and much more complicated.

if you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image , you need much more powerfull
software which is readily available commercially.

and lastly , jpeg is a compression algorithm. it can be applied to any image of
arbitrary bit depth. again , this is not a bug. it is a way of saving disk space

how can one dump to the printer , the content of a vga screen. if it were
a text screen , we can execute a shift printscr. but with graphics , we have
to do a pixed by pixel print. it would be greatly appreciated if someone can
supply source code for this. alternately , are there commercial or shareware
programs that are available to do this. i must be able to shell out of my
program to execute this print screen. therefore , it would be prefferable to have source code.

can i view jpeg files without special hardware \?

lucy wilson , access services librarian
college of engineering , university of cincinnati

yup.

most jpeg viewers seem to require specific video drivers since they support
only specific video cards. some have the standard ibm bios video support for
the vga 320x200 256 colour mode , but they leave out the other cards such as
the hercules monochrome card (which by the way can give very good picture
quality if your dithering works right).

i ca n't remember the name of a jpeg viewer since i usually convert jpeg 's to
gif 's before viewing them. but some require vesa driver for the video cards.
you do n't need any special hardware to view jpeg 's except perhaps for a vga
card and maybe a 286 processor. most people these days program for 286
computers and neglect the rest of the 86 processors (8086 , 8088). i have a
8088 clone (a nec v20 processor) and a hercules card , i have had to write
some programs so that they will view gif 's and animations for the vga and other
colour graphics boards on my monochrome hercules card. i use floyd steinberg
dithers and have found that if one does something neat with the colour palette
the resulting dithered image gives much greater detail than it normally would
when viewed on other monochrome systems. compushow 8.50 has fs dithering but
it does the standard thing with the image palette before dithering , my way
gives a brighter more detailed image.

anyway , enough of my rambling in the wrong direction. the final point is , as
far as i know , you do n't need extra hardware to view jpeg 's other than the
vga (and perhaps a 286 or better)

have a day !

gerry.

320x200x4 and 640x200x2 are easy enough , but i'm not so sure about the

think. if i'm wrong , let me know. also , 320x200x256 is just one byte pixel
that 's easy enough , but are there any other ways to write to the screen ,
perhaps bytes at a time , or something like that \?

of course , i 'd appreciate any information about any mode.... which reminds
me of another question do the supervga modes work the same , generally ,
as the normal 16 and 256 color modes , or is not only the mode numbers
for various cards different , but the methods for writing to the screen
different as well \?

i recently got a document describing the jpeg fif (jfif) file
format. i was looking thru it , but i did n't get the idea how
to determine the size of a pic in pixel without decoding the
whole image.

how do you get the height and width of a jpeg in a jfif \?

how do you determine wether it is a color or a greyscale
picture \?

i wrote a small tool (lsgif) for gif that returns the
filesize , picture size and color resolution by analizing
the header chunks. the output looks like this

157605 bla.gif 640x 480 248c24

i use this lsgif to create index files of my archive and since
jpeg are getting more and more popular i would like to have a
similar tool for jfif , with an output like this

57605 bla.jpg 640x 480 c24

please respond by email , because i do n't read this news

i wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
this makes sense , because the main use of xv is only viewing images.

doing many changes to image , we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to 24bit image ,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.

think about what you are saying here. the 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. this
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. you then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file , so you have to find which
colours mapped to this one palette colour.

i suppose you do n't know what about we have discussed.
we discussed about error(s) in xv 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit ,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

look be consistent. first you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error.
so i post and asy it is not a bug , it is meant to be like that.
so you post and say it is not a bug , you never said it was , i have misunderstood
etc.
now you are saying

we discussed about error(s) in xv 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit ,

if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a lot easier.



so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is , there
must be a colormap anyway. the problems you present are exist anyway ,
and i did n't tried to solve them at all , because i would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

eh \? sorry , i do n't understand what you are saying here. i am aware that english is
not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning , but this
paragraph defeats me.

gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as i presented. there 's no need make tricks from 8bit quantized image
back to 24 bit image.

yes as i originally said , global changes are easily possible.

but this statement contradicts what you said earlier

i wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.



how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file \? how
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together \? only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated.

ok , you 're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors your questions , by the way ,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

no i do n't think so actually.

you were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising) ,
manipulating the colours in the colour editor , then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. xv lets you edit individual
colours. where is this sudden jumping off the topic \?

my solution does n't work , because there 's no colormap withing real 24bit
image

yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file ! !

you see , user see 24bit image going back to 8bit is silly.

i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

about changing individual colors in 8bit quantized rasterized image
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.

\? \? \?
what are you saying
\? \? \?

xv allows this feature , but i do n't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

ah ! now we see thew problem ! first you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. then i point out problems with this. now you are
saying there is no problem because you , personally , happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem ! !


moreover , xv is not a paint program you can only make those global
changes.

not sure what you are saying here. certainly one can make local changes.

in full 24bit xv , changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
if person have 8bit screen , there 's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. because user do n't see full 24bit
image , there 's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). to select indiavidual color , there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area
selecting individual color is possible from that.

yes that is one possible approach. i would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy , however.

ok , i do n't have thought very much 24bit painting programs , never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...

well here we agree you have not thought it through very much. you do n't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. ok , we all have off days perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.

yes again. what is (was \? ) wrong with xv \?

it saved 8bit quantized rasterized images as 24bit jpegs jpeg is not
designed for that.

as i said in the last post , jpeg is a compression algorithm. it is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. i fail to see what
the problem is. you have not proposed any workable alternatives.

also , human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image

speak for yourself. you are the only person i have met or spoken to who ,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits , expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

perhaps that is why you yused the singular \?

say ,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it , then it is
expected that the image still is the same.

look , next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. you are the only person who claims this is confusing.

so , xv were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work design error.

is a design error the same as a bug \? )

read my lips. xv is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. it lets
you import other images. it shows , i would say , a good deal of thought about the
human interface. and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for. it makes no false claims.

i have heard xv were designed first for 8bit images files , but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

if you would come up with a solid , logical , well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work , feel free to post them. so
far , you have not done so.

so , even all screen images are 8bit , the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily , instead of 8bit.

argh ! ! after all this , a comment like that. `very easily'. ok , go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

or alternatively , look up the terms `import' and 'non reversible transformation'.

before anybody will make a note yes , i may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up , and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however ,
even the manuals tells the correct situation , it does n't solve the problem.
(americans the lift is just an example )

i think this is a bit of an exageration.

what you are actually saying is , you got into a lift (elevator , if you are in
the states ) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. everyone else
had no problem. now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...

well , my text may be a bit hard reading ,

you bet

hopefully you suggeeded to
read it.

mostly. leaving aside the language issue however , it betrays some very wooly
thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. go think
some more.

yes i am aware coreldraw exports in scodal.
version 2 did it quite well , apart from a
few hassles with radial fills. version 3 revb
is better but if you try to export in scodal
with a bitmap image included in the drawing
it will say something like cannot export
scodal with bitmap at least it does on my
version.

oh. ok then , sorry for misunderstanding.

if anyone out there knows a way around this
i am all ears.
temporal images make a product called filmpak
which converts autocad plots to scodal , postscript
to scodal and now gif to scodal but it costs 650
and i was just wondering if there was anything out
there that just did the bitmap to scodal part a tad
cheaper.

maybee you should persuade your burea that for only 650 they can become much
more competitive , taking input from autocad , postscript andgif as well as
scodl...

seriously , this sounds like something the bureau should have. or find another
bureau. you should not be the one buting this software.

as the distribution comes as .tar.z you should either have uncompress

recently we have found tiff manipulation packages which do not recognize
tiff files output by xv. this is due to a missing xresolution and yresolution
tag which apparently is required (or at least believed to be required) for
valid tiff. i have checked both xv 2.x and xv 3.x and neither of these
do indeed copy these tags.

has anyone out there hacked in the fixes for xv to support these tags \?
i have been told that i could find some code in tiff tools tiffcp.c , but
that directory is one of many of the tiff group not distributed with xv. i
hope to obtain the original tiff src and look at it , but would prefer
to find code already known to work in xv.

read issue 2 of wired magazine. it has a long article on the hype of
3do. i 've noticed that every article talks with the designers and how
great it is , but never show any pictures of the output (or at least
pictures that one can understand)

gamepro magazine published pictures a few months ago and computer chronicles
(a program that is syndicated to public tv stations around the nation) spent
several minutes on it when it was shown at ces. it was very impressive what
it can do in real time.

john munsch

the april 1993 edition of mix magazine carries a story on 3do which
includes pictures of the unit , a schematic of what 's inside and some
indication from the people at 3do as to where they intend to go and in
what stages. (mix is a trade rag aimed at the professional sound
engineering community.)

the schematic shows a central dma engine connecting and mediating between
two graphics animation processors (32 bit bus) , a 32 bit risc processor
with math co processor , video decomp module , a control port , an expansion
port (where 3do hangs its double fast cd player) , 1mb dram , an optional
video port (for editing video) and on the outbound side 1mb vram to video
processor to tv chain parallel with a dsp to sound chain.

they promise red book cd quality audio , full 30 fps video and a future
connection path to your pc via a pc expansion card.

i am not informed enough to have an opinion about the various means and
methods discussed here. the article , written by philip de lancie , does
cover the other machines mentioned in this thread. i come from the pc
tcp ip world and see a tremendous potential for bringing connectedness to
the educated consumer 3do seems to have the right business partners to
make this happen.

hope this helps.

wow ! a new proof for an np complete problem , you guys in eurpoe
really got your stuff together !


base step deleted too bad

inductive step

but anyway , poor golfers , bad carpenters or bad surgeons are not
thieves , so your assertion that hacker thief is unsupported by
your argument , imho. the narrower view that a hacker , when
associated with the computing environment , is a dishonest
expert is not so widespread ...

inductive hypothesis
therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker , and somebody
perceives you as a thief , then this person belongs to a very very
small group that has some computer knowledge , but not enough to know
the wider (and original) meaning of the word. of course , one can
always know this and disregard it nonetheless , then
equate hacker to thief , giving substance to mr. humpty 's assertion ,
even though in a kind of reverse way.

fodder step
finally , a true hacker does not name himself herself one , for this is
a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.
to me , a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
says nahh , i just know a thing or two , people always exagerate... )

why would i want to buy one book vs the other book \? i have an 80386

pexlib and phigs (as it comes from mit with pex and as is explained in the
phigs programming manual) are just different api 's for the pex protocol ,
which is an extension to the x protocol.

so it depends on you , what you go to use.

advantage of phigs is the protability to other platforms (ibm graphigs ,
sunphigs) and the standardized structuring of the 3d objects.

advantage of pexlib is the sometimes faster and easier programming for
immediate mode graphics , because pex is not an exactly mapping of phigs
to a prortocol.

open telematic group

otg




i have proposed the forming of a consortium task force for the promotion
of naplps jpeg , fif to openly discuss ways , method ,
procedures , algorythms ,
applications , implementation , extensions of naplps jpeg standards.
these standards should facilitate the creation of real time online
applications that make use of voice , video , telecommuting , hires
graphics ,
conferencing , distant learning , online order entry , fax , in addition
these dicussion would assist all to better understand how sgml , cals ,
oda , mime , oodbms , jpeg , mpeg , fractals , sql , cdrom , cdromxa , kodak photocd , tcl ,
v.fast , eia tia562 , can best be incorporated and implemented to
develop telematic multimedia applications....

we want to be able to support dos , unix , mac , windows , nt , os 2
platforms.
it is our hope that individuals , developers , corporations , universities ,
r d labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.

this would be a not for profit group with bylaws and charter. already
many
corporation have decided to support otg (open telematic group) so do not
delay joining if you are a developer

an rfd has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a faq will soon be
be compose to start promulgating what is known on the subject.
if you would like to be added to the mailist send email or mail to
the address below.

this group would publish an electronic quarterly naplps jpeg newsletter
as well as a hardcopy version.
we urge all who wants to see cmcs hires based applications
the naplps jpeg g r o w , decide to join and mutually benefit from
this not for profit endeavor.

note telematic has been defined by mr. james martin as the marriage
of voice , video , hi res graphics , fax , ivr , music over telephone

i put it to you thus where has the hacker ethic gone \? if it still exists ,
where \? and , if it does exist , why are those who call themselves hackers
allowing this to perpetuate itself \? why are they not creating new , innovative ,
interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the
computer industry \?

since this was posted on comp.ai , i assume there is an ai angle to this. hacking is
what ai students do when they 're really supposed to be doing something else , e.g.
thesis research write up , getting their supervisors' pet programs to run properly ,
etc. no one gets much glory for hacking , and no one gets any money out of it.
producing good free software requires an enormous investment of time resources that
not many people can , or want to , afford particularly during a recession.

in addition , over the last 10 years , i think there has been a de emphasis on producing
running programs in ai research , and a greater emphasis on more formal approaches to
problem solving. students have been proving theorems instead of writing programs.
at a conference a year or two ago , johann de kleer suggested that everyone should
'get back to the keyboard' and write more programs that demonstrate their ideas
and i have to say i'm inclined to agree.

(i do n't claim to be a superhacker , but i do n't think that invalidates my remarks.
and i'm sure this is n't the whole story.)

what a computer hacker is and does will change as long as the definition

or perhaps you write a freely available , gpled unix for commonly

you found a legue for programming freedom to fight restrictive litigation

so vital to continuing progress in our field. or maybe you start up
a gnu project , and produce by far and away the best c c compiler
for unix there is , not to mention other valuable utilities.

some hackers make significant contributions without selling out their
ideals. as for bill gates , after pawning of grossly inferior software
onto the pc market for ten years , if he ever was a hacker , he deserves
to have his name eradicated from the annals of computer hackery.

as for me , i like running linux x countless other packages , without
paying a dime. on the other hand , i have no problem purchasing motif

organization computer science department , university of cape town

i have a question about recursive , backward raytracing.

when an incident ray (i) strikes an object at point p , first
the normal (n) is calculated. light rays are calculated (l1 to ln
where n is the number of light sources) these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything. the reflected ray (r) and
the transmitted ray (t) is calculated from the formulae.

calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours
along the rays (r and t) as rcol and tcol. each object has its own
colour ocol and each light source has licol (1 i n).

the question is
how do you combine rcol , tcol , ocol and all the licol 's to get
the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray \?

all colours are defined as strucures (records) having r , g , b components
between 0 and 1.

if anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints \?

i 'd like to know if there is any system (cpu hd array framebuffer)

hdtv has about 6mb frame , so recording playing moving picture will need
about 180mb sec bandwidth. i'm thinking to treat the raw data.. not
compressed.

actually , for digital hdtv systems that 's far higher bandwidth than
you need , unless there 's some reason you must work in fully uncompressed
hdtv. also , my calculations is that each frame should be well under 6mb ,
even using 24 bits pixel (which is more bits than you actually need 15 or
18 should be enough for a moving picture). 1600x1100x16bits is 3.5mb (i'm
guessing at hdtv resolution it may be a bit wider than 1600 , i'm fairly
sure of the 1100 number for most of the digital proposals).

i hope you have a very fast memory system as well 180mb s while
displaying will require a heavily interleaved vram system.

unless you have a very compelling reason , i 'd advise trying to use
at least somewhat compressed data. you do n't have to go to full compression
to get to a level where the data io requirements are much cheaper and easier
to deal with.

i have an ibm compatible notebook computer with an lcd vga screen. while i
was working with it this morning , the screen started to flicker a little ,
which i thought was odd since i do use a surge protector for my computer and
all peripherals. it only did this for a second and then stopped.

i left the room for several minutes and , when i returned , the screen was
completely dim , not blank , but very very dim. the contrast slider still
worked so that i could adjust it to where i could faintly make out what
was on the screen but the brightness slider had absolutely no effect.

i was plugged in at the time (i.e. , not using the battery) but i still
tried switching the battery , changing the power saver features , etc. , etc. ,
all to no avail.

has anyone else experienced anything like this \? if this just means that i
need to replace the screen then i guess i 'll have to but i thought that the
death of my lcd screen would be a little less dramatic when it eventually
happened. i did n't want to take it in to be repaired before i asked on the
net about this because i already know what they 'll say yep , you gotta have
this replaced and it 's gonna cost you \? \? \? .

i 've only had the computer for about 21 months. is that a reasonable life
cycle for a lcd display \? oh , i guess i ought to give specifics here the
brand is compudyne (is this a reputable company \? ) , it 's a 386sx @ 20 mhz.
i forget the model number exactly and i was too ticked off to write it down
before coming in to work today.

opposed to having it replaced , but i 'd rather not if it 's not absolutely
necessary. if you would n't mind , please e mail me at mike@mik.uky.edu

intro to access.bus (re the access.bus software creator 's
contest announcement)

what is access.bus \?

access.bus is a new open industry standard for computer
peripheral connectivity. access.bus is a serial protocol that
uses simple , low cost i2c technology to link multiple devices to
a single pc port. peripheral devices such as keyboards or
keypads , locators (mice , trackballs , joysticks) , printers , vr
gloves , digitizers , sensors , actuators or data transmitters and
others can be easily daisy chained to the host pc. applications
such as cad cam , data acquisition , simulation , virtual reality ,
multiple player single pc games , education and many , many more
can now take advantage of access.bus , the technology that puts
plug and play on every pc.

the access.bus offers advantages to end users and developers of
systems and peripherals. multiple devices connect to the host
computer with only one port. common communication methods for a
number of device types lead to simplified hardware and software
development. as an open standard , access.bus enables cross
platform use of the same device.

access.bus technological description


access.bus technology is an open specification , enabling anyone
to implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without
fee or royalty.
access.bus has a bus topology architecture. that is , a single
host can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices. access.bus
data rate is 100 kbits sec.

access.bus physical layer

access.bus is a serial bus architecture , based on i2c hardware
protocol , with one data line and one clock line.
standard low cost i2c microcontrollers handle bit level
handshaking , including automatic arbitration and clock
synchronization.

access.bus software protocols

the access.bus communication protocol is composed of three
levels i2c protocol , base protocol , and application protocol.

i2c protocol this simple and efficient protocol defines
arbitration among contending masters without losing data. i2c
provides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with
different clock rates. bus transactions include addressing ,
framing of bits into bytes , and byte acknowledgment by the
receiver.

base protocol establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between
a host computer and multiple peripherals. the host becomes the
access.bus manager. the base protocol defines the format of an
access.bus message envelope , which is an i2c bus transaction with
additional semantics , including checksum.
unique features of the base protocol are auto addressing and hot
plugging. auto addressing assigns devices with unique bus
addresses , without the need for setting jumpers or switches. hot
plugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the
system is running , without rebooting.

application protocol this is the highest level of the access.bus
protocol which defines message semantics specific to particular
types of devices. each type requires a different application
protocol. three broad device types have been identified
keyboards , locators , and text devices.

access.bus support on the pc

all three levels of the access.bus protocol are supported on the
pc. an add on card implements the physical layer and uses the
base protocol to communicate with physical access.bus devices.
an access.bus manager tsr under dos and a dll under windows 3.1
controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with
the access.bus device drivers. drivers are available for
multiple access.bus keyboards , locators and printers for dos and
windows 3.1. also available are c language source code examples
of the interface from applications to the device drivers.

lines 46
nntp posting host nwfocus.wa.com

hi all ,
i am looking into methods i can use to turn my linux based bbs into a full color
graphical bbs that supports pc , mac , linux , and amiga callers.
originally i was inspired by the naplps graphics standard (a summary of
which hit this group about 2 weeks ago).

i posted that document (forgot part 1 6 etc) but it was more than a summary ,
it was a complete technical description of the protocol. it can be ftped
from simtel or from wuarchive.wustl.edu in mirrors msdos naplps

following up on software availability of naplps supporting software i find
that most terminal programs are commercial the only resonable shareware one being
pp3 which runs soley on msdos machines leaving mac and amiga users to buy full
commercial software if they want to try out the bbs (i know i would n't)

next most interesting possibility is to port mgr to pc , mac , amiga. i

why not write a naplps decoder for your choice of platform and release the
code to the net \? then other willing souls can help port it to other platforms.
naplps was designed for this type of online interactive graphics much the
same as x , but while x is intended for high bandwidth network connections ,
naplps was optimized for low bandwidth modem connections.

is there a color version of mgr for linux \?

does anyone have any other suggestions for a linux based gui bbs \?

i'm sure you will receive other suggestions but look at it this way. if you
wanted to provide a full network connection to linux over a modem would you
use slip ppp or would you invent some new way \? most people would say that
slip ppp exist and are reasonably well designed protocols , so lets just
implement them. i see it the same way with naplps. it is an existing , well
thought out , extensible protocol for online graphics , so why not implement
it.

if you need any advice on implementation , just e mail me. i am currently
getting a beta version of my coreldraw to naplps converter working well
enough to release it by may 15. if you or someone else does not get going
on a freely available naplps decoder , then i intend to do it after i get
a my conversion program out of beta , and get a couple of other things done.

well for starters , why use rle files \? you might have a specific program that
needs them , ok , but i tend to convert straight to jpeg format , thus a 2.4meg
24bit targa file becomes a 80k or less 24bit jpeg.

the latest versions of xv (2.2.1 \? ) and xloadimage (3.03) both handle jpeg files.
and the best way to convert to jpeg is with the c djpeg suit. even at 90

hi i'm new to imaging , and my advisor and i would like to
do some 3d reconstructions.

we take slides (biological) , and image them on a 486. then
the software allows us to trace the outline of the objects
we want to save. the outlines are stored as a tiff file.

we would like to convert a group of these outlines into a
3d image. we are unsure as to where to begin. someone mentioned
that if we could convert the tiff into a vector format then
we could view them in autocad.

any help would be greatly appreciated.

subject quicktime performance (was re rumours about 3do \? \? \? )
organization university of waikato , hamilton , new zealand
lines 67

ok , with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime ,
the effects of scaling and so on , i thought i 'd do some more tests.

first of all , i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor).
i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results
(for better or for worse).

i pulled out a copy of 2001 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv
a while back. about fifteen minutes into the movie , there 's a sequence where
the earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically , i digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration , zooming in on the rotating space
station. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. to increase the differences between frames , i digitized it at only
5 frames per second , to give a total of 171 frames.

i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384 288 pixels with the spigot
card in my centris 650 (quarter size resolution from a pal source). i then
imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor ,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie one scaled
to 320 240 resolution , the other at 160 120 resolution. i used the default
2.00 quality setting in premiere 2.0.1 , and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

i then ran the 320 240 movie through the same raw speed test program i used
for the results i 'd been reporting earlier.

result a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

that 's right , i was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. just for fun , i copied the 320 240 movie to my external hard
disk (a quantum lp105s) , and ran it from there. this time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk
(also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors , and tried playing back the 160 120 movie scaled to 320 240
size. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly , the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in
action , not 1.5. i 'd try my tests with quicktime 1.0 , but i do n't think it 's
entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1...

unscaled , the playback rate for the 160 120 movie was over 100 fps.

the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320 240 movie with
preferred playback rates greater than 1.0 , and seeing how well they played
from within movieplayer (ie with quicktime 's normal synchronized playback).
a preferred rate of 9.0 ( 45 fps) did n't work too well the playback was
very jerky. compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with
ease. i ca n't believe that quicktime 's synchronization code would add this
much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system 's task
switching.

a preferred rate of 7.0 ( 35 fps) seemed to work fine i could n't see
any evidence of stutter. at 8.0 ( 40 fps) i think i could see slight
stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard to tell.

i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames , to make the stutter more noticeable. of course , this will also
improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance
even more...

xv can import 24 bit images and quantises them down to 8 bits. this is a handy
facility , not a bug.

never claimed it is a bug.


how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file \? how
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together \? only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated.
if you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image , you need much
more powerfull software which is readily available commercially.

i guess i edited my note on this away from the article i posted to
many newsgroups.

i wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
this makes sense , because the main use of xv is only viewing images.

doing many changes to image , we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to 24bit image ,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.


and lastly , jpeg is a compression algorithm. it can be applied to any
image of arbitrary bit depth. again , this is not a bug.

never claimed it is a bug.
i tried kept sure i do n't claim that jpeg is noting else than
a compression algorithm , because i know what the jpeg is.
(you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

you also missed what is (were) wrong with xv. however , i did wrote it.

no , mis folks have infinite budgets of death , and they also get parts

organization center for instructional and research computing activities

reply to lioness@ufcc.ufl.edu
nntp posting host maple.circa.ufl.edu


more people have been asking for information on the kubota graphics
workstations , so here is some more info on the kenai denali vs. the
e s freedom.


here is the text of a denali vs. e s freedom done by d.h. brown associates.



denali bears a strong resemblance to evans and sutherlands freedom graphics
subsystem in several aspects of its high level design. both products use
a parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations. both
have a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of
pixel processors. as a result , denali and freedome overlap significantly
in performance and functionality. both design teams also appear to have
similar philosophies with respect to modularity , scalability , and market
penetration.

there remain , however , several important differences between the kpc and
e s products. evans and sutherland designed freedom as a high end
developer 's dream system with plenty of performance potential and
flexibility. in its favor , freedom has configurations from two to
sixteen floating point units , a border range that starts and ends at
a higher price and performance levels than denali. all freedom
systems include a large , fixed number of pixel processors that
support a broader variety of color blending functions. the freedom
design treats its entire image memory as general purpose memory , allowing
developers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special purpose
applications. finally , e s provided freedom with very flexible otput and
video integration features for multimedia and simulation applications. note
that kpc is working an auxiliary board for ntsc and pal output that will not
require an external video encoder. e s programmable output features ,
however , will remain much more flexible.

the kpc design team , in contrast , made denali more of an end user 's system.
entry version have better performance range and flexibility than low end
freedom configurations , and come in at more realistic mainstream price
points. denali does not need as many 29050 modules as freedome because
it uses a deeper scan conversion pipeline to support each one , resulting
in better cost performance characteristics. although both products provide
strong support for 3d , imaging , and volume rendering , kpc recognized that
not all users will want an even mix of these capabilities. denali 's
configuration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase
geometric and pixel processing capabilities separately , and to upgrade
them separately as needed.

both companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at
workstation price levels as a way to attack sgi 's more expensive
vgxt and realityengine systems the only other products to provide
this capability. kpc supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation
of textures in hardware , but provides only software support for the higher
qualtiy tri linear interpolated mipmapping method. on balance , however , denali
provideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than e s for most applications.
aside from being much more affordable , kpc solutions deliver more parallelism
for texture processing and more off screen memory for general graphics
data storage. by implementing texture mapping on its transformation
modules , e s foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels
to obtain better texturing performance. kubota avoids this problem by linking
texturing to its frame buffer modules , providing a lower cost , more scalable
solution.

hope this helps ,

and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations. at the
moment it looks like i'm going to have to look at all possible cases
and examine each seperately e.g.

1) rectangle encloses parallelogram.

2) parallelogram encloses rectangle.

3) two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle





y y


. . origin


y y
x x




4) two corners of parallelogram outside rectangle

i hope someone can help.

many thanks in advance ,

i have posted disp140.zip to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.
i will upload this package to simtel20 later.

you may distribute this program freely for non commercial use
if no fee is gained.
there is no warranty. the author is not responsible for any
damage caused by this program.

important changes since version 1.35
added support for iris.
support mix concat. two images.
added support for 'batch conversion'.
added support for 'load save palette table'.
added support for 'edge enhance'.
added support for 'crop one line'.
added support for 'negate image'.
new color quantization option.
fix some minor bugs.

(1) introduction
this program can let you read , write and display images with different
formats. it also let you do some special effects(rotation , dithering ....)
on image. its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
formts.
include simple file management system.
support 'slide show'.
support 'batch conversion'.
there is no limit on image size.
currently this program supports 8 , 15 , 16 , 24 bits display.
if you want to use hicolor or truecolor , you must have vesa driver.
if you want to modify video driver , please read section (8).


(2) hardware requirement
pc 386 or better. msdos 3.3 or higher.
min amount of ram is 4m bytes(maybe less memory will also work).
(i recommend min 8m bytes for better performance).
hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

the following description is borrowed from djgpp.

supported wares

up to 128m of extended memory (expanded under vcpi)
up to 128m of disk space used for swapping
supervga 256 color mode up to 1024x768
80387
xms vdisk memory allocation strategies
vcpi programs , such as qemm , desqview , and 386max

unsupported

dpmi
microsoft windows

features 80387 emulator , 32 bit unix ish environment , flat memory
model , svga graphics.


(3) installation
video drivers , emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from djgpp.
(if you use western digital vga chips , read readme.wd)
(this go32.exe is a modified version for vesa and is completely compatible
with original version)
but some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
other djgpp programs in their system. if you encounter this problem ,
don't put go32.exe within search path.

please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

if you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver , add 'nc 256' to environment
go32.

for example , go32 driver x xxxxx xxxxx.grn nc 256

if you do n't have 80x87 , add 'emu x xxxxx emu387' to environment go32.

for example , go32 driver x xxxxx xxxxx.grd emu x xxxxx emu387

notes 1. i only test tr8900.grn , et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
other drivers are not tested.
2. i have modified et4000.grn to support 8 , 15 , 16 , 24 bits
display. you do n't need to use vesa driver.
if et4000.grn does n't work , please try vesa.grn.
3. for those who want to use hicolor or truecolor display ,
please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).
you can find vesa bios driver from
wuarchive.wustl.edu mirrors msdos graphics

(7) detail

initialization
set default display type to highest display type.
find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

1. when you run this program , you will enter 'read' menu. whthin this
menu you can press any function key. if you move or copy
files , you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
'read' menu , but only allow you to change directory.
the header line in 'read' menu includes (d xx , f xx , t xx) .
d display type. f number of files. t number of tagged files.
pressing space in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
for reading current file.
pressing return in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. this
program will automatically determine which format this file is.
the procedure is first , check magic number. if fail , check
standard extension. still fail , report error.
pressing s or s in 'read' menu will do 'slide show'.
if delay time is 0 , program will wait until you hit a key
(except escape).
if any error occurs , program will make a beep.
'w' or 'w' to pause , any key to continue.
escape to terminate.
pressing ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
pressing alt x in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.
pressing f5 will turn on 'effect' menu.

2. once image file is successfully read , you will enter 'screen' menu.
you can do special effect on image.
pressing return show image.
in graphic mode , press return , space or escape to return to text
mode.
pressing tab change processing target. this program allows you to do
special effects on 8 bit or 24 bit image.
pressing left , right arrow change display type. 8 , 15 , 16 , 24 bits.
pressing space save current image to file.
b w dither save as black white image(1 bit).
grey scale save as grey image(8 bits).
full color save as color image(8 bits).
true color save as 24 bit image.

this program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
to file. some questions are format dependent. finally this program
will prompt you a filename. if you want to save file under another
directory other than current directory , please press space. after
pressing space , you will enter 'write2' menu. you can change
directory to what you want. then ,

pressing space this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
pressing return this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
(filename under bar).


3. this program supports 8 , 15 , 16 , 24 bits display.

4. this program is memory greedy. if you do n't have enough memory ,
the performance is poor.

5. if you want to save 8 bits image
try gif then tiff(lzw) then targa then sun raster then bmp then ...

if you want to save 24 bits image (lossless)
try tiff(lzw) or targa or ilbm or sun raster
(no one is better for true 24bits image)

6. i recommend jpeg for storing 24 bits images , even 8 bits images.

7. not all subroutines are fully tested

8. this document is not well written. if you have any problem , suggestion ,
comment about this program ,
please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
i need your suggestion to improve this program.
(there is no anonymous ftp on this site)


(8) tech. information
program (user interface and some subroutines) written by jih shin ho.
some subroutines are borrowed from xv(2.21) and pbmplus(dec 91).
tiff(v3.2) and jpeg(v4) reading writing are through public domain
libraries.
compiled with djgpp.
you can get whole djgpp package from simtel20 or mirror sites.
for example , wuarchive.wustl.edu mirrors msdos djgpp


(9) for thoese who want to modify video driver
1. get grx source code from simtel20 or mirror sites.
2. for hicolor and truecolor
15 bits of colors is set to 32768.
16 bits of colors is set to 0xc010.
24 bits of colors is set to 0xc018.


acknowledgment
i would like to thank the authors of xv and pbmplus for their permission
to let me use their subroutines.
also i will thank the authors who write tiff and jpeg libraries.
thank dj. without djgpp i ca n't do any thing on pc.

commercial industry standards of file conversion , has n't attempted it yet

adobe streamline has been out four a couple of years. it does a much better
job than the autotracing functions which are built into illustration
programs. of course , a higher resolution bitmap will produce a more
accurate trace. the problem that i 've run into though , is that when it
creates a detailed trace , it produces way more points than are necessary.
if i trace something manually , i use many less es points. the problem
with this is it produces big files which slow everything down , especially
printing.

yes. there are many methods of rendering , raytracing is one of them.
you did n't say what you mean by rendering , so i wo n't guess. methods of
rendering include

o pencil and graph paper , doing the math by hand

o wireframe rendering of the 2d projection

o hidden line rendering

o scanline rendering using

a good reason (which is why many companies use it) for 48 bits pixel
is so you can use double buffering (for animating scenes) i.e. you have
2 24 bit planes. you write to the one in the background , and then flip !
the entire screen updates to the second image plane. the screen updates
in one refresh and you do n't see different objects appearing in the order
that they 're drawn (as in the cad macdraw effect). now your ready to update
the image that used to be in the foreground.

well , i am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
polygonal descriptions of a head , face , skull , vase , etc. the format
of the files is a list of vertices , normals , and triangles. there are
various resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number
of polygons , eg. phred.1.3k.vbl contains 1300 polygons.


in order to get the data via ftp do the following

1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
2) login as anonymous , guest as the password
3) cd pub dabro
4) binary
5) get cyber.tar.z

once you get the data onto your workstation

i have some color gifs which i would like to archive in a much smaller

by dithering. up to now i have used xv to process the images , but now i
would like to automate the procedure.

the problem is that xv ca n't (i think) convert images automatically , and the
obvious alternative pnmplus (ppmquant and pnmdither) do n't even get close to
xv 's quality. pnmdither apparently dithers in rgb , even though the images
are in grayscale. the dithering routine in xv seems to use the natural image

i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave self intersecting polygons.
this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave multi outline
algorithm , but not tremendously faster. i spent awhile implementing and
optimizing both flavors , and the convex turned out about 10 faster. this is
all c (on hp pa risc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as
fast as possible , as far as i could tell). for any sort of game the database
to render is known ahead of time , and can be made all convex. definitely the
way to go.

subject re need help z buffering lines areas together
originator mark@einkauf.austin.ibm.com
organization ibm austin
keywords z buffer , roundoff , lines , areas
lines 105


david gorgen writes

i'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in z buffering , that i 've encountered in 2 different
pex implementations. i ca n't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources i can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex faq , gaskins 's
pexlib programming manual , vendors' documentation).

....

the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching
artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas. the interpolated z values along a line will
differ slightly , due to roundoff error , from the interpolated z values
across an area , even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area. because of this , it 's a tossup whether the
z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.
visually , the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid.

using the pexlib api , my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different pex view mapping transforms , in two view table entries , one
for the areas and one for the lines. the pex structures or immediate
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas , and the other is always in effect for lines. the
result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines , so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.

this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards (i.e.
smaller vrc z coordinates) , compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas. this means that when a point is transformed
to npc , its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area , thus accomplishing the desired bias.

i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most , out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer ,
typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit z buffers).
therefore , it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching.

but in fact , experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003
to 0.006 of the range. (empirically , it 's worst when the npc z
component of the slope of the surface is high , i.e. when it appears more
or less edge on to the viewer.) it 's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the
z buffer have any dependable meaning ! this amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through
areas which they are supposed to lie behind.

i 've observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital
workstation pex servers , to approximately the same degree. the test
program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5.x implementation
this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex
5.1.

open questions
(1) why does this happen \?
am i configuring the pex view table wrongly \?
is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines
as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which
could be corrected for \?
are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their
interpolators \?
something else \?
(2) what to do about it \?
can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
in z buffered hlhsr \?
is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching
artifacts \?
am i just out of luck \?


we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations. i was also
shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by
about 16 bits (assuming 24 bit z buffer). this seems huge , but is only
1 256 of the dynamic range. in those terms it does n't seem so bad. what
is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear , due
mainly to roundoff , i believe. so the polygon is not planar in z , but is
more like a ruffles potato chip. ditto with lines. when you start end at
different x y values , the ridges are out of phase , resulting in the
stitch effect. you have the same problem if you try to draw 1 polygon
right on top of another , but with different vertices. you will likely see
a smeared effect where they overlap.
example
try polygon 1 (100 , 100 , 100) (100 , 200 , 100) (200 , 200 , 100) (200 , 100 , 100)
polygon 2 (125 , 125 , 100) (125 , 175 , 100) (175 , 175 , 100) (175 , 125 , 100)

your implementation is correct. in fact , we do a similar trick when
rendering primitives that have lines and polygons such as nurbs surfaces
with isoparametric lines. without the trick , the lines appear stitched , as
you say. when the application draws lines polygons independently , the
system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting , so the
application must do it. this is what you have discovered and are doing.
bravo !

(note to ibm'ers the information given here has been previously disclosed
through proper channels so i'm not giving away any new unpublished info.)

originator abrodnik@watdragon.uwaterloo.ca
organization jozef stefan institute , ljubljana , slovenia
lines 69

this is an invitation to send articles to the informatica magazine.
the first fully international issue has been published and echoes
are quite favourable. for any information , contact (matjaz.gams@ijs.si).

dear colleague , april 25 , 1993

number 1 of volume 17 of informatica is now out of print and some of you
will receive it in a week or so. as you will see , the journal is structured
in the following way the editorial (first page) profiles (second page
biography of an editor , in this issue , terry winograd) the edited
part of papers (pp. 3 80) mission and research reports (a plan for
knowledge archives project in japan and csli in stanford , pp. 81 100)
and news and announcements (pp. 101 108). this structure is mentioned to
give you a suggestion how could you help to make the contents of the
journal significant , diverse , and interesting , bringing your own views
into the discourse.
a great emphasis is given to the so called editorial page. this page
expresses an opinion (belief) of the writing editor to some problems
within the scope of computing and informatics , extending into other
concerning disciplines , e.g. cybernetics , advanced ai , cognitive sciences ,
mind , informationally concerned neural sciences , advanced technology
(e.g. photonics) , etc. i asked professor terry winograd to write this
page for number 2. i certainly would appreciate very much to get
suggestions or possible offers from other editors , who like to express
their strong (directed) beliefs concerning a future development of the
area in question.
on the second page of each number an editor 's profile is published.
the aim of the profile is twofold to show his her professional
achievements , interests , scientific , and philosophical orientation on
one side to narrate his her life story in the environments in which
editors has lived and live on the other side. this kind of story should
be instructive , adequately factically faced , contributing to the
understanding of circumstances in which editors have to act and live.
the edited part (edited papers) is still critical. i would like to have
a stock of accepted papers in advance , so the issuing dates of a particular
number can be fixed (e.g. january , april , july , and october). in situation
right now , i ask you to help me with contributions of yours or your
colleagues , collaborators , students , etc. some critical views to the
contemporary development of computing and informatics are appreciated.
a special emphasis should be given also to originality by which fresh
ideas are coming into the circulation of different professional communities.
reports of different occasions (symposia , conferences , meetings , etc.)
and particularly on new books , papers , and interesting events are welcome.
you can send these news immediately (also by your secretary) by e mail.
on the other hand , you can send books and other publications (annual
reports , journals , calls for papers , etc.) for reviewing and publishing
in informatica. we in the editorial staff will manage the rest.
e mail is functioning satisfactorily , so please use it in every respect.
you can submit editorial notes , profiles , reports , news and even complete
papers written in standard latex format (especially formulas). we received
several final (corrected) texts in number 1 from different sites (us ,
russia , etc.). in this way , you can compose reports from already typed
texts , using your own choice and editing , and submit them to the contact
person (matjaz.gams@ijs.si) , who is always being on your disposal. so ,
you will receive a prompt confirmation and any information concerning
our common interest and job.

at the end , please do not forget we need your cooperation and help in
every mentioned respect. the aim of informatica is to open various
possibilities of communication concerning strong scientific and
philosophical orientations as well as those coming up , still unrevealed ,
and on the way to become significant. please , do not apprehend to give
proposals , suggestions , and , certainly , contributions via the e mail
and by other means.

sincerely yours ,

of real time online applications that make use of voice , video ,

fractals , sql , cdrom , cdromxa , kodak photocd , tcl , v.fast , and
eia tia562 , can best be incorporated and implemented to develop
telematic multimedia applications.

we want to be able to support dos , unix , mac , windows , nt , os 2
platforms. it is our hope that individuals , developers , corporations ,
universities , r d labs would join in in supporting such an endeavor.

this would be a not for profit group with bylaws and charter. already
many corporations have decided to support otg (open telematic group) so
do not delay joining if you are a developer

an rfd has been posted to form a usenet newsgroup and a faq will soon
be be composed to start promulgating what is known on the subject. if
you would like to be added to the maillist send email or mail to the
address below.

this group would publish an electronic quarterly naplps jpeg
newsletter as well as a hardcopy version. we urge all who wants to
see cmcs hires based applications the naplps jpeg g r o w , decide to
join and mutually benefit from this not for profit endeavor.

cornell theory center summer school

offered through the cornell school of
continuing education and summer sessions

course description

within the past ten years , the simulation and modeling of
lines 197

molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into
a international industry. computer graphics has played a
decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to
build , visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects.

while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their
own discipline , they are often unfamiliar with the terminology ,
simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists.
similarly , chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms
and technological advances in graphical computing.

this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap
between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry
researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of
prepackaged graphics software. although this is not intended to
be a course in computational chemistry or drug design , data sets
from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students
will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own. lab exercises
and projects will be carried out using data flow programming
(ibm visualization data explorer software) and students will have
access to cornell theory center computing resources , including video
recording equipment.

audience researchers and students in the chemical and biological
sciences interested in integrating state of the art
computer graphics into their research computer scientists
wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of
scientific visualization.

the class size will be limited to 25 participants on a
first come first served basis.

level graduate advanced undergraduate , 1 or 2 credits. may be taken
without credit as a workshop. calculus , linear algebra
and introductory chemistry required. familiarity with unix ,
x windows and c is useful but not required.

date june 14 25 , 1993 (2 credits)

format

the course will be held in the theory center training facility
where computer workstations will be available. daily lectures will be
interspersed with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided
for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing
environment. students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis
of their laboratory exercises and short final project. those enrolled
for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures , be given
more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
and discuss problems encountered.

organization university of houston

distribution world
nntp posting host menudo.uh.edu


i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program ,
an interactive , full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl.
besides typical touchup tasks , such as crop , rotate , smooth , etc ,
bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs ,
such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.

the following is the relevant sections from the man page.


pre release of may , 1993 bit(1l)

name
bit bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations

description
bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on
silicon graphics gl. as a full color program , bit handles images of both
24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.

as an image viewer , bit allows list of images to be displayed in their
original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the
many built in styles of display. you can walk up and down the list using
mouse and keyboard , or you can let bit do the walk for you (the
slideshow). with the pan and zoom features , large images can be viewed
in full without being limited by the window or screen size.

as an image editor , bit performs a large number of image editing and
processing tasks accurately and efficiently. it keeps information loss
at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing
subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type
whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of
input images. you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into
another. in addition , arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple
geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with
the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take
advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. postscript).

bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing
image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence
turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be
accessed by a press of a button , and best of all , the processed image
will be read back and displayed immediately. convolution using exter
nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically
giving great flexibility in processing an image.

features

bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a
continuous progress report , and once the processing is complete ,
the processed image will be displayed.

current features include

o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing
and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color.

o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x and or y directions with
the option of subpixel sampling.

o renders text of arbitrary color , size or orientation on top of an
image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving
the text and raster separately , such as into a postscript file , to
take advantage of a higher printer resolution. besides normal text
strings , many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as
in tex(1) , e.g. , alpha small beta produces greek alphabet alpha
followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta.

o presents graphically the histogram of an image.

o performs arbitrary 1 to 1 pixel transformation. the transformation
function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary
forms. further , the transformation can be applied to rgb channels
separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of
it. many difficult tasks , such as thresholding , can be accomplished
rather easily by 1 to 1 transformation in combination with the avai
lability of graphical histograms of the image.

o places simple geometric figures (sgfs) , e.g. , arrows , circles , trian
gles etc. , of arbitrary color , size and orientation into an image at
arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some
user definable coordinate system units , with the option of rendering
directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g ,
postscript file). all sgfs can be scaled in x and y directions
independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a
circle).

o performs edge detection. in combination with image histograms and 1
to 1 transformation , very accurate result can be obtained.

o performs histogram equalization.

o performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of
arbitrary order.

o crops a rectangular portion of an image.

o cuts and pastes across images.

o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.

o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause
interval between images. (slideshow)

o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels
along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities
or as an intensity vs. distance plot.

o performs image type conversions.

o converts image formats.

o smoothes an image (special convolution).

o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image
back and display it.

o modify an individual pixel 's rgb values.

o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the
resulting power spectra.

o spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre release).

supported formats
o iris rgb , native to sgi iris
o jpeg(jfif) format
o compuserv gif
o pnm(portable any map) , including ppm , pgm and pbm.
o xbm (x window bitmap)
o tiff
o postscript(write only)

hardware requirements

any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode() , including indigoes.

where to get it

anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu pub bit bitxxx.tar.z
where xxx is the version number. current version is 0.73

read src 01readme for installation instructions after unpacking

acknowledgement

jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups 's library version 4.
forms library , developed by mark overmars , is used for gui.
both jpeg and forms library are included in this release.


bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate
images the built in editing features will satisfy most of
your editing needs. in addition , the external filter and dynamical
kernel will utilize any program you already have. so try it
(and you will like it).

as always , any comments bug reports are welcome.

subject need help z buffering lines areas together
organization applicon , inc. ann arbor , mi (usa)
keywords z buffer , roundoff , lines , areas
lines 84

i'm asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low
apparent precision in z buffering , that i 've encountered in 2 different
pex implementations. i ca n't find any discussion of this problem in any
resources i can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex faq , gaskins 's
pexlib programming manual , vendors' documentation).

i'm posting this article by itself on comp.graphics , and virtually the
same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on
comp.windows.x.pex. the problem is hard to describe without pictures ,
hence this article is longish. if you can run pexlib 5.x programs and
are interested , i encourage you to build and run the test program in
comp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach
to dealing with it. (it depends on the utility code from the above
gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given.)

the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching
artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are
coplanar with filled areas. the interpolated z values along a line will
differ slightly , due to roundoff error , from the interpolated z values
across an area , even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with
vertices of the area. because of this , it 's a tossup whether the
z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.
visually , the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the
line is supposed to be solid.

using the pexlib api , my approach to a solution is to use two slightly
different pex view mapping transforms , in two view table entries , one
for the areas and one for the lines. the pex structures or immediate
mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in
effect for areas , and the other is always in effect for lines. the
result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines , so as to
attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.

this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used
in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards (i.e.
smaller vrc z coordinates) , compared to their positions in the view
table entry used for areas. this means that when a point is transformed
to npc , its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than
if it comes from an area , thus accomplishing the desired bias.

i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount
to a few units at most , out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer ,
typically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit z buffers).
therefore , it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc
between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix
the stitching.

but in fact , experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003
to 0.006 of the range. (empirically , it 's worst when the npc z
component of the slope of the surface is high , i.e. when it appears more
or less edge on to the viewer.) it 's as if only 8 or 9 bits of the
z buffer have any dependable meaning ! this amount is so great that one
problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through
areas which they are supposed to lie behind.

i 've observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital
workstation pex servers , to approximately the same degree. the test
program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib 5.x implementation
this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex
5.1.

open questions
(1) why does this happen \?
am i configuring the pex view table wrongly \?
is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines
as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which
could be corrected for \?
are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their
interpolators \?
something else \?
(2) what to do about it \?
can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision
in z buffered hlhsr \?
is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching
artifacts \?
am i just out of luck \?

any help would be immensely appreciated !

anyone who thinks that tiff is too complex has n't dealt with
cgm , asn.1 , cda , dca , sgml , or any one of a number of other
very successful file format. people seem perfectly capable
dealing with these others. dealing with the format of tiff
is frankly less difficult than dealing with the dct , lzw , and
fax encoding of the image data. the majority of the libraries
which deal with tiff are dedicated to these other issues rather
than with simply decoding the tags and parameters.

perhaps people are overwhelmed in comparison with some rather
simpleminded formats such as gif , pcx , and bmp , but to suggest
that tiff is so complex as to be doomed to failure is ludicrous.

that does n't mean that gif is n't fine , but do n't even thing about
using it in many instances. gif is very nice for use in low end
photos applications and for screen grabs and such , but it would
never do for high volume or high resolution systems. fax is nice ,
but it does n't do color (and gif does n't do b w all that well).
jpeg is nice for high resolution color , but is slow for low end.

the advantage tiff brings to the table is its ability to handle
all these situations (and then some). naturally it 's more complex.
but i'ld rather propose tiff imaging solutions over imaging
systems based on having to deal with 3 4 file formats anyday.

you may find that tiff is too complicated for your personal tastes
but please do n't wrail against it 's complexity. the complexity
it contains is required to provide the functionality it does and
does n't come close to the complexity found in most commercially
viable file formats.


if we 're in philosophical arguments against complexity , let 's all
go program in scheme and forth and do imaging with run length
encoding.

we are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs ,
and terrain elevation maps (dtm).
each database consists of a 2d array of height values (any data format can
be used for each value) , and a corresponding 2d array of color values (can
be gray level , 256 color value or full 24 bit r g b values. other format can
also be used). we work on 512x512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.

could somebody please email me some info on either what gif or iff
file formats are , or where i can get such info \?

well , gif stands for graphics interchange format and was put forth by
compuserve back in 1987( \? ) or so. it was to create a format that could be
read and displayed by any system. gif is limited to 8 bit color but has
a built in compression scheme (lzw \? ).

iff is not really a graphics format , but rather a standard way to package
images , sounds , animations , text , or whatever into one file. iff was
created by electronic arts , i do believe (i could be wrong) , for the amiga.
it was quickly adopted as pretty much the standard file format for the amiga.
the most common image format for the iff package is an ilbm (interleaved
bitmap \? ) but many others exist. this format supports 24 bit color images.

information on both of these and many more are available via anonymous ftp at

i wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
this makes sense , because the main use of xv is only viewing images.

doing many changes to image , we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to 24bit image ,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.

think about what you are saying here. the 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. this
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. you then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file , so you have to find which
colours mapped to this one palette colour.

i suppose you do n't know what about we have discussed.
we discussed about error(s) in xv 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit ,
and my suggestion above works perfectly with it.

so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is , there
must be a colormap anyway. the problems you present are exist anyway ,
and i did n't tried to solve them at all , because i would not make such
problems to my programs in the first place.

gamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image
as i presented. there 's no need make tricks from 8bit quantized image
back to 24 bit image.


how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file \? how
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together \? only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated.

ok , you 're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit
and user want edit individual colors your questions , by the way ,
jumps off the discussion a bit.

my solution does n't work , because there 's no colormap withing real 24bit
image you see , user see 24bit image going back to 8bit is silly.


about changing individual colors in 8bit quantized rasterized image
changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most
cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may
make serious errors to anywhere in the image.
xv allows this feature , but i do n't recommend to use it with the
mentioned type images.

moreover , xv is not a paint program you can only make those global
changes. in full 24bit xv , changing individual colors sounds like
paint program job.
if person have 8bit screen , there 's need for tricks to get the
original 24bit image modified. because user do n't see full 24bit
image , there 's need to make approximations and it is not possible to
modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if
image is rasterized). to select indiavidual color , there could be 7x7
cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area
selecting individual color is possible from that.

ok , i do n't have thought very much 24bit painting programs , never seen
such in good view and are not planned to make such. not to mention
24bit painting program in 8bit screen...


yes again. what is (was \? ) wrong with xv \?

it saved 8bit quantized rasterized images as 24bit jpegs jpeg is not
designed for that.
also , human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image say ,
person would like to crop part of the image and save it , then it is
expected that the image still is the same. so , xv were designed
without thinking about human interface and how human expect the
program work design error.

i have heard xv were designed first for 8bit images files , but
it were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making
major change to the original design.

so , even all screen images are 8bit , the processed images and saved
images could have been 24bit very easily , instead of 8bit.

before anybody will make a note yes , i may as well make a lift where
'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes
up , and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however ,
even the manuals tells the correct situation , it does n't solve the problem.
(americans the lift is just an example )


well , my text may be a bit hard reading , hopefully you suggeeded to
read it.

this is getting pretty silly. first off , hacker is an obsolete term.
does n't matter what it used to mean , today it means thief.

it only means thief if you want it to mean that. to me , it means

lots of context wickedly omitted by myself )

anyway , if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who
know the word they 'll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a
bad carpenter. but there are very very few people who will think he is
a good and clever programmer. )

if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief do n't be
surprised when people think you are a thief. even if you do n't agree
with that definition of the word.

.... the narrower view that a hacker , when
associated with the computing environment , is a dishonest
expert is not so widespread , i'm my opinion , at least with the
people involved with the field. imho the wider meaning is not
obsolete at all , no matter how much the lay press would like it to
be ! ....

therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker , and somebody
perceives you as a thief , then this person belongs to a very very
small group that has some computer knowledge , but not enough to know
the wider (and original) meaning of the word. ....

unfortunately , the general public has a very narrow view of the deep , dark
recesses of the art of computing. what little they do see is from the view
given to them by the media. from what i have seen from the media , 'hacker'
is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person.

i , on the other hand , know what 'hacker' means from those who consider
themselves such. following is the definition from jargon file 2.9.10 .
(this is also known as the hackers dictionary .) the definitions are
arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage

hacker originally , someone who makes furniture with an axe n.
1. a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable
systems and how to stretch their capabilities , as opposed to most
users , who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. 2. one who
programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys
programming rather than just theorizing about programming. 3. a
person capable of appreciating hack value . 4. a person who is
good at programming quickly. 5. an expert at a particular program ,
or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in 'a unix
hacker'. (definitions 1 through 5 are correlated , and people who
fit them congregate.) 6. an expert or enthusiast of any kind. one
might be an astronomy hacker , for example. 7. one who enjoys the
intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing
limitations. 8. deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to
discover sensitive information by poking around. hence 'password
hacker' , 'network hacker'. see cracker .

the term 'hacker' also tends to connote membership in the global
community defined by the net (see network , the and
internet address ). it also implies that the person described
is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic (see
hacker ethic , the ).

it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe
oneself that way. hackers consider themselves something of an
elite (a meritocracy based on ability) , though one to which new
members are gladly welcome. there is thus a certain ego
satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker (but if
you claim to be one and are not , you 'll quickly be labeled
bogus ). see also wannabee .

hacker ethic , the n. 1. the belief that information sharing
is a powerful positive good , and that it is an ethical duty of
hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and
facilitating access to information and to computing resources
wherever possible. 2. the belief that system cracking for fun
and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits
no theft , vandalism , or breach of confidentiality.

both of these normative ethical principles are widely , but by no
means universally) accepted among hackers. most hackers subscribe
to the hacker ethic in sense 1 , and many act on it by writing and
giving away free software. a few go further and assert that
all information should be free and any proprietary
control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the gnu
project.

sense 2 is more controversial some people consider the act of
cracking itself to be unethical , like breaking and entering.
but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who
see themselves as `benign' crackers (see also samurai ). on
this view , it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy
to (a) break into a system , and then (b) explain to the sysop ,
preferably by email from a superuser account , exactly how it
was done and how the hole can be plugged acting as an
unpaid (an unsolicited) tiger team .

the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker
ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share
technical tricks , software , and (where possible) computing
resources with other hackers. huge cooperative networks such as
usenet , fidonet and internet (see internet address )
can function without central control because of this trait they
both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be
hackerdom 's most valuable intangible asset.

finally , a true hacker does not name himself herself one , for this is
a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large.
to me , a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who
says nahh , i just know a thing or two , people always exagerate... )

note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing
limself (meaning himself herself) one , but simply says that it is better
not to do so. there are many who do not know the meaning of 'hacker'. so ,
in order to defend the true meaning of the word , it is sometimes necessary
to borrow on the reputation of a known (respected) hacker around the
workplace. (this means that 'hacker' is defined in terms of some well known
and respected person.) sometimes , there may only be one such person.

no matter what mr. dumpty says , language does n't work that way.
actually it does , you just have to get adequate press coverage... )

language works anyway that we want it to work. the purpose of language is
to communicate. to oversimplify as long as communication is taking place ,
then language is working.

first annual phigs user group conference

the first annual phigs user group conference was held march 21 24
in orlando , florida. the conference was organized by the rensse
laer design research center in co operation with ieee and sig
graph. attendees came from five countries spanning three con
tinents. a good cross section of the phigs community was
represented at this conference with participants including phigs
users , workstation vendors , third party phigs implementors , stan
dards committee members , and researchers from industry and
academia. the opening speaker , dr. richard puk , challenged phigs
users to take charge of your phigs by participating in phigs
standardization activities and communicating their needs to phigs
implementors. the closing speaker , dr. andries van dam ,
described his vision of the future of graphics standards beyond
phigs .

technical paper sessions in the conference covered the following
topics phigs and x , application toolkits , application issues ,
texture mapping , nurbs , phigs extensions , and object oriented
libraries and frameworks. panel sessions on phigs and pex , phigs
non retained data , real world cad applications using phigs , and
portability issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed
a good forum for exchange of ideas , needs , and experiences. the
conference also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang
ing from mathematics for 3d graphics to object oriented tools
based on phigs.

next year 's conference is planned for march , 1994.

phigs everywhere

at the conference , phigs vendors described and demonstrated
phigs products that run on all types of computers , from pcs to
mainframes.

megatek corporation demonstrated their phigs extensions including
conditional traversal , composite logical input devices , texturing
and translucency.

template graphics software launched figaro pro , the photo
realistic option for phigs . figaro pro is designed to add
advanced rendering to the existing phigs api , with features like
ray tracing , materials , anti aliasing and texture mapping.
radiosity support is also planned.

figaro is an example of how tgs continues to add newly emerging
graphics features to their products. figaro supports immediate
mode extensions to phigs and also supports sun xgl , hp starbase
and sgi gl opengl. figaro for nt will be released this summer.

tgs also demonstrated the latest versions of figraph , a powerful
2 call charting system based on phigs , and figt , an object
oriented utility library for phigs pex developers.

g5g and gallium software demonstrated a new version of gphigs on
silicon graphics workstations. scheduled for summer , 1993 , ver
sion 3.0 of gphigs , the company 's phigs library for worksta
tions , will include an advanced phigs debugger that allows phigs
developers to display and browse phigs structures and other phigs
internal state. g5g also described their non duplicated data
store that stores pointers to application data in the gphigs css
for more efficient use of memory. in addition , g5g described
their application gse that allows application callback functions
during gphigs traversal. gphigs and phigure , g5g 's data visual
izer and application development toolkit , are currently available
on all major workstations that support gl , x windows , pex , or
starbase.

wise software presented a slide show of z phigs for ms windows
and arena , a phigs based modeller render. z phigs implements most

this is a heavily edited modified version of the gopher faq intended to
give people just starting with gopher enough information to get a
client and jump into gopher space a complete version can be obtained
as described below. once you have a gopher client point it at
merlot.welch.jhu.edu and welcome to gopher space !

common questions and answers about the internet gopher , a
client server protocol for making a world wide information service ,
with many implementations. posted to comp.infosystems.gopher ,
comp.answers , and news.answers every two weeks.

the most recent version of this faq can be gotten through gopher , or
via anonymous ftp

rtfm.mit.edu pub usenet news.answers gopher faq

those without ftp access should send e mail to mail server@rtfm.mit.edu
with send usenet news.answers finding sources in the body to find out
how to do ftp by e mail.


list of questions in the gopher faq

q0 what is gopher \?
q1 where can i get gopher software \?
q2 what do i need to access gopher \?
q3 where are there publicly available logins for gopher \?
q4 who develops gopher software \?

q0 what is gopher \?

a0 the internet gopher client server provides a distributed
information delivery system around which a world campus wide
information system (cwis) can readily be constructed. while
providing a delivery vehicle for local information , gopher
facilitates access to other gopher and information servers
throughout the world.


q1 where can i get gopher software \?

a1 via anonymous ftp to boombox.micro.umn.edu. look in the directory
pub gopher


q2 what do i need to access gopher \?

a2 you will need a gopher client program that runs on your local pc
or workstation

there are clients for the following systems. the directory
following the name is the location of the client on the anonymous
ftp site boombox.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.2) in the directory
pub gopher.

unix curses emacs pub gopher unix gopher1.12.tar.z
xwindows (athena) pub gopher unix xgopher1.2.tar.z
xwindows (motif) pub gopher unix moog
xwindows (xview) pub gopher unix xvgopher

nextstep pub gopher next
vm cms pub gopher rice cms or pub gopher viegopher
vms pub gopher vms
os 2 2.0 pub gopher os2
mvs xa pub gopher mvs

many other clients and servers have been developed by others , the
following is an attempt at a comprehensive list.

a microsoft windows winsock client the gopher book
sunsite.unc.edu pub micro pc stuff ms windows winsock goph tbk.zip

a macintosh application , macgopher .
ftp.cc.utah.edu pub gopher macintosh

another macintosh application , gopherapp .
ftp.bio.indiana.edu util gopher gopherapp

a port of the unix curses client for dos with pc tcp
oac.hsc.uth.tmc.edu public dos misc dosgopher.exe

a port of the unix curses client for pc nfs
bcm.tmc.edu nfs gopher.exe

a beta version of the pc gopher client for novell 's lan workplace
for dos
lennon.itn.med.umich.edu dos gopher

a vms decwindows client for use with wollongong or ucx
job.acs.ohio state.edu xgopher client.share


note these macintosh clients require mactcp.

most of the above clients can also be fetched via a gopher client
itself. put the following on a gopher server

type 1
host boombox.micro.umn.edu
port 70
path
name gopher software distribution.


or point your gopher client at boombox.micro.umn.edu , port 70 and
look in the gopher directory.


there are also a number of public telnet login sites available.
the university of minnesota operates one on the machine
consultant.micro.umn.edu (134.84.132.4) see q3 for more
information about this. it is recommended that you run the client
software instead of logging into the public telnet login sites. a
client uses the custom features of the local machine (mouse ,
scroll bars , etc.) a local client is also faster.


q3 where are there publicly available logins (ie places to telnet to
in order to get a taste of gopher) for gopher \?

a3 here is a short list , use the site closest to you to minimize
network lag.

telnet public logins

hostname ip login area

consultant.micro.umn.edu 134.84.132.4 gopher north america
gopher.uiuc.edu 128.174.33.160 gopher north america
panda.uiowa.edu 128.255.40.201 panda north america
gopher.sunet.se 192.36.125.2 gopher europe
info.anu.edu.au 150.203.84.20 info australia
gopher.chalmers.se 129.16.221.40 gopher sweden
tolten.puc.cl 146.155.1.16 gopher south america
ecnet.ec 157.100.45.2 gopher ecuador
gan.ncc.go.jp 160.190.10.1 gopher japan


it is recommended that you run the client software instead of
logging into the public login sites. a client uses the
custom features of the local machine (mouse , scroll bars , etc.)
and gives faster response. furthermore many of the basic features
of clients saving a file to your hard drive , printing a file
to a local printer , viewing images , retrieving files from ftp
sites etc.... are not available by the telnet logins.




q4 who develops gopher software \?

a4 gopher was originally developed in april 1991 by the university
of minnesota microcomputer , workstation , networks center to help
our campus find answers to their computer questions.

it has since grown into a full fledged world wide information
system used by a large number of sites in the world.

many people have contributed to the project , too numerous to
count.

the people behind the much of the gopher software can be reached
via e mail at gopher@boombox.micro.umn.edu , or via paper mail

or via fax at

1 (612) 625 6817


q5 what is the relationship between gopher and (wais , www , ftp) \?

a5 gopher is intimately intertwined with these two other systems.
as shipped the unix gopher server has the capability to

search local wais indices.
query remote wais servers and funnel the results to gopher
clients.
query remote ftp sites and funnel the results to gopher
clients.
be queried by www (world wide web) clients (either using
built in gopher querying or using native http querying.


q6 are papers or articles describing gopher available \?

a6 gopher has a whole chapter devoted to it in

the whole internet , ed kroll , o'reilly , 1992 (editors note
..great book , go out and buy a bunch ! )

q7 what is veronica \?

a7 veronica very easy rodent oriented net wide index to
computerized archives.

veronica offers a keyword search of most gopher server menu titles
in the entire gopher web. as archie is to ftp archives , veronica
is to gopherspace. a veronica search produces a menu of gopher
items , each of which is a direct pointer to a gopher data source.
because veronica is accessed through a gopher client , it is easy
to use , and gives access to all types of data supported by the
gopher protocol.

to try veronica , select it from the other gophers menu on
minnesota 's gopher server , or point your gopher at

name veronica (search menu items in most of gopherspace)
type 1
port 70
path 1 veronica

ok , with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime ,
the effects of scaling and so on , i thought i 'd do some more tests.

first of all , i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than
realistic. the movie i had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a
version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor).
i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results
(for better or for worse).

i pulled out a copy of 2001 a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv
a while back. about fifteen minutes into the movie , there 's a sequence where
the earth shuttle is approaching the space station. specifically , i digitized
a portion of about 30 seconds' duration , zooming in on the rotating space
station. i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between
frames. to increase the differences between frames , i digitized it at only
5 frames per second , to give a total of 171 frames.

i captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384 288 pixels with the spigot
card in my centris 650 (quarter size resolution from a pal source). i then
imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor ,
keeping the 5 fps frame rate. i created two versions of the movie one scaled
to 320 240 resolution , the other at 160 120 resolution. i used the default
2.00 quality setting in premiere 2.0.1 , and specified a key frame every ten
frames.

i then ran the 320 240 movie through the same raw speed test program i used
for the results i 'd been reporting earlier.

result a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.

that 's right , i was getting a much higher result than with that first short
test movie. just for fun , i copied the 320 240 movie to my external hard
disk (a quantum lp105s) , and ran it from there. this time the playback rate
was only about 35 frames per second. obviously the 230mb internal hard disk
(also a quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.

i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional
scaling factors , and tried playing back the 160 120 movie scaled to 320 240
size. this time the playback speed was over 60 fps. clearly , the poster who
observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime 1.0 in
action , not 1.5. i 'd try my tests with quicktime 1.0 , but i do n't think it 's
entirely compatible with my centris and system 7.1...

unscaled , the playback rate for the 160 120 movie was over 100 fps.

the other thing i tried was saving versions of the 320 240 movie with
preferred playback rates greater than 1.0 , and seeing how well they played
from within movieplayer (ie with quicktime 's normal synchronized playback).
a preferred rate of 9.0 ( 45 fps) did n't work too well the playback was
very jerky. compare this with the raw speed test , which achieved 45 fps with
ease. i ca n't believe that quicktime 's synchronization code would add this
much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system 's task
switching.

a preferred rate of 7.0 ( 35 fps) seemed to work fine i could n't see
any evidence of stutter. at 8.0 ( 40 fps) i think i could see slight
stutter , but with four key frames every second , it was hard to tell.

i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the
key frames , to make the stutter more noticeable. of course , this will also
improve the compression slightly , which should speed up the playback performance
even more...

i'm afraid i missed the start of this thread , but there are three factors that
can significantly affect quicktime 's playback speed that you may want to take
into account

(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a
movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for , this is usually 8 or 16
bit , but other depths are (of course) possible).

(2) type of scaling (qt is optimized for double size scaling , other scaling
factors hit peformance much harder).

(3) playback window position (movieplayer limits your window placement choices
to advantagous pixel boundaries by default , i'm not sure about premiere).

any combination of those can radically alter playback performance. image size
is , of course , another biggie. giving the movie player lots of ram can also
make a real difference.

forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in the thread...

the polygons are all convex.

i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex
polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw
concave self intersecting polygons.
this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that
simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line.
complex (figure 8 type polygons) can be a bit trickier.

the less than n sides specification especially if it is a very small
number like 3 or 4 allow othe optimisations to be made.

thus for a high speed game application i think you are looking for
code that exploits and is hence limited to drawing simple convex
polygons.

1 what is jpeg \?

jpeg (pronounced jay peg ) is a standardized image compression mechanism.
jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group , the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard. jpeg is designed for compressing either
full color or gray scale digital images of natural , real world scenes.
it does not work so well on non realistic images , such as cartoons or line
drawings.

jpeg does not handle black and white (1 bit per pixel) images , nor does it
handle motion picture compression. standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees , named jbig and mpeg
respectively.

jpeg is lossy , meaning that the image you get out of decompression is n't
quite identical to what you originally put in. the algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably
the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details
of light and dark. thus , jpeg is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans. if you plan to machine analyze your images , the
small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you , even if they are
invisible to the eye.

a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters. this means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality. you can make extremely small
files if you do n't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image
archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc. etc. conversely , if you
are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression.


2 why use jpeg \?

there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller , and to store
24 bit per pixel color data instead of 8 bit per pixel data.

making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images. being able to compress a
2 mbyte full color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time ! (if you are comparing gif and jpeg , the
size ratio is more like four to one. more details below.)

if your viewing software does n't support jpeg directly , you 'll have to
convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. even
with a jpeg capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image
than to view an image of a simpler format (gif , for instance). thus , using
jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

it 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file. i 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet
posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bits pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). if you have
only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you. within a couple of years , though , 8 bit gif will look as obsolete as
black and white macpaint format does today. furthermore , for reasons detailed
in section 7 , jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware. hence jpeg is considerably
more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard.


3 when should i use jpeg , and when should i stick with gif \?

jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images ,
gif is superior in image quality , file size , or both. one of the first
things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to.

as a rule of thumb , jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or
gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and
similar material. jpeg is superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display
hardware , and it is a lot superior if you do. (see section 7 for details.)

gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors ,
such as cartoons and line drawings. in particular , large areas of pixels
that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by gif. jpeg ca n't squeeze these files as much as gif does without
introducing visible defects. this sort of image is best kept in gif form.
(in particular , single color borders are quite cheap in gif files , but they
should be avoided in jpeg files.)

jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure white pixels , for example. sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. again , this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly
often in gif files borders , overlaid text , etc. the blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high.
if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text , do n't jpeg it.

computer drawn images (ray traced scenes , for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. the more complex and
subtly rendered the image , the more likely that jpeg will do well on it.
the same goes for semi realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

plain black and white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg.
you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale
images. it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images
of up to 256 levels , while jpeg is not.

if you have an existing library of gif images , you may wonder whether you
should convert them to jpeg. you will lose a little image quality if you do.
(section 7 , which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif , only
applies if both formats start from a full color original. if you start from
a gif , you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg
can only make things worse.) however , the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway. this is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself.
if you do convert a gif library to jpeg , see section 14 for hints. be
prepared to leave some images in gif format , since some gifs will not
convert well.


4 how well does jpeg compress images \?

pretty darn well. here are some sample file sizes for an image i have
handy , a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor. the first three
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg
software described in section 6b.

file size in bytes comments

ship.ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format (no compression 24 bits
or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.z 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress
compress does n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note.
other text oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant fs 256 ppmtogif
most of the savings is the result of losing color
info gif saves 8 bits pixel , not 24. (see sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg q 95 (highest useful quality setting)
this is indistinguishable from the 24 bit original ,
at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg q 75 (default setting)
you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
from the original , even with both on screen at once.
ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg q 50
this has slight defects if you know what to look
for , you could tell it 's been jpeged without seeing
the original. still as good image quality as many
recent postings in usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg q 25
jpeg 's characteristic blockiness becomes apparent
at this setting (djpeg blocksmooth helps some).
still , i 've seen plenty of usenet postings that were
of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg q 5 optimize ( optimize cuts table overhead)
blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
indexing purposes. note that this file is tiny
the compression ratio from the original is 173 1 !

in this case jpeg can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller
than a gif of comparable quality (the q 75 file is every bit as good as the
gif , better if you have a full color display). this seems to be a typical
ratio for real world scenes.


5 what are good quality settings for jpeg \?

most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting. there seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings. quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the
information , as some have claimed. the quality scale is purely arbitrary
it 's not a percentage of anything.

the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original. this setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb.

the default quality setting ( q 75) is very often the best choice. this
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image. try q 75 first if you see defects , then go up. except for
experimental purposes , never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as q 95 , but of hardly any better quality.

if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to
go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation. on the other hand , you
might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation.
the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg.
the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24 bit images , but q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info).

if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects , a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right. q 2 or so may be amusing as op art .

(note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg
software described in section 6b , and to many programs based on it. other
jpeg implementations , such as image alchemy , may use a completely different
quality scale. some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale , just
high medium low style choices.)


6 where can i get jpeg software \?

most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp.
if you do n't know how to use ftp , see the faq article how to find sources .
(if you do n't have direct access to ftp , read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.) that article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can
get it by sending e mail to mail server@rtfm.mit.edu with
send usenet news.answers finding sources in the body. the anonymous ftp
list faq may also be helpful it 's usenet news.answers ftp list faq in
the news.answers archive.

note this list changes constantly. if you have a copy more than a couple
months old , get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive.


6a if you are looking for canned software , viewers , etc

the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one
kind of system. if you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out
the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list. note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
internet but some commercial programs are listed too.

x windows

xv (shareware , 25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg , gif , and many other
image formats. it can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations. it 's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) ,
file contrib xv 3.00.tar.z. version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24 bit displays and many other improvements however , it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking. if you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export. note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display (you 'll get
only 8 bit color) , nor for converting 24 bit images to jpeg. but 2.21 works
fine for converting gif and other 8 bit images to jpeg. caution there is a
glitch in version 2.21 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox
when saving a jpeg file , or the file will be blurry.

another good choice for x windows is john cristy 's free imagemagick package ,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib imagemagick.tar.z.
this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. the
imagemagick viewer handles 24 bit displays correctly for colormapped
displays , it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the
basic free jpeg software.

both of the above are large , complex packages. if you just want a simple
image viewer , try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest
release , 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu ,
file contrib xloadimage 3.03.tar.z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage ,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage , at least with respect to jpeg files , because it has the ijg v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked over v1. the next
xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib xli.1.14.tar.z. both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24 bit displays.


ms dos

this covers plain dos for windows or os 2 programs , see the next headings.

one good choice is eric praetzel 's free dvpeg , which views jpeg and gif files.
the current version , 2.5 , is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50) , file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg25.zip. this is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386 486 machines. the user interface is
not flashy , but it 's functional.

another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei 's hiview. the
current version , 1.2 , is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note
below) , file msdos graphics hv12.zip. hiview requires a 386 or better cpu
and a vcpi compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work windows and
os 2 do not). hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen. for larger images , it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do).
you may or may not prefer this approach , but there 's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably. note installation is a
bit tricky read the directions carefully !

a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ( 30). this is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives. its user interface is
also much spiffier looking , although personally i find it harder to use
more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior. it is faster than dvpeg but a
little slower than hiview , at least on my hardware. (for images larger than
screen size , dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed , and both
are faster than hiview.) the current version is 2.1 , available from
simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics dcview21.zip.
requires a vesa graphics driver if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa tsr.zip from the same directory. (many recent pcs have a built in
vesa driver , so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains
that the driver is missing.)

a second shareware alternative is fullview , which has been kicking around
the net for a while , but i do n't know any stable archive location for it.
the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time.

the well known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest
revision , 8.60a. however , cshow 's jpeg implementation is n't very good
it 's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi color displays. too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a
good jpeg capability in cshow. shareware , 25. available from simtel20 and
mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos gif cshw860a.zip.

due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware , any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine. if you ca n't get any
of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert jpeg to gif , then view with your favorite gif viewer. (if you
have hi color hardware , do n't use gif as the intermediate format try to
find a targa capable viewer instead. vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi color displays.)

the independent jpeg group 's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20
and mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). these files are dos
compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will
convert jpeg to and from gif , targa , and ppm formats.

handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools , gif2jpg jpg2gif.
these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in
particular , you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a jpeg. the major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi 's proprietary
jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format. since hsi format
files are rather widespread on bbses , this is a useful capability. version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). get it from
simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics gif2jpg2.zip.
note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet , since it is
not readable on non pc platforms.

handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package , image alchemy. this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi
formats) to and from many other image formats. it can also display images.
a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and
mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics alch162.zip.

note about simtel20 the internet 's key archive site for pc related programs
is simtel20 , full name wsmr simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). simtel20
runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document
refers to directory (eg) msdos graphics at simtel20 , that really means
pd1 msdos.graphics . if you are not physically on milnet , you should
expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20. there are several
internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives
most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. a popular usa
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117) , which keeps simtel20 files
in (eg) pub msdos graphics . if you have no ftp capability , you can
retrieve files from simtel20 by e mail see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. if you are outside the usa ,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is.

microsoft windows

there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images.
(windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware ,
due to windows' system overhead. note that you can run the dos conversion
programs described above inside a windows dos window.)

the newest entry is winecj , which is free and extremely fast. version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net , file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj.zip.
requires windows 3.1 and 256 or more colors mode. this is a no frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway , at least for previewing...

jview is freeware , fairly fast , has good on line help , and can write out the
decompressed image in windows bmp format but it ca n't create new jpeg
files , and it does n't view gifs. jview also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment) , but it 's
an excellent basic viewer. the current version , 0.9 , is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84) , file pub pc win3 desktop jview090.zip.
(mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites ,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

winjpeg (shareware , 20) displays jpeg , gif , targa , tiff , and bmp image files
it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter.
it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and
slideshow. the current version is 2.1 , available from simtel20 and mirror
sites (see note above) , file msdos windows3 winjp210.zip. (this is a slow
286 compatible version if you register , you 'll get the 386 only version ,
which is roughly 25 faster.)

colorview is another shareware entry ( 30). this was an early and promising
contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it
has no real advantages over winjpeg. if you want to try it anyway , the
current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file
pub pc win3 desktop cview097.zip. (i understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.)

dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows , but only in full screen
mode , not in a window.

macintosh

most mac jpeg programs rely on apple 's jpeg implementation , which is part of
the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed.
to use quicktime , you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running
system 6.0.7 or later. (if you 're running system 6 , you must also install
the 32 bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system 7.) you can get
quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com , file dts mac quicktime quicktime.hqx.
(as of 11 92 , this file contains quicktime 1.5 , which is better than qt 1.0
in several ways. with respect to jpeg , it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file. however ,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.)

mac users should keep in mind that quicktime 's jpeg format , pict jpeg , is
not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format. (see section 10 for
details.) if you post images on usenet , make sure they are in jfif format.
most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

the first choice is probably jpegview , a free program for viewing images
that are in jfif format , pict jpeg format , or gif format. it also can
convert between the two jpeg formats. the current version , 2.0 , is a big
improvement over prior versions. get it from sumex aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6) , file info mac app jpeg view 20.hqx. requires system 7 and
quicktime. on 8 bit displays , jpegview usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers. jpegview can
view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact , it 's
the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4mb mac. given a large image , jpegview automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers. (you can zoom in on any desired portion , though.) some people
like this behavior , some do n't. overall , jpegview 's user interface is very
well thought out.

gifconverter , a shareware ( 40) image viewer converter , supports jfif and
pict jpeg , as well as gif and several other image formats. the latest
version is 2.3.2. get it from sumex aim.stanford.edu , file
info mac art gif gif converter 232.hqx. requires system 6.0.5 or later.
gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer , but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images. also , the newest version of gifconverter can
load and save jfif images without quicktime , so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run quicktime. (but it 's faster with quicktime.)
note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg , try
converting the file to gif with jpeg convert , then viewing the gif version.

jpeg convert , a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities , is
available from sumex aim.stanford.edu , file info mac app jpeg convert 10.hqx.
this will run on any mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing.
you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer.

previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6 , a jpeg gif
converter based on an old version of the ijg code. if you are using this
program , you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert.

apple 's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif , quicktime jpeg , and
gif format , and can convert between these formats. you can get pictpixie
from ftp.apple.com , file dts mac quicktime qt.1.0.stuff pictpixie.hqx.
requires quicktime. pictpixie was intended as a developer 's tool , and it 's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime.
some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display ,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. worse , pictpixie is an
unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not
intend to fix. (there is an old version of pictpixie , called
pictcompressor , floating around the net. if you have this you should trash
it , as it 's even buggier. also , the quicktime starter kit includes a much
cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor. note that
picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.)

storm technology 's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter.
this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but
it will run without system 7 or quicktime , so you may be forced to use it on
older systems. (it does need 32 bit quickdraw , so really old machines ca n't
use it.) you can get it from sumex aim.stanford.edu , file
info mac app picture decompress 201.hqx. you must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it.

if your machine is too old to run 32 bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance) ,
gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing. if you
do n't want to pay for gifconverter , use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer.

more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg , although not
all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format. adobe photoshop , version
2.0.1 or later , can read and write jfif format jpeg files (use the jpeg
plug in from the acquire menu). you must set the file type of a downloaded
jpeg file to 'jpeg' to allow photoshop to recognize it.

amiga

(most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). there are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one. in the usa , a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu look under mirrors amiga.physik.unizh.ch ...)

hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer converter , as well as being a
general image manipulation tool. it 's cheap (shareware , 20) and can read
several formats besides jpeg. the current version is 2.0.8. a demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) , file
amiga gfx edit hamlab208d.lha. the demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional.

rend24 (shareware , 30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg , ilbm ,
and gif images. the program can be used to create animations , even
capturing frames on the fly from rendering packages like lightwave. the
current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites) , file amiga os30 gfx rend105.lha. (note although this directory is
supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs , the program will also run under
amigados 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1.)

viewtek is a free jpeg ilbm gif anim viewer. the current version is 1.04 ,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) , file
amiga gfx show viewtek104.lha.

if you 're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages
that support jpeg. two are written by thomas krehbiel , the author of rend24
and viewtek. these are cinemorph , a standalone image morphing package , and
imagefx , an impressive 24 bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting ,
effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph. both are
distributed by great valley products. art department professional (adpro) ,
from asdg inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for amigas. imagemaster , from black belt systems , is another
well regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support.

the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga gfx conv , file
amigajpegv4.lha. these programs convert jpeg to from ppm , gif , targa formats.

the amiga world is heavily infested with quick and dirty jpeg programs , many
based on an ancient beta test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk of the month , without
so much as notifying the authors). among these are augjpeg , newamyjpeg ,
vjpeg , and probably others i have not even heard of. in my opinion ,
anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space
it 's stored on if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer.

atari st

the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st , tt , etc ,
from atari.archive.umich.edu , file atari graphics jpeg4bin.zoo.
these programs convert jpeg to from ppm , gif , targa formats.

for monochrome st monitors , try mgif , which manages to achieve four level
grayscale effect by flickering. version 4.1 reads jpeg files. available
from atari.archive.umich.edu , file atari graphics mgif41b.zoo.

i have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg capable viewers for
ataris , but surely there must be some by now \? pointers appreciated.

acorn archimedes

! changefsi , supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view
jpeg jfif format. provision is also made to convert images to jpeg ,
although this must be done from the cli rather than by double clicking.

recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle
jpeg , along with about 30 other image formats. while older versions can be
found on some archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by
registering with the author , john kortink , nutterbrink 31 , 7544 wj , enschede ,
the netherlands. price 35 dutch guilders (about 22 or 10 pounds).

there 's also a commercial product called ! jpeg which provides jpeg read write
functionality and direct jpeg viewing , as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options. this is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs. contact dt software , freepost ,
cambridge , uk. tel 0223 841099.

next

imageviewer is a pd utility that displays images and can do some format
conversions. the current version reads jpeg but does not write it.
imageviewer is available from the standard next archives at
sonata.cc.purdue.edu and cs.orst.edu , somewhere in pub next (both are
currently being re organized , so it 's hard to point to specific
sub directories). note that there is an older version floating around that
does not support jpeg.


portable software for almost any system

if none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free
jpeg conversion software described in 6b. you 'll also need a viewer program.
if your display is 8 bits or less , any gif viewer will do fine if you have a
display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read targa
or ppm 24 bit image files.

there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings , with more popping up every
day. i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. in that case ,
purchase a hardware assisted product. ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can
handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's files.


6b if you are looking for source code to work with

free , portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent
jpeg group , which i lead. a package containing our source code ,
documentation , and some small test files is available from several places.
the official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9). look under directory graphics jpeg the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z. (this is a compressed tar file do n't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.) you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp.
if you are on a pc and do n't know how to cope with .tar.z format , you may
prefer zip format , which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note
above) , file msdos graphics jpegsrc4.zip. this file will also be available on
compuserve , in the graphsupport forum (go pics) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip.
if you have no ftp access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive version 4 appeared as issues 55 72 of volume 34.
(if you do n't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the faq
article how to find sources , referred to at the top of section 6.)

the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg jfif format and image
files in gif , pbmplus ppm pgm , utah rle , and truevision targa file formats.
the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs , such as image viewers. the package is highly portable we have
tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays.

we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg related products.
we do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details).
we hope to make this software industrial quality although , as with
anything that 's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you 'd like to
contribute to improving our software , you are welcome to join.


7 what 's all this hoopla about color quantization \?

most people do n't have full color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. to display a full color image , the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors. this process is called color quantization . (this is something
of a misnomer , color selection would be a better term. we 're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

clearly , color quantization is a lossy process. it turns out that for most
images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at
the very lowest jpeg quality settings).

since jpeg is a full color format , converting a color jpeg image for display
on 8 bit or less hardware requires color quantization. this is true for
all color jpegs even if you feed a 256 or less color gif into jpeg , what
comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors , but thousands of colors.
this happens because jpeg 's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors. each original color gets smeared
into a group of nearby colors. therefore quantization is always required to
display a color jpeg on a colormapped display , regardless of the image
source. the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output.

(incidentally , because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a jpeg image. even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values , different jpeg decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences. i occasionally see
posted images described as 256 color jpeg . this tells me that the poster
(a) has n't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif.
jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale (just like photographs) , but
number of colors just is n't a useful concept for jpeg.)

on the other hand , a gif image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors. (a gif does have a definite number of colors in its
palette , and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
for purposes of usenet picture distribution , gif has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients do n't have to.
this is also the disadvantage of gif you 're stuck with the sender 's
quantization. if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display , you have to re quantize , resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image.
furthermore , if the sender did n't use a high quality color quantization
algorithm , you 're out of luck.

for this reason , jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware.
jpeg 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display
hardware. furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of jpeg
images you already have. with a gif , you 're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

it 's also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines. if you view a 256 color gif on a 16 color ega
display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the gif , one to display it) , but often it 's
also due to sloppiness. jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed. thus , jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average
gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones !

finally , an ever growing number of people have better than 8 bit display
hardware already 15 bit hi color pc displays , true 24 bit displays on
workstations and macintoshes , etc. for these people , gif is already
obsolete , as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display. jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively.
thus , jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images
in a machine independent fashion.


8 how does jpeg work \?

the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine
transforms , coefficient quantization , and huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding. this article 's long enough already , so i'm not going to say more
than that here. for technical information , see the comp.compression faq.
this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files
pub usenet news.answers compression faq part 1 3 . if you need help in
using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article.


9 what about lossless jpeg \?

there 's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the jpeg committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i.e. , one that guarantees the
final output is bit for bit identical to the original input. however , this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy jpeg
algorithm , and it offers much less compression. at present , very few
implementations of lossless jpeg exist , and all of them are commercial.

saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image.
what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step. (with the v4 free jpeg code , you can also say
sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling. keep in mind that many commercial
jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular jpeg
algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations. the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye ,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

at this minimum loss setting , regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image. true lossless jpeg
provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees
bit for bit accuracy.

if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component) , you may want to look into the
jbig bilevel image compression standard. this performs better than jpeg
lossless on such images. jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with
6 or more bits per pixel furthermore , jpeg is public domain (at least with a
huffman back end) , while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents.


10 why all the argument about file formats \?

strictly speaking , jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms
it does not refer to a specific image file format. the jpeg committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format , this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of
official standards , a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to
do their own thing , and as a result their programs are n't compatible with
anybody else 's.

the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work
that 's been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems. they have defined
two jpeg based file formats
jfif (jpeg file interchange format) , a low end format that transports
pixels and not much else.
tiff jpeg , aka tiff 6.0 , an extension of the aldus tiff format. tiff is
a high end format that will let you record just about everything you
ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides ). tiff is
a lot more complex than jfif , and may well prove less transportable ,
because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
and incompatible subsets of tiff. it 's not likely that adding jpeg to the
mix will do anything to improve this situation.
both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of jpeg related products it 's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in
picture postings. jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the
tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details. even when tiff jpeg is well
defined , the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common
denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable.

a particular case that people may be interested in is apple 's quicktime
software for the macintosh. quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped
inside the mac specific pict structure. conversion between jfif and
quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward , and several mac programs are
available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a). if you have an editor
that handles binary files , you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif
by hand see section 11 for details.

another particular case is handmade software 's programs (gif2jpg jpg2gif and
image alchemy). these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif
format. by default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by
hsi. this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be
used for usenet postings. use the j switch to get jfif output. (this
applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif
format by default. you still should be careful not to post hsi format
files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms.)


11 how do i recognize which file format i have , and what do i do about it \?

if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read , it 's likely
to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format. you can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file

1. a jfif standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0 ,
followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10) , followed by 'jfif'.

2. if you see ff d8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a
raw jpeg file. this is probably decodable as is by jfif software
it 's worth a try , anyway.

3. hsi files start with 'hsi1'. you 're out of luck unless you have hsi
software. portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data , but they
wo n't decompress properly with non hsi programs.

4. a macintosh pict file , if jpeg compressed , will have a couple hundred
bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif'). strip off
everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it.

5. anything else it 's a proprietary format , or not jpeg at all. if you are
lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream.
if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8) ,
try stripping off everything before that.

in uuencoded usenet postings , the characteristic jfif pattern is

begin line
m c x ...

whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with

begin line
m ' i ...

if you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non jfif files.


12 what about arithmetic coding \?

the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output
of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
the choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file. on typical images , arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding. (all the
file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.)

unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm , at t , and mitsubishi.
thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses
from these companies. (the fair use doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

at least in the short run , i recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding the space savings is n't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles. in particular , arithmetic coding should not
be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet.

there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future. stay tuned for further details.


13 does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression \?

it would be nice if , having compressed an image with jpeg , you could
decompress it , manipulate it (crop off a border , say) , and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
unfortunately this is not the case. in general , recompressing an altered
image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it without changing it then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an
identical jpeg file. even this is not true at least , not with the current
free jpeg software. it 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error. if you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation
output. (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited , but i am not optimistic about it.

in any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg , at the original
quality setting , would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation.
(if you 're wondering why , it 's because the pixel block boundaries move.
if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but
that 's a mighty limited capability ! )

the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images , but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps. use a lossless format
(ppm , rle , tiff , etc) while working on the image , then jpeg it when you are
ready to file it away. aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot
of compression decompression time this way ).


14 what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg \?

as stated earlier , you will lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing gif image to jpeg. if you can obtain the original
full color data the gif was made from , it 's far better to make a jpeg from
that. but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from ,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg , to
make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding gif
that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary. some gifs may be better left as gifs , as explained in
section 3 in particular , cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors
do n't convert well. you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality
will be larger than the gif. (so check the sizes too.)

experience to date suggests that large , high visual quality gifs are the best
candidates for conversion to jpeg. they chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings , and they convert to jpeg with least degradation.
do n't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes. also , do n't
expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created
directly from full color originals. to maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through
jpeg files would be (i.e. , shoot for 1 2 or 1 3rd the size of the gif file ,
not 1 4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color
border around a gif image. while useless , this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in gif files. it is not free in jpeg files , and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ( ghost edges). do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before jpeging. (if you are on an x windows
system , xv 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg 's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full color input , but
for gif inputs , q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation. (if you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher
q setting may not be necessary.)

color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store.
if you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. the
trouble with dithering is that , to jpeg , it looks like high spatial frequency
color noise and jpeg ca n't compress noise very well. the resulting jpeg
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it).
to get around this , you want to smooth the gif image before compression.
smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give jpeg trouble. appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high q factor , thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file , while still obtaining a better looking output image
than you 'd get without smoothing.

with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it) , a simple smoothing
capability is built in. try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs.
values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gifs. heavy handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (if you can see regular
fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement , then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.) too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image , which you do n't want. if you are an image processing
wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as
pnmconvol from the pbmplus package. however , cjpeg 's built in smoother is
a lot faster than pnmconvol...

the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a
good starting point for converting gifs. but if you really care about the
image , you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

particular , contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg info@uunet.uu.net.

(geoffrey warren hicks) writes

posted on behalf of craig southeren who does not have access to

can anyone provide me with a colour space transform that would
emulate the effects of red green colour blindness \? i have had
a quick look in the computer graphics literature with no results.
perhaps someone who has access to medical information could help \?

certainly. reference follows.

bear in mind that there are at least two conditions which may be called
red green colour blind. one , protanopia , is caused by a lack or major
dysfunction of the l cones , those that respond best to long
wavelengths. this gives much reduced red green and red violet discrimination and
also means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.

the other , deuteranopia , is due to missing or dysfunctional m cones although it
can also be caused by a lack of the l m cone difference signals in the retina.
it also gives reduced red green discrimination but red violet is unaffected.
unlike protanopia , reds are not dimmer than normal.

on a uniform chromaticity diagram the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer
graphics books there is a single confusion point for each type of colour
deficiency. colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this
point. for protanopia the point is at u' 0.61 , v' 0.51 , very close to the far red
corner. for deuteranopia , the point is at u' 4.75 , v' 1.31

note that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly
different values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental
setup , random errors , and so on. the values quoted are typical.

so if all colours on a line are seen as the same , which colour is actually seen \?

this problem has now been solved. tests on people with one normal eye and one
affected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto
which all the colours collapse. for protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on
the spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe) for deuteranopes the line is
very similar , joining 477nm and 579nm.

so to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or
duuteranopia

1) plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram
2) construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point
3) find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line
4) this is the new chromaticity.

the best reference for this is meyer , g.w. greenberg , d.p. (1988) 'colour
defective vision and computer graphics displays' , ieee computer graphics and
applications 8(5) 28 40.

you will also need a decent reference on basic colour science if you are not
familiar with the cie xyz colour model and the uniform chromaticity scale diagram.

i would like to write a program (probably a ppm filter) to allow
previewing of images to check for sufficient contract for colour
blind users. not being colour blind myself , this is a bit difficult !

yes this is certainly possible. you will need the chromaticities of the red
green and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on , and
the chromaticity of the white point. this information can be measured , or
obtained from the manufacturer. i posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a
couple of weeks ago.

the procedure , for each pixel ( ! ) is as follows. (some lookup tables might be a
help here.)

a) convert rgb to cie xyz. this is a simple 3 3 matrix multiplication once you
have the monitor data.
b) retaining the y component for later , convert xyz to chromaticity coordinates u'v'
using u' 4x (x 15y 3z) , v' 9y (x 15y 3z)
c) find the equation of the line as in step 2 above
d) find the intersection as in step 3
e) convert back from u'v' to xyz , using the y value from step a
f) ensure that this new colour can be displayed on your monitor if not , move it
along a line in xyz space towards neutral grey (ie half way between black and
white) until it is displayable.

please email replies i will summarise and repost if there is
sufficient interest

done also posted for the rest of us.

i was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine ! ) ) and he made a reference to a
48 bit graphics computer image processing system. i seem to remember it being called image or
something akin to that. anyway , he claimed it had 48 bit color a 12 bit alpha channel. that 's
60 bits of info what could that possibly be for \? specifically the 48 bit color \? that 's 280
trillion colors , many more than the human eye can resolve. is this an anti aliasing thing \? or
is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor.

hmm... 48 bit aye \?
well , it beats a 32 bit design for thee sake of ellegance.
48 bit means 16 bits per primary colour.
the 2 48 nr of colours is a bit misleading. it makes more sense to see it
as 65536 possible shades of pure red.
this might actually make some sense , since 256 shades of red (24 bit colours)
may produce visible 'jumps' in intensity.
then again , a byte per primary colour for each pixel is the most elegant way
of doing colour graphics , because it leaves ya such a tidy (and fast) program
code.

take care ,

1 what is jpeg \?

jpeg (pronounced jay peg ) is a standardized image compression mechanism.
jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group , the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard. jpeg is designed for compressing either
full color or gray scale digital images of natural , real world scenes.
it does not work so well on non realistic images , such as cartoons or line
drawings.

jpeg does not handle black and white (1 bit per pixel) images , nor does it
handle motion picture compression. standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees , named jbig and mpeg
respectively.

jpeg is lossy , meaning that the image you get out of decompression is n't
quite identical to what you originally put in. the algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye , notably
the fact that small color details are n't perceived as well as small details
of light and dark. thus , jpeg is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans. if you plan to machine analyze your images , the
small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you , even if they are
invisible to the eye.

a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters. this means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality. you can make extremely small
files if you do n't mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image
archives , making thumbnail views or icons , etc. etc. conversely , if you
are n't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting , you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied , and accept lesser compression.


2 why use jpeg \?

there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller , and to store
24 bit per pixel color data instead of 8 bit per pixel data.

making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images. being able to compress a
2 mbyte full color file down to 100 kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time ! (if you are comparing gif and jpeg , the
size ratio is more like four to one. more details below.)

if your viewing software does n't support jpeg directly , you 'll have to
convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images. even
with a jpeg capable viewer , it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image
than to view an image of a simpler format (gif , for instance). thus , using
jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

it 's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved , the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file. i 'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet
posting format is that jpeg can store full color information 24 bits pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors). if you have
only 8 bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you. within a couple of years , though , 8 bit gif will look as obsolete as
black and white macpaint format does today. furthermore , for reasons detailed
in section 7 , jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware. hence jpeg is considerably
more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard.


3 when should i use jpeg , and when should i stick with gif \?

jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images ,
gif is superior in image quality , file size , or both. one of the first
things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to.

as a rule of thumb , jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or
gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and
similar material. jpeg is superior even if you do n't have 24 bit display
hardware , and it is a lot superior if you do. (see section 7 for details.)

gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors ,
such as cartoons and line drawings. in particular , large areas of pixels
that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by gif. jpeg ca n't squeeze these files as much as gif does without
introducing visible defects. this sort of image is best kept in gif form.
(in particular , single color borders are quite cheap in gif files , but they
should be avoided in jpeg files.)

jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure white pixels , for example. sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting. again , this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs , but it shows up fairly
often in gif files borders , overlaid text , etc. the blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that 's only a few pixels high.
if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text , do n't jpeg it.

computer drawn images (ray traced scenes , for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity. the more complex and
subtly rendered the image , the more likely that jpeg will do well on it.
the same goes for semi realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

plain black and white (two level) images should never be converted to jpeg.
you need at least about 16 gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale
images. it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images
of up to 256 levels , while jpeg is not.

if you have an existing library of gif images , you may wonder whether you
should convert them to jpeg. you will lose a little image quality if you do.
(section 7 , which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif , only
applies if both formats start from a full color original. if you start from
a gif , you 've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg
can only make things worse.) however , the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway. this is a decision you 'll have to make for yourself.
if you do convert a gif library to jpeg , see section 14 for hints. be
prepared to leave some images in gif format , since some gifs will not
convert well.


4 how well does jpeg compress images \?

pretty darn well. here are some sample file sizes for an image i have
handy , a 727x525 full color image of a ship in a harbor. the first three
files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg
software described in section 6b.

file size in bytes comments

ship.ppm 1145040 original file in ppm format (no compression 24 bits
or 3 bytes per pixel , plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.z 963829 ppm file passed through unix compress
compress does n't accomplish a lot , you 'll note.
other text oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif 240438 converted to gif with ppmquant fs 256 ppmtogif
most of the savings is the result of losing color
info gif saves 8 bits pixel , not 24. (see sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95 155622 cjpeg q 95 (highest useful quality setting)
this is indistinguishable from the 24 bit original ,
at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75 58009 cjpeg q 75 (default setting)
you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
from the original , even with both on screen at once.
ship.jpg50 38406 cjpeg q 50
this has slight defects if you know what to look
for , you could tell it 's been jpeged without seeing
the original. still as good image quality as many
recent postings in usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25 25192 cjpeg q 25
jpeg 's characteristic blockiness becomes apparent
at this setting (djpeg blocksmooth helps some).
still , i 've seen plenty of usenet postings that were
of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o 6587 cjpeg q 5 optimize ( optimize cuts table overhead)
blocky , but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
indexing purposes. note that this file is tiny
the compression ratio from the original is 173 1 !

in this case jpeg can make a file that 's a factor of four or five smaller
than a gif of comparable quality (the q 75 file is every bit as good as the
gif , better if you have a full color display). this seems to be a typical
ratio for real world scenes.


5 what are good quality settings for jpeg \?

most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting. there seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings. quality 95 does not mean keep 95 of the
information , as some have claimed. the quality scale is purely arbitrary
it 's not a percentage of anything.

the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original. this setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another , but here are some rules of thumb.

the default quality setting ( q 75) is very often the best choice. this
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image. try q 75 first if you see defects , then go up. except for
experimental purposes , never go above q 95 saying q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as q 95 , but of hardly any better quality.

if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with , you might be able to
go down to q 50 without objectionable degradation. on the other hand , you
might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation.
the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg.
the default q 75 is about right for compressing 24 bit images , but q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting gifs (see section 14 for more info).

if you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects , a q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right. q 2 or so may be amusing as op art .

(note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg
software described in section 6b , and to many programs based on it. other
jpeg implementations , such as image alchemy , may use a completely different
quality scale. some programs do n't even provide a numeric scale , just
high medium low style choices.)


6 where can i get jpeg software \?

most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp.
if you do n't know how to use ftp , see the faq article how to find sources .
(if you do n't have direct access to ftp , read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.) that article appears regularly in news.answers , or you can
get it by sending e mail to mail server@rtfm.mit.edu with
send usenet news.answers finding sources in the body. the anonymous ftp
list faq may also be helpful it 's usenet news.answers ftp list faq in
the news.answers archive.

note this list changes constantly. if you have a copy more than a couple
months old , get the latest jpeg faq from the news.answers archive.


6a if you are looking for canned software , viewers , etc

the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one
kind of system. if you do n't see what you want for your machine , check out
the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list. note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
internet but some commercial programs are listed too.

x windows

xv (shareware , 25) is an excellent viewer for jpeg , gif , and many other
image formats. it can also do format conversion and some simple image
manipulations. it 's available for ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) ,
file contrib xv 3.00.tar.z. version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support
for 24 bit displays and many other improvements however , it is brand new
and still has some bugs lurking. if you prefer not to be on the bleeding
edge , stick with version 2.21 , also available from export. note that
version 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24 bit display (you 'll get
only 8 bit color) , nor for converting 24 bit images to jpeg. but 2.21 works
fine for converting gif and other 8 bit images to jpeg. caution there is a
glitch in version 2.21 be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox
when saving a jpeg file , or the file will be blurry.

another good choice for x windows is john cristy 's free imagemagick package ,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib imagemagick.tar.z.
this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks. the
imagemagick viewer handles 24 bit displays correctly for colormapped
displays , it does better (though slower) color quantization than xv or the
basic free jpeg software.

both of the above are large , complex packages. if you just want a simple
image viewer , try xloadimage or xli. xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest
release , 3.03. xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu ,
file contrib xloadimage 3.03.tar.z. xli is a variant version of xloadimage ,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage , at least with respect to jpeg files , because it has the ijg v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked over v1. the next
xloadimage release will fix this.) xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu , file contrib xli.1.14.tar.z. both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24 bit displays.


ms dos

this covers plain dos for windows or os 2 programs , see the next headings.

one good choice is eric praetzel 's free dvpeg , which views jpeg and gif files.
the current version , 2.5 , is available by ftp from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50) , file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg25.zip. this is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386 486 machines. the user interface is
not flashy , but it 's functional.

another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei 's hiview. the
current version , 1.2 , is available from simtel20 and mirror sites (see note
below) , file msdos graphics hv12.zip. hiview requires a 386 or better cpu
and a vcpi compatible memory manager (qemm386 and 386max work windows and
os 2 do not). hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen. for larger images , it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do).
you may or may not prefer this approach , but there 's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably. note installation is a
bit tricky read the directions carefully !

a shareware alternative is colorview for dos ( 30). this is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives. its user interface is
also much spiffier looking , although personally i find it harder to use
more keystrokes , inconsistent behavior. it is faster than dvpeg but a
little slower than hiview , at least on my hardware. (for images larger than
screen size , dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed , and both
are faster than hiview.) the current version is 2.1 , available from
simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics dcview21.zip.
requires a vesa graphics driver if you do n't have one , look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa tsr.zip from the same directory. (many recent pcs have a built in
vesa driver , so do n't try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains
that the driver is missing.)

a second shareware alternative is fullview , which has been kicking around
the net for a while , but i do n't know any stable archive location for it.
the current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the simtel20 archives at that time.

the well known gif viewer compushow (cshow) supports jpeg in its latest
revision , 8.60a. however , cshow 's jpeg implementation is n't very good
it 's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi color displays. too bad ... it 'd have been nice to see a
good jpeg capability in cshow. shareware , 25. available from simtel20 and
mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos gif cshw860a.zip.

due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware , any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine. if you ca n't get any
of them to work , you 'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert jpeg to gif , then view with your favorite gif viewer. (if you
have hi color hardware , do n't use gif as the intermediate format try to
find a targa capable viewer instead. vpic5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi color displays.)

the independent jpeg group 's free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel20
and mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory). these files are dos
compilations of the free source code described in section 6b they will
convert jpeg to and from gif , targa , and ppm formats.

handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools , gif2jpg jpg2gif.
these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in
particular , you ca n't get 24 bit color output from a jpeg. the major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi 's proprietary
jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format. since hsi format
files are rather widespread on bbses , this is a useful capability. version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware). get it from
simtel20 and mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics gif2jpg2.zip.
note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet , since it is
not readable on non pc platforms.

handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package , image alchemy. this will translate jpeg files (both jfif and hsi
formats) to and from many other image formats. it can also display images.
a demo version of image alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from simtel20 and
mirror sites (see note below) , file msdos graphics alch162.zip.

note about simtel20 the internet 's key archive site for pc related programs
is simtel20 , full name wsmr simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20). simtel20
runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document
refers to directory (eg) msdos graphics at simtel20 , that really means
pd1 msdos.graphics . if you are not physically on milnet , you should
expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel20. there are several
internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the simtel20 archives
most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead. a popular usa
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117) , which keeps simtel20 files
in (eg) pub msdos graphics . if you have no ftp capability , you can
retrieve files from simtel20 by e mail see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how. if you are outside the usa ,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel20 mirror is.

microsoft windows

there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images.
(windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware ,
due to windows' system overhead. note that you can run the dos conversion
programs described above inside a windows dos window.)

the newest entry is winecj , which is free and extremely fast. version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net , file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj.zip.
requires windows 3.1 and 256 or more colors mode. this is a no frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
but it 's so fast you 'll use it anyway , at least for previewing...

jview is freeware , fairly fast , has good on line help , and can write out the
decompressed image in windows bmp format but it ca n't create new jpeg
files , and it does n't view gifs. jview also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment) , but it 's
an excellent basic viewer. the current version , 0.9 , is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84) , file pub pc win3 desktop jview090.zip.
(mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites ,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

winjpeg (shareware , 20) displays jpeg , gif , targa , tiff , and bmp image files
it can write all of these formats too , so it can be used as a converter.
it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and
slideshow. the current version is 2.1 , available from simtel20 and mirror
sites (see note above) , file msdos windows3 winjp210.zip. (this is a slow
286 compatible version if you register , you 'll get the 386 only version ,
which is roughly 25 faster.)

colorview is another shareware entry ( 30). this was an early and promising
contender , but it has not been updated in some time , and at this point it
has no real advantages over winjpeg. if you want to try it anyway , the
current version is 0.97 , available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu , file
pub pc win3 desktop cview097.zip. (i understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos.)

dvpeg (see dos heading) also works under windows , but only in full screen
mode , not in a window.

os 2

the following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
note check pub uploads for more recent versions the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
pub os2 2.x graphics jpegv4.zip
32 bit version of free ijg conversion programs , version 4.
pub os2 all graphics jpeg4 16.zip
16 bit version of same , for os 2 1.x.
pub os2 2.x graphics imgarc12.zip
image archiver 1.02 image conversion viewing with pm graphical interface.
strong on conversion functions , viewing is a bit weaker. shareware , 15.
pub os2 2.x graphics pmjpeg11.zip
pmjpeg 1.1 os 2 2.x port of winjpeg , a popular viewer for windows
(see description in windows section). shareware , 20.
pub os2 2.x graphics pmview85.zip
pmview 0.85 jpeg gif bmp viewer. gif viewing very fast , jpeg viewing
fast if you have huge amounts of ram , otherwise about the same speed
as the above programs. strong 24 bit display support. shareware , 20.

macintosh

most mac jpeg programs rely on apple 's jpeg implementation , which is part of
the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed.
to use quicktime , you need a 68020 or better cpu and you need to be running
system 6.0.7 or later. (if you 're running system 6 , you must also install
the 32 bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system 7.) you can get
quicktime by ftp from ftp.apple.com , file dts mac quicktime quicktime.hqx.
(as of 11 92 , this file contains quicktime 1.5 , which is better than qt 1.0
in several ways. with respect to jpeg , it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file. however ,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt 1.5.)

mac users should keep in mind that quicktime 's jpeg format , pict jpeg , is
not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format. (see section 10 for
details.) if you post images on usenet , make sure they are in jfif format.
most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

the first choice is probably jpegview , a free program for viewing images
that are in jfif format , pict jpeg format , or gif format. it also can
convert between the two jpeg formats. the current version , 2.0 , is a big
improvement over prior versions. get it from sumex aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6) , file info mac app jpeg view 20.hqx. requires system 7 and
quicktime. on 8 bit displays , jpegview usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers. jpegview can
view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact , it 's
the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4mb mac. given a large image , jpegview automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen , rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers. (you can zoom in on any desired portion , though.) some people
like this behavior , some do n't. overall , jpegview 's user interface is very
well thought out.

gifconverter , a shareware ( 40) image viewer converter , supports jfif and
pict jpeg , as well as gif and several other image formats. the latest
version is 2.3.2. get it from sumex aim.stanford.edu , file
info mac art gif gif converter 232.hqx. requires system 6.0.5 or later.
gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer , but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities , so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images. also , the newest version of gifconverter can
load and save jfif images without quicktime , so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run quicktime. (but it 's faster with quicktime.)
note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg , try
converting the file to gif with jpeg convert , then viewing the gif version.

jpeg convert , a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities , is
available from sumex aim.stanford.edu , file info mac app jpeg convert 10.hqx.
this will run on any mac , but it only does file conversion , not viewing.
you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer.

previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v0.6 , a jpeg gif
converter based on an old version of the ijg code. if you are using this
program , you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert.

apple 's free program pictpixie can view images in jfif , quicktime jpeg , and
gif format , and can convert between these formats. you can get pictpixie
from ftp.apple.com , file dts mac quicktime qt.1.0.stuff pictpixie.hqx.
requires quicktime. pictpixie was intended as a developer 's tool , and it 's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime.
some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory , it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24 bit display ,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface. worse , pictpixie is an
unsupported program , meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not
intend to fix. (there is an old version of pictpixie , called
pictcompressor , floating around the net. if you have this you should trash
it , as it 's even buggier. also , the quicktime starter kit includes a much
cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor. note that
picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net.)

storm technology 's picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter.
this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways , but
it will run without system 7 or quicktime , so you may be forced to use it on
older systems. (it does need 32 bit quickdraw , so really old machines ca n't
use it.) you can get it from sumex aim.stanford.edu , file
info mac app picture decompress 201.hqx. you must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'jpeg' to allow picture decompress to open it.

if your machine is too old to run 32 bit quickdraw (a mac plus for instance) ,
gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing. if you
do n't want to pay for gifconverter , use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer.

more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg , although not
all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format. adobe photoshop , version

amiga

(most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80). there are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one. in the usa , a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu look under mirrors amiga.physik.unizh.ch ...)

hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer converter , as well as being a
general image manipulation tool. it 's cheap (shareware , 20) and can read
several formats besides jpeg. the current version is 2.0.8. a demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) , file
amiga gfx edit hamlab208d.lha. the demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512 , but it is otherwise fully functional.

rend24 (shareware , 30) is an image renderer that can display jpeg , ilbm ,
and gif images. the program can be used to create animations , even
capturing frames on the fly from rendering packages like lightwave. the
current version is 1.05 , available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites) , file amiga os30 gfx rend105.lha. (note although this directory is
supposedly for amigados 3.0 programs , the program will also run under
amigados 1.3 , 2.04 or 2.1.)

viewtek is a free jpeg ilbm gif anim viewer. the current version is 1.04 ,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) , file
amiga gfx show viewtek104.lha.

if you 're willing to spend real money , there are several commercial packages
that support jpeg. two are written by thomas krehbiel , the author of rend24
and viewtek. these are cinemorph , a standalone image morphing package , and
imagefx , an impressive 24 bit image capture , conversion , editing , painting ,
effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph. both are
distributed by great valley products. art department professional (adpro) ,
from asdg inc , is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for amigas. imagemaster , from black belt systems , is another
well regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support.

the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga gfx conv , file
amigajpegv4.lha. these programs convert jpeg to from ppm , gif , targa formats.

the amiga world is heavily infested with quick and dirty jpeg programs , many
based on an ancient beta test version of the free ijg jpeg software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk of the month , without
so much as notifying the authors). among these are augjpeg , newamyjpeg ,
vjpeg , and probably others i have not even heard of. in my opinion ,
anything older than ijg version 3 (march 1992) is not worth the disk space
it 's stored on if you have such a program , trash it and get something newer.

atari st

the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st , tt , etc ,
from atari.archive.umich.edu , file atari graphics jpeg4bin.zoo.
these programs convert jpeg to from ppm , gif , targa formats.

for monochrome st monitors , try mgif , which manages to achieve four level
grayscale effect by flickering. version 4.1 reads jpeg files. available
from atari.archive.umich.edu , file atari graphics mgif41b.zoo.

i have not heard of any other free or shareware jpeg capable viewers for
ataris , but surely there must be some by now \? pointers appreciated.

acorn archimedes

! changefsi , supplied with risc os 3 version 3.10 , can convert from and view
jpeg jfif format. provision is also made to convert images to jpeg ,
although this must be done from the cli rather than by double clicking.

recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program translator can handle
jpeg , along with about 30 other image formats. while older versions can be
found on some archimedes bboards , the current version is only available by
registering with the author , john kortink , nutterbrink 31 , 7544 wj , enschede ,
the netherlands. price 35 dutch guilders (about 22 or 10 pounds).

there 's also a commercial product called ! jpeg which provides jpeg read write
functionality and direct jpeg viewing , as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options. this is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs. contact dt software , freepost ,
cambridge , uk. tel 0223 841099.


portable software for almost any system

if none of the above fits your situation , you can obtain and compile the free
jpeg conversion software described in 6b. you 'll also need a viewer program.
if your display is 8 bits or less , any gif viewer will do fine if you have a
display with more color capability , try to find a viewer that can read targa
or ppm 24 bit image files.

there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings , with more popping up every
day. i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow. in that case ,
purchase a hardware assisted product. ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can
handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else 's files.


6b if you are looking for source code to work with

free , portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent
jpeg group , which i lead. a package containing our source code ,
documentation , and some small test files is available from several places.
the official archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9). look under directory graphics jpeg the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.z. (this is a compressed tar file do n't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.) you can retrieve this file by ftp or uucp.
if you are on a pc and do n't know how to cope with .tar.z format , you may
prefer zip format , which you can find at simtel20 and mirror sites (see note
above) , file msdos graphics jpegsrc4.zip. this file will also be available on
compuserve , in the graphsupport forum (go pics) , library 15 , as jpsrc4.zip.
if you have no ftp access , you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive version 4 appeared as issues 55 72 of volume 34.
(if you do n't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings , see the faq
article how to find sources , referred to at the top of section 6.)

the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg jfif format and image
files in gif , pbmplus ppm pgm , utah rle , and truevision targa file formats.
the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs , such as image viewers. the package is highly portable we have
tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays.

we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg related products.
we do not ask a royalty , although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the readme file in the distribution for details).
we hope to make this software industrial quality although , as with
anything that 's free , we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you 'd like to
contribute to improving our software , you are welcome to join.


7 what 's all this hoopla about color quantization \?

most people do n't have full color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel , so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time. to display a full color image , the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors. this process is called color quantization . (this is something
of a misnomer , color selection would be a better term. we 're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

clearly , color quantization is a lossy process. it turns out that for most
images , the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg (except at
the very lowest jpeg quality settings).

since jpeg is a full color format , converting a color jpeg image for display
on 8 bit or less hardware requires color quantization. this is true for
all color jpegs even if you feed a 256 or less color gif into jpeg , what
comes out of the decompressor is not 256 colors , but thousands of colors.
this happens because jpeg 's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently , so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors. each original color gets smeared
into a group of nearby colors. therefore quantization is always required to
display a color jpeg on a colormapped display , regardless of the image
source. the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output.

(incidentally , because of this effect it 's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a jpeg image. even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values , different jpeg decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences. i occasionally see
posted images described as 256 color jpeg . this tells me that the poster
(a) has n't read this faq and (b) probably converted the jpeg from a gif.
jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale (just like photographs) , but
number of colors just is n't a useful concept for jpeg.)

on the other hand , a gif image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors. (a gif does have a definite number of colors in its
palette , and the format does n't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
for purposes of usenet picture distribution , gif has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization , so recipients do n't have to.
this is also the disadvantage of gif you 're stuck with the sender 's
quantization. if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display , you have to re quantize , resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image.
furthermore , if the sender did n't use a high quality color quantization
algorithm , you 're out of luck.

for this reason , jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines do n't match the sender 's display hardware.
jpeg 's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user 's display
hardware. furthermore , you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area) , or purchase better display hardware , to get a better view of jpeg
images you already have. with a gif , you 're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

it 's also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines. if you view a 256 color gif on a 16 color ega
display , for example , you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to. this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the gif , one to display it) , but often it 's
also due to sloppiness. jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all , and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed. thus , jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average
gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones !

finally , an ever growing number of people have better than 8 bit display
hardware already 15 bit hi color pc displays , true 24 bit displays on
workstations and macintoshes , etc. for these people , gif is already
obsolete , as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display. jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively.
thus , jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images
in a machine independent fashion.


8 how does jpeg work \?

the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling , discrete cosine
transforms , coefficient quantization , and huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding. this article 's long enough already , so i'm not going to say more
than that here. for technical information , see the comp.compression faq.
this is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu , in files
pub usenet news.answers compression faq part 1 3 . if you need help in
using the news.answers archive , see the top of this article.


9 what about lossless jpeg \?

there 's a great deal of confusion on this subject. the jpeg committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm , i.e. , one that guarantees the
final output is bit for bit identical to the original input. however , this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular , lossy jpeg
algorithm , and it offers much less compression. at present , very few
implementations of lossless jpeg exist , and all of them are commercial.

saying q 100 to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image.
what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step. there is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step. (with the v4 free jpeg code , you can also say
sample 1x1 to turn off subsampling. keep in mind that many commercial
jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

even with both quantization and subsampling turned off , the regular jpeg
algorithm is not lossless , because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations. the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value it 's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye ,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

at this minimum loss setting , regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24 bit per pixel image. true lossless jpeg
provides roughly the same amount of compression , but it guarantees
bit for bit accuracy.

if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component) , you may want to look into the
jbig bilevel image compression standard. this performs better than jpeg
lossless on such images. jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with
6 or more bits per pixel furthermore , jpeg is public domain (at least with a
huffman back end) , while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents.


10 why all the argument about file formats \?

strictly speaking , jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms
it does not refer to a specific image file format. the jpeg committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

since we ca n't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format , this leaves us with a problem. in the absence of
official standards , a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to
do their own thing , and as a result their programs are n't compatible with
anybody else 's.

the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work
that 's been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems. they have defined
two jpeg based file formats
jfif (jpeg file interchange format) , a low end format that transports
pixels and not much else.
tiff jpeg , aka tiff 6.0 , an extension of the aldus tiff format. tiff is
a high end format that will let you record just about everything you
ever wanted to know about an image , and a lot more besides ). tiff is
a lot more complex than jfif , and may well prove less transportable ,
because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
and incompatible subsets of tiff. it 's not likely that adding jpeg to the
mix will do anything to improve this situation.
both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of jpeg related products it 's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in
picture postings. jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the
tiff 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted , and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details. even when tiff jpeg is well
defined , the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common
denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable.

a particular case that people may be interested in is apple 's quicktime
software for the macintosh. quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped
inside the mac specific pict structure. conversion between jfif and
quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward , and several mac programs are
available to do it (see mac portion of section 6a). if you have an editor
that handles binary files , you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif
by hand see section 11 for details.

another particular case is handmade software 's programs (gif2jpg jpg2gif and
image alchemy). these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif
format. by default , though , they write a proprietary format developed by
hsi. this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be
used for usenet postings. use the j switch to get jfif output. (this
applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif
format by default. you still should be careful not to post hsi format
files , unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms.)


11 how do i recognize which file format i have , and what do i do about it \?

if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software wo n't read , it 's likely
to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format. you can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file

1. a jfif standard file will start with the characters (hex) ff d8 ff e0 ,
followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10) , followed by 'jfif'.

2. if you see ff d8 at the start , but not the rest of it , you may have a
raw jpeg file. this is probably decodable as is by jfif software
it 's worth a try , anyway.

3. hsi files start with 'hsi1'. you 're out of luck unless you have hsi
software. portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data , but they
wo n't decompress properly with non hsi programs.

4. a macintosh pict file , if jpeg compressed , will have a couple hundred
bytes of header followed by a jfif header (scan for 'jfif'). strip off
everything before the ff d8 and you should be able to read it.

5. anything else it 's a proprietary format , or not jpeg at all. if you are
lucky , the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream.
if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream (look for ff d8) ,
try stripping off everything before that.

in uuencoded usenet postings , the characteristic jfif pattern is

begin line
m c x ...

whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with

begin line
m ' i ...

if you learn to check for the former , you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non jfif files.


12 what about arithmetic coding \?

the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output
of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
the choice has no impact on image quality , but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file. on typical images , arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than huffman coding. (all the
file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding.)

unfortunately , the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm , at t , and mitsubishi.
thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses
from these companies. (the fair use doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm , but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

at least in the short run , i recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding the space savings is n't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles. in particular , arithmetic coding should not
be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet.

there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future. stay tuned for further details.


13 does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression \?

it would be nice if , having compressed an image with jpeg , you could
decompress it , manipulate it (crop off a border , say) , and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
unfortunately this is not the case. in general , recompressing an altered
image loses more information , though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it without changing it then there is no further loss , i.e. , you get an
identical jpeg file. even this is not true at least , not with the current
free jpeg software. it 's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error. if you repeatedly compress and decompress , the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation
output. (it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited , but i am not optimistic about it.

in any case , the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg , at the original
quality setting , would introduce no further loss. even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation.
(if you 're wondering why , it 's because the pixel block boundaries move.
if you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels , you might be safe , but
that 's a mighty limited capability ! )

the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images , but you do n't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps. use a lossless format
(ppm , rle , tiff , etc) while working on the image , then jpeg it when you are
ready to file it away. aside from avoiding degradation , you will save a lot
of compression decompression time this way ).


14 what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg \?

as stated earlier , you will lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing gif image to jpeg. if you can obtain the original
full color data the gif was made from , it 's far better to make a jpeg from
that. but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from ,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg , to
make sure you are happy with it , before throwing away the corresponding gif
that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary. some gifs may be better left as gifs , as explained in
section 3 in particular , cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors
do n't convert well. you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality
will be larger than the gif. (so check the sizes too.)

experience to date suggests that large , high visual quality gifs are the best
candidates for conversion to jpeg. they chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings , and they convert to jpeg with least degradation.
do n't waste your time converting any gif much under 100 kbytes. also , do n't
expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created
directly from full color originals. to maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through
jpeg files would be (i.e. , shoot for 1 2 or 1 3rd the size of the gif file ,
not 1 4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color
border around a gif image. while useless , this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in gif files. it is not free in jpeg files , and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts ( ghost edges). do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before jpeging. (if you are on an x windows
system , xv 's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg 's default q setting of 75 is appropriate for full color input , but
for gif inputs , q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation. (if you apply smoothing as suggested below , the higher
q setting may not be necessary.)

color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that gif can actually store.
if you enlarge the image , you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value. the
trouble with dithering is that , to jpeg , it looks like high spatial frequency
color noise and jpeg ca n't compress noise very well. the resulting jpeg
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from jpeging the original full color image (if you had it).
to get around this , you want to smooth the gif image before compression.
smoothing averages together nearby pixels , thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway , and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give jpeg trouble. appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high q factor , thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file , while still obtaining a better looking output image
than you 'd get without smoothing.

with the v4 free jpeg software (or products based on it) , a simple smoothing
capability is built in. try smooth 10 or so when converting gifs.
values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high quality gifs. heavy handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors. (if you can see regular
fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement , then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.) too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image , which you do n't want. if you are an image processing
wizard , you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program , such as
pnmconvol from the pbmplus package. however , cjpeg 's built in smoother is
a lot faster than pnmconvol...

the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality 85 smooth 10 is probably a
good starting point for converting gifs. but if you really care about the
image , you 'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

i am not sure that i am supposed to post this mail here. however
during the last year , while i was involved in developing graphical user
interface (gui) applications , i have enjoyed being personally part of this
news group wherin i got some interesting information which helped me in my
work. i am posting my resuming hoping that people working in my area would
make time to look at it.

dear prospective employer

i am seeking employment as a software engineer with interests in software
design and development , in which i can utilize my experience in hardware ,
c c programming , graphical user interface (gui) , operating systems and
computer networking.

i received my bachelors of engineering (be) degree in electronics
engineering in 1990 and a m.s. degree in electrical engineering in dec 1992
from iowa state university. currently i am enrolled in a m.s. in computer
engineering at iowa state university.

during my masters program , as a research assistant since jan 1991 , i have
published three papers including one in the ieee transactions on magnetics.
these papers are a reflection of the quality of my research and my ability
to learn new concepts quickly.

i have been involved in many projects involving software developments and
have extensive experience programming in c , c , fortran and assembly level.
i am also familiar with operating systems like unix , ultrix and ms dos.
i am familiar with motif x programming and currently , as a research assistant ,
am involved in graphical user interface (gui) design using the multiplatform
gui toolkit xvt . my experiences also include areas such as operating systems
and computer networks , through course work and projects. i was involved in the
study of the design and development of the internals of the xinu operating
system. i have also been involved in many tcp ip programming projects in
computer networking.

while in college i learnt the importance of clear and concise communication.
i have also learned a lot about time management. in my m.s. program i
have maintained a 3.70 grade average , worked 20 hours per week and
have enjoyed being involved in many other extra curricular activities.

my software experiences along with my hardware background (electronics
engineering) would be very helpful in my career goals as a software engineer.
i request that my qualifications may kindly be reviewed. i would like to
have an interview to discuss your employment needs and my career goals.
i am eager to hear from you soon.


sincerely

you had bought a compaq or toshiba , you might have reasonably expected the
machine to last longer before something went wrong but that 's a moot
point , perhaps.

maybe. i 've had an epson portable with backlit lcd since 1988 which is
still used daily and the screen on that is fine. the only problem it
has (and ever has had) is the arm of the screen is sorta lose and if
you bend it fairly harshly the screen goes off until you wiggle it

add all entries in the table. if the sum 0 , the point is outside. if

synergy revolt
...the first in a continuing series of collaborative
art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity
of the infosphere. this series of diversely
structured art manipulation projects will attempt
to stretch across network boundries encouraging
use of electronic mail , fax , video , photography ,
scanned conventional art and even sound to
create multi artist still visuals in gif and
jpg formats. visualists from all technical levels
are welcome.

revolt will be structured simply. there will be
three stages of production. the first stage will
consist of all participants creating one still
work as a starter piece that two other partici
pants will , in turn , manipulate. all first stage
base images are due by sunday , may 23rd , 1993 ,
midnight central daylight time.

stage two will begin on may 24th. all images will
be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant
for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see
fit. for purely digital artists , this may consist
of filtering the image through their favorite paint
program. for analog artists , this may well be
printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their
own part with pen , pencil or white out then scan
ning in the image again to be transferred on to
the third stage artist. all second stage works
are due by midnight on sunday , may 30th.

stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
on may 31st. all artists will do what they think
it takes to finish up the image they 've been given
using whatever technique they see as worthy.
these images will be due on june 6th , midnight.

all involved will participate in each stage of
creation.

okay , i got enough replies about the kubota kenai denali systems that i
will post a summary of their capabilities. i have n't actually used one
or seen one , so take the specs with a grain of salt. i 'd like to see
an independent review of one against , say , an sgi indigo extreme or
something.

basically , the kenai workstations are dec alpha axp based workstations that
run osf 1 ( dec 's ) and will likely run windows nt in the future. they are
binary compatible with digital 's osf 1 alpha axp implementation. denali
is their graphics subsystem , which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding transformation engines .

the two main kenai machines are the 3400 imaging and 3d graphics workstation
and the 3500 imaging and 3d graphics workstation.

okay , now the real stuff. the kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as denali. the denali comes in three models , the e , p , and v. they

as you can see , these are pretty powerful workstations , and the best part
is the pricing. i would recommend that you call kubota for more information.
their number is 408 727 8100. i'm sure they 'll send you an information you
may want. oh , some prices

low end

if someone could post a relative comparision with an indigo extreme or

hope this helps someone out there ,

sorts of things (change colors , draw points lines polygons fills , etc.). does
such a library exist for generic vga graphics cards chips , hopefully in the
public domain \? this would be for the purpose of compiling under a non dos
operating system running on a standard pc.


i'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library
package to do pc vga graphics.

i'm currently working on a realtime application running on a pcc with a
non dos kernel that needs to do some simple graphics. i'm not sure if
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.
i suspect i 'll implement the display controller as a server process that
handles graphics requests , queued on a mailbox , one at a time. if this
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then i believe that i can
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library.

being fairly new to the realtime systems world i may be overlooking something ,
what do you think \?

hello
i have posted to this newsgroup once before and recieved a
moderately helpful response on a couple of issues. this i appreciated very
much . i would however like to know why it is that ther is simply no
information out there on some subjects for the relativly novice graphics
programmer. the subjects are

1) how do you access the extra video memory on a video board. i
know somwhere there aresome standard video bios calls that allow you to
dothis. i have 1meg of memory on my board and according to all the books
and info i have read i am only (at maximum) using 256k of it. there is a
way to do this in standard vga cause i have seen vidoe paging (written in
assembly , which i do n't know) written into apps hat use mode 13h. to get
any speed at all you have to do this. how do i do it \?

2) the vesa standard. what gives here. i have read most of what
the net has to offer on vesa and as far as coding for vesa goes most of
the advice is cryptic at best. where do i get public domain info that will
tell me in mostly plain english how the vesa calls work.

my biggest gripe is about number 1. i have bought graphics books ,
i have asked graphics professors , i have hunted the net through both
gopher , and archie , i ahave asked apps programmers and it is like there is
some lock on this information. graphics programming books tell alot of
programmiing algorithm information , but they always fall short of telling
you how to really control the video bios. what are all the calls folks , i
know there are people out there that know how to doall tis stuff. where
are you , and why have n't you written a book yet \?

please help

hi ,

i 'd like to know if there is any system (cpu hd array framebuffer)
which can play and record hdtv quality moving picture in realtime.

hdtv has about 6mb frame , so recording playing moving picture will need
about 180mb sec bandwidth. i'm thinking to treat the raw data.. not
compressed.

finding a disk array that can do 180mb sec. will be difficult. the fastest
ones i know about are from maximum strategy (ibm also sells these). they
can attach hippi at up to 144 mb sec. (64 bit). for these kinds of data
rates you need more than scsi for connections. their latest model , the
raid 5 model gen 4 only does 90 mb sec. but i think this may be a
limitation only of the hippi channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. they are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. they
still marketed the older , faster model as of a few mongths ago.

you might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the hippi bus fully working at all times sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate.

interesting problem. tell us more if you can \?

i did n't want to mess with tga or rle. so i wrote the following script.
all you need is the very standard set of pbm utilities.

this script is a .pov to .jpg converter. just run it like this

pov2jpg 1280 1024 fred.pov

you will need to modify the path 's in the script to reflect where you put
povray and its include files. if you have a problem with disk space , you
can use named pipes instead of temporary files.

mac@utkvx.bitnet (richard j. mcdougald) writes
since there 's no (not really) such thing as a decent raster to vector
conversion program , this tracing technique is about it. simple stuff ,
like b w logos , etc. do pretty well , while more complicated stuff goes
haywire.

the first and only thing i 've ever tried to auto trace was a piece
of a uscg nautical chart using adobe illustrator 3.2. i wanted to get the
outline of the coast for western long island sound. i was simultaneously
suprised at how good a job it did and disappointed at how poorly it did. i
suspect what i gave it was a very difficult thing not only is the coastline
very irregular , but overlaid on the chart are numerous sets of gridlines
(not only lattitude and longitude , but loran grids as well). the most
common mistake it make was whenever the coastline was roughly parallel and
tangent to a grid line , it would take off following the gridline instead of
the coast. i think the best improvement would be some sort of interactive
algorithm that would let you step in and say no , dummy , you 're going the
wrong way .

steve reisberg , a friend of mine a few years back( ) , did his
doctoral work analysing electron micrographs of filimentous phage (virii).
a good chunk of the work was writing a program to take a digitized
micrograph and automatically trace the centerline of the virus particles.
this is essentially the same problem that illustrator tries to solve with
its auto trace tool.

in some respects the problem steve worked on was harder , since he
was trying to do quantitative analysis of the virus structure and finding a
good centerline was only the first step , but a step on which all future
analysis depended. however , in other respects , it was an easier problem
since the program could be written with a lot of knowledge about what the
virus particles were supposed to look like , and the analysis could be
restricted to those particles which happend to be relatively straight ,
clean , and well imaged you do n't always have that freedom auto tracing real
life images. in any case , it gave me some insight into just how difficult
this problem is to solve in the general case.

( ) steve is no longer with us. he and his wife disappeared while
on vacation in hawaii a couple of years after they graduated. their last
known location was hiking in a densely wooded in a mountainous area. while no
bodies were ever found , they are presumed to have been the victim of some
sort of fall or accident in the woods.

there are some tricks to installing atm to windows... install them first
to dos , then run the atm control panel to get them into windows.

the best reason for atm is that adobe is the standard. truetype is a
failed ms venture to undercut adobe when adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary. just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a truetype document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

although there are lots of pretty tt fonts floating around , they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
however , you can convert your tt fonts with fontmonger or some similar program
to atm fonts for high end stuff.

if you are using dot matrix for all your printing , you may have wasted

i'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. what i want to do is
the following

from a fast source , eg. a cdrom , several sound sources are read , each having
it 's own defined position and other attributes , eg. direction etc. given the
listeners position and direction , the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction. this
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it 's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source. (i think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear , and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle. this impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source. this impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.) additionally some
reflection , diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated , but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation , kinda like some radiosity algorithm.

have someone done this and or written articles on implementing such a system \?

a note on gamma correction and images

author graeme w. gill
graeme@labtam.oz.au

date 93 5 16


what is all this gamma stuff anyway \?


although it would be nice to think that an image is an image ,
there are a lot of complications. not only are there a whole bunch of
different image formats (gif , jpeg , tiff etc etc) , there is a whole
lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit
complicated. gamma is one of those things. if you 've ever downloaded
images from bbs or the net , you 've probably noticed (with most image
viewing programs) that some images look ok , some look too dark , and some
look too light. why is this \? you may ask. this , is gamma correction
(or the lack of it).

why do we need gamma correction at all \?


gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts (cathode
ray tubes the monitors usually used for viewing images). if you
have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer
image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of
the scene , then you have created a linear or un gamma corrected
image. this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate
the image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding
and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).
now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage
and feed it into a crt , you find that the crt does n't give you
an amount of light proportional to the voltage. the amount of light
coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage
something like this

light out voltage crt gamma

so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt , the image
will look much too dark. to fix this up you have to gamma correct
the image first. you need to do the opposite of what the crt
will do to the image , so that things cancel out , and you get
what you want. so you have to do this to your image

gamma corrected image image (1 crt gamma)

for most crts , the crt gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.

if that is all it is , why does it seem so complicated \?


the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.
also not all sources of images give you linear images (video cameras
or video signals in general). because of this , a lot of images
already have some gamma correction done to them , and you are
rarely sure how much. if you try and display one of those images
with a program that does gamma correction for you , the image gets
corrected twice and looks way to light. if you display one of those
images with a program that does n't do gamma correction , then it will
look vaguely right , but not perfect , because the gamma correction is
not exactly right for you particular crt.

whose fault is all this \?


it is really three things. one is all those display programs
out there that do n't do gamma correction properly. another is
that most image formats do n't specify a standard gamma , or
do n't have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.
the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma
correction is all about , and create a lot of images with varying
gamma 's.

at least two file formats do the right thing.
the utah graphics toolkit .rle format has a semi standard way of recording
the gamma of an image. the jfif file standard (that uses jpeg compression)
specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a
linear image but not everyone obeys the rules).

some image loaders (for instance xli an x11 image utility)
allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you
are using , but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to
view. other image viewers (eg. xv another x11 image program) and
utilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma
of an image , but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction
yourself , allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has ,
and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor.

note that xv 2.21 does n't provide an easy way of modifying the
gamma of an image. you need to adjust the r , g and b curves to the
appropriate gamma in the coledit controls. altering the intensity
in the hsv controls does n't do the right thing , as it fails to
take account of the effect gamma has on h and s. this tends
to give a tint to the image.

how can i figure out what my viewer does , or what gamma my screen has \?


the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg
(provided with xli distribution) , which is a jfif jpeg format file
containing two grayscale ramps. the ramps are chosen to look linear
to the human eye , one using continuous tones , and the other using
dithering. if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects
images , then the two ramps should look symmetrical , and the point
at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half
way from the top to the bottom. (to find this point it helps if
you move away a little from the screen , and de focus your eyes a
bit.)

if your viewer does n't do gamma correction , then left hand ramp will have
a long dark part and a short white part , and the point of equal brightness
will be above the center.

if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction
for a display , then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the
gamma , and decrease it if it is below the center. the value will usually be
around 2.2

with xli for instance , you can adjust the display gamma with the
dispgamma flag , and once you 've got it right , you can set the display gamma
environment variable in your .profile

how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is \?


this is the most tricky bit. as a general rule it seems that a lot of
true color (ie. 24 bit , .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of
1.0 (linear) , although there are many about that have some gamma
correction. it seems that the majority of pseudo color images
(ie. 8 bit images with color maps .gif etc.) are gamma corrected
to some degree or other.

if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will
look good , and gamma corrected images will look too light.

if your viewer does n't do gamma correction , then linear images will
look too dark , and gamma corrected images will ok.

why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing


one of the reason that many high quality formats (such as
video) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better
use of the storage medium. this is because the human
eye has a logarithmic response to light , and gamma correction
has a similar compression characteristic. this means images
could make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance) ,
if they used gamma correction. the implication though , is that
every time you want to do any image processing you should
convert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain
the same accuracy. since little popular software does this , and
none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard
gamma correction factor , it is difficult to justify gamma corrected
images at the popular level.

if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma ,
and if image manipulation software takes care to use
extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data ,
then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.

(i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance , has a
standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the
highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).

hi !

we have an old montage fr 1 35mm film recorder. when connected to a pc with
its processor card it can directly take hpgl , targa and lasergraphics language
files. 24 bit targa is quite ok for raster images , but conversion from
whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. this lasergraphics language
seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector based language
that can handle one million colors. it does some polygons too , and perhaps
something else \?

the question is , where can i find some information about this language \?
a ftp site , a book , a company address , .... \?

(ok , it would be nice to have a windows driver for it , but i'm not that
optimistic...)

thanks in advance for any help !

i was recently talking to a possible employer ( mine ! ) ) and he made a
reference to a 48 bit graphics computer image processing system. i seem to
remember it being called image or something akin to that. anyway , he claimed
it had 48 bit color a 12 bit alpha channel. that 's 60 bits of info what
could that possibly be for \? specifically the 48 bit color \? that 's 280
trillion colors , many more than the human eye can resolve. is this an
anti aliasing thing \? or is this just some magic number to make it work better
with a certain processor.

well 48 bit colour could be for improved resolution but 16 bits per channel
seems like a bit excessive. i have seen a paper that quoted 10 bits per channel
of 12 bits for computational precision. more than that would seem to be wasted.

perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to
represent the full range rgb is a cube so it is a compact encoding.

most likely however is that there are two separate 24 bit (8 bits per component)
frame buffers. this set up , called double buffering , allows a complex 3d picture
to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer (containing the previous
frame) is displayed. this makes for smoother animation.

(sadly , i have access to none of them. just a dec 5000 25. sigh.)

well hey if you want to brag about numbers , the 5000 range can take a pxg turbo
card with 96 bits per pixel. full double buffering (two 24 bit buffers) , a 24
bit z buffer and an extra 24 bit buffer for off screen image storage.

mind you the card costs more than your workstation.

i 've got this animation file with a .gl extension.
what is this \? are there anu ms dos or os 2 programs

the gl file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .pic or .clp files) , fonts , and a .txt file
that tells the grasp animation system how to display it. gl stands
for grasp library. there is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures faq.

there are freely distributable viewers for gl files , and they are usually
named grasprt \? .exe (replace the \? with a version digit or letter). most
gl files contain frames that are hardware specific to particular modes
of the cga , ega , or vga adapters on pcs. i think that there are some
copies of grasprt available by anonymous ftp (i know that i got one there

note this database is quite out of date , and not topologically structured.
if you need a standard for world cartographic data , wait for the
digital chart of the world. this 1 1m database has been produced from
the defense mapping agency 's oncs and will be available , together with
searching and viewing software , on a number of cd roms later this summer.

check into hanauma.stanford.edu and ucsd.edu (see ftp list above)
the cia database consists of coastlines , rivers and political boundaries
in the form of line strokes. also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
array of elevation data , containing one ieee floating point number for
every half degree longitude and latitude.

a program for decoding the database , mfil , can be found on the machine
pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
there 's another program , which reads a compressed cia data bank file and
builds a phigs hierachical structure. it uses a phigs extension known as
polyline sets for performance , but you can use regular polylines. ask
joe stewart joes@lpi.liant.com .
the raw data at stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.

i assume you have a general understanding of computer graphics. no \? then read
some of the books that the faq contains. for ray tracing , i would
suggest
an introduction to ray tracing , andrew glassner (ed.) , academic press

note that i have not read the book , but i feel that you ca n't be wrong
using his book. an errata list was posted in comp.graphics by eric haines

theoretical foundations for computer graphics and cad , ed. r.a.e.earnshaw ,
nato as , vol. f 40. , pp. 1039 1060. printed by springer verlag , 1988.

it contains code for a small , but fundamentally complete ray tracer.

15. where can i find the geometric data for the


a. teapot \?


displays on display column of ieee cg a jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the martin newell 's teapot. the article also has
the bezier patch model and a pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

ieee cg a sep '87 in jim blinn 's column jim blinn 's corner describes
an another way to model the teapot bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

the off and spd packages have these objects , so you 're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself. the off data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8 x4 triangles meshing per patch).
the spd package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. space shuttle \?


tolis lerios tolis@nova.stanford.edu has built a list of space shuttle
datafiles. here 's a summary (from his sci.space list)

model1
a modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful , i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3 vertex , 146 4 vertex , 7 5 vertex , 3 6 vertex).
payload doors non existent.
units unknown.

simon marshall (s.marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. he
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2
the newsgroup model , in off format. you can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub off objects shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu , pub graphics comp.graphics objects shuttle.data

model3
the triangles' model.

this model is stored in several files , each defining portions of the model.

greg henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy. he did
not mention any restriction on the model 's distribution.

model4
the nasa model.

the file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers ,
defining the offsets used by lockheed in their simulations

x offset y offset z offset

from then on , the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3 vertex , 2268 4 vertex , 33 5 vertex , 14 6 vertex ,
10 7 vertex , 8 8 vertex , 8 12 vertex , 2 13 vertex , 2 15 vertex ,
17 16 vertex , 2 17 vertex , 2 18 vertex , 3 19 vertex , 8 24 vertex).
payload doors closed.
units inches.

jon berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
proprietary info unknown

model5
the old shuttle model.

the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3 vertex , 41 4 vertex).
payload doors open.
units meters.

we have been using this model at star labs , stanford university , for
some years now. contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
scott williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.



16. image annotation software


a. touchup runs in sunview and is pretty good. it reads in
rasterfiles , but even if your image is n't normally stored
in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
rasterfile.

b. idraw (part of stanford 's interviews distribution) can handle some
image formats in addition to being a macdraw like tool. i'm not
sure exactly what they are.
you can ftp the idraw 's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. tgif is another macdraw like tool that can handle x11 bitmap (xbm)
and x11 pixmap (xpm) formats. if the image you have is in formats
other than xbm or xpm , you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
things like gif or even some macintosh formats to xpm.
tgif 's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
(version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. use the editimage facility of khoros (see below).
this is just one utility in the overall system you can essentially do all
your image processing and macdraw type graphics using this package.

e. you might be able to get by with pbmplus. pbmtext gives you text output
bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires sun hardware running openwindows 3.it 's a postscript based
graphical editor , and it 's available for anonymous ftp from internet host
eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). requires sun c 2.0 and
two other locally developed packages , the lxt library (an xlib based
toolkit) and a small c class library. all files (pub ice.tar.z ,
pub lxt.tar.z and pub ldgoc .tar.z) are available in compressed
tar format. pub ice.tar.z contains a readme that gives installation
instructions , as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
a statically linked compressed executable pub ice sun4.z for
sparc systems is also available for ftp.

all software is the property of columbia university and may not
be redistributed without permission.

ice means image composition environment and it 's an imaging tool that
allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
postscript annotations in wysiwyg fashion via x11 imaging
routines and news postscript rasterizing.

g. use imagemagick to annotate an image from your x server. pick the
position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen
color from a pull down menu. imagemagick can read and write many
of the more popular image formats. imagemagick is available as
export.lcs.mit.edu contrib imagemagick.tar.z or at your nearest
x11 archive.

wit

in a nutshell it 's a package of the same genre as avs , explorer , etc.
it seems more a image processing system than a generic scivi system (imho)
major elements are

a visual programming language , which automatically exploits the inherent
parallelism
a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

iconified libraries present a rich set of point , filter , io , transform ,
morphological , segmentation , and measurement operations.
a flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast , merge ,
synchronization , conditional , and sequencing control strategies.

wit delivers an object oriented , distributed , visual programming
environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
imaging problems. users can consolidate both software and hardware
developments within a complete cad like workspace by adding their
own operators (c functions) , objects (data structures) , and servers
(specialized hardware). wit runs on sun , hp9000 7xx , sgi and supports
datacube mv 20 200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real time.

idl sips

a lot of people are using idl with a package called sips. this was
developed at the university of colorado (boulder) by some people working
for alex goetz. you might try contacting them if you already have idl
or would be willing to buy it. it 's a few thousand dollars (american) i
expect for idl and the other should be free. those are the general
purpose packages i 've heard of , besides what terramar has.
sips was written for aviris imagery. i'm not sure how general purpose
it is. you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask. i
have another piece of software (pcw) that does pc and walsh
transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
modification (you can compute an image using selected components). i 've
used it on 70 megabyte aviris images without problems , but for the best
speed you need an external dsp card. it will work without it , but large
images take quite a while (50 70 times as long) to process. that 's a
freebie if you want it

my favorite is idl (interactive data language) from research systems ,
inc. idl is in my opinion , much better and infinitely easier. its
programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like. it
handles the number crunching very well , also. personally , i like doing
the number crunching with idl on the vax (or mathematica , igor , or even
excel on the mac if it 's not too hairy) , then bringing it over to nih
image for the imaging part. i have yet to encounter any situation which
that combination could n't handle , and the speed and ease of use
(compared to iraf) was incredible. by the way , it 's mostly astronomical
image processing which i 've been doing. this means image enhancement ,
cleaning up bad lines pixels , and some other traditional image
processing routines. then , for example , taking a graph of intensity
versus position along a line i choose with the mouse , then doing a curve
fit to that line (which i might do like in kaleidagraph.)

for idl call research systems , for pv wave call precision visuals and
for sips call university of colorado @ boulder . from what i can
understand , you can get packaged programs from research systems , though

svlib fvs

svlib is an x windows widget set based on the osf (open software
foundation) motif widget set. svlib widgets are macro widgets
comprising lower level motif widgets such as buttons , scrollbars ,
menus , and drawing areas. it is designed to address the reusability
of 2d visualization routines and each widget in the library is an
encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap
manipulation , image display , and contour plotting. it is targetted
to run on unix workstations supporting osf motif. currently , only
color monitors are supported. since svlib is a collection of widgets
developed in the same spirit as the osf motif user interface widget
set , it integrates seamlessly with the motif widgets. programmers
using svlib widgets see the same interface and design as other
motif widgets.

fvs is a visualization software for computational fluid dynamics (cfd)
simulations. fvs is designed to accept data generated from these
simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
data graphically.
fvs accepts three dimensional multi block data recorded in ncsa hdf format.

gvlware distribution
bob an interactive volume renderer for the sgi
raz a disk based movie player for the sgi
icol motif color editor


the army high performance computing research center (ahpcrc) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2d and 3d
data sets. in the graphics and visualization lab (gvl) we are using
these tools along side standard packages , such as sgi explorer and the
utah raster toolkit , to render 3d volumes and create digital movies.
a couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called gvlware .

gvlware , currently consisting of bob , raz and icol , is now available
via ftp. the most interesting program is probably bob , an interactive
volume renderer for the sgi. raz streams raster images from disk to
an sgi screen , enabling movies larger than memory to be played. icol
is a color map editor that works with bob and raz. source and
pre built binaries for irix 4.0.5 are included.

to acquire gvlware , anonymous ftp to
machine ftp.arc.umn.edu
file pub gvl.tar.z

to use gvlware
mkdir gvl cd gvl
zcat gvl.tar.z tar xvf

some bob features
motif interface , sgi gl rendering
renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a vgx
alpha compositing and maximum value rendering , in perspective
(only maximum value rendering on personal iris)
data must be a brick of bytes , on a regularly spaced grid
animation , subvolumes , subsampling , stereo

some raz features
motif interface , sgi gl rendering
loads files to a raw disk partition , then streams to screen
(requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
script interface available for movie sequences
can stream from memory , like ncsa ximage

some icol features
motif interface
easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
rgb , hsv and yuv color spaces , multiple file formats
communicates changes automatically to bob and raz
has been tested on sgi , sun , dec and cray systems

btw bob brick of bytes
icol interpolated color

18. molecular visualization stuff


based on a list from cristy@dupont.com cristy , which asked for
systems for displaying molecular dynamics , md for short

flex

it is a public domain package written by michael pique , at the scripps
research institute , la jolla , ca. flex is stored as a compressed ,
tar'ed archive (about 3.4mb) at perutz.scripps.edu 137.131.152.27 , in
pub flex. it displays molecular models and md trajectories.

macmolecule

(for macintosh). i searched with archie , and the most
promising place is sumex aim.stanford.edu (info mac app , and
info mac art qt for a demo)

md display

runs on sgi machines. call terry lybrand (lybrand@milton.u.washington.edu).

xtalview

it is a crystallography package that does visualize molecules and much more.
it uses the xview toolkit.
call duncan mcree dem@scripps.edu

landman@hal.physics.wayne.edu

i am writing my own visualization code right now. i look at md output
(a specific format , easy to alter for the subroutine) on pc 's. my
program has hooks into gks. if your friend has access to phigs for x
(pex) and fortran bindings , i would be happy to share my evolving code
(free of charge). right now it can display supercells of up to 65
atoms (easy to change) , and up to 100 time steps , drawing nearest
neighbor bonds between 2 defining nn radii. it works acceptably fast
on a 10mhz 286.

icsg0001@caesar.cs.montana.edu

i did a project on molecular visualization for my master 's thesis , using
unix x11 motif which generates a simple point and space filling model.

i'm working on molecular dynamic too. a friend of mine and i have

developed a program to display an md run dynamically on silicon
graphics. we are working to improve it , but it does n't work under x ,
we are using the graphi. lib. of the silicon gr. because they are much
faster then x. when we 'll end it we 'll post on the news info about
where to get it with ftp. (will be free software).

xball v2.0

mindtool

it runs under sunview , and requires a fortran compiler and sun 's cgi
libraries. mindtool is a tool provided for the interactive graphic
manipulation of molecules and atoms. currently , up to 10 , 000
atoms may be input.
available via anonymous ftp , at rani.chem.yale.edu , directory

i would also suggest looking at least in sgi 's applications directory.
it contains many more packages nfotis



19. gis (geographical information systems software)


grass

(geographic resource analysis support system) of the us army
construction engineering research lab (cerl). it is a popular geographic and
remote sensing image processing package. many may think of grass as a
geographic information system rather than an image processing package ,
although it is reported to have significant image processing
capabilities.

feature descriptions

i use grass because it 's public domain and can be obtained through the
internet for free. grass runs in unix and is written in c. the source
code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass
integration. you then compile the source code for your machine , using
scripts provided with grass. i would recommend grass for someone who
already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. grass is not very
user friendly , compared to macintosh software. a first review of
overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
image enhancement routines (fft). kelly maurice at vexcel corp. in
boulder , co is a primary user of grass . this gentleman has used the
grass software and developed multi spectral (238 bands \? \? ) volumetric
rendering , full color , on suns and stardents. it was a really effective
interface. vexcel corp. currently has a contract to map part of venus
and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps. you can call them
at (303) 444 0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

host configuration requirements

if you are willing to run a ux you could install grass on a macintosh
which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
satellite data. grass is public domain , and can run on a high end pc
under unix. it is raster based , has some image processing capability ,
and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
environment). i have used grass v.3 on a sun workstation and found it
easy to use. it is best , of course , for data that are well represented
in raster (grid cell) form.

availability

cerl 's office of grass integration (ogi) maintains an ftp server
moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

mail regarding this site should be addressed to
grass ftp admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

this location will be the new canonical source for grass software , as
well as bug fixes , contributed sources , documentation , and other files.
this ftp server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
tar archiving of files. a feature attraction of the server is john
parks' grass tutorial. because the manual is still in beta test stage ,
john requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
it and mail him comments corrections. the ogi is not currently
maintaining this document , so all correspondence about it should be
directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

support

listserv mailing lists

grassu list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for grass users application level
questions , support concerns , miscellaneous questions , etc) send

microstation imager

intergraph (based in huntsville alabama) sells a wide range of gis
software hardware. microstation is a base graphics package that imager
sits on top of. imager is basically an image processing package with a
heavy gis remote sensing flavor.

feature description

basic geometry manipulations flip , mirror , rotate , generalized affine.
rectification affine , 2nd , 3rd , 4th and 5th order models as well as a
projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
rgb to ihs and ihs to rgb conversion. principal component analysis.
classification k means and isodata. fourier xforms forward , filtering
and reverse. filters high pass , low pass , edge enhancing , median ,
generic. complex histogram contrast control. layer controller manages
up to 64 images at a time user can extract single bands from a 3 band
image or create color images by combining various individual bands , etc.

the package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
very large images) and there is all kinds of other software available
for gis applications.
host configuration requirements

it runs on intergraph workstations (a unix machine similar to a sun)
though there were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment.

pci

a company called pci , inc. , out of richmond hill , ontario , canada , makes
an array of software utilities for processing , manipulation , and use of
remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard
formats lgsowg , bsq , landsat , and a couple of others whose titles i
forget. the software is available in versions for ms dos , unix
workstations (among them hp , sun , and ibm) , and vms , and quite possibly
other platforms by now. i use the vms version.

the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of
utilities , grouped by function but all operating on a common pci
database disk file. the tape i o package is a set of utility
programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape
formats into , or write those formats out from , the pci database file
this is the only package i use or know much about. other packages can
display data from the pci database to one or another of several
pci supported third party color displays , output numeric or bitmap
representation of image data to an attached printer , e.g. an epson type
dot matrix graphics printer. you might be more spe cifically
interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and
fourier analysis , equalization , user specified operations (e.g.
multiply channel 1 by 3 , add channel 2 , and store as channel 5 ) , and
god only knows what all else there 's a lot. i do n't have and do n't
use these , so ca n't say much about them you only buy the packages your
particular application interest calls for.

each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters , read from
a common parameter file which must be (in vms anyway) in your default
directory. some utilities will share parameters and use the same
parameter for a different purpose , so it can get a bit confusing setting
up a series of operations. the standard pci environment contains a
scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic , but which allows you to
automate the process of setting up parameters for a common , complicated ,
lengthy or difficult series of utility executions. (in vms i can also
invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure.) there 's
also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
language programs which can interface with (read from write to) the pci
data structures (database file , parameter file).

the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images , but
requires such a level of operator expertise that , once you reach the
level where you can handle r s images , you can figure out ways to handle
a few other things as well. for instance , the tape i o package offers a
utility for reading headerless multi band (what adobe photoshop on the
macintosh calls raw ) data from tape , in a number of different
interleave orders. this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
graphic arts industry 's ct2t format , would probably (i have n't tried)
handle targa , and so on. above all , however , you have to know what
you're doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start
over. it 's worth noting that the pci database file is designed to
contain not only raster (image) data , but vectors (for overlaying map
information entered via digitizing table) , land use , and all manner of
other information (i observe that a remote sensing image tape often
contains all manner of information about the spectral bands , latitude ,
longitude , time , date , etc. of the original satellite pass all of this
can go into the pci database ).

i believe that on workstations the built in display is used. on vax
systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific
third party display systems (the name gould deanza seems to come to
mind). one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would
display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q (q bus
24 bit directcolor) display subsystem. pci software could be overkill
in your case it seems designed for the very high end
applications users , i.e. those for whom a mac pc largely does n't suffice
(although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time). it 's
probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada , a country which
does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe
the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these
areas.

spam (spectral analysis manager)

back in 1985 jpl developed something called spam (spectral analysis
manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time. that was designed
for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery (byte data , 256 pixels
across by 512 lines by 256 bands) a modified version has since
been developed for aviris (airborne visual and infrared imaging
spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

spam does none of these things (rectification , classification , pc and
ihs transformations , filtering , contrast enhancement , overlays).
actually , it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
(stretching). spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

the original spam uses x or sunview to display. the aviris version may
require vicar , an executive based on tae , and may also require a frame
buffer. i can refer you to people if you 're interested. pcw requires x
for display.

hello ,
i have some problem in converting tga file(generated by povray) to

if i use xloadimage getx11 , something is wrong.

error messages are ,

i know that i need to install ppmtorle and tgatoppm , but i do not spend
time to install them. even i do not want to generate .rgb from povray
and then convert them to rle , if possible.(.rgb to rle works , but
it will mess up my directory with so many files , and it needs 2 more
steps to finally convert to rle file. say cat rawtorle rleflip )
does any body out there have same experience problems \?

moved on a bit

i wrote something about making color modifications quickly
with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.
this makes sense , because the main use of xv is only viewing images.

doing many changes to image , we should keep all modifications
in a buffer and then before making the operations to 24bit image ,
we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations.

think about what you are saying here. the 24 bit image is quantised down to 8
bits so many 'similar' colours are mapped onto a single palette colour. this
colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways. you then want to apply these
modifications back to the 24 bit file , so you have to find which colours mapped
to this one palette colour. ok you could do this by copying the 24 bit file to a
32 bit file and using the extra 8 bits to hold the index entry.
having done this , you need to do something to them ... what , exactly \?

apply the difference in rgb between the original and modified palette entry to
each colour in the group \? this could generate colours with rgb outside the range
0...255. it would also lead to discontinuities when different parts of a smooth
colour gradient mapped to several different palette entries.

you could interpolate from full modification to no modification depending how
far each colour was from the palette entry. however i suspect this would look
rather odd.

so in summary , what i said in my previous posting still holds

how would you suggest doing colour editing on a 24 bit file \? how
would you group 'related' colours to edit them together \? only global
changes could be done unless the software were very different and
much more complicated.

if you want to do colour editing on a 24 bit image , you need much
more powerfull software which is readily available commercially.

in other words , to edit a 24 bit file you need software built for the job.
tacking mods onto xv is going to create more problems than it solves.

as to the other bits you seemed to be claiming that there were bugs in xv. if
that was not what you meant , then

(you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many
places so far.)

yes , i probably did. i found that the collected digest format of your posting
made it a little difficult to understand precisely what your point was. sorry
if i misunderstood.

you also missed what is (were) wrong with xv. however , i did wrote it.

yes again. what is (was \? ) wrong with xv \?

an automatic mail handler at brown university allows users of computer
graphics principles and practice , by foley , van dam , feiner , and
hughes , to obtain text errata and information on distribution of the
software packages described in the book. also , users can send the
authors feedback , to report text errors and software bugs , make
suggestions , and submit exercises. to receive information describing
how you can use the mail handler , simply mail graphtext@cs.brown.edu
and put the word help in the subject line. use the subject line
software distribution to receive information specifically concerning
the software packages srgp and sphigs.

errata for an introduction to ray tracing is available on
wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics graphics books introtort.errata.

errata for digital image warping is in the same directory as
digital image warping.errata .

all c code from the graphics gems series is available via anonymous ftp
from princeton.edu. look in the directory pub graphics graphicsgems for
the various volumes (gems , gemsii , gemsiii) , and get the readme file first.

errata to graphics gems and graphics gems ii is available on
wuarchive.wustl.edu in graphics graphics books.

a list of computer graphics , computational geometry and image processing
journals is available from juhana kouhia , jk87377@cs.tut.fi.


2) drawing three dimensional objects on a two dimensional screen.

the simple answer is , you divide by the depth. for a more verbose
explanation , see any of the above references , starting with

the foley van dam feiner hughes computer graphics book is certainly
a good start. chapter 6 is viewing in 3d , then read chapter 15 ,
visible surface determination . for more information go to chapter 16 for
shading , chapter 19 for clipping , and branch out from there.


3) quantizing 24 bit images down to 8 bits.

find a copy of color image quantization for frame buffer display by
paul heckbert , siggraph '82 proceedings , page 297. there are other
algorithms , but this one works well and is fairly simple. implementations
are included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).

a variant method is described in graphics gems , p. 287 293. note that
the code from the graphics gems series is all available from an ftp site ,
as described above.

check out john bradley 's diversity algorithm , which is incorporated into
the xv package and described in the back of the manual.

the imagemagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another
quantizing algorithm which is presented as doing a better job than the
other algorithms , but slower .

there 's also an implementation of

wan , wong , and prusinkiewicz , an algorithm for multidimensional data
clustering , transactions on mathematical software , vol. 14 2 (june , 1988) ,
pp. 153 162.

avialable as princeton.edu pub graphics colorquant.shar. this code ,
in modified form , appears in the utah raster toolkit as well.


4) converting color into grayscale.

the ntsc formula is

luminosity .299 red .587 green .114 blue


5) quantizing grayscale to black white.

the only reference you need for this stuff is

digital halftoning , robert ulichney , mit press 1987 , isbn 0 262 21009 6

but before you go off and start coding , check out the image manipulation
software mentioned in item 7 below. all of the packages mentioned can do
some form of gray to b w conversion.


6) rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.

the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source
image , transform each coordinate , and copy the pixel to the destination.
this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination. instead ,
loop over the pixels in the destination image , apply the reverse
transformation to the coordinates , and copy that pixel from the source.
this method is quite general , and can be used for any one to one
2 d mapping , not just rotation. you can add anti aliasing by doing
sub pixel sampling.

however , there is a much faster method , with antialising included ,
which involves doing three shear operations. the method was originally
created for the im raster toolkit (see below) an implementation is
also present in pbmplus. reference a fast algorithm for raster
rotation , by alan paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) graphics
interface '86 (vancouver). an article on the im toolkit appears in
the same journal. an updated version of the rotation paper appears
in graphics gems (see section 1 ) under the original title.


7) free image manipulation software.

there are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to
another , doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling , plus
the above mentioned 24 8 , color gray , gray b w conversions.
here are pointers to some of them

xv by john bradley. x based image display , manipulation , and format
conversion package. xv displays many image formats and permits editing
of gif files , among others. the program was updated 5 92 see the file

in both speed and in the number of formats supported. available in the
same places as xloadimage (contrib tape , comp.sources.x archives).

tiff software , by sam leffler sam@okeeffe.berkeley.edu . nice
portable library for reading and writing tiff files , plus a few tools
for manipulating them and reading other formats. available via ftp as

xtiff , an x11 tool for viewing a tiff file. it was written to handle
as many different kinds of tiff files as possible while remaining
simple , portable and efficient. xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes. it is
distributed as part of sam leffler 's libtiff package and it is also

please do not post or mail messages saying i ca n't ftp , could someone
mail this to me \? there are a number of automated mail servers that will
send you things like this in response to a message. see item 13 below for
details on some.

also , the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion
of software like this. you may find useful information there.


8) format documents for tiff , iff , biff , nff , off , fits , etc.

you almost certainly do n't need these. read the above item 7 on free
image manipulation software. get one or more of these packages and
look through them. chances are excellent that the image converter you
were going to write is already there. but if you still want one of the
format documents , many such files are available by anonymous ftp from
zamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub graphics.formats.

these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.
this archive includes pixel formats , and two and three dimensional object
formats. the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment , as mark
hall foo@cs.rice.edu will apparently no longer be maintaining it.

a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained
by quincey koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu). the latest version exists at
ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in misc file.formats graphics.formats. apparently ,
neither of these is complete , you might want to check both.

fits stands for flexible image transport system. it 's a file format most
often used in astronomy. despite the name , it can contain not only images
but other things as well. there is a regular monthly fits basics and
information posting on sci.astro.fits read it if you want to know more.



9) converting between vector formats.

a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript , or macdraw
to cgm , or whatever. it is important to understand that this is a very
different problem from the image format conversions in item 7. converting
one image format to another is a fairly easy problem , since once you
get past all the file header junk , a pixel is a pixel the basic objects
are the same for all image formats. this is not so for vector formats.
the basic objects circles , ellipses , drop shadowed pattern filled
round cornered rectangles , etc. vary from one format to another.
except in extremely restricted cases , it is simply not possible to do
a one to one conversion between vector formats.

there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp.psc.edu. the
contributor states that it runs on unix , ms windows , and possibly the mac.
a better , more specific blurb would be most welcome.

on the other hand , it is quite possible to do a close approximation ,
rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.
as far as i know , no one has put together a general toolkit of such
converters , but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been
posted to comp.sources.misc. check the index on your nearest archive
site.

a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format
to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format , or hpgl to
x11 bitmap. for example , some of the commercial postscript clones for
pc 's allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer. also ,
the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun 's x11 news can
be used to render to a file if you 're clever. but in general , the
answer is no. however , if someone were to put together a vector to
vector conversion toolkit , adding a vector to raster converter would be
trivial.

gnu ghostscript (from the fsf current version 2.5.2) includes
drivers for both ppm and gif format files , thus it can be used as
a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter. (it implements
essentially all of postscript level 1 and alot of display postscript
and level 2).


10) how to get pixar films.

the various john lasseter pixar computer animated shorts are available
on video tape. you can order them from direct cinema limited

prices and availability. or , just write to

direct cinema limited
1749 14th street
santa monica , ca 90404 4342

allan braunsdorf has this to say

at siggraph they were selling a tape with all four shorts
for 25. that was a sale price. you can get it for slightly
more than that normally. ( 35 maybe.) i believe it 's
available from renderman retail (at pixar 's address).

pixar
1001 west cutting blvd.
richmond , ca. 94804
(510) 236 4000
(510) 236 0388 (fax)

you can obtain a video directly from pixar which contains luxo , jr. , red 's
dream , tin toy and knicknack for 25.00 , plus 2.50 for shipping. they
will take your order over the phone or via fax with a major credit card. i
ordered mine just last week and received it several days later. do n't expect
to be able to rent a copy from your local video store. according to the license
agreement printed on the back cover of the case , it cannot be rented.


11) how do i draw a circle as a bezier (or b spline) curve \?

the short answer is , you ca n't. unless you use a rational spline you
can only approximate a circle. the approximation may look acceptable ,
but it is sensitive to scale. magnify the scale and the error of
approximation magnifies. deviations from circularity that were not
visible in the small can become glaring in the large. if you want to
do the job right , consult the article

a menagerie of rational b spline circles
by leslie piegl and wayne tiller
in ieee computer graphics and applications , volume 9 , number 9 ,
september , 1989 , pages 48 56.

for rough , non rational approximations , consult the book

computational geometry for design and manufacture
by i. d. faux and m. j. pratt ,
ellis horwood publishers , halsted press , john wiley 1980.

for the best known non rational approximations , consult the article

good approximation of circles by curvature continuous bezier curves
by tor dokken , morten daehlen , tom lyche , and knut morken
in computer aided geometric design , volume 7 , numbers 1 4 (combined) ,
june , 1990 , pages 33 41 elsevier science publishers (north holland)


12) how to order standards documents.

the american national standards institute sells ansi standards , and also
iso (international) standards. their sales office is at 1 212 642 4900 ,
mailing address is 1430 broadway , ny ny 10018. it helps if you have the
complete name and number.

some useful numbers to know

cgm (computer graphics metafile) is iso 8632 4 (1987). gks (graphical
kernel system) is ansi x3.124 1985. phigs (programmer 's hierarchical
interactive graphics system) is ansi x3.144 1988. iges is asme ansi
y14.26m 1987. language bindings are often separate but related numbers
for example , the gks fortran binding is x3.124.1 1985.

standards in progress are made available at key milestones to solicit
comments from the graphical public (this includes you ! ). ansi can let
you know where to order them most are available from global engineering
at 1 800 854 7179.


13) how to ftp by email.

there are a number of sites that archive the usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system. you send a message
to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix fbm ,
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

in addition , there is at least one ftp by mail server. send mail to
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying help and it will tell you how to use
it. note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.


14) how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.

consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to
infinity. if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way ,
the point is within the polygon. if the ray crosses an even number of
edges , the point is either outside the polygon , or within an interior
hole formed from intersecting polygon edges. this idea is known in
the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines' article in
glassner 's ray tracing book (above) for more information , including
treatment of special cases.

another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all
the vertices on the polygon. if the sum is 2 pi , the point is inside ,
if the sum is 0 the point is outside. however , this method is about an
order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the
trigonometric functions is usually quite costly.

code for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in
the ray tracing news , vol. 5 , no. 3 , available from princeton.edu
pub graphics rtnews rtnv5n3.z.


15) how to tessellate a sphere.

one simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles. the
base of the recursion is an octahedron , and then each level divides
each triangle into four smaller ones. jon leech leech@cs.unc.edu
has posted a nice routine called sphere.c that generates the coordinates.
it 's available for ftp on ftp.ee.lbl.gov and princeton.edu.

16) specific references on ray tracing and global illumination.

rick speer maintains a cross indexed ray tracing bibliography

highlights of this edition

i) more than 500 citations spanning the period from 1968 through
november '91

international and ausgraph proceedings through december , '91
iii) all citations keyworded for easy lookup
iv) cross indices by keyword and author
v) glossary of the 119 keywords used.

the bib is in the form of a postscript file. the printout is 41 pages long.
below is a list of ftp sites and the dirs that contain the file. it 's named
speer.raytrace.bib.ps.z and is compressed at most sites

site dir

eric haines (erich@eye.com) maintains ray tracing and radiosity global
illumination bibliographies. these are in refer format , and so can be
searched electronically (a simple awk script to search for keywords is
included with each). the bibliographies are available at most of the
sites listed above , and the most current versions are maintained at
princeton.edu pub graphics papers as raybib. and radbib. .

tom wilson (wilson@cs.ucf.edu) has collected over 300 abstracts from ray
tracing related research papers and books. the information is essentially
in plaintext , and latex and troff formatting programs are included. this
collection is available at most of the sites above as rtabs. .

17) siggraph information online

from steve cunningham and ralph orlick

acm siggraph announces its online information site at siggraph.org
(128.248.245.250). this site now provides siggraph information via both
anonymous ftp and an electronic mail archive server.

the anonymous ftp service is very standard , and the ftp directory includes
both conference and publications subdirectories.

to retrieve information by electronic mail , send mail to
archive server@siggraph.org
and in the subject or the body of the message include the message send
followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. a good place to start is with
the command
send index
which will give you an up to date list of available information.


18) siggraph panels proceedings available

from steve cunningham and bob judd

acm siggraph announces the availability of the siggraph '91 panels proceedings
at the siggraph.org site (128.248.245.250). the proceedings are available
in three formats
text (ascii)
rtf (rich text format , suitable for many word processors)
word (ms word for the macintosh)
they may be retrieved from siggraph.org in two ways

(1) by anonymous ftp
change to one of the directories
publications s91 panels proceedings text rtf word
the text and rtf files may be downloaded in ascii mode , while the word
files are stored in macbinary format and must be downloaded in binary
mode.

each directory contains a table of contents file (toc) that describes the
contents of each panel file.

(2) by electronic mail
send mail to
archive server@siggraph.org
you can retrieve either the text or rtf files. we suggest that you
first retrieve the index files by putting one of the messages
send panel91 txt index
send panel91 rtf index
in the subject or body of the message. you will get the necessary
information to retrieve the actual transcript files.


19) graphics mailing lists

there are a variety of graphics related mailing list out there , each
covering either a single product or a single topic. i have been an
active participant in one of these for some time now , and find the
focus and expertise which can be brought to bear on an isolated topic
to be nothing short of amazing.

please send me the appropriate information if you have any others you
would like to see added.

questions about this book may be sent to gbook@iecc.cambridge.ma.us.


21) what about gif \?

gif stands for graphics interchange format. it is portable and usable upon
a wide variety of platforms. it is quite limited in some ways (yes , the
keeper of the faq has some opinions after all) , and in fact , i do n't like
it much. however , it looks to me like the most frequently asked question
which was not previously covered in this list. the following is a list
of newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about gif.

subject alt.binaries.pictures faq general info
subject alt.binaries.pictures faq os specific info
newsgroups alt.binaries.pictures.d , alt.binaries.pictures.misc ,
alt.binaries.pictures.utilities , alt.binaries.pictures.fractals ,

available in the indicated usenet newsgroup(s) , or via anonymous ftp from
pit manager.mit.edu in the files

pub usenet news.answers pictures faq part1
pub usenet news.answers pictures faq part2

also available from mail server@pit manager.mit.edu by sending a mail
message containing any or all of

send usenet news.answers pictures faq part1
send usenet news.answers pictures faq part2

send a message containing help to get general information about the
mail server.

also , you could check out the resources described in sections 7 , 8 , and
20 above for more information.


22) what is morphing \?

warping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new
location. morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.
valerie hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and
morphing. this is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au
in the directory pub graphics bibliography morph. there are three files

morph intro.ps.z (postscript version , many pictures 1.5m)
morph intro.txt.z (text version)
m responses.z (responses to morphing questions)

the files are compressed , so you must use binary transfer and
uncompress them afterwards.


23) how to ray trace height fields

height fields are a special case in ray tracing. they have a number of uses ,
such as terrain rendering , and some optimization is possible. thus , they
get their own faq section. note that further references can no doubt be
located via the ray tracing bibs in section 16 above.

the following paper seems to be the definitive reference

f. kenton musgrave
grid tracing fast ray tracing for height fields
july , 1988
musg88.ps.z

this is available as research report yaleu dcs rr 639 from yale university ,
it 's also in the siggraph '91 fractal modeling in 3d computer graphics and
imaging course notes , and (best of all) it 's available on the net

nic.funet.fi pub sci papers musg88.ps.z

24) how to find the area of a 3d polygon

the area of a triangle is given by (in c notation) ,

area 0.5 ( ( x 0 y 1 ) ( x 1 y 2 ) ( x 2 y 0 )
( x 1 y 0 ) ( x 2 y 1 ) ( x 0 y 2 ) )

and the area of a planar polygon is given by

area 0.0

for ( i 0 i n 1 i )
area ( x i y i 1 ) ( x i 1 y i )
area ( x n 1 y 0 ) ( x 0 y n 1 )
area 2.0

if the area is a negative number , the polygon or triangle is
clockwise , if positive , it is counterclockwise.

from ronald golman 's gem (in graphics gems ii see section 1 above) , area
of planar polygons and volume of polyhedra

the area of a polygon p0 , p1 , p2 , ... pn , not in the x y plane , is
given by

area(polygon) 1 2 n . sigma pk x pk 1

where n is the unit vector normal to the plane and p is a polygonal
vertex. the . represents the dot product operator and the x
represents the cross product operator. sigma represents the summation
operator. represents the absolute value operator. pn 1 is equal
to p0.


25) how to join acm siggraph

probably the easiest way to join acm siggraph is to trot over to your

i'm planning on writing several classes to build a raytracing radiosity library
on top of , and i'm wondering if anythink like this is freely available on the
net before i go to it. what i need is classes like rays , vectors , colors ,
shaders , surfaces , media , primitives , worlds (containing primitives) and
views images.

please post or mail.

where did the hacker ethic go \?

we hackers of the 70 's and 80' are now comfortably employed
and supporting families. the next generation takes
the radical lead now. do n't look for radicalism among us
old ones we 're gone...

perhaps all of us hackers have become (ick) professionals \? i have noticed
my and my associates progression from hackers to computer professionals.
it is rather distasteful. it occurs when a series of things happen

1) one 's ego outgrows one 's talent knowledge
2) one 's financial situation takes precedence
3) a change in priorities (esp. family) possibly leading to 2)
4) the hacker 's attitude makes the shift from fun to work
5) one 's vocation burns away the creativity needed for the hobby

or the biggest killer (imo)

6) one 's dreams are (sadly) shattered on the hard rocks of society 's
version of reality. without the dream the motivation dies , without
the motivation the effort seems useless.

another set of problems stems from our children. while most of us remember
when there were several completely different computer systems , our children
are growing up with just a few choices (msdos mac amiga) and do not enjoy
the diversity we did. i remember the great computer fallout of the early
eighties vividly as i was forced to stop using skills developed for systems
that were now dead. the diversity of systems before then allowed for widely
divergent paradigms. that period forced hackers to continually learn new
systems in the attempt to keep up. not to mention that if a program was
needed we were forced (in most situations) to write it ourselves as a
commercial offering was just not available. now our children are being
taught the user mentality. as the number of us old timers dwindle we are
not being replaced by the next generation.

this file is crossposted to comp.graphics , comp.answers and news.answers ,
so if you ca n't locate it in comp.graphics , you 're advised to search in
comp.answers or news.answers
(the latter groups usually are archived in your site. contact your sysadmin
for more info).

these 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3 4 times a month and are kept in
many places (see below)



many faqs , including this one , are available on the archive site
pit manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) 18.172.1.27 in the directory
pub usenet news.answers. the name under which a faq is archived appears
in the archive name line at the top of the article.

there 's a mail server on that machine. you send a e mail message to
mail server@pit manager.mit.edu containing help in the subject field



the inria graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the
subject 4 mail servers )



the resource listing is accesible through wais in the machine
enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics resources list.
it 's got a digest type line before every numbered item for purposes of
indexing.



another place that monitors the listing is the maasinfo files.
for more info contact robert e. maas rem@btr.com



yet another place to search for faqs in general is the switch
(swiss academic and research network) system in switzerland

interactive
telnet nic.switch.ch 130.59.1.40 , login as info . move to the
info service usenet periodic postings directory. search in the

1. archie


the archie is a service system to locate ftp places for
requested files. it 's appreciated that you will use archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

archie servers
archie.au or 139.130.4.6 (aussie nz)
archie.funet.fi or 128.214.6.100 (finland eur.)
archie.th darmstadt.de or 130.83.128.111 (ger.)
cs.huji.ac.il or 132.65.6.5 (israel)
archie.kuis.kyoto u.ac.jp or 130.54.20.1 (japan)
archie.sogang.ac.kr or 163.239.1.11 (korea)
archie.ncu.edu.tw or telnet 140.115.19.24 (twn)
archie.doc.ic.ac.uk or 146.169.3.7 (uk ireland)
archie.sura.net or 128.167.254.179 (usa md )
archie.unl.edu (password archie1) (usa ne )
archie.ans.net or 147.225.1.2 (usa ny )
archie.rutgers.edu or 128.6.18.15 (usa nj )
archie.nz or 130.195.9.4 (new zealand)

connect to archie server with telnet and type archie as username.
to get help type 'help'.
you can get 'xarchie' or 'archie' , which are clients that call archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'xarchie' is on the x11.r5 contrib tape , and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc ,
vol. 27.

to get information on how to use archie via e mail , send mail with
subject help to archie account at any of above sites.

(note to janet pss users the united kingdom archie site is
accessible on the janet host doc.ic.ac.uk 000005102000 .
connect to it and specify archie as the host name and archie as
the username.)



2. notes

(excerpted from the faq article)

please do not post or mail messages saying i ca n't ftp , could
someone mail this to me \? there are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

there are a number of sites that archive the usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system. you send a message
to an automated server saying something like send comp.sources.unix fbm ,
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

4. mail servers and graphics oriented bbses


please check first with the ftp places above , with archie 's help.
do n't overuse mail servers.

there are some troubles with wrong return addresses. many of these
mail servers have a command like
path a valid return e mail address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

dec 's ftpmail

send a one line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com without a subject field ,
and having a line containing the word 'help'.
you should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
must follow in order to get the files you want.

note that the reply or answer command in your mailer will not work
for this message or any other mail you receive from ftpmail. to send
requests to ftpmail , send an original mail message , not a reply.
complaints should be sent to the ftpmail request@uucp gw 2.pa.dec.com
address rather than to postmaster , since decwrl 's postmaster is not
responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

bitftp

for bitnet sites only , there 's bitftp@pucc.
send a one line 'help' message to this address for more info.

procedural database generators in the spd package , and many objects
floating in various ftp sites. there 's also a previewer written in
hp starbase from e.haines. also there 's one written in vogle , so you can
use any of the devices vogle can output on.
(check in sites carrying vogle , like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

off

object file format , from dec 's randy rost (rost@kpc.com).
the object archive server seems to be mothballed. in a future version ,
i 'll remove the ref. to it nfotis

available also through their mail server. to obtain help about using this
service , send a message with a subject line containing only the word
help and a null message body to object archive server@decwrl.dec.com.
for ftp places to get it , see in the relevant place . there 's an off
previewer for sgi 4d machines , called off preview in
godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . there are previewers for xview and sunview ,
also on gondwana.

tddd

it 's a library of 3d objects with translators to from off , nff ,
rayshade , imagine or vort objects.
edited copy of the announcement follows (from raytracing news , v4 , 3)

new library of 3d objects available via ftp , by steve worley
(worley@cup.portal.com)

i have assembled a set of over 150 3d objects in a binary format
called tddd. these objects range from human figures to airplanes ,
from semi trucks to lampposts. these objects are all freely
distributable , and most have readmes that describe them.

in order to convert these objects to a human readable format , a file
with the specification of tddd is included in the directory with the
objects. there is also a shareware system called ttdddlib (officially
on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala pbm ) to from various
object formats imagine ttddd (extension of tddd \? ) , off , nff ,
rayshade 4.0 , or vort. source included for amiga unix as executables
for the amiga. also outputs framemaker mif files and isometric views
in postscript.

p3d

from pittsburgh supercomputing center. the p3d uses lisp with slight
extensions to store three dimensional models. a simple lisp
interpreter is included with the p3d release , so there is no need to
have access to any vendor 's lisp to run this software.

the mouse driven user interfaces for motif , open look , and silicon
graphics gl , and the drawp3d subroutine library for generating p3d
without ever looking at the underlying lisp.

the p3d software currently supports nine renderers. they are
painter painter 's algorithm , dore , silicon graphics inc. gl language ,
generic phigs , sun phigs , dec phigs , rayshade , art ray tracer (from
vort package) and pixar renderman.

the code is available via anonymous ftp from the machines
ftp.psc.edu , directory pub p3d , and nic.funet.fi , directory
pub graphics programs p3d.

renderman

pixar 's renderman is not free call pixar for details.



8. solids description formats

for documentation , you might want to contact nancy flower at
ncga technical services and standards , 1 800 225 6242 ext. 325
and the cost is 100.
this standard is not available in electronic format.

c. pdes step this slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
the geometrical information , but also for things like fem , etc.
the main bodies besides this standard are nist and darpa. you can get
more information about pdes by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
and putting the line

subject re optimizing projections
organization university of waterloo
lines 31

in article 1sua3tinnqs2@no names.nerdc.ufl.edu lioness@ufcc.ufl.edu writes
my three d library does a lot of projections ( duh ) , but currently it
is projecting an object 's vertices on a per triangle basis . this is
grossly inefficient for 99 of the objects displayed ( which can
be optimized by doing projections one time , once for each vertex ) , but
objects whose z extents intersect the hither plane ca n't benefit from
this because new vertices must be created during z clipping.

anyone have any better ideas \?

yes. here 's what you should do.

keep the vertices in an array , and have the polygons (triangles are okay ,
but n sided polygons are slightly more efficient) store the indices into
the array of the vertices that comprise them. you set a flag for each
vertex when you transform it , so you do n't have to transform any vertex
more than once you also do backface elimination before processing the
polygon , so that vertices that belong only to bacfacing polys do n't have
to be transformed at all.

whenever you transform a vertex , check if it 's on the far side of the hither
plane if it is , you can project it right away and store the result.

then do your z clip any vertices that get produced will have to have their
projection done at that stage.

subject re raytracing colours \?
summary illumination equations
organization kubota pacific computer , inc.
lines 44

asecchia@cs.uct.ac.za (adrian secchia) writes
when an incident ray (i) strikes an object at point p ... the reflected
ray (r) and the transmitted ray (t) is calculated from the formulae.

calling the routine recursively on r and t will return the colours
along the rays (r and t) as rcol and tcol. each object has its own
colour ocol and each light source has licol (1 i n).

the question is
how do you combine rcol , tcol , ocol and all the licol 's to get
the correct resulting colour to return along the i ray \?

first of all (this is not a snide response) , if you 're confused about
this issue , you will stumble over a lot of other things as well. i suggest
that the weakness is your reference material. get an introduction to ray
tracing by andrew glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing
algorithm. you could also refer to the 2nd edition of foley van dam.

on to the question. the simple answer is that you just keep adding up
all the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity. for
example , if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0 , then keep adding up
and clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower
bound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs , but that 's another issue ). so , you
get some illumination equation like this

i lambient ldiffuse(light n ) lreflected ltransparent

the contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light
intensity , as is the light due to transparency. now , a slightly less
hand waving illumination equation is this

i kala kdld(light n ) krlr ktlt

that is , each component of the illumination equation is governed by the
material constants ka , kd , kr and kt. so the maximum you can get from
transparency for a given object , for example , might be 0.4 , 0.1 , 0.5 for a
purple colored glass object.

hopefully this answers your question. i 'll forward my illumination
equation sermon to you also.

runs under dec vms.

avs is in its fourth year on the street and is very mature. all
fields of science , engineering , medicine , and even business
applications now use avs. this seminar will focus on its many
features in technical detail during a half hour slide
presentation. following a question period there will be a live
demonstration using a sun sparcstation. in addition , a new avs
program called campus will be introduced at this meeting.

also discussed will be the international avs center , which
provides an on line repository of over 1000 graphics modules at
the north carolina supercomputer center in raliegh , nc. avs has
imbedded tools to write one 's own customized modules should these
not be available with avs or from avs international.

but surely you do n't expect a system you buy now for a five year
period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year period \?

what 's sort of interesting about this whole thread is just how much
it has in common with similar threads in groups dealing with other vendor 's
hardware. i currently deal basically with hardware from 3 vendors apple ,
dec , and sgi and thus tend to monitor the groups about those vendor 's
hardware. currently , it seems like sgi customers are pissed at sgi about
dropping support for the personal iris , dec customers are pissed at dec for
dropping mips support in favor of the new alpha boxes , and apple customers
seem to get pissed every time a new mac is introduced that 's faster and
cheaper than the one they just bought. when i used to be a sun customer
years ago , i remember people being pissed at sun for leaving their 386
and 680x0 customers out in the cold when sparc came along.

what 's really interesting is that from what i can tell , the mis
folks in the basement with their es 9000 do n't seem to be pissed at ibm.
why \? i have no idea. either ibm really does take care of their customers
better , or they just have their customers brainwashed better than the
smaller vendors do.

this is almost certainly a macbinary file which is an encoded version

you need a program that converts this to a regular file. if this is a

you type binary first.

lightwave3d mail list

what is lightwave \?

lightwave3d is part of a suite of programs that come bundled with a
device called the toaster (from newtek , inc.) that operates on an
amiga platform. the lightwave software (lightwave lightwave3d and
lightwave modeler) allows and artist to create three dimensional
photo realistic images for a variety of purposes.

why are we doing this \?

this mailing list is for those interested in the lightwave software , how
it operates and in ideas on how to obtain the best quality images
available to them. the list is for those who own the toaster and
lightwave as well as those just interested in what can be done with the
package. we hope to share information , tips , procedures and to bond as
a group.

what are the rules \?

since lightwave modeler are just a part of the newtek video toaster
software , i'm sure we will discuss a few items related to the operation
of the toaster. however , we will strive to keep the subject revolving
specifically around the 3d software , related tools and products.

you do not have to own a toaster to join this list !

ok ! how do i join \?

to become a member of the lightwave3d mailing list you must send a mail
message to the address

lightwave request@bobsbox.rent.com

in the body of the message enter

subscribe lightwave l your.name@your.site.domain

or just ask to be signed up and i will sign you up to the list. at this
point in time the process is manual but i hope to get an automated
script based system in place soon. there should n't be too much of a
delay in joining. expect a welcome message within 5 days after you
send your request. then , expect the mail to start flowing in !

how do i post to the list \?

contributing to the list is simple. just mail your articles to the
following address

lightwave@bobsbox.rent.com

your article will be processed by the system and distributed to all
others joined to the list. your articles will also be sent to you so
you know that your article has made it to the list. however , those
addresses that are either no good or no longer active will bounce back
to you. so , if you post an article and another members address is no
longer valid , your original article will be returned to you. this
does n't mean it has n't been posted to the list. in fact , just the
opposite is true. it means that your article was posted and that it
could n't be sent to one or more of the members of the list due to a bad
address.

note i hope to have a fix for this behavior soon.

how do i quit the list \?

simply mail a request to be removed from the list to the same address
you used to sign up

lightwave request@bobsbox.rent.com

in the body of the message enter

unsubscribe lightwave l your.name@your.site.domain

i will remove your name from the list of members. please , if you join
the list and your account is going to be closed or if you will not be
able to receive mail for a while , send a request to be removed from the
list ! if you are just going to lose access for a short while still send
a request for a suspension of your membership and i will suspend
forwarding of the articles to you.


what about old articles \?

i am currently archiving all the articles posted to the list at the
originating site (bobsbox). however , i can not continue to do this due
to lack of disk space. what we need is a volunteer that will maintain a
compendium of articles sent to the list. they can compress and store
them in archives on their system. they can then periodically post an
index of the contents of the compendium and any other information that
relates.

if there are no volunteers then maybe someone can donate a large scsi
hard drive to me for archival purposes. grin

i have setup a mail based file server so that anyone interested in the
list can obtain information as well as the entire archive of past
articles , the membership listing and other information pertaining to
the lightwave3d mailing list. for information on this service , please
send a mail message to

fileserver@bobsbox.rent.com

the first command to the server must be help or user name passwd .

use help to request a current copy of the helpfile.
use user name passwd to connect to the service.
use \? to get a short listing of all available commands.



now what do i do \?

well , sit back and enjoy the pouring out of information. if you have
something to offer , please feel free to contribute that information to
the list. every little bit helps. questions are welcomed ! it makes
some of us feel important when we can answer them. grin

if you have any questions or comments regarding the list , please contact
me at the address

rome reborn the vatican library and renaissance culture
presents some 200 of the vatican library 's most precious
manuscripts , books , and maps many of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of greece and
rome. the exhibition presents the untold story of the vatican
library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
renaissance. the exhibit will be on display in the jefferson
building of the library of congress from january 8 , 1993 through
april 30 , 1993. the online exhibit will be available by

the exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections the vatican
library , archaeology , humanism , mathematics , music , medicine
biology , nature described , a wider world i how the orient came
to rome , and a wider world ii how rome went to china. each
section consists of its own sub directory within the exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate jpeg image files for each object. this online exhibit
includes not only objects from the library of congress exhibit ,
but also the alternate objects (brought from rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
omitted later in the planning process.

this exhibit will be of interest to medieval and renaissance
scholars in particular , but also to art historians , historians of
science or medicine , early music scholars , students of the
humanist movement , students of printing and the printed word ,
