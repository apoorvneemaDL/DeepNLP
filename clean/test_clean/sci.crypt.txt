in article 0fpizbg00wc70qokyw@andrew.cmu.edu you write
suppose i knew how the algorithm worked and knew the n for my chip , but
did not know f , then by cryptanalysis i might be able to determine f from
if law enforcement field
e e k u n f
not knowing n would might make this much harder.

they 're betting that you ca n't do this , even if you know n. even if you
know e , in fact , which they 're trying to keep secret. if you can find e
by grinding down the chip , presumably you can find f as well. but we ca n't
do this right now with des , even knowing the encryption method without
doing almost the whole 56 bit search.

that is not true , with chosen plaintext attacks des keys can be determined
without the full search.


now suppose that i know f , (either legitimately or not) ,
if i know k (either because i am involved in the conversation , or i know u
for a party in the conversation) , i may now be able to determine u for the
other party.

again , they 're betting that you ca n't find u given k i.e. they claim the
encryption is strong. (trust us...)

i am not willing to take that bet.

if i know f i can also defeat the law enforcement field , since i could
make my own , with a different k then the one i am using. knowing f also
allows traffic analysis to be performed. so i might not know what you are
saying but i could know who you are saying it too.

i'm not sure there 'll be a way to shove arbitrary key and data through your
chip , but if so , this part 's ok. (we 're assuming e is unknown.)

you can obviously shove arbitrary data through your chip......
as for the key , it is stated that the sesion key exchange is external to
the chip , so i can pick my keys too.

now i admit that someone trying to compute u will not have lots of
messages to work from , but since we have no way of knowing that the key
generation method does not (deliberately \? ) generate weak keys , or for that
matter that the published method is in fact used , perhaps the u 's will be
chosen from know weak keys for the system.

they assume that you wo n't be able to find u no matter how many messages
you have. if they could break u , they would n't need the key escrow.

bing bing bing bing bing , that exactly my point , since we cant know that
they do not have this capability , the only safe assumption is that they
do... i admit that most of my cryptographic complaints are probably
unfounded , but since we cant know one way or the other , im not gonig to
take their word for it....

obviously the compromise of f would be a disaster , both to law enforcement
for whom this whole thing is designed , and for the people who believe that
it is giving them security. f is but one number , and i sure that alot of
people (more then 1) know what it is (and if some panel of experts is
going to check it over for flaws then many more will know f , forget
grinding chips , bribery and blackmail work just fine.

it 's not clear that the experts will be told f. in fact , i 'd be surprised.
i 'd expect something more of the form of the fips pub describing des , so that
they could look at the algorithm in general , rather than with the specific
set of keys chosen.

oh come on , thats like saying you could evaluate des without the s box
constants.....

the following document summarizes the clipper chip , how it is used ,
how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the
escrow process , and how law enforcement decrypts communications.

interesting. tell us , what happens if i were to say ok , i want to have
something else. if the law enforcement wants my traffic , they can record
it , then get a search warrant , and get the keys from me , just like they
would the keys to a stout private safe , etc. (lets say i suspect that
there is a way to trivially crack this at the fed level , with no warrant ,
say for nsa scanning for keywords , etc. , and the government has abused
great power in the past...).

so i say mr vendor , i want something different , independent. i am

also , please be so kind as to tell us what the plans are for private
encryption of , say files transferred by modem , or ftp , or data stored

for us people on that.... with your rather intimate relationship with
the fbi , nsa , etc. you must certainly have an idea. you are surely
not going to say the people are not to know , until it is too late...
this is supposed to be government of the people by the people , is n't
it \? that is , the people are the government 's bosses \? the bosses
want to know what the @() (@ is going on here...

you see , i am kind of nervous , because in the last month or so , i have
seen a non stop stream of ideas coming out of wash dc that at least
appear very strongly to have a common trait to limit privacy (freedom
from govt eavesdropping) , and the ability to defend ourselves against
violent attack (no , 911 is not good enough for 'common folk' , they
arrive only in time to clean up the mess i would be dead if i had to
depend on 911...). you see , with all that talk about national smart
id cards , limiting of encryption to 'government approved' , denial of
means to effective personal defense (eight bills in congress right now) ,
it looks an awfully lot like the whole thing is to be able to trace
every activity of an individual from cradle to grave. all it would take
is requiring that national id card to be used in all transactions...
and with no effective data protection , and with the people suitably
disarmed , there would not be a helluva lot they could do about it , now
would there \? all in the name of the war on the constitu ... er ...
drugs , and of course that catch word 'terrorists'. what is wrong with
good old fashioned police work to build a case \? they do n't want to
have to be burdened to leave the office , it seems...

please read the bill of rights (first ten amendments to the us
constitution) and tell us how you can reconcile this big brother ish
policy of the administration (always for a 'crisis' of some kind , is n't
it \? ) with that bill of rights in the context of the people who wrote
it \?

reassure us please... (or is that no longer regarded as necessary ,
seeing as apparantly the people have no input on this agenda , the
administration preferring to make all the decisions in secret , then
springing it on us...). does n't sound much like ... by the people
to me. i cannot help notice that the congress people involved were
not mentioned on the press release. i find that more than a little
bit curious , do n't you \? i sure would like to know who to not vote
for come election time...

yes , i am upset. i feel you are a part of this , because i recall it
was you that was posting heavily in favor of a very similar idea (could
have been the same thing , it was so close) a few months ago... i
also recall it was not well received. apparantly powers that be
really did n't care (or were not told , or both).

from what i see , clipper will only be useful for conversations i do n't
want the neighborhood kid listening in on. any serious security i do n't
think i would want to trust it a bit. might as well use cleartext.
certainly corporations would be rather dumb to depend on this for serious
trade secret data , especially if millions depended on that security.
given enough money , one could buy any keys they wanted. buy a crooked
judge , and a crooked cop. given a few hundred thou , they would n't be
hard to find. so , we end up with only criminals , terrorists , and the
government with real security , and the ability to eavesdrop. you know
the first two , if they are serious , ai n't going to use this thing for
their communications. i bet the government wo n't , either (except perhaps
to order a pizza).

tell us , will that be prima face evidence of criminal activity ,
someone not using the 'government approved' methods \? that just a desire
to have privacy is no longer regarded as a legitimate right of an
unconnected citizen \? will that be grounds for a fly through the door
raid , and confiscation of all one 's equipment , as 'terrorist tools' ,
using civil forfeiture , so there will be no inconvenient need to
prove any wrongdoing on the part of the citizen \?

i have yet another question , are we going to see articles in all the
public magazines , consisting of soothing text telling us how great
this is , how nice the government is by letting us have this illusion
of privacy \? that the government is going to be so kind as to let
us 'sort of' exercise a right \? what you want to bet that i am
correct here \?

please answer these questions. as citizens of the united states , we
hava a right to know what our government plans to 'let' us have
out of the goodness of their hearts...

funny thing , though with all these proposals , i do n't feel one bit
safer from drug dealers , terrorists , or a common street thug. i am
beginning to wonder if the greater danger lies in the above entities ,
or our own government gone out of control \?

re assure us , please. so far , i have n't seen much to reassure me...
and a lot to greatly disturb me.

some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is

somehow if non escrowed crypto goes away.
a little perspective might be in order.

right. people here believe the government is listening in on
everything. sure. if you ca n't provide an answer , change the
assumptions to something you can deal with.

it 's not a matter of the government listening on on everything , it 's a
matter of the government listening on anyone they take an interest in.
say , if you do something heinous like attend a computer meeting at a
mall , the secret service decides to go for a warrantless search , and
acquires your name. it 's a matter of any number of possible wiretap
abuses that cryptology makes far less likely , and this chip can
sabotage.

par for the course , though. i predicted that you 'd be jumping in in
favor of this. the reply was that you 'd justify anything up to and
including death camps as long as the government backed them and had a
written policy statement. perhaps a little extreme , but not much.

but i think that mind set is a mistake. before there
were cattle prods , governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs and rubber hoses. before there were lasers for
eavesdropping , governments used binoculars and lip readers.
though government certainly uses technology to oppress , the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.

evil and good walk hand in hand. it is also important to note that
the good in the tools lies in the wielder of the tools.

in fact , technology represents one of the most promis
ing avenues available for re capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them.

i cannot accept this ridiculous leap in logic. technology is neutral
to good or evil. when technology is used by evil men , it is called
evil technology. when it is used by good men , it is called good
technology. really , it is just technology that allows action to be
realized more efficently and on a larger scale.

by its very nature , it favors
the bright (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can
not).

try not to confused the development of technology with its use.
certainly , bright people will be better at creating technology , but
even young children know how to program vcr machines. are vcr
machines not extremely complex to create \?

it favors the adaptable (who are quick to see the
merit of the new (over the sluggish (who cling to time
tested ways).

adaptibility and flexibility is always better at enduring than the
stiff and stubborn. a young child is soft and supple an old man is
stiff and inflexible. a dripping of water can cut through stone.
this has nothing to do with technology , rather technology just
allows us to magnify action.

o.k. if you 've read this group for a while , you know all about the
one time pad , but here 's a question i have n't seen.

the one time pad yeilds ideal security , but has a well known flaw in
authentication. suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad , and
exclusive or as the encryption operation. if an adversary knows the
plaintext of a message , he can change it into any other message.
here 's how it works.

alice is sending bob a plaintext p , under a key stream s
alice computes the ciphertext c s xor p , and sends it to bob.

eve knows the plainext p , but wants the message to appear as p'.
eve intercepts c , and computes c' c xor p xor p' s xor p'.
eve sends c' to bob.

bob decrypts c' by computing c'xor s p' , thus receiving the
false message which was substituted by eve.


now the question is how can this attack be defeated with information
theoretic security , not just computational security.
can we define something like ideal authentication which is the
analog of ideal security. can we obtain ideal authentication \?

if not , how much can we limit eve 's control over the message \?

if we can achieve ideal authentication , does the solution use more
key bits or expand the message \? can we show the solution to be
optimal in one or more parameters \?

does anyone know if these questions have been aswered before \?

the problem is that laws can change. congress may pass a law setting
up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. some
future congress may change that law. suppose pre nazi germany had

thank you for sending me a most interesting article. a
society of individuals and organizations that would expend the
time and resources to use a series of 'digital pseudonyms' to
avoid data linkage does not in my opinion make big brother
obsolete but acts on the assumption that big brother is ever
present. i view your system as a form of societal paranoia.

as a matter of principle , we are working to enact formal
legal protections for individual privacy rather than relying on
technical solutions. we want to assume a society of law which
respects legal limits rather than a society that will disobey the
law , requiring citizens to depend on technical solutions. e.g.
require a judical warrant for government interception of data
communications rather than encrypt all messages on the assumption
that regardless of the lawt the government will abuse its power
and invade privacy.

as a matter of practicality , i do not think your system
offers much hope for privacy. first , the trend toward universal
identifiers is as much. a movement generated by government or
industry 's desire to keep track of all citizens as it is by
citizens seeking simplicity and convenience in all transactions.
at best , your system would benefit the sophisticated and most
would opt for simplicity. the poor and the undereducated would
never use or benefit from it.

finally where there 's a will , there 's a way. if government
wants to link data bases , it will , by law , require the disclosure
of various individual pseudonyms used by citizens or prohibit it
for data bases which the government wants to link. since
corporations make money by trading commercial lists with one
another , they will never adopt the system or if it is adopted ,
will use fine printn contracts to permit selling various codes
used by their customers to other firms.

the solution remains law , policy , and consensus about limits
on government or corporate intrusion into areas of individual
autonomy. technique can be used to enforce that consensus or to
override it. it cannot be used as a substitute for such
consensus.



sincerely yours ,

i am aware of the restrictions imposed by the munitions act
on the export of cryptographic technology , however , is it illegal to
transmit encrypted data from the u.s. to another country \? if so ,
then which laws apply to this situation \?

from the us law perspective , unless you 're engaging in illegal speech ,
it 's not illegal to use encryption. yet. the nsa is allowed to try
to listen , but you 're not obligated to make it easy for them. yet.
the other country may have more repressive laws about that
i gather france 's bureaucracy wants to know what you 're saying ,
and in the old soviet union , they did n't need laws to make things illegal (

(paranoia follows , for those of you who want to play it safe )
the fact that the nsa is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies , but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate rsa 's patents , e.g. if you use pgp , the
nsa may tell rsa that you 're doing so , and if the secret service catches on ,
they may decide that the mere fact that rsa has n't filed a lawsuit
against you does n't mean that you do n't deserve to have your computer
confiscated for possible patent violation , munitions law violation ,
espionage , money laundering , drug importation , and creatin' a disturbance ,
and then not give it back because you did violate the patent even
though they had to drop all the other charges , unlike that nasty steve
jackson who had the gall not to be guilty of anything .

court , not only to le for prosecuting the case but to
parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).

our friends south of the border do n't have as easy a time of
it. among other things they have as many le agencies as we
have agencies , and some of them have teeth. they also have the
war on drugs which gives law enforcement agencies exceptional
powers to ignore individuals' rights (the dea has more
arbitrary power than that given to canadian agencies under the
war measures act). we have the rcmp and csis who ca n't stop
fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
suppression of private citizens' rights. not only that , our
police commissions have teeth , as i learned when i had to fend

it may be ironic that the nation founded on life , liberty and

unlike the cia , the nsa has no prohibition against domestic spying. read
bamford 's the puzzle palace.

i did. you 're mistaken. nsa 's communications intelligence mission is
strictly against foreign governments. here 's an excerpt from the enabling
charter (24 oct 52 , truman) that should clarify this. the charter was
declassified in about feb 1990 when an foia request made it public. mind
you , i do n't know that they never collect anything they 're not supposed
to... but spying on us citizens is n't in their charter.

b. the comint mission of the national security agency
(nsa) shall be to provide an effective , unified organization
and control of the communications intelligence activities of
the united states conducted against foreign governments , to
provide for integrated operational policies and procedures
pertaining thereto. as used in this directive , the terms
communications intelligence or comint shall be construed
to mean all procedures and methods used in the interception
of communications other than foreign press and propaganda
broadcasts and the obtaining of information from such
communications by other than intended recipients , but shall
exclude censorship and the production and dissemination of
finished intelligence.

they 're also tasked with protecting the us 's communications , but i have n't
seen the specific enabling memo on that. i assume that 's the role under
which skipjack was developed.

nsa is not in the standard setting business , though that 's why this
clipper stuff came from nist , which i believe is tasked with coming up
with standards based on their best inputs from other government agencies ,
which would include nsa.

not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units , but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys
from escrow.

big deal. if you are a legitimate law enforcement agent and have a
legitimate wiretap order , you just listen in on the line for 10
minutes , get the serial number , and then take the order and go to the
escrow agencies. if you notice the criminal is now using a different
phone instrument , take your still valid wiretap order to the escrow
agency with the new serial number. (this provides opportunities for
abuse by law enforcement , but thats not what we are discussing right
now.) i oppose clipper , but the mechanics here are simple and easy to
understand. the whole rest of your article is based on a large series
of false premises , all predicated on the notion that this simple act
is somehow impossible.

i believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
government maintaining a secret of some kind.

not necessarily. for instance , in the system outlined in the may 1993
issue of byte , the process of getting one 's public key listed for general
use involves giving pieces of your private key to escrow agencies , which
do calculations on those pieces and forward the result to the publishers of
the public key directory , which combines these results into your listed
public key. if you try to give the escrow agencies pieces which do n't
yield your private key when they are all put together , the result is that
the public key listed for you is wrong and you ca n't read messages encrypted
to you.

each chip includes the following components

the skipjack encryption algorithm
f , an 80 bit family key that is common to all chips
n , a 30 bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
u , an 80 bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip
...

to see how the chip is used , imagine that it is embedded in the at t
telephone security device (as it will be). suppose i call someone and
we both have such a device. after pushing a button to start a secure
conversation , my security device will negotiate an 80 bit session key k
with the device at the other end. this key negotiation takes place
without the clipper chip. in general , any method of key exchange can
be used such as the diffie hellman public key distribution method.

once the session key k is established , the clipper chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream m (digitized voice). the
telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two
values

e m k , the encrypted message stream , and
e e k u n f , a law enforcement field ,
...

which are transmitted over the telephone line. the law enforcement
field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u
concatenated with the serial number n , all encrypted under the family
key f. the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

one very interesting thing i notice about this is that the only use of
the chip key is to encode the session key for the law enforcement field.
it is not used at all by the encryption algorithm.

it seems like it would be possible to create a device that would be
otherwise compatible , but would send out a bogus law enforcement field.
this might render the device unusable with normal devices if there 's
some sort of validation involving the law enforcement field , but it
could certainly be used with other such modified devices.

of course , this is irrelevant if the nsa has a backdoor in the
algorithm , but it does make it possible to defeat the key escrow system.

would wiretap chip be cost effective \?

summary compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars ,
wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police. so the
proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part
in three thousand to be cost effective.

robin 's calculation is interesting and important , even if it 's off by
an order of magnitude (for example).

even if hardware costs for the clipper chip phones were zero , the
protocol overhead in transmitting the escrow field would be much
higher than the 1 part in 3 thousand...it depends on the exact details
of the phone call length , protocol , etc. (shorter calls get a
proportionately greater hit).

however , i suspect most americans will not find this line of reasoning
as persuasive as the analogies about escrowing keys to one 's house
are.

sorry , my news reader does n't seem to know how to copy a subject header.
this tracks the thread why people do n't need strong crypto.....

the atomic energy act of 1954 expressly forbids thinking about building
nuclear devices. while i was in grad school , a friend of mine got a
security clearance to work on the defense for the progressive magazine.
he found lots of articles which were public domain removed from the
local engineering library (madison wisconsin). so the lawyers sent him
all over the states to other libraries to show that the information in
the article was already public. what pissed everyone off was a local
underground paper went and published the article anyway (it had been
precensored by the feds , that 's what this was all about) so the judge
declared the case moot.

the atomic energy act of 1954 has never been tested in court. from my
discussions with several people familiar with the case , only 2 other
times has this preemptive clause been used. in every case the people
simply did what they felt like and courts tossed the cases out.

for all intents and purposes , the government does have precidence for
declaring things classified after it has been published. while i was
working on star wars this happened to me my clearance was in the works
and i developed a method for tracking particle beams. it was good enough
to classify , so i was no longer allowed to work on it. a friend from
canada was in the same boat he developed a method to compute stripping
cross sections , but because the subject was classified he was not allowed
to present his own paper at a conference ! . he later published it in an
open journal without problems.

when the going gets wierd , the wierd turn pro. the feds can do whatever
they want whenever they feel like it , and they will make up rules to let
themselves get away with it. since the mass media ca n't tell the difference
between a joke and the real thing (like ranch appocolypse for the waco
massacre) do n't count on them to help spread the word about their loss
of freedom. the government can make strong crypto illegal. so what \?
since the government does not obey any of its own rules , why should we \?

to tell it to use idea in ofb mode or ecb mode. in ofb mode , errors in

at the company i worked for previously , i received a file that was
des encryped and the person that had sent it , went on vaction.
rather than wait two weeks i set up a straight frontal attack with
one key at a time. it only took two(2) days to crack the file.

taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else
that has been published here about brute force des cracking , unless russell
was lucky with respect to the key) , i 'd be very interested in whether the
program russell used is available \? in whether he used a cleartext
recognition algorithm in the program or whether he had to examine each
decryption by hand \? in whether he used a known plaintext attack \?


this has to be a dictionary attack. no other attack makes sense.


this means that whoever encrypted the file just typed some password
which was a single dictionary word , and then russell tried all the
words in the dictionary. this is n't too implausible , especially if he
was smart and clipped the first plaintext block off the ciphertext (if
the first block does n't decrypt then obviously the others wo n't
either).

assuming one attempt a second , it takes seven hours to try all the
words in usr dict words. not real tough.

if you want des to be secure , you have to use random keys. you ca n't

you should probably use numbers much larger than 64 bits. also , you
may want to include some randomly generated bitstrings in your protocol.
this way , if someone should find the shared key you and another person
use on one day , they wo n't be able to guess it for the next day....

ie a sends g a mod p and random string r0
b sends g b mod p and random string r1

both find (g a mod p) b mod p shared key , then both calculate

session key hash(r0 , shared key , r1)

also , you will want to make sure that you 're getting the right public
key value g a mod p. someone with the power to intercept and change messages
can oterwise spoof you by sending both of you his public key , and then
acquiring a session key with each of you....

subject one time pad authentication \?
nntp posting host mizzou1.missouri.edu
organization university of missouri
lines 51

i can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one time
pad encrytped scheme , though i'm not sure how to prove that what kind of
authenicity they provide.

an obvious first attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable
for eve) block to the message , and then calculate a crc which included the
random starting block and all of the message. this could be encrypted after
the message. the problem is , i'm not sure it 's impossible to come up with
a message that will hash to the same crc regardless of the random starting
block. (it intuitively seems like it ought to be hard , but i'm not that
sure....) clearly , a crypto strength hash like md5 or the sha would be
stronger , but again , i'm not sure i'm comfortable claiming that it 's
unbreakable.

a scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0 's
to include in the plaintext stream before going on would n't be too bad ,
either. at the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your
pad , this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your
opponent could spoof a valid looking message , since any deciphered plaintext
in a spot that should be carrying 0 's will show that something funny 's going
on.

if , for each message bit m i , we used up one random bit , r i , to decide
whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream , we 'd get a total pad use
of 2.5 times the message length. (we 'd expand the message size by about
half.) each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that does n't is a
guess for our would be spoofer. at each bit , she has to guess. i'm trying
to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the
spoofed message , but it gets a little complicated , because she can get un
synched , and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message.

now , i can see a simple way of doing this that 's got to be as secure
as a one time pad , at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits.

for each message bit , m i , use one random bit , r i , and xor them together
to get x i. now , encrypt the three bits with the one time pad. the enemy
has no way of guessing what r i is , so he she ca n't guess what x i is , either.
any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess
of what r i was. is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits \?

spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random
bits as there are bits in the message. clearly , this makes spoofing messages
just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.
in fact , it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed
message with the ciphertext as without it , but i'm not entirely sure about
that.

is there an easier way of doing this that 's provably as secure as the
one time pad \?

gasp !

i 've just spent 3 hours catching up on sci.crypt here (slow reader i
guess) and i really have to put out a few comments too. first , let me
flame the famous dave s. he 's obviously only 10 years old. cut him
some slack.

the joke about clinton crypto drugs slammed me thru the roof. nice job
guys ! i 've been working on marijuana legalization for over 5 years
now , clinton 's actions so far have really helped. but because of
government action taken against various other groups , i have developed
a 64 bit des based on public literature to protect my mailing list.
the s boxes are the critical component , and since i chose 32 out of 57
based on the key , cracking this des is going to tough. (the reason it
slows you down a touch is that for each key you try you need to use a
different set of s boxes , i know it 's only a vector , but it sure makes
random search a pain). several marijuana legalization groups have had
their mailing lists confiscated when people were charged with drug
use sales. it 's not a crime to be a member of a legalization org ,
but you will be watched.

it really is important to write a letter to every official you
personally vote for to explain why your privacy is being destroyed by
the cripple chip . amazingly enough they do listen when they get
enough mail. the doonsbery jokes about nra postcards are real , and
the imi (illinois marijuana initiative) has grown to the point where we
are seeing some changes.

it 's pretty clear that all the hullabaloo is really about the
implimentation decision being made behind our backs. as vesselin
points out , this was common practice in communist regimes (and may be
again depending on how the vote goes). but just as criminals have guns
and law abiding citizens do n't , and criminals like me have marijuana
and law abiding subjects do n't , criminals like me will have secure
crypto while law abiding robots do n't. pgp is nice , but as time goes
on we all can do better. and to save our hides we will.

someone posted an excerpt from machiavelli. he 's my favorite dude.
500 years ago he saw clearly how people are , and tried to explain
that to princes who wanted people to obey . one section not quoted
(i 've got the prince at home , so i 'll just paraphrase ) ) had to do
with conquring a free city. the only way is to completly destroy
it. failing that , you must appoint locals to high positions and accept
the people 's customs. even after 100 years of oppression , a people
will remember their heratige and rise up to overthrow the oppresive
government. and he gave an example. and that was 300 years before
thomas jefferson.

there were questions about watching traffic. only interesting traffic
is watched stuff that goes overseas and comes back stuff with keywords
like marijauana , cryptography , nsa certain individuals who are known
subversives , etc. it is easy enough to store all that traffic. so if
you know how to be subversive i.e. how to be unseen , it 's pretty easy
to go unnoticed for a long time. the stronger your crypto system and the
less you 're noticed , the better your chances of developing an organization
which can diseminate truth to the masses.

which gets me to the thread about a public encrypted conference .
that 's just silly. the first thing the feds do is send in an
infiltrator (like dave s.) and they know what you 're doing. it will be
fun for teenagers and college students , but for the real world it 's
pretty pointless. crypto is useful for more things than hiding where
you get your marijuana.

guns , drugs and crypto do have some commonality there are people in
government who want you to obey their rules. as lundquist says in
alt.drugs live free or do n't . machiavelli pointed out that 's just
how most people actually live , inspite of appearences to the contrary.
it 's true that the decision to shove the clipper (not the same thing as
intergraph 's ! ! ! ) down our throats violates the principles of what the
u.s. was founded on , but the government is full of idiotic robots
called bureaucrats and there 's less to worry about than one might
think. only really innocent (read naive) subjects of the u.s. will be
hurt by this , the rest of us criminals will live in secure freedom.
de toqueville pointed out 150 years ago that the tyranny of the
majority will be mitigated by the mediocrity of the government.

and given what i see government officials doing where i work (argonne
national lab.) the level of stupidity makes dave s. look smart.

any monkey business on this point they have to expect that the
chip will be reverse engineered sooner or later it 's an obvious
opportunity to introduce additional holes.

the chip is n't the place to pull the monkey business you do it in
the key generation , either by having a mathematical backdoor ,
or by having the program on the laptop that supposedly generates the
keys also save a copy of s1 and s2 and leak it out somehow ,
or by having the program that supposedly puts the official keys
on the chip actually put a different key there (very hard to detect ,
since the escrow agents have to either trust the nsa laptop or
give each other the s keys , and they still do n't know the algorithm.)
or have the chip burner at the factory make copies of the keys.

gentlefolk ,

it seems to me that the step 1 of taking a warrant to the
telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (do n't
you love animal metaphors).

with each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
( e(n f) is not syntactically different than n ) , all they
have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
today 's target and use the serial number to identify the
session they want , and get the chip number of the other end of
the conversation. even without the key , this is great for
traffic analysis. i can think of several ways to learn the
right serial number.

it looks like one intended effect of the clipper is to
eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your
alligator clips erect). this is particularly handy if you have
s1 and s2.

btw , did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
number \?

cheers ,
marc

the easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. this makes
the funding separate from government.

it also has the neat side property that if the chip does n't catch on , the
scheme breaks down , and the government is back to the drawing boards ,
assuming that they have n't prohibited alternatives in the meantime.

in fact , maybe this should be part of the official system. before the
government is allowed to move this past the experimental stage , they
should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption. the
government is very fond of demonstration projects proving feasibility in the
use of government funds for social programs they should have to make a
similar feasibility demonstration (on economic viability cum acceptance
terms) for this baby as well. let 's put it to the only vote that counts a

you obviously have n't read the information about the system. the chips
put out serial number infomation into the cypher stream to allow
themselves to be identified. the system does not rely on registering
people as owning particular phone units.

i am against the proposal , but lets be accurate in our objections.


do not presume to tell me what i have and have not read. the system may
not rely upon registering people as owning particular phone units , but
it is necessary to know which phone units are likely to be used for some
suspected criminal communication before you can obtain their unit keys
from escrow. this necessity raises the stakes in favor of a criminal 's
coercing or colluding use of some other person 's clipper phone.

i will restate my assumptions more explicitly and amplify my argument.
the original title perhaps should have been distinction between legal
and illegal cipher systems considered harmful , but clipper considered
harmful is not inaccurate , and is more eye catching in the current context.

assumptions

1. clipper is made available.

2. laws are passed to make use of cipher systems other than clipper illegal
(either on radio systems , or on any common carrier system). these laws
also include enforcement authority to listen across the relevant radio
spectrum (or other medium) , characterize signals , validate clipper
wrappers , detect probable use of non clipper ciphers , and make such
detection a cause for further action.

3. for escrowed keys to be useful , some specific clipper chip must be
associated with a suspected criminal. this means that at a minimum
some association between the common carrier 's unique phone id (esn) and
the clipper chip serial number n will be stored in a government database.
an observed pairing of n and esn other than the one recorded raises a
red flag.

4. to reduce ordinary fraud , the cellphone system which offers clipper
will also be constructed with an esn mechanism much more tamper proof
and much less spoofable than today 's cellphones.

5. criminals want inscrutable communications. some criminals are not
entirely stupid or ignorant , and will figure out both that clipper
cellphones offer excellent security in normal circumstances , and that
they offer no security against law enforcement once a (presumably
legitimate) wiretap order exists. they will also figure out that the
wiretap order must necessarily be against a specific cellphone , because
each one has a unique unit key.

6. criminals do not want to call attention to themselves. because they
are not stupid or ignorant (or because they read netnews) , and because
they know that their open use of a non clipper cipher is likely to be
detected , they will generally avoid using non clipper ciphers directly
on some monitorable tappable channel. they know that do so would raise
a red flag , putting a given cellphone (if not a given person) under
immediate suspicion.

7. it is impractical to reverse engineer skipjack , discover family key f ,
and construct a functional clone of a clipper chip.

by 2 , 3 , 4 , and 7 it will be very difficult to spoof a given clipper
phone without immediate detection. because it is difficult to obscure one 's
association to a specific phone by reprogramming or changing chips
around , the criminal will be motivated to find an intact phone which is
associated with someone else.

a non stupid criminal will conclude that they can have clipper secure
communications , at least for some limited time t , if they buy , beg , borrow ,
or steal use of someone 's phone in a way that prevents that person from
reporting compromise of the phone for at least time t. the encrypted
communications might have been recorded , and thus be retrievable later ,
but the criminal can delay , and quite likely evade , discovery by destroying
or abandoning the phone before t elapses.

it would be unusual for an innocent person to volunteer use of their clipper
phone to someone else. the honest subscriber does n't want to pay someone
else 's bill , and he does n't want to fall under suspicion.

this leaves two sources of clipper phones for criminal use coercion
and collusion.

coercion first. theft bears a relatively low risk , but also sometimes
a low time until detection (a few minutes if a phone is stolen from
a car parked in front of a store , a couple of weeks if a phone is stolen
from someone who is away on vacation). criminal commerce is likely to
arise in stolen clipper phones , with phones coming from risk inured poor
criminals , and cash coming from risk averse wealthy criminals. someone
who is extraordinarily motivated to gain a day or two of undetected
communication (like a terrorist) could kill a person or hold them hostage.
the limited time (before detection) that a coerced phone is useful means
that continuing criminal enterprises require a continuing supply of
freshly coerced phones.

there would also be created a collusive commerce between relatively
wealthy criminals , and ignorant or do n't care patsies who need money ,
and who will submit to being paid in return for subscribing to clipper
phone service for someone else 's use.

criminals will learn that it is more to their advantage to coerce use of a
clipper cellphone than it is to apply a non clipper cipher to a normal
cellphone. they will call much less attention to themselves (or at least to
their stolen phone) this way. the fact of a phone 's use being coerced must
first be reported before it can be identified as an interesting phone , and
have its keys obtained from escrow.

clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of super encryption. an automated full system surveillance
mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key f ,
can validate clipper wrappers and n esn associations , but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of super encryption , unless it knows all unit keys ,
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces , upon specific wiretap like order.

whereas a criminal 's use of any cipher within a normally cleartext medium
would stand out , a criminal 's use of a non clipper cipher within a clipper
medium would be very difficult to detect , even ex post facto in bulk
recordings , as long as the association between criminal and specific clipper
chip is fractured.

if you make use of this other cipher illegal per se , then you can charge
the criminal with this (if you can identify the true criminal he 'll be
using someone else 's phone) , but you 'll have no evidence to help you against
whatever traditional crime he might have been planning. you will not even be
able to detect that unusual (encrypted) communications are occurring until you
identify specific phones and obtain their keys from escrow.

the gangster and terrorist are thus arguably more , not less , secure than
they were before clipper came along.

i therefore consider clipper harmful because

1. it does not provide absolute privacy to the honest public against
aggressive or dishonest government.

2. if other ciphers are proscribed , it engenders new types of direct
criminal threat to the honest public.

3. it provides an extraordinarily effective mechanism for criminals to
hide their use of some other cipher , making it more difficult than
ever even to gain notice that unusual communications are occurring
and that plans for some criminal act might be in progress.

4. if other ciphers are proscribed , lazy investigators and prosecutors
are more likely to pursue the easily quantifiable cipher use crime
than they are the traditional and directly harmful crimes which key
escrow is claimed to help against.

5. if other ciphers are proscribed , the stage is set for witch hunting
of illegal cipher use. because any computer can be used as a cipher
machine...

classified. as i understand the law , nuclear weapons design is
automatically classified even if you do the work yourself. i believe you

if i want to talk to someone , i do n't need to have previously exchanged
keys with him , i just call him up , and the phones establish a session key
for us using a zero knowledge algorithm or something of the kind. (if i 've
misunderstood this part , it probably invalidates the rest of this notion.)

this lends itself to spoofing.
...
i go buy a pair of clipper phones to go on a pair of phone lines in a back
room somewhere , and have the digital switch programmed to redirect his
calls to one of my two lines instead of to his , whenever he receives a
call. the two phones are wired back to back in the clear.


anyone see any problem with this scheme , other than to assume that all
public officials and phone company employees are totally incorruptible \?

as far as i can see , no matter how the session keys are generated (be it
diffie hellman or whatever) , any cripple conversation which travels in
whole or in part over a land line is vulnerable to this scheme. law
enforcement agencies can do it legally at the telco , or illegally by finding
some part of the phone line that they can cut into. the degree of risk
depends very much on location not good in the middle of a busy street ,
but not bad on a line in open country (leading to a drug lord 's ranch). the
only way to defeat it would be if your phone had the equivalent of a public
key indexed against phone number for every phone you might want to call (all
of them) totally impractical , even if some part of the cripple algorithm
could be used as a kind of public key (i do n't understand enough about these
things to know).

this sort of encryption scheme is only really workable over a radio link ,
and even then you could probably interevene without causing problems for
other phones nearby if you were physically close to the target phone.

gosh , yet another way to get round cripple encryption. how many is that
we 've found so far \? and that 's without even knowing the details of the
algorithm.

it would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
whole fiasco is the economic standpoint. as others have mentioned , the most
difficulty the clipper chip faces is an economic one. let 's face it , the
average consumer does n't care or know that the clipper is a bad idea. if
there is a perceived need for cellular encryption , then the companies will
provide one. most likely , a standard will emerge. but if the clipper is
too expensive (and 25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their
own or buy a cheaper one.

this is an interesting point. as a very coarse rule of thumb , you can
figure that the final price of a product is 3 to 5 times the cost of goods.
(the exact multiplier depends largely on economies of scale products that
sell tens of millions of units year will be at the low end , those that sell
thousands of units year will be at the high end. i suspect cellular phones
are in the middle). this implies that adding a 25 chip would increase the
cost of the phone by approx 100 , or about 25 30 .

i do n't think you 'll get a lot of consumer support for this.

by the simple expedient fact that they are not supported , funded , or
overtly controlled by the government.

thats one problem that has so far been overlooked. these two escrow
agencies will have to create a secure database and service the
input and output of keys. who pays for this \? if they refuse an
illegal request from some congressman to deliver a key can their
budget by cut to punish them \? will congress be forced to fund

congress is n't forced to do anything. not even follow their own rules ,

the s l scandal were n't hurt too much , if at all. deconcini 's personal
stake in suppliers to those big aerostats has n't affected his credibility
at all , inside congress , at least. he is still pushing his police state
agenda...

the problem is that laws can change. congress may pass a law setting
up an escrow agency with instructions that keys are private. some
future congress may change that law. suppose pre nazi germany had
a clipper system. do you think the escrow agencies would have
told hitler that he could not have the keys without a valid
court order \?

it will be like the old saw in new jersey and new york , chicago , etc
when the politicians promised that this spiffy new gun registration law
will not be used for future confiscation purposes. sure enough , a few
years later , when they were used just for that purpose , and folks
complained , the response was well , i did n't make that promise...
some politicians may not even wait a few years... escrowed keys would
have the same assurances of security. besides , if someone wants to
snoop , how are you to know you do n't think they will send you a letter
saying we are now snooping on your private conversations... , do you \?
what are the assurances the escrow people will not be forbidden to
report any access attempts for one 's keys \?

so much for government assurances of privacy.

in effect you must set up escrow agencies as a fourth branch of
the goverment and isolate them from any outside interferance.
they will be able to directly tap into federal funds with no
accountability to anyone except through a court challenge.

how \? the feds will just change the law , or just ignore it. nothing
new here... they got the muscle , the resources , the guns...

as an aside , since export of crypto is verboten because of itar ,

taking this at face value (though it seems quite dissonant with much else

given that certain archival methods have certain key(cleartext) in a file i

he probably should also tell us , given his address , what machine he used a

my previous employment has nothing to do with my current address , other than
the fact that the fastest machine in the office was an ibm risc system 6000

depending on his answer , this could be an appalling development calling into
question both des and rsa des. dunno about rsa idea.

i really think this more of a statement of the limitations placed on the key
by the interface(ascii char no padding) , and most programs do n't bother to
clear off the archival front and backend id 's.

if any bright programmer with a little idle machine time can crack a single

yes any moderatly bright programmer with a little idle machine time , can
crack most of todays real world encryption. i sure that you or i could
select a key , and prepare the data inorder that the decryption will become a
worst case. but that is not the real world , and i'm sure that is how any

maybe you are using the wrong amendment. if someone were to seize

the combination , the applicable defense would be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure. the police would be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter , but any broad search

in the case of the safe , they would probably get a locksmith and

rubber hose cryptography.

the clipper chip 's user key is formed by

r1 e d e n1 s1 s2 s1
r2 e d e n2 s1 s2 s1
r3 e d e n3 s1 s2 s1

why is the triple encrytion used \? is it just to gain an effective
increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch \? (if so , why use
80 bit keys \? ) not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm , it 's
not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to
guess s1 , s2.

why are n1 , n2 , and n3 formed as they are \? it would be facinating to
see the skipjack algorithm , to look for ways of attacking it that require
three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.

where do the 34 bit constant values that are concatenated with the
serial number to form n1 , n2 , n3 come from \? are they changed from chip to
chip , or session to session \? (even if they 're published in the ny times ,
if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks , when using triple
encryption , then there 's no break in security. but why allow that kind
of weird format \? if those three 34 bit values are truly random bits , then
maybe it 's used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack , if
it exists , ca n't be easily used to derive s1 and s2 for a whole production
run of these chips....)

i ca n't answer all our questions in detail , but i can take a stab at
them.

the form the operations that compute r1 , r2 , and r3 is , of course , the
famous ``triple encryption'' suggested for use with des. it 's much
stronger than a single encryption , and has an effective key length of
160 bits. for reasons that were discussed when des was first
standardized , a simple double encryption would not have the same
strength. triple encryption has been used by ibm since more or less
the beginning to encrypt other keys. it 's recommended for anything of
very high value. and i think we can agree that the r i and s i fit
that description.

why n 1 , n 2 , and n 3 \? well , you need different plaintext values. i
have no idea if they 'll be disclosed or not. at a guess , they 're
constructed so that they differ in as many bit positions as possible.
a goo cryptosystem will scramble things a lot with even a 1 bit change
but the values of n in a series will have fairly similar bit
patterns , and there might , conceivably , be a weakness. so the n i
values are and i'm guessing chosen to increase the hamming
distance.

in any event , i'm quite convinced that one cannot go back to the s i
from the u i , let alone u. (observe if the nsa has u , they do n't
need to find s i. but even if they do , they ca n't get u 1 and u 2. in
theory , they should never even see those values , even with a warrant.)

the real question , i think , is why use this scheme at all , as opposed
to a hardware random number generator. my answer is that this is
much more verifiable. look suppose that nsa , nist , the aclu , the
eff , and the nra combined to build a really good random number
generator , and that it passed every test you could think of. when you
come back next week to program some more chips , does it still work that
well \? have any components changed in value \? have the components been
changed out from under you \? does it still work well the in the
presence of a focused microwave beam that tends to bias it towards
selecting 1 bits \? yes , you can run detailed statistical tests on it
again , but that 's hard.

consider , on the other hand , a software solution. you bring your own
floppies with you , you can run cryptographic checksums , etc. it 's a
lot easier to verify that the software is unchanged , in other words.
(yes , i can think of ways to cheat software , too. i think that they 're
a lot harder.)

there are three issues with clipper. the first is whether or not the
architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working. my answer ,
with one significant exception , is yes. i really do think that nsa and
nist have designed this scheme about as well as can be , assuming that
their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping , under
certain carefully controlled circumstances , with a minimum risk of
abuse. (the exception is that u exists outside of the chip , on a
programming diskette. that 's seriously wrong. u 1 and u 2 should be
loaded onto the chip separately.) to those who disagree (and i do n't
claim my answer is obvious , though i found my own reasoning
sufficiently persuasive that i was forced to rewrite the conclusions
section of my technical analysis paper i had originally blasted the
scheme) , i issue this invitation assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system , with complete regard for civil rights and
due process. what would you do differently \? in answering this
question , please accept nsa 's fundamental assumptions that both
strong cryptography against outsiders , and the ability to wiretap
some domestic users , is necessary. (if you feel it necessary to
challenge those assumptions , do it in the context of the last issue i
present below. right here , i'm discussing just the technical
aspects. and no , i do n't by any means claim that just because
something can be done , it should be.)

the second issue is whether or not this whole architecture is actually
going to be used. just because clipper chips are made this way does n't
mean that that 's the only way they 'll be made. maybe the nsa will
substitute its own chips between the programming facility and the
shipping dock. and they 'll generate bogus warrant requests , so that
the escrow agents do n't wonder why they 've never called. (``sorry ,
guys all them terrorists and drug dealers and pedophiles seem to have
bought triple des phones instead. who 'd 'a' thunk it \? '') i have no
answer to this question , and at the moment , i do n't see a way of
answering it. those concerns are part of my reasoning in my answer
to the final question , below.

the third , and most serious issue , is whether or not clipper is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.
i think that the answer is no , but it 's not a no brainer. i'm a civil
libertarian , not a libertarian , for reasons that i explained at great
length on the net in the elder days , and that i do n't have the energy
to repeat now. but that means that i'm willing to accept that some
laws are necessary , so long as they respect the essential rights of
individuals. the government already has the ability and in our
system the right to issue search warrants , and while that power has
certainly been abused , it 's also been used quite properly and fairly in
other cases. is key escrow sufficiently different \? i think so but
again , it 's not an easy question for me. (it is easy for libertarians
to answer , of course , since clipper is completely alien to much of the
rest of their (oft admirable) philosophy. and it 's also easy for those
who give their unreserved trust to government , a group i'm much more
distant from.)

you needed an export lisence for these systems.

now i knew the nsa was watching this traffic (just like they are watching
this traffic.)

and what do you know... two weeks later an agent of the us government shows
up in my office to remind me if we or our agents sold systems into the evil
empire , we had better make sure the export lisences were handled properly.

he was part of a five man office in columbus ohio ! ! who did this stuff
based on sources he could not reveal. (i assume most of the time these
guys sat around the office with their thumbs up their ass as there is n't
that much stuff coming out of columbus )

wow , the electric utility in prague sure is a big worry for these folks )

the point is , we have created a giant bureaucracy (nsa) with a budget
bigger than the cia 's who , like all bureaucracies , fill their time looking
for things to do. the evil empire is gone. the nsa is not. they will do
something to fill their time and justify their budgets. (i just wish they
too would sit around with their thumbs up their ass... but that is too
much to hope for... they will spy on us and do things like skipjack and
subvert people like dorothy denning.) sigh...

it is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks
messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. the announcement was
silent on this. the betting seems to be that once your key has been
obtained (by the authorities , by divorce lawyers , by the mafia , by the
fbi , by lost or stolen backup tapes , by the nsa , etc.). all previous
conversations are unsecure. (session keys are negotiated , but knowing
the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security. no doubt more details will emerge.)

it is completely clear. you have to assume that each byte that was encrypted
by this 'clipper chip' has been compromised.
some people wondered , why denning , hellman and others did not respond ,
when asked what would be done about such compromised phones , or if
compromise could not be restricted in time. (i did too) let us just assume
that a) they do not know and b) those who know do n't tell and c)
they do not care. it seem 's to be an 'other person 's problem' ...

somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

that was probably me.
i meant only that nobody has overreacted yet. it seemed to me that
jerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting , and i
vehemently disagree. i see a lot of talk , but not much action.
i see now that i misunderstood jerry 's position.

the reason is very simple how many people do you want to die in a riot \?
in a new civil war \?

everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it , and i'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper.

not this bunch. they 'll just bitch on the net for a while , and
then go back to lurking.

can people work within the system before trying to break it \? examine your
history books , and find out how many armed revolutions led to democratic
(or democratic style) governments. i think you 'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history.

actually , it 's not quite that bad , but it 's close.

look , we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out , but we
do n't use it. we clearly do n't need to go burning things down , but we
clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out.
unfortunately , the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time , so the masses wo n't react and throw them out.
eventually , the masses will react , unless the bums cease their
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy.
the sooner it happens , the less the damages will be. i do n't want to
live in a war zone , either i want to see the bums thrown out before
they do some real damage.

i 'd use a secret (nope , obscure) cryptographic encoding to expand the
30 bit serial number to a 64 bit block. the redundancy hereby introduced
can be used to detect tampered clipper signals where some public enemy
replaced the l.e. block by random data.

and of course the l.e. block would be used to initialise the encryption
of the user data so that at the receiving end the correct l.e. block must
be processed in order to have any chance of getting the plaintext back.

for those of you who might want to mangle the l.e. block (e.g. by xor ing
a constant pattern) on the transmission line and restore it before feeding
it into the receiving crippler chip i would add further encrypted copies
of this block (perhaps created by repeated application of the encryption
algorithm or so) at regular intervals during the transmission. if the
receiving chip detects a mismatch it must assume that the line is bad and
it will cease to work in your own interest you are protected from getting
faulty plaintext , you know it 's just like a checksum for your own
safety (.

the `monitoring agencies' wo n't have the famous black box which is needed
for actual decryption and will be kept by the fbi but nothing prevents
them from using special boxes which will do the redundancy check for the
serial number block and consistency checks on the embedded l.e. blocks
within the transmission. these boxes will turn a red light on as soon as
they detect a bitstream that violates the correct protocol.

so do n't anyone think that you can use the chip and fool l.e. about the
tapping key i bet the developpers have provided much better checks
than those suggested above. of course it 's absolutely crucial that the
algorithms (and protocols) remain secret. personally i doubt they will.

it is still easy to conceal super encryption , at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the k key , which can take a while ,
presumably not in near real time. (worst case , in which the escrow agencies
provide the u key to the local cops , still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant , unless the same key is used for both directions ,
which i suppose the capstone version of the chip will probably insist on.)

unless there has been a major change in the law , there 's no such beast

yes there is , the patent can be classified as secret. i recently
saw a patent from 1947 (dealing with nuclear weapons technology)
that was only declassified in the last couple of years. there
is of course the problem of enforcing the patent.

the same thing applies in civilian development you ca n't patent something

ever does get exposed you still have some legal protection.

this is absolutely right.

if you want your opinions to be taken seriously it is very important
that you state those opinions in a manner that is understandable and
seems reasonable to a layman. do n't overburden your reader with technical
details or expect them to know the history of various encryption
technologies. before you mail it , hand your letter to a non technical
friend and ask them to sanity check it.

above all , realize that legislators are often motivated as much by
self interest as by anything else. try to point out risks in terms that
will be meaningful and motivating to them such as the loss of individual
privacy rights or the damage restrictive export regulations do to american
businesses' ability to compete in the global marketplace. pull the
strings that you think will work with your legislator if your
legislator is unlikely to be swayed by civil rights concerns then point out
how a government granted monopoly for mycotronx damages the competitiveness
of businesses in your district that manufacture or market phone or crypto

net , i think) discussing three potential replacements for des. was
anyting ever done with these \? are khufu , khafre , and or snefru still
being discussed anywhere \? (i know snefru is referenced in the rsa
faq , and i think it may also be in the sci.crypt faq.)
on a related topic , can anyone point me toward good sites to find
papers articles discussions of cryptology \? i think i 've about exhausted
the math sci library here , which does n't seem to have anything more recent
than about '84.

thanks.

john kelsey

khufu and khafre are both patented ( 5003597). biham and shamir showed
that differential cryptanalysis can break 16 round khafre with a chosen
plaintext attack using 1500 different encryptions. khafre with 24 rounds
can be broken with the same attack using 2 53 different encryptions.
(there are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks , if
someone wants to take the time to look.)

khufu has key dependent s boxes , and is immune to differential cryptanalysis.
source code for this algorithm (and khafre) are in the patent.

snefru is a public domain one way hash function. the version of snefru
that produces a 128 bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis
(vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force) for
four passes or less. given that , sha and md5 are much more efficient.

oh yes , anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact dave petre ,
director of patent licencing for xerox , (203) 986 3231.

how come the media is not telling about the provisions of the clipper
decision \? ...

how can the bulk of the people be informed , when the media refuses to
do it \?

the answer to your second question lies in the way you phrased the
first one 'the media is...'.

the medis is n't 'is'. the media 'are'. 'media' means 'more than one
medium.' there are thousands of publications. some say this , some say
that.

how can the bulk of the people be informed , when they wo n't read
informative publications \?

because much of the public are n't even aware of the names of informative
publications. look at the 'wealth' of material on the typical newsstand.
unless the person is working in some kind of technical environment , with
the usual trade journals , all they ever see is the media (note media
in this context is the popular media tv , radio , daily newspapers , and
such publications as time , newsweek , and all that). and they all say
pretty much the same thing. i see most of them being in the range of
center left to far left , and generally supportive of pie in sky
we will take care of you think for you cradle to grave. there seems
to be an air of arrogance that the individual is not capable of
understanding major issues so the media does n't bother to inform them
(as with clipper , for example) or tells the people how to interpret
events in others. what is lost sight of is that the people are not good
at understanding things because they are not told accurate information
about them. it is a lot to expect of the people for them to be
clarirvoyant. for example , i would have been unaware of clipper had
i not picked it up on usenet. how much of the population has usenet ,
let alone internet access \?

for access to better publications , the person has to spend time digging.
many folks , especially who work long hours , have families , etc. , do not
have time to go digging , and many are not (yet) aware things are wrong ,
so are not motivated to dig. not saying its right , just saying that is
the way things are. people are n't upset about things when they are n't
told. and the less than objective media is a major contributer to the
problem.

and then compound that with an attitude of arrogance in the civil service
(bureaucrats , politicians) that act as if the person without political
connections , or deep pockets (potential contributer) should have few if
any rights , being a resource to be used by those in control for their
polticial or financial gain. some law enforcement agencies act as if
they regard the common person with a rather intense degree of contempt ,
peons that are supposed to do what they are told , and get very nasty
when someone questions them. the media pundits editors , etc tend to
fall into those with privilege , and tend to not be upset by the current
state of affairs. the fellow in dc , who shot the swimmer in his jacuzzi
for daring to swim in it , with an illegally owned gun (violating the law
he pushed to be foisted on everyone else) , ends up walking where a less
well connected person would have been crucified. a typical example of
one standard for 'us' , a much more restrictive standard for 'other folk'.

perhaps i am not real eloquent in expressing this , but the solution
sure as hell is not to make it harder for people to find out what is
going on , or dismiss their concerns because one happens to be in a position
where one feels they are exempt or insulated. such as that hypocrite of
a journalist in dc described above. one notices that these less than
complimentary points about that double standard was not covered in the
media. i feel the reason was it dovetailed with their political views
on the subject , and it involved a 'brother' journalist.

is n't it time for our 'objective' media , the main source of info for the
average person , to start being what they claim to be , instead of spin
doctors for the statist elements \?

about 50 people so far have asked , once the fbi gets your clipper keys ,
wo n't they be able to read all your future and past traffic \?

there has been no response from nist , nsa , ms. denning , mr. hellman , or
anyone else who might be able to give us an authoritative answer.
this is troubling.

did n't nsa think about this \? or is it a feature , and they thought we
would n't notice \?

i would have thought that by now they would have responded with something
of the form , well , that wo n't be a problem because ....

don alvarez posted a good partial solution to this problem to
comp.risks. i 'll present my variant on it instead , since i feel it 's a
bit stronger against some likely attempts to cheat. depends on the
protocol that 's followed for reading traffic. briefly , the cops get a
wiretap warrant , and record the call. they then notice the encryption
and the disclosure header. it , along with a copy of their warrant , is
sent to the fbi , or whoever it is who holds the family key. the
f holder decrypts the header , and sends the serial number n and the
encrypted session key u k to the escrow agents. they , in turn , use u1
and u2 to recover k , and send that to the local police.

note how this solves the problem of wiretapping forever. neither the
cops nor the fbi ever see u , so they ca n't read other traffic. every
request must be validated by both the fbi and the escrow agents. the
cops and the fbi together ca n't cheat , since they do n't have u. (i
regard that as a likely pairing of folks who might try to beat the
system. it 's to prevent this that i modified alvarez 's scheme.) the
escrow agents ca n't read the conversation , since they do n't have it
all they have is n and u k . and the police do n't even see n.

it 's harder to see how to block decryption of old , warrantless ,
wiretaps. there is one protection you have to persuade the escrow
agents that the call is current. but that 's not nearly as strong.
there are approaches i can see that might work , involving sequences of
data on an unalterable medium , complete with cryptographic protection
against insertion onto a new medium. but i do n't have anything yet
that is n't too complex for comfort , or too hard to install in the real
world. the nsa might have an answer they may or may not be smarter
than me , but i 've been working on this for a week , and they 've had years.

2) how can we trust the escrow agencies \?
3) it is not cost effective
4) we want other encryption systems , the government seems to want to

5) anyone can build a non key system
6) we are worried about a back door
7) once everyone uses a clipper chip , the mechanism for a big brother
government is in place , a change of government can lead to it.
especially since the escrow agencies operation is not governed by
law (so the president can change the rules to allow free access to
the keys at any time , e.g. , during war)
8) few criminals are caught by wiretaps , the cost and risks are unjustified

the proposal could be modified so that if they get a court order to tap you

yes , but will they buy you a ticket on a time machine to allow you to
go back and use the phone with the new key instead of the phone whose
key they obtained \?

it is unclear whether obtaining the key at time 0 also unlocks
messages recorded (by whomever) at earlier times. the announcement was
silent on this. the betting seems to be that once your key has been
obtained (by the authorities , by divorce lawyers , by the mafia , by the
fbi , by lost or stolen backup tapes , by the nsa , etc.). all previous
conversations are unsecure. (session keys are negotiated , but knowing
the private key is believed by many commentators here to break the
security. no doubt more details will emerge.)

so , the loss of a key , whether one is guilty or innocent , may mean a lot
more than merely replacing the phone.

sort of like saying to someone , oh , i copied your diary. but i 'll buy
you a new one.


and the system , if made mandatory (as i expect) , will make such
storing of conversations much easier , i fear. for one thing , the
transmission of the escrow key field acts as a clear signal to anyone
listening , a kind of caller id and callee id on a grand scale.
also , the phone companies may not care as much about protecting the
privacy of the calls , as they perceive them all to be useless
encrypted junk. (this is a bit of a reach , i know , suggesting that the
clipper will make security more lax...).

anyway , still lots of issues unresolved.

ok , andrew , i 'll provide some evidence. a friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a west coast office. they routinely sold
equipment to the japanese. one day , the japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products.

this company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field
offices. the japanese had simply intercepted it. so my friend , the computer
systems admin , came up with a solution. he started sending the data out
double block encrypted with des.

two days after this new distribution plan was implemented , the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. they told him to
knock it off . the president gave in , since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government.

now , if the government was n't monitoring the communications , how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed \? further , since encryp
tion is n't illegal , and des certainly is n't , what is the basis of the
government 's cease and desist demand \?

the spooks do whatever they think is necessary , with or without the blessings
of the law. i 'll say no thanks to clipper , or anything else the government
produces. for the moment , double or triple des is probably adequate. and when
the line is idle , send random garbage , just to keep 'em busy.

we do need an alternative to nsa bugged telephones , but

qualcomm had spare cycles in the dsps for their new cdma digital
cellular phones. they wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
had the capacity. the government decided to discourage them.

really , none of this stuff is especially hard. all you need for a true
private phone is an isdn codec , a vocoder (either a chip or
software) , an encryptor (a chip is fine , but software is more than
fast enough) , a v.32 or v.32bis modem module , and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing. its easy to do , its cheap. and
any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit
from the boys in the dark suits from washington , just like qualcomm
did. i suspect that companies like cylink are tolerated because their
products are too expensive.

however , no law yet stops one from building really private phones , in
spite of the hints the administration has made when discussing the new
crime bill and in connection with the clipper skipjack big brother
chip. someone out there will build a unit to do all this. better yet ,
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a

you could just as well use a 16 character password to perform the encryption
of the 64 zero bits. one simple method would be to use the first 8 characters
to encrypt the 64 zero bits and then use the remaining 8 characters to
encrypt the result again. the output would still be 64 bits which encodes
into 11 ascii characters.

would n't this method be vulnerable against a birthday attack \?
currently a cracker needs to find the only ( 1) key that produces
the given ciphertext. he has to try about 2 63 keys on the average.
in the proposed method the cracker only needs any pair of key halves.
if he can store about 2 32 guesses for one half , he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about 2 32 guesses. (here i have assumed that the
des encryption is reversable , if the key is guessed. is this so or do
the modifications of the s boxes by the salt bits make it non reversable \? )

1 probably there is only one key i think there is 1 chance in about 128
that there are two or more keys (can anyone verify this \? ) , but this does n't

encryption technologies are currently reguarded as arms by the
feds , hence the export ban. while the second is under enough
attack for guarrentteing our rights to fire arms , perhaps we
should reflect on this as well. (perhaps fire arms are not the
only weapons covered under the second amendment)

hmmm... i would n't consider encryption to be a weapon. how would the
government classify encryption \? seems to me that encryption ought to
be covered by the first amendment. using this line of reasoning , the
government should n't be able to restrict what data people encrypt and
what encryption algorithms they use because this would be restricting
one 's freedom of speech. in other words , encrypted data text ,
graphics , or other information is just another form of free speech.
for this reason the government should n't be able to regulate the use
of encryption algorithms and encrypted data. the only time the
government should be able to 'force' someone to reveal his or her
encryption keys for some encrypted data is when the encrypted data
in question may be something that is n't protected by the first
amendment such as kiddy porn. even in a case like this the
government should be required to get a search warrant before coercing
someone into revealing the keys.

btw , what encryption methods are considered to be state of the art
nowdays. have the feds relaxed export restrictions on des yet \?
also , is des still regarded as a good form of encryption \?

how fast do the fastest modems go \?

v.fast is targeted for about 28kbps 14.4kbps is 500 , and 19.2 may
be here soon too. (remember to ignore compression figures which make
your modem go faster on compressible data , because voice gets
compressed better than that , and encryption makes further compression impossible.)

how far can voice be compressed \?

the stu iii phones on the market from at t , motorola , and (i forget who else) ,
give you a choice of 9600 , 4800 , and 2400 baud. the 9600 and 4800 are celp ,
and i think the 2400 is some earlier military vocoder stuff.
9600 is decent , 2400 is pretty artificial , anything less is speak spell.
16000 can produce quite adequate sound. there 's also some 8 kbps celp around.
dsps have made it possible to do all this in real time for cheap.

old hand government crypto have trouble adjusting to systems faster
than 9600 baud , because if the voice on the other end sounds good ,
you assume the crypto has n't been turned on yet )

brad yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a
phone clipper relationship.

it does n't wash.

recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect 's phone
calls. they do what they do now figure out which lines to tap. they then
record the stuff. if it 's clipper , they read the law enforcement block ,
extract the serial number , and get the keys using the court order.

no new difficulties (such as using someone else 's phone instrument or phone
line) are introduced that would n't have existed absent clipper. if the
crooks were going to use a pay phone (say) , they could have done so without
clipper. if the government figures out they 're so doing , they listen in , and
if it 's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys.

if the crooks use an innocent person 's clipper phone on the tapped line
there 's no problem. the feds do n't care whose phone instrument is used , just
that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. they get the
serial number , get the keys , and they are in business.

no clipper chip to person association is ever needed.

clipper also allows an extraordinary opportunity for the criminal to
conceal use of super encryption. an automated full system surveillance
mechanism (quite feasible across radio bandwidth) which knows family key f ,
can validate clipper wrappers and n esn associations , but it cannot reveal
in realtime the use of super encryption , unless it knows all unit keys ,
which we are being assured are only to be made available in two separate
pieces , upon specific wiretap like order.

the serial number will be in a 64 bit block , with a 34 bit filler. does n't
take a lot to check to see if that is correct.

there are three issues with clipper. the first is whether or not the
architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working. my answer ,
with one significant exception , is yes. i really do think that nsa and
nist have designed this scheme about as well as can be , assuming that
their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping , under
certain carefully controlled circumstances , with a minimum risk of
abuse. (the exception is that u exists outside of the chip , on a
programming diskette. that 's seriously wrong. u 1 and u 2 should be
loaded onto the chip separately.) to those who disagree (and i do n't
claim my answer is obvious , though i found my own reasoning
sufficiently persuasive that i was forced to rewrite the conclusions
section of my technical analysis paper i had originally blasted the
scheme) , i issue this invitation assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system , with complete regard for civil rights and
due process. what would you do differently \? in answering this
question , please accept nsa 's fundamental assumptions that both
strong cryptography against outsiders , and the ability to wiretap
some domestic users , is necessary. (if you feel it necessary to
challenge those assumptions , do it in the context of the last issue i
present below. right here , i'm discussing just the technical
aspects. and no , i do n't by any means claim that just because
something can be done , it should be.)

ok steve , here 's a sketch of an alternative that i believe addresses
most of the objections to the clipper scheme.

notation
concatenation
exclusive or
e(m , k) message m encrypted by key k
d(m , k) message m decrypted by key k
h(m) hash (digest signature) of message m

important values
u0 x local chip unit key from escrow agency x
u1 x remote chip unit key from escrow agency x
n 0 serial number of the local chip
n 1 serial number of the remote chip
a number of escrow agencies
k 0 , k 1 session keys agreed upon external to this protocol
f family key , need not be secret

protocol
choose k0 1 , ...k0 a such that k 0 k0 1 ... k0 a
remote chip does same for k 1 , k1 1 , ... , k1 a .

compute the following

l0 1 e(k0 1 , u0 1 )
...
l0 a e(k0 a , u0 a )

l 0 n 0 e(n 0 l0 1 ... l0 a , f)

remote chip does the same for l1 1 , ... , l1 a , l 1

send l 0 to remote chip and receive l 1 from remote chip

compute

ke 0 h(k 0 n 0 l0 1 ... l0 a
k 1 d(l 1 , f)

kd 0 h(k 1 d(l 1 , f)
k 0 n 0 l0 1 ... l0 a

note that d(l 1 , f) n 1 l1 1 ... l1 a

remote chip does the same for ke 1 and kd 1

user data is encrypted (decrypted) with keys ke 0 , ke 1
(kd 0 , kd 1 )

assumptions
no trap doors in e() , d() and h(). h() is not invertible.

algorithms for e() , d() and h() are secret. otherwise a software
implementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip.

the chip only supports the following operation

1) return n 0
2) load k0 x
3) return e(k0 x , u0 x )
4) return e(n 0 l0 1 ... l0 a , f)
5) given e(n 1 l1 1 ... l1 a , f) ,
return n 1 , l1 1 , ... , l1 a
6) load k 1
7) given e(n 1 l1 1 ... l1 a , f) ,
compute ke 0 , kd 0
8) given m , return e(m , ke 0 )
9) given m , return d(m , kd 0 )

anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying
the chip (u 1 , ... , u a , f , n 0 ).

u 1 , ... , u a can not be determined except by destroying the chip.
(unfortunately this may not be true in reality. i suppose it 's
possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a
sophisticated sp \? x ray machine to look for blown fuses.)

the u 's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.

notes
for tapping escrow agency y is given n 0 , e(k0 y , u0 y ) , n 1 ,
e(k1 y , u1 y ) and returns k0 y , k1 y .

lea 's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from
both chips and the encrypted partial keys. this allows the agencies
to record that both chips were tapped.

lea 's only get the session key , not the key to all conversations
of a particular chip. this precludes real time decrypting of a
conversation but that is n't one of the stated requirements.

observation
in order for any secure by tap able communication scheme to work ,
the active parts need to share a secret. and if this secret is
revealed , communications by those that know the secret can be made
un tap able . obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm
and the master (family) key. relative size and complexity suggests
that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the
scheme a lot easier and faster than the algorithm.

three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way.

where do the 34 bit constant values that are concatenated with the

chip , or session to session \? (even if they 're published in the ny times ,
if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks , when using triple
encryption , then there 's no break in security. but why allow that kind
of weird format \? if those three 34 bit values are truly random bits , then
maybe it 's used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack , if
it exists , ca n't be easily used to derive s1 and s2 for a whole production

one of the great things about human beings is that they are capable of change

a message digest algorithm maps a message of arbitrary length to a
``digest'' of fixed length , and has three properties computing the
digest is easy , finding a message with a given
digest ``inversion'' is hard , and finding two messages with the
same digest ``collision'' is also hard. message digest algorithms
have many applications , including digital signatures and message
authentication.

rsa data security 's md5 message digest algorithm , developed by ron
rivest cite rfc md5 , maps a message to a 128 bit message digest.
computing the digest of a one megabyte message takes as little as a
second. while no message digest algorithm can yet be em proved
secure , md5 is believed to be at least as good as any other that maps
to a 128 bit digest. inversion should take about 2 128
operations , and collision should take about 2 64 operations. no
one has found a faster approach to inversion or collision.

recent work by den boer and bosselaers cite den boer md5 presents
a special kind of ``pseudocollision'' in md5 's
internal compression function , which maps
a 512 bit message block x and a
128 bit input state s to a 128 bit output
state. they show how to find a message block x
and two related input states s 1 and s 2 that yield the same
output state f(x , s 1) f(x , s 2) . their well thought approach
exploits structural properties of the collision function to find
a pseudocollision in about 2 16 operations , much less than one
would expect.

practical implications of this pseudocollision work to the security of
md5 are not evident. while a real collision in md5 implies a
pseudocollision (or a ``pseudo inversion'') , a
pseudocollision need not imply a real collision. indeed , a real
collision , since it involves two different messages , would almost
always involve em different message blocks x 1 and x 2 such that
f(x 1 , s 1) f(x 2 , s 2) , but the pseudocollisions have the same
message blocks. moreover , the input states s 1 and s 2 would
generally be unrelated , but the pseudocollisions' input states are
the same except for four bits. there does not seem to be any way to
extend den boer and bosselaers' approach to anything beyond the
special pseudocollisions , a limitation they readily admit.

it is reasonable , therefore , to believe that md5 remains secure. while den
boer and bosselaers have found interesting structural properties in
md5 , the properties seem only to lead to special pseudocollisions
and not anything approaching real collisions. further research , of
course , will give a better understanding of the strengths of md5 and
other message digest algorithms , with the eventual hope that
such algorithms can , in some sense , be proved secure.

ok , andrew , i 'll provide some evidence. a friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a west coast office. they routinely sold
equipment to the japanese. one day , the japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products.

this company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field
offices. the japanese had simply intercepted it. so my friend , the computer
systems admin , came up with a solution. he started sending the data out
double block encrypted with des.

two days after this new distribution plan was implemented , the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. they told him to
knock it off . the president gave in , since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government.

now , if the government was n't monitoring the communications , how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed \? further , since encryp
tion is n't illegal , and des certainly is n't , what is the basis of the
government 's cease and desist demand \?

something similar has happened to me ages ago when we were working on pgp
we used to send short messages about development issues or simply to test
new features around. now at this time pgp (and certainly the newer version)
was unknown over here. suddenly the admin at the site i was using received
a request that i stop sending encrypted email. now there is almost no way
that some automatic scanner could have found this , since they would n't have
known about pgp they must have checked for unknown data types in the
message , tried to unscramble it , found they could n't get past the pem
armour part , and then contacted the sysadmin and asked me to stop. luckily
the current email carriers are less picky about what goes over their
networks ).

in case people think email scanning does n't take place , i can assure you
that it is done regularly by many sites usually not by government
agencies (or at least not that i know of) , but by local administrators who ,
for reasons of their own , have decided to monitor all communications
(i'm sure you can all think of a whole mess of reasons stop hackers
terrorists child pornographers drug dealers evil commies whatever). there
have been several occasions when i 've got people into trouble simply by
including the traditional nsa bait in a message (i do n't try it any more
now ). a friend of mine was once picked up for mentioning the name of
the uk town of scunthorpe (hint look for words embedded in it). i'm sure
there are many more examples of this happening (in fact if anyone has any
examples i 'd appreciate hearing from them i could use them as
ammunition during talks on privacy issues).

subject authentication and one time pads (was re advanced one time pad)
summary presents one time pad based mac
organization australian computing and communications institute
lines 93

in article 1s1dbminnehb@elang05.acslab.umbc.edu olson@umbc.edu (bryan olson cmsc (g)) writes
the one time pad yeilds ideal security , but has a well known flaw in
authentication. suppose you use a random bit stream as the pad , and
exclusive or as the encryption operation. if an adversary knows the
plaintext of a message , he can change it into any other message.
here 's how it works.

alice is sending bob a plaintext p , under a key stream s
alice computes the ciphertext c s xor p , and sends it to bob.

eve knows the plainext p , but wants the message to appear as p'.
eve intercepts c , and computes c' c xor p xor p' s xor p'.
eve sends c' to bob.

bob decrypts c' by computing c'xor s p' , thus receiving the
false message which was substituted by eve.

firstly , an aside

i agree that the weakness exists , but i have a lot of trouble
believing that it represents a difficulty in real life. given

1. the purpose of the one time pad is to give unbreakable security ,
and the expense of key distribution etc. , imply that the clients
really do want that level of security

2. these same people want to keep p a secret

i find it hard to believe that eve might happen to have a copy of p
lying around.

(i am aware that the same argument applies to eve knowing even a small
part of the message , but eve must know exactly where (which bytes) in
c her known susequence starts , or the result will be garbled. i find
this at least as surprising.)

back to the question

if i had the resources to use a one time pad for such transmissions , i
would also append a message authentication code to the message , using up
the next bits of the one time pad as the key perhaps. your original
question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the
message with the same degree of security as the pad itself provided ,
and i do n't know the answer. however , i would propose the following
for discussion.

alice and bob have an arbitrary number of secret , random bits to
share , which eve does n't know. she finds them out (effectively) by
knowing some p and the corresponding c. it is the fact that they
correspond that causes the problem. if a message authentication code was to
be created using some one time pad operation such that eve could not
know which parts of the mac were affected by which parts of the input ,
she would be unable to forge a mac to correspond.

what is required is a non linear combiner of parts of the message.
(non linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever does n't
have exactly the same effect).

now , at the end of the encrypted message c , alice appends a n bit mac
computed as follows (s2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad)
1. compute c2 p xor s2 , and pad to an n bit boundary with more of s
2. break c2 into n bit chunks
3. set mac to 0 (initialisation vector)
4. for i in each chunk sequentially
set mac mac nlop c2 i

at the end of this process mac is the message authentication code.

(bob verifies the mac in the obvious manner he recovers the
plaintext p , then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the mac in
the same manner.)

nlop is the non linear operator , and there is the rub. the simplest
non linear operator i can think of is an s box that is , have a fixed
(even published) permutation of the n bit integers , an indexable table
called sbox , and use
x nlop y x xor sbox y .

practically speaking , i think this solves your problem , as eve never
sees the intermediate output c2 , and hence ca n't deduce s2 or perform any valid
substitution on it.

also practically speaking , you want the mac to be fairly large , say 32
bits , but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) s box , so you might
work on 4 byte sized s boxes , but i think that is an irrelevant detail
for the discussion at hand.

who will be first to point out my errors , or give me a pointer to some
literature \?

you are misinformed. but this whole issue is off the topic.

somebody once said something like armed violence is meant only to be

second question why ! \? ! \? why is such a strange procedure used , and
not a real rng \? this turns those s1 , s2 in a kind of bottleneck for
system security.

the only theory that makes any sense is that s1 and s2 are
either the same for all chips , or vary among very few
possibilities , so that anyone trying to break the encryption
by brute force need only plow through the possible serial
numbers (2 30 , about one billion) , multiplied by the number
of different s1 , s2 combinations.


suppose instead that s1 and s2 can be reconstructed given 3 or 4 of the
unit keys generated in a single batch (through some sort of known
plaintext attack , say). suppose further that 3 or 4 of the chips
programmed in each session never find their way into commercial
products , but instead end up elsewhere .

suppose the folks at elsewhere can determine a unit key , given
physical access to one of these chips. then those same folks can
determine s1 and s2 for the whole batch...

too many suppositions \? yeah , probably.

now that makes sense. but the other half must be in a non government

good idea , but why put all the eggs in one basket \?

given that the escrow keys are generated 200 at a time on floppy disks , why

i suspect the government feels it is enough to prevent companies from
offering secure encryption services. big companies do n't take that
kind of risk. they 're too visible and have too much to lose.

the us government may not have to make encryption illegal to prevent its
use. if they could credibly say to ibm or mit you will receive no us
government money next year unless you follow these voluntary guidelines on
use of encryption , i doubt either organization would delay making use of
encryption a violation of local policies. the us government gets much of
its power by making it impractical to operate without getting money from the
government while putting restrictions on use of such money that would be
illegal if they were enacted as laws.

the point of the matter is that yes this is a serious problem. but it is
not the end of the world. guess what \? we 're doing something now you

it , (or rather , you 're complaining about it) and nobody is shooting at us.

we would like to keep it that way. thats the point. by reacting
strongly and forcefully now , we will assure that we continue to remain
free. you cannot overreact to a threat like this. the worst that
happens if we overreact is that we waste time and effort. the worst that
happens if we underreact is tyranny. i prefer overreaction myself.

guess what people \? you live in one of the few countries in the world
where a person can complain without getting shot at.

does n't that tell you how precious and hard to maintain freedom is \?

only through centuries of overreaction have we managed to maintain
ourselves in this state of even moderate freedom. i suggest that

i do n't wish to rehash the pgp patent issue at all , but i do feel
that some potential misconceptions in interpretting intellectual property
laws need to be raised.

in article a rubin.736125803@dsg4.dse.beckman.com a rubin@dsg4.dse.beckman.com (arthur rubin) writes

if pgp violates rsas patents , then only executing pgp could be a violation.
distributing pgp could be contributory infringement , but the pgp
documentation seemed sufficient to me to protect distributors (before i
deleted it using pgp might be a patent violation in the us , so i have no
need to keep it.)

you are correct that executing pgp would be a violation (unless the patent
were declared invalid by the courts) , but... there is a question as
to when , how , or if distributing pgp would be a violation. if the person
or company distributing pgp receives money for doing so , then it is
clearly a sale (for example , if it were on compuserve , they charge you
for access so they would be selling pgp). when there is no charge for
pgp things get less clear , but there would still be a reasonable view
that it is inducing an infringement.

... nb re jim bidzos
you have no legal action you can take , unless you believe you can prove
someone is using pgp in the us , for a purpose other than that specifically
allowed by patent laws. (not entirely correct , anyone can sue for any
reason , but , you cannot prevail unless you can prove that by a prepoderance
of evidence). under patent laws , pgp does have legitimate uses , as a means
to study your algorithm , in order to produce improvements (which would
still require your approval to execute , until the patent runs out around
2000).

this is a common misconception. the patent laws do not mention any valid
purpose for infringing a patent. although it is clear that in order to
create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing
a prior patent , one must perform research on an existing patent. to
just say that you infringed a patent (assume we 're not talking the rsa
patent) only for research purposes (wink wink , nudge nudge) and then never
develop any related invention (ie. only use it) , would be a clear
infringement.

btw i'm working on one.

you should realize that form letters are the worst way to influence
your congresscritters exact copies are routinely placed on the lowest
rung of the opinion ladder.

if you want to write (and i think you should ! ) , take the time to really
write a letter. things to emphasize

it 's been said that usenet is available to the 'technical
elite' , i.e. the techies at corporate sites and universi
ties. emphasize that you are part of the group that will
be making developing using clinton 's 'data superhighway.'

explain how you are intimately familiar with both computing
and data communications. (if this is the case do n't call your
self an 'expert' after wiring in a 1200 bps modem.) this
will distinguish your letter from the random flamers. do n't
turn it into braggadocio just tell them that you know the
technical sides of the issue.

do n't overdo jargon and gobbledygook. remember , your letter
will be first read (in all likelihood) by a staffer who may
even be a college student if they do n't understand it , your
views wo n't even make the 'running total' sheets.

be concise do n't ramble. rants are definitely out of place.
cite references , if necessary , but only use accepted references
like academic journals. my neighbor jim is not a real refer
ence. 8)

unfortunately , very few congresscritters really understand
electronic communications. encourage them to pick up access
to compuserve , america online , or one of the free nets. offer
to send them samples. if you are in a position to do so , offer
them (or their staffers back in the home state) access to your
systems. offer to give a demonstration the next time they 're in
town. your offer to get personally involved in helping them
will give your opinions more credence.

in addition to sending mail to your representatives , send mail
to the members of the committee (or subcommittee) that is dealing
with the issue. if your congresscritter is n't on the committee ,
they ca n't be of much help until the matter comes to the floor.

ps i 'd suggest drawing analogies between digital communication and the
more traditional media , but usenet does n't have a decent track record

organization the world public access unix , brookline , ma
lines 68

my original post was

i am building an oracle v6 database to serve as a repository for
information which is considered proprietary or confidential. as such
i want to verify the security of oracle passwords and apply some of
the same security checking techniques we use on our nix systems.
specifically i would like to use crack , or something like it to check
the encrypted data for easily guessed passwords.

the use of 'crack' would depend on oracle using the unix password
encryption scheme , does anyone know if this is the case , or what
method is used \?

any other methods for security checking audit in the oracle
environment would be much appreciated.

this article will just scratch the surface of a few security
considerations , comments are requested. (email fw@world.std.com)
my thanks to the people who responded , both on usenet and from
oracle corp.

the most common response was to suggest use of oracle audit
features or ops passwords to control access (opinion on ops
included suggestions to use and not use). i was also advised to
use table views to refine the granularity of access control.

one important security consideration in networked installations
is that ops accounts presume that the client host provides user
authentication. os 2 server ops users are only as secure as the
least secure machine on the network. hence you should probably
not define any ops accounts on systems with pc 's , or limit access
of ops accounts to data with no security concerns. unix oracle
servers provide for disabling ops access over the network (orasrv
option) , while relying on host security for local processes.

internally oracle provides powerful and well documented (sic)
audit mechanisms which the dba will use to monitor system and
data access. these tools can be used to track the primary security
risks from within the oracle environment.

oracle password security is based on a proprietary usage of des
encryption. oracle corp. states that the algorithm is not prone
to cleartext attack. this is a difficult claim to substantiate
since the algorithm is unknown. the concern here is that if users
choose easily guessed passwords. if a cracker can gain access
to your oracle database files through the host operating system ,
s he could extract the 'cyphertext' password data and apply
cryptanalysis techniques to learn the users passwords.

as security risks go , the above scenario is pretty low severity.
certainly once an intruder has access to the raw database files ,
s he can access to the data in them. if a cracker could break
the passwords , however , s he could do substantial damage without
alerting the auditing mechanism 's , and leaving and audit trail
which would point to valid users. at present oracle (like unix)
provides no native means of ensuring that passwords are not
guessable.

as with all computer security , the most important defense is to
educate users in the safe choice of passwords. these techniques
are well discussed in internet rfc 1281 and the crack manual ,
(both available from ftp archive servers) and , unix(r) system
security (curry , david a. addison welsey 1992)

this only makes sense if the government prohibits alternative non escrowed
encryption schemes. otherwise , why not just use the front end without
clipper \?
because everyone but you expects that making alternative methods of
encryption illegal is the next step. otherwise the cripple chip is
utterly worthless. it should be obvious that
a) the cripple chip is aimed at spying on ordinary citizens
or
b) that other forms of encryption will soon be illegal.

a
hearing on the questions raised in this letter. there may also be a
follow on
hearing dedicated to the clipper chip , but that 's not definite.

glenn ,

thanks for posting that. i was surprised to notice , however , that one
question i might have expected to be asked was not are all forms of
strong encryption other than the clipper to be made illegal \? speaking
of which , is anyone aware of whether that question has been asked of
any knowledgeable or official spokesperson for the government \? i have
not yet seen it mentioned in any of a dozen places it might have been
reported , but i could have easily missed it.

please let us know if you get a solid answer to the question of legality
of other strong cryptosystems. so far any references i have seen
have been weasel words ( more plans in the future , etc ) , but nothing
that could be taken as a no (strong crypto will not be outlawed) . i
have heard (not verified) that the crime bill before congress has
language that either requires escrow of keys , or that will regard
all systems 'unapproved' for public use , like strong cryptosystems
not trivially broken by the govt , or without escrowed keys
which one cannot readily change (read use being only permitted by
folks with 'special' connections , or government agencies) as either
'terrorist tools' or 'drug dealers tools'. not outlawed specifically
but by added civil forfeiture powers , and clever wording , effectively
outlawed for all intents and purposes.

now , for some idle speculation ... for those who do n't care , hit 'n' now.

crypto being effectively outlawed could be done without specifically
outlawing any class of crypto systems. for example , a crowbar , hammers ,
screwdrivers , and such can be regarded as 'burglar tools' pretty much
at the whim of the authorities , based primarily on the individual
possessing them in the car , etc. not being in a trade that makes routine
use of these tools. in a like manner , one who has no 'legitimate need'
(gov't definition) for strong crypto software or systems , and is caught
using them , might find themselves in possession of 'terrorist tools'.
in other words , if one is not working for a corporation with extremely
sensitive commercial data that warrants (in the fed 's opinion) strong
security , or a government agency , and securing only work related data ,
not personal data , one will most likely be nailed on this if discoverd.
a personal desire for 'privacy' most certainly will not be regarded as
a 'legitimate need'
why do you want such strong security , especially from 'legitimate law
enforcement' \? an individual with 'legitimate' endeavors would not be so
concerned government is not in the business of revealing your personal
secrets to the public... so you must be trying to conceal or planning
to conceal some unlawful or criminal activity... do you have something
to hide , hmmmm \?
i expect that initially there will be some people selected either at
random , or who happen to have been 'troublemakers' for the purposes of
'making an example' for those who think the feds are not serious about
this... (mega ' ( 's)

one asking about a 'right' to privacy will probably get a response that
there is no constitutional right for privacy spelled out as such (an
argument used in the abortion debate) you do not have a right to have
security that 'legitimate law enforcement cannot break' (as suggested
in the clipper press release).

this , in a nutshell , is what i find so extremely frightening. not only
for crypto systems , as in this case , but for the precident it will set ,
laying the groundwork for future erosions of privacy (escrow of both
safe deposit box keys 'master' keys or combinations for privately
owned safes , and so on. why not \? )...

i cannot think of a better way to make an 'end run' around those
'inconvenient' parts of the us constitution. a law cannot be easily
declared unconstitutional , if it there is no specific law. it would
simply be a minor extension of the rico statutes or wod policies. a
simple policy decision , just like so many of the gun regulations are
mainly batf policy decisions... the conversation of the fed agents
would go something like

we are gonna seize your home , your computers , your car , your bank
account , (you do n't have to undress and give us yer clothes , unless you
have a floppy in yer pocket) because they are all connected with your
acquisition , transport , and use of 'terrorist tools' and or 'drug dealers
tools' part of the wod or against terrorism , ya unnerstand... no
decent american subject would be against these noble causes... .

note we are not accusing you of any wrong doing ... we are only saying
your home , computers , car , bank assets are connected with wrong doing
somehow they housed , transported , and funded these 'terrorist tools'.
only a civil matter ... heh heh ... we had this 'tip'... grin .

therefore , the constitutional protection on individual rights do not
apply we are 'arresting' the tainted property... not you... evil grin .

if you wish to deposit a bond , hire some attorneys , and go to court to
prove the innocence of this property (that they are not 'terrorist tools'
and again to prove they are not also 'drug dealers tools') , go ahead ,
we have no problem with that ! 'course , with your bank assets seized ,
no car , computer , or home , (probably no job , too) and your
less than limitless resources , you might run into some minor practical
difficulties grin ... .

that is what has me going so damned ballistic... it is exactly how
the logic goes when someone gives a 'tip' that your home has been
used to store drugs... note no trace of drugs need to be found on
the property... only some bozo who will say 'yup. i stored stuff in
that dude 's house...' (probably to get out of a 10 year sentence for
dealing). much more cost effective to let him walk , to bust another
day , and hit the jackpot with your assets...

ob disclaimer (of course)...

ok , note that i am not a lawyer , and can only base these speculations
on what i have read heard been told regarding past civil forfeiture
cases , and how they are used to augment the budgets of assorted agencies ,
or to get 'cooperation' of folks who just want to be left alone , or who
do not wish to be put in a risky situation (especially in areas where
they are denied either meaningful police protection , and the means to be
able to even pretend to defend themselves , as is quite common back east ,
like nj , ma , nyc , wa dc , or out west in ca). these people have the
choice of cowering under the government boot , or cowering under threats
of pissed off drug dealing gang bangers... helpless in either case...
all behind some dude who drops a dime on you for his gain , or behind
the feds wanting to 'make an example'... civil forfeiture being the 'hook'.

point is , are these speculations way out of line , or are they all too
typical , and if so , does the extension to crypto and just about anything
that the feds regard as 'inconvenient' seem reasonable \? and if not
why not (what are our guarantees , besides the government promises) \?

none \?

revised , april 21 , 1993

the chips are programmed by mykotronx , inc. , which calls them the
myk 78. the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc.


all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif (secure compartmented
information facility) , which is essentially a vault. the scif contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips. about 300 chips
are programmed during a single session. the scif is located at
mykotronx.

acknowledgment and distribution notice. this article is based on
information provided by nsa , nist , fbi , and mykotronx. permission to
distribute this document is granted.

so , who is mykotronx , inc. \? it would be nice to know that they were
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the
u.s. government. trusting the fox to guard the chickens , and all that.
seems suspicious when the rest of the sources are foxes.

while we are at it , the chip design(s) should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon ,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm. it would be a
shame if some three letter agency had the ability to interrogate my chip , when
all i 'd know is that someone rang , and when i attempted to go off hook the
line went dead. could be even worse if the chip were intended to connect
directly to a modem.

the design examination should be done to the gate level. does anyone have
a good idea how to tell if there is a piggyback design on silicon \? the model
would be extra logic sharing pins with the advertised function. tip offs
would be circuitry that would ignore incoming data if formats or sequence
is not right. i can think of only two ways an output pin could be used ,
and its possible that might be noticed , but could be edited from the netlist.
i think the silicon itself needs to be investigated. imagine a design
done in two layer metalization , yet finding a third layer under the
microscope.

the government is asking for a lot of blind trust the encryption algorithm ,
operating protocols , the agency having physical control of the devices , the
silicon implementation. i 'd feel like keeping one hand on my wallet.

just curious , how would the clipper chip system handle
conference calls \?

depending on the encryption system , so long as everyone has the same
key , it can be done. for example , i was using vat , which is an
internet audio tool , for a conference call , and we were encrypting the
session. (unfortunately , one site was doing more work , and did n't
have the cpu for it , so it did n't sound all that good at a different
site)

you would have to use something other than the at t black box in other
words , i do n't think public key would work. the session key would have
to be agreed upon prior to the conversation and distributed to all
sites beforehand.

meeting of the uk cryptoprivacy association


saturday , 8 may 1993 , 1500

to be held at the offices of

forest
4th floor
2 grosvenor gardens
london sw1w 0dh

this is located at the corner of hobart place , a couple of
blocks west of victoria station , and almost directly across from
the dark green cabbie shelter.

if you have trouble finding the place , please call the office on
071 823 6550. or , call me (russell whitaker) on my pager ,
081 812 2661 , and leave an informative message with the
telephone number where you can be reached i will return the
call almost immediately.

discussion will range from the usual general topics , such as the
use of secure public key cryptosystems to protect message data , to
specific topics , such as recent moves by the u.s. government
to restrict choice in data privacy (reference recent discussion
on usenet groups , e.g. sci.crypt and alt.security.pgp).

all are invited. particularly welcome are members of the
newly formed uk community group ... the local
eff in spirit if not in name folks.

those who plan to attend should email me and let me know.
please.

all attendees are requested to bring diskettes preferably
ms dos with their pgp 2. public keys. as is usual at these
gatherings , several of us will bring our laptops , and will sign
public keys , subject to the usual caveats (reference the
documentation for pgp 2.2 , specifically files pgpdoc1.doc and
pgpdoc2.doc).

if you do not already have a copy of pgp 2.2 (ms dos) , and would
like to have a copy of this public domain program , please bring
a formatted , medium or high density 3.5 inch floppy pc diskette
you will be provided a copy of the program.

of course , you might prefer to ftp a version of the program from
one of the various archive sites. i suggest trying demon
internet systems , which carries the full range of pgp (phil
zimmerman 's pretty good privacy ) implementations directory
pub pgp at gate.demon.co.uk.

meetings are of indeterminate time. those who are interested
are invited to join the rest of us at a pseudorandomly
determined pub afterwards.

please note

in the past few months , interested people have emailed me ,
requesting faqs and special information mailings. i regret
that , except in very unusual cases (e.g. working press) , i
cannot , in a timely manner , respond to these requests. i will ,
however and for the first time do a writeup of this meeting ,
which i will post in various places.

what i am willing to supply is general information on our
activities for the maintainers of existing faqs , such as that
for alt.privacy. faq maintainers can contact me at

subject basic crypto requirements
organization express access online communications , greenbelt , md usa
lines 20
nntp posting host access.digex.net


in order to have formulate a rational position on what cryptography
policies are acceptable , we must set forth a list of basic requirements.
i would propose the following as a starting point

1. the algorithm must be publicly known , and must have a record of
surviving attempts by outside experts to find weaknesses.

2. the system implementation must make it possible to verify that the
advertised algorithm is , in fact , the one that is being used.

3. the key must be quickly changeable by the user , and must be of a
sufficient length and complexity to defeat any brute force search
possible now or in the reasonably near future.

note that these requirements are not incompatible with some form of key
escrow system the may 1993 issue of byte describes an example of an
encryption system which can clearly be implemented in a manner consistent
with the above requirements while requiring that parts of the key be
escrowed in order to have one 's public key listed by a central distributor.

letter of interest follows

april 19 , 1993

the honorable ronald h. brown
secretary
department of commerce
14th and pennsylvania ave. , nw
washington , dc 20236

dear secretary brown

as you know , i have long been interested in the privacy
and security of telecommunications transmissions and data in
a networked environment. recent reports concerning the
administration 's endorsement of an electronic encryption
standard , based upon clipper chip technology , have raised a
number of related issues. the international competitiveness
of u.s. high tech manufacturers and the software industry is
a key factor that the government should consider when
addressing issues of encryption and data security. as the
nation moves forward in developing the national
communications and information infrastructure , security of
telecommunications transmissions and network data will be an
increasingly important factor for protecting the privacy of
users.

the hacker community can compromise the integrity of
telecommunications transmissions and databases linked by the
network. the people and businesses that use the nation 's
telecommunications network and the personal computers linked
through it increasingly are demanding that information be
protected against unauthorized access , alteration , and theft.

i am concerned that the administration 's plan may mean
that to remain competitive internationally , u.s. companies
would be compelled to develop two products one for u.s.
government customers , and another for private , commercial
users who may want a higher encryption standard. this may
inadvertently increase costs to those u.s. companies hoping
to serve both markets. to assist the subcommittee 's analysis
of this issue , please respond to the following questions

1. has the encryption algorithm or standard endorsed by the
administration been tested by any entity other than nsa , nist
or the vendor \? if so , please identify such entities and the
nature of testing performed. if not , please describe any
plans to have the algorithm tested by outside experts and how
such experts will be chosen.

2. under the administration 's plan , what entities will be the
holders of the keys to decrypt scrambled data \? what
procedures or criteria will the administration utilize to
designate such key holders \?

3. does the encryption algorithm endorsed by the
administration contain a trap door or back door , which
could allow an agency or entity of the federal government to
crack the code \?

4. it is clear that over time , changes in technologies used
for communications will require new techniques and additional
equipment. how will encryption devices adapt to the rapid
advancement of telecommunications technology \?

5. what additional costs would the proposed encryption place
on the federal government \? what is the estimated cost to
consumers and businesses which opt for the federal standard
in their equipment \?

6. what is the commerce department 's assessment of the
competitive impact of the administration 's endorsement of the
clipper chip technology on u.s. exports of computer and
telecommunications hardware and software products \?

i would appreciate your response by no later than close
of business , wednesday , april 28 , 1993. if you have any
questions , please have your staff contact colin crowell or
karen colannino of the subcommittee staff at (202) 226 2424.

sincerely ,

they 're betting that you ca n't cryptanalyze e to get u given n .
... but we ca n't
do this right now with des , even knowing the encryption method without
doing almost the whole 56 bit search.

that is not true , with chosen plaintext attacks des keys can be determined
without the full search.

by almost i mean the differential cryptanalysis attack. the chosen
plaintext attack requires a detailed analysis of about 2 36 chosen plaintexts
drawn from a total of about 2 47 that need to be run , if i understand the
situation correctly. this is certainly a break under the meaning of the
act , but does not constitute much less work than the brute force keysearch.

the rest of his article assumes that we can figure out the skipjack
encryption algorithm e by choosing the correct data to send through it and
observe the results. i wish him joy of it , and choose not to try that attack.

i am not defending the system , and in fact am offended by the ideas of
escrowed keys or a secret algorithm becoming a de facto industry standard.
however , i also object to opposing it for the wrong reasons , since that
weakens the case against it.

i said (in my private e mail)
it 's not clear that the experts will be told f. in fact , i 'd be surprised.
i 'd expect something more of the form of the fips pub describing des , so that
they could look at the algorithm in general , rather than with the specific
set of keys chosen.

oh come on , thats like saying you could evaluate des without the s box
constants.....

no , it 's quite different. the government would have no percentage in
choosing f to be a weak key , since it 's not to their advantage to have
anybody else know it. the experts could thus assume that f is no worse
than anything else during their analysis. totally different situation
from unknown s boxes. again , i'm not saying it would be good or
satisfactory for the experts to just be given the raw algorithm without
the rest of the surrounding details regarding the chip and protocols and
so on simply that i doubt that they would be given all the
information.

ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses , so be it.

ah , but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government 's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate , into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping.


but the nsa will not be doing any wiretapping. the actual wiretapping will ,
presumably , be conducted by the fbi. of course , the capability for this was
provided by the nsa , but i think that they are still within the limitations
of their charter.

i realize this is a fine point , and some may differ , but this is my opinion.

true , but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access , but to make access more expensive (in time ,
money , manpower) than it is worth.

another idea use a laptop computer. as mentioned earlier , the lcd screen

the fact that the nsa is listening may affect your willingness to use
wimpy crypto technologies , but it may also affect your willingness to
use technologies that violate rsa 's patents , e.g. if you use pgp , the
nsa may tell rsa that you 're doing so , and if the secret service catches on ,

i'm afraid i have to disagree with you on that point. nsa will not
tell rsa or any other non dod entity anything that its eavesdropping
reveals. that includes the fbi and secrect service (although there

you 're reading far too much into this (aside from the obvious fact
that you should n't hold anybody to what they wrote in a 10 year old
book in a rapidly changing field like this.)


quite simply she says that the security should not depend on the
secrecy of the algorithm. a secret algorithm can still be secure ,
after all , we just do n't know it. only our level of trust is
affected , not the security of the system.

the algorithm could be rsa for all we know , which we believe to
be secure.

they have a much better reason to classify the algorithm than to
protect its security. they want to protect its market share.

if they publish the algorithm , then shortly manufacturers would
make chips that implement the algorithm and standard but do not
use a key stored in escrow. and of course , everybody would buy them.


the whole push of this chip is that by establishing a standard that
you can only use if you follow their rules , they get us to follow
their rules without enacting new laws that we would fight tooth and
nail.

quite simply , with clipper established , it would be much harder for
another encryption maker to define a new standard , to make phones that
ca n't talk to the leading phone companies. the result is tappable
cryptography without laws forbidding other kinds , for 99 of the
populace.


to get untappable crypto , you would have to build a special phone that

that 's the chicken and egg of crypto. the government is using its
very special ability to solve chicken and egg problems of new

it 's almost admirably clever. when the eff started , i posed the question here
what are the police going to do when they wake up and discover they
ca n't wiretap \? and nobody here had an answer (or even thought it was
much of a question)

then came the backdoor and digital telephony bills , which we fought.

second question why ! \? ! \? why is such a strange procedure used , and not
a real rng \? this turns those s1 , s2 in a kind of bottleneck for system
security.

the only theory that makes any sense is that s1 and s2 are either the
same for all chips , or vary among very few possibilities , so that anyone
trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the
possible serial numbers (2 30 , about one billion) , multiplied by the number
of different s1 , s2 combinations.

my interpretation of denning 's description is that s1 and s2 are chosen
randomly by agents of the key escrow companies at the start of each 300
chip programming session. i imagine that the chips are in a carrier which
will allow them all to be programmed fairly quickly there would not be
a need to transfer chips one at a time into a little pla programmer as some
people have envisioned.

my guess as to why this procedure is used is that basing the keys on the
s1 and s2 using a specified algorithm provides an (in principle) checkable
way to verify that no back doors exist in the choice of the random numbers
used to generate the keys. since we have to trust the escrow companies
anyway , it does not weaken the system to have the keys be generated from
random seeds entered by the escrow agents. and since the algorithm for
key generation is public (modulo skipjack secrecy) then in principle an
agent could challenge the procedure , ask for s1 and s2 to be exposed , and
run his own independent calculation of u1 and u2 to verify that that is
what is actually being put onto the floppies.

and yes , there are many ways in which failures to follow this scheme could
be hard to check. the laptop probably will not really be destroyed each
time. hidden cameras in the ceiling could see the s1 and s2 entered by
the trusted escrow agents. back doors in the chip could allow u to be
recovered. heck , each chip could be recorded with the same u , ignoring
what was on the floppy.

some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is
listening in on everything and one will have to hide one 's clipper messages
somehow if non escrowed crypto goes away.

a little perspective might be in order.

the number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. law enforcement has to
present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
authorizations.

thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
recorded by the government , and for that to happen they have to
a) have a pretty good reason , with evidence
b) use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons.

though the system may be imperfect , it is a long way from the horror stories
some here seem to believe or anticipate.

would wiretap chip be cost effective \?

by robin hanson
draft , april 21 , 1993

summary compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars ,
wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police. so the
proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part
in three thousand to be cost effective.

background

until now , phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps ,
detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line. and over
time , law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to
aid in criminal investigations. however , powerful new encryption
technologies threaten this status quo , by making possible truly
private communication. a small chip in each phone could soon make it
literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical
microphones at either end.

in order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap
phone conversations , the u.s. government announced on april 16 , 1993
that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip
to be placed in future phones , instead of the total privacy chips
which have been under private development. the same day , at t
announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone
products .

each chip would be created under government supervision , when it would
be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key. periodically during
each conversation , the chip would broadcast its identifier and other
info in a special law enforcement block . law enforcement officers
with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the
indentifier from special trust agencies , and could thereby listen in
on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone.

to date , most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its
security. the government wo n't disclose the encryption algorithm , and
many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it
has claimed. the track record of previous governments does not
inspire confidence on this point 1 .

however , this paper will neglect these concerns , and ask instead
whether this new wiretap chip is a cost effective tool for police
investigation. that is , which is a cheaper way for society to
investigate crime force phone communications to support wiretaps , or
give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways \?
or to put it another way , would police agencies be willing to pay for
each wiretap , if they had to pay their share of the full social cost
of forcing phones to support wiretaps \?

to start to answer this question , we might compare the current
benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected
costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan. and since current
benefits are easier to estimate , we begin there.

wiretap benefits

1990 is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available
2 . in that year , 872 wiretap installations were requested , and no
requests were denied. (this figure does not include wiretaps obtained
with the consent of a party to the conversation.) 2057 arrests
resulted from wiretaps started the same year , 1486 arrests came from
wiretaps in previous years , and 55 of arrests led to convictions.
76 of the wiretaps were for phones (vs pagers , email , etc.) , 60 were
regarding drug offenses , and 40 were requested by federal
authorities. each wiretap installation heard an average of 1487
calls , 22 of them incriminating , among 131 people , and cost an
average of 45 , 125 (extrapolating from the 794 installations
reporting costs) , mostly for labor.

thus a total of about 40 million was spent on wiretaps , to obtain
about 4000 arrests , at 10 , 000 per arrest. thus these arrests are at
least four times more expensive than the 2500 per arrest figure one
gets by dividing the 28 billion spent by all police nationally by the
total 11 million non traffic arrests 3 . thus the 30 million per
year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police
expenditures. and if we divide this by the 138 million phone access
lines in the country 3 , we get about 23 cents spent per year per
phone line , or about two cents a month.

in general , we deter a given class of criminals through a combination
of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted , and some
expected punishment level if convicted. so the social value of having
wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get
the same criminal deterrence through other means. if unable to
wiretap a particular suspect 's phone , police might instead use hidden
microphones , or investigate that suspect in other ways. or police
might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps. or
we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime.

if we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be
on average twice as expensive as wiretaps , then the annual social
benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level
of two cents a month per phone line.

wiretap costs

let us for the moment optimistically assume that the us government
encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would
have offered instead , protecting our conversations from the spying
ears of neighbors , corporations , and governments , both foreign and
domestic. even so , the need to support wiretaps would add many
additional costs to build and maintain our communication system.

extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions ,
increasing traffic by some unknown percentage. a special process must
be used to add encryption keys to chips , while securely distributing
these keys to special agencies , which must be funded and monitored.
the chips themselves are designed by a military contractor , whose
design is to remain secret , and are manufactured through a special
process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart.
(chips are now offered at the relatively high price of 30 a peice in
lots of 10 , 000 4 .) private encryption systems not supporting
wiretaps would require none of these extra costs.

perhaps most important , government degree would at least partially
replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to
be represented , encrypted , and exchanged in our future phones. it is
widely believed that governments are less efficient than private
enterprise in procuring products and standards , though they may perhaps
perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private
standards. how much less efficient is a matter of debate , some say
they pay twice as much , while others might say only 10 more.

currently , a total of 96 billion is spent as operating expenses of
u.s. phone companies 3 , which comes out to about 60 per month per
access line. if we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per
month , we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even
as much as one part in 3000 , then wiretaps are not cost effective !
and this does n't even include extra costs phone owners pay because
their encryption chips are more expensive. of course most phones
would n't have encryption chips for a while , but the wiretap benefit
per phone is still the same , so this argument still applies.

conclusion

given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the
phone system and the value of wiretaps , we can justify only the
slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps.
when the only modification required was to allow investigators in to
attach clips to phone wires , wiretap support may have been reasonable.
but when we consider substantial modification , the burden of proof is
clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs
would really be less than the benefits.

if consensus cannot be obtain on this cost benefit estimate , a
compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a
rate of say five cents per month , a tax payable to police agencies
nationwide to compensate them for their loss of wiretap abilities.

well , actually , this one 's easy. it 's their job. the nsa is
supposed to develop cryptosystems. if the government chooses to go
ahead and sell those cryptosystems to the masses , so be it.

ah , but developing cryptosystems which are specificially designed to
protect the government 's domestic spying capabilities takes them beyond
that mandate , into the forbidden field of domestic wiretapping.


the nsa 's charter forbids them from doing any purely domestic
intelligence work , i would think that even providing assistance in
development of the skipjack algorithom is a violation of that charter.
but as with any intrenched government agency , they will do what they

i just joined this group recently and really do not know much about
cryptography , but a couple things came to mind while reading through
the posts.

1. is the clipper chip going to be exported \? if not , how will
people communicate with other countries \? will they have to do
that in un crypt mode. will other encryption techniques be
legal (assuming the government cracks down on using others) when
going overseas , but not within the states \?

2. i 've read about authentication systems that use an electronic
security card that looks like a calculator to create an encrypted
pin based on the time date. the host system has the algorithm
built into it as well so that it can authenticate a user.
is there some form of encryption technology that would create
keys that are only valid at a certain instant in time \? the
systems would then allow a window of time around this instant
where the key would work.
i realize that this technique would increase the amount of information
needing to be stored because you would need entire algorithms rather
than just keys. but for smaller scale things it might work.
could some similar method be used to make the two 80 bit keys that
are issued to police fbi etc to tap a phone only usable for one week
(for instance). if further surveilance was needed , they would have
to go back to the escrow service to get another key. this would
make it useless for local police to database keys they have used.

i assume this is not possible because the receiving phone would need
to be able to decypher the message. but any thoughts on the subject \?

analyzing chips to understand process technology , design rules ,

and therefore the probable current cost and possible future cost curves ,

taiwanese , japanese and especially korean semiconductor manufacturers
have all (korea continues) reverse engineered foreign chips and
produced the chip. taiwan and japan have signed intellectual

design before laying the chip out again. the koreans still
use mask level copying , i believe. at least , they are under a lot
of pressure to pass laws to meet international intellectual property
standards.

all this despite lots of attempts to hide the designs. there are lots
of techniques to do so in both hardware and software design.

for a complex chip , there will be real intellectual effort extracting
the gate design from the transistor design , and the algorithm from

there are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject. for

if the crooks use an innocent person 's clipper phone on the tapped line
there 's no problem. the feds do n't care whose phone instrument is used , just
that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. they get the
serial number , get the keys , and they are in business.

no clipper chip to person association is ever needed.

yeah , but who wants to start a pool on the first person arrested
mistakenly and has their life turned upside down because some law
enforcement agency does make a chip person association \?

i wonder if there are any plans to keep these records (e.g. encode the
serial number into the upc scanned at k mart along with the credit
card info , voila.)

at least your phone number tends to only locate to your house or
whatever (i.e. to be coming from your telephone number the person
likely is in your house etc.) , plus or minus some shenanigans of
course.

but i 'd hate to think of these guys getting the clipper id , recording
the conversation , then doing a quick cross lookup and your name comes
up as owner of that id (mistakenly , maybe you sold the phone at a
garage sale or the phone was stolen from your car or whatever.) they
might only know who one side of the conversation is , for example.

anyone who thinks the govt is forbidden by law to cross correlate such
databases loses two points. first , law enforcement agencies can of
course do this. second , they 're only forbidden from budgeting any
money for it. the irs , for example , does do this anyhow. they just
do n't spend any money on it so it 's (technically) legal i guess.

instead they probably trade little favors with companies like
mastercard (if you 're the irs i 'll bet you have a lot of
opportunities to trade favors with major corps for their databases.)

i know , an irs guy read an amazing list off to me (from his screen , i
could hear him typing to pull up each screen) once on the phone during
a dispute i had with them (to intimidate me , actually , not much of a
dispute , i did n't particularly disagree , but for some reason this
fellow wanted to play tough guy with me , i hope he 's better now.)

amazing stuff he had at his finger tips. be afraid.

you would be arrested as an international arms trafficker.

there are several things in itar which have never been tested in court.
the concensus appears to be

you could be arrested as an international arms trafficker. (you could ,
regardless of the state of the law , but there are some paragraphs which
suggest you would be violating the law.)

if it goes to court , the itars could be thrown out is incompatible with the
first amendment or the court could rule that software is technical
data not subject to the itars or the court could rule that the
phrase publicly available as defined in the itars would apply ,
making it only subject to requiring a general export license or , you could
be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage. general
concensus among lawyers who have read the itars , is that one of the first
two would occur.

this is troubling.

it was implied in the first technical posting by dorothy denning that the

whether the fbi would just decrypt the session keys for the locals , or would

one thing i'm a bit puzzled by why are n't they doing this with a public
key scheme of some sort \? you could generate two uniqe public private pairsor
for each chip. then , escrow the private keys with the escrow agencies. set
the protocol up to encrypt the session key with both public keys. to decrypt
a message , both escrow agencies (in the right order , for most pk schemes)
have to decrypt with the escrowed private key. this way , there would n't be

wcs@anchor.ho.att.com (bill stewart)

my question was

how sensible is des encrypted data towards bit errors \? how much data per
bit will be lost in average (i assume you still have the correct key) \?

how much of the des encrypted data is affected depends on the used
encryption mode. according to marcus j ranum (mjr@tis.com) there is

cfb cipher feedback mode
ecb electronic code book mode
cbc cipher block chaining mode
ofb output feedback mode

each mode does some stuff better than others. ofb and cfb are designed
for communications streams more than for files.

unfortunally , people strongly disagree which mode will lead to destruction
of all of the following data. sure seems that some modes will resync quite
fast , others will never , others will even only effect the very block.

summarized , people said concerning this matter


in cbc mode , only the current block will be affected (tarnold@vnet.ibm.com

it depends on the mode you 're using. for a single 64 bit input block , a
one bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits in other words , it essentially turns the output block into
a random number. if you 're encrypting data in cbc mode , however , only the
one 64 bit block will be affected. the next block , and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly.

it 's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely.

how sensible is des encrypted data towards bit errors \? how much data per
bit will be lost in average (i assume you still have the correct key) \?

it depends on the mode you 're using des in.
electronic code book (ecb) takes a block of 64 input bits
and produces 64 output bits , so if any bits are changed ,
the entire block of 64 bits becomes bad.
i forget which feedback mode is which.
in all of them , the results of encrypting one block affect later blocks.
with some modes , the system self synchronizes , so errors are repaired
in a few blocks. with other modes , once one block is bad ,
all later blocks will be bad too.

there 's also the framing problem. if you have a bit change ,
the block that it 's in changes , and maybe later blocks also change.
but if you have bits lost or bits added (64 bits in , 63 or 65 bits out) ,
everything is confused after that.



from marcus j ranum mjr@tis.com

depends on the mode you 're using. cfb , for example , synchronises
pretty fast. figure a bit error will destroy the current block and the
next one.

the security of the system does depend only on the secrecy of the keys.

the ability to tap is an inherent insecurity which depends fundamentally on
the secrecy of the algorithm. to spell it out , because so many people seem to
miss the point , if the algorithm were published , anyone could create a chip
which would work correctly with the skipjack chips but which would not have
its key registered.

i believe there is no technical means of ensuring key escrow without the
government maintaining a secret of some kind. for example , the secret could be
the private keys of the escrow agencies their digital signatures would be
required before a key could be used. in this case , the nsa nist whoever has
decided that protecting the entire algorithm is easier cheaper more secure than
other possible protocols.

and just were would you put that bridge \? if it is n't at one of

most of the people using encrypted conference bridges these days are
military (or equivalent , like cia and other embassy personnel) ,
so putting bridges on the recipient 's location is normal
it 's in a vault on a military base or ft. meade , and the
secure phones are in sound proof rooms with big locks on the doors
because they 're talking about classified stuff (or golf with other generals.)

that paradigm will change as we start using encrypted phones in our
offices or homes to carry on normal conversations about dinner plans
and stock purchases and meeting schedules and technical info
and the good batch of illegal frop that we got last weekend from bob
most people do n't use sound proof vaults , and may use bridges in their
pbx or from the local phone company (3 way calls) or long distance
or value added phone company (e.g. alliance conference bridges).

if clipjack is mainly used for the radio portion of cellular phones ,
the conferencing aspects do n't change. but there may be a market niche for
trusted conference bridge providers , though i suppose the inquisitors
would try to get a blanket wiretap authorization for many bridges ,
just in case a bad guy might use the service.

i speculate , from the mykotronx data sheet on the myk 78 , that the algorithm
is a classified cryptosystem , similar in application to des but cleared by
the nsa for classified traffic , that has been in use for a number of years.
myktotronx refers to it as government type ii encryption , which matches the
designation of one of the types of encryption available on stu iii phones ,
and may be the same as a cryptosystem i have heard called cipher2 .

this would make sense , since this is evidently a field proven cryptosystem
which can act as a pin compatible substitute for des. combined with a
tappable key exchange protocol , this would offer exactly what is claimed for
clipper secure encryption with access via a key escrow. if this is fact the
case , it would make me quite confident of the encipherment algorithm itself.

now , i do not know if these are in fact the same cryptosystem my knowledge
of classified cryptography is n't even fuzzy ) , it 's nonexistent. however ,
it would certainly have been the least effort approach on the part of the
government take an old military cipher that people can drop in place of des
(and which is at least as secure) , set up a key escrow scheme for law
enforcement , and promote it for public use. this also fits with mykotronx ,
who 's been around but almost invisible for years.

because des is not known to have any known plaintext attacks readily

now , it is possible that he noted a weakness in the implementation of

might cut down on the keyspace (not for the user keys for the other
kind who 's name i ca n't remember). however , this is not what was

do n't get me wrong des is weaker than it should be. however ,
cracking it in 15 minutes requires more money be spent on the cracking
machine than any organization i know of has available.

i do n't think that this should be worked on just in the context
of cryptography. that 's sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts

it to signals on its serial port. full duplex. now , this device is not a

for
a) speech synthesis (with a few nifty libraries and some samples)
b) speech recording for electronic messaging
c) building voicemail systems
d) internet talk radio
e) internet relay chat

of course , some of the electronic messaging in item b might be
encrypted , possibly realtime , but that 's the user 's decision. one would
need 2 of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout
to switch over , and some code on , say , a 486 laptop.

i 'd really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive
internet talk radio could be done. ideally , though , it should be a general
purpose device. it should be a general purpose enough device that nobody
should be able to balk at its widespread use. obviously , to make it easy
for homebrewers , it should use pretty common hardware.

it 's interesting to note that i 'd already talked with a couple
of folks about building such a thing , before this whole clipper thing
started. i even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are

may i suggest that any any proposed cipher system
having less entropy than the user 's key and message can have
an embedded subliminal channel as big as the
difference in entropies between the entropy of the user
input (message) and the entropy of the output \?

for example , take plain des. the unsuspecting
user inputs a string plaintext to be enciphered.

he cranks the algorithm which has been hacked
by george quisling and comes out with j 3h4902d.

nine char in and nine chars out. right \?

the unsepecting user ships the ciphertext
to be decrpyted and the message plaintext
is produced. everything fine , right \? nope.


imagine the algorithm did a lz compression
on plaintext before desing. (compressing is
down to four characters with more entropy

9 wj

the opponent now pads the message with his
own message , also compressed

3dk@

before applying des to the concatenated
compressed pairs. when decrpyted , the
first compressed message is stripped off
and declared sent. unbeknowst to the
receiver , the opponents accomplice collects
the remaining message in the bit bucket and
uncompresses to kill now.

and to prevent all such subliminal or covert
storage channels you would need to have
maximal entropy all the time which is
a priori impossible because (for example)
a stereotypical message might be
replaced by one bit in the output reserving
the rest of the output bits for the long
covert message.

in other words , if you opponent get to muck
with the algorithm you either have got to
muck with it last or concede his possible
embedding of covert channels.

in other words , if you present a message
to an opponet with less than maximal entropy
then you have given him free bits of storage.

right now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out
of business. this is a very real possibility. so they really need help in
stopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.

if they 're planning on patenting an algorithm , then i hope they go out of
business as quickly as possible. and you can tell them i said that.

i'm sure many other readers of these newsgroups will agree , too.

you all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.

the question that i have is why cant someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it \? i mean , take the thing to a chip testing
analysis facility , one with a decent electron microscope. just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry. i remembered a place that i use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests. they could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was.

i am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there , especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser , for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it \?

what can the government do to prevent this \? start taking away all
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes \? \?


they are using some technology developed by vlsi systems , the other manufacturer of
the clipper chips , that produces chips that are supposed to be highly resistant to
reverse engineering.

i question whether celp is the best approach for this application. it produces

ouch ! thanks for trying it.

the following program is a very quick hack i created a few months
ago to determine whether a sun sparcstation ipc could perform
real time , full duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today 's modems.

this test program reads linearly encoded audio from the audio device ,
compresses it with gsm 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13 bit samples
recorded at 8khz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 hz frame rate) , encrypts
it with des , then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device. the compressed , encrypted audio stream
is 13 kbits s ( ! ).

my sparcstation ipc (not exactly a very fast machine these days ,
certainly slower than an elc) would just barely sustain this activity
(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible). i
ran it as a real time process to get the best results. remember ,
though , that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved.

the audio compression routines can be ftp 'd from tub.cs.tu berlin.de ,
i believe (look for gsm or toast). i used eric young 's des
implementation but i no longer know where i got it from.

brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid , and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they do n't cooperate.
it 's an important issue , especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they 'd rather stop offering the service.
i assume that if the escrow agent is n't the government ,
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys.

the easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured.
this makes the funding separate from government.

but who 's the user paying the fees here , and what 's the service \?
if the user is the government , then the funding 's not separate from the government.

if the user is the buyer , what 's the service \?
keeping the key for me \? no thanks i do n't need , and wo n't buy their service !
not telling everybody my key \? sounds like blackmail !

if the user is the manufacturer , does the user have a choice about buying \?
the alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it , which is fine
i 'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key !

face it , the escrow provider is providing a service the users do n't want.
the only people who want it are the government , not the users.
what you 're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service , up front or per year , either from general taxes ,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips , or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)

i hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number , especially if the escrow is a government agency.

here in new jersey , we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees. there are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee , though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective.
if you go to a baseball game at yankee stadium , there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.
something could scratch the paint , after all.
and what a shame if your clipper key got out !

dear senator congressman president fill in the blank

i am writing you to voice my strong opposition to president clinton 's clipper
chip initiative. this proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing. the idea that citizens must register their
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret
is patently unamerican. additionally , the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the
clipper chip standard is in place. this latest attack on our civil rights is
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me.

the presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this
is not the case. the fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment
is avalible the criminals , drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press
release will simply use non clipper cryptography. meanwhile the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the
government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. this seems like an
obvious back door for the nsa and law enforcement. if you still do nott
understand my objection to key registration , consider the way j. edgar hoover
blackmailed government officials like yourself would you now use a phone to
transmit personal details of your life that the nsa and fbi have the keys to \?

in this giant bally ho over this clipper chip i noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the e mail and posts i 've tossing back and
forth.
... deleted ...
a circut court judge in illinois once said when dealing with a government
that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry ,
one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means
to parry this attack on personal privacy.

(unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
detectors....)

the point remains. more and more i see the government slowly washing
away privacy. even unwittingly. do you think i will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth \? do you think i
will live in a soceity that insists i register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what i'm saying \? even if there is no evidence of my
guilt \? do you think i will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind \? i'm tired
of it. there is (imho) no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.

more than the proposals themselves , i read the language of the press
releases , the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public , and i am sickened. i am revolted. i am repulsed.

90 , perhaps even 95 of this country could care less about the
clipper chip , the wiretap bill , the smart card , because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the clinton administration.

the problem is , the people are not having the scope , or implicataions
pointed out to them. hell , most have n't even heard of clipper , and
when they do , it will be in soothing language telling everyone how
nice the government is at 'letting them have' privacy.

how come the media is not telling about the provisions of the clipper
decision \? the provisions of the crime bill \? the abuses of civil forfeiture \?
the government uses polls to support 75 percent of the people want
gun bans , etc. , yet the same pollsters have determined (according to
the media) that 30 percent of the people are unaware of what the holocaust
is...

the people cannot be expected to give decent decisions when they are
denied the information that all these abuses and whittling away of
rights are going on quietly. when they find out (when it hits them) ,
it will be too late. one cannot expect each citizen to spend all their
time probing , searching , researching , etc. for example , how big a
percentage of the average population even has access to usenet \? way
less than 1 percent , i bet. how many outside of internet usenet
are even aware of what big brother is doing , or have been exposed to
arguments of both sides of the issue \?

what the public will get is only one side the government 's side.

that is scary.


this saddens and frightens me.

i am a conserveative believe it or not. a law and order conserveative.
but the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me ,
mostly because i know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the american people. tell them it 's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists , and they will let you
put cameras in their home.

how can the bulk of the people be informed , when the media refuses to
do it \?

even in the wake of waco , you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves.

somebody once said something like armed violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack. it is not meant to be used in
agression. this is the difference between self defence and murder.

to be quite honest , the way things are going , i 'd call it self defense.

let 's try to avoid killing things , eh \? there 's enough blood shed in the
world , without adding a couple of riots , civil wars , etc.

i'm probably overreacting. but what i 've read scared me a lot. i do n't
want my children growing up in a war zone.


and i dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera
24 hours a day.

the people at large need to be informed. but how \? i am but one person.
i try to talk to everyone that will listen , but i can hardly make any
kind of dent.

each chip includes the following components

the skipjack encryption algorithm
f , an 80 bit family key that is common to all chips
n , a 30 bit serial number (this length is subject to change)
u , an 80 bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip
...

to see how the chip is used , imagine that it is embedded in the at t
telephone security device (as it will be). suppose i call someone and
we both have such a device. after pushing a button to start a secure
conversation , my security device will negotiate an 80 bit session key k
with the device at the other end. this key negotiation takes place
without the clipper chip. in general , any method of key exchange can
be used such as the diffie hellman public key distribution method.

once the session key k is established , the clipper chip is used to
encrypt the conversation or message stream m (digitized voice). the
telephone security device feeds k and m into the chip to produce two
values

e m k , the encrypted message stream , and
e e k u n f , a law enforcement field ,
...

which are transmitted over the telephone line. the law enforcement
field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u
concatenated with the serial number n , all encrypted under the family
key f. the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after
an authorized wiretap has been installed.

is the u used in the law enforcement field from the phone which placed the
call , from the unit whose 'start secure session' button was pressed first ,
or does each phone transmit its own law enforcement field \? even assuming
one of the first two choices , the fbi is going to get a fresh n , u for its
own database about every other phone call , eventually accumulating keys for
all the phones used to connect to the line they are monitoring , not just
the 'suspects' key. (assuming the ever thrifty fbi does n't forget each key
after its wiretap permission has expired.) not quite a pyramid , but not
bad , either.

hell , just set up a spark jammer , or some other very electrically noisy
device.

as i 've noted , you can likely get around that with a directional
sensor. phased array systems could completely defeat this scheme.

true , but the basic idea behind any communications security system is not
to absolutely deny access , but to make access more expensive (in time ,
money , manpower) than it is worth.

something that no one has discussed yet (or i missed it)

the fbi sets up a wiretap after the court order was handed.
only at this point they can access the line and detect
the serial number n.

what happens next , does the fbi simply asks for the keys
for n , and , since a warrant was issued for the line , the fbi
simply gets it \? what if multiple phones are used from the
same house , the fbi just asks for n1 , n2 , etc. \?

exactly who is to prevent the fbi from claiming some
other serial number , x , was also used over the wirtapped
line and get the keys for x \?

either a second court order (for the specific serial key)
is required (and i have seen no indication of this) , or
the fbi can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any
time , so the escrow key holders are a total fake.

an unrelated issue if and when all phones always use
the clipper chip , how are call transfers going to take

no new cypher is worth considering unless it comes
from someone who has already broken a very hard one.

historically , friedman has been right. it 's really hard to develop
a good cypher. ibm 's lucifer , the precursor to des , turns out to have
been fatally flawed. most of the des like systems other than des seem
to be vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis. the first two tries at
public key encryption (remember knapsack cyphers \? ) were broken. most
if not all of the machine cyphers of the electromechanical era were
broken eventually. attempts in the computer era to home brew encryption
have been disappointing the classic a survey of data insecurity packages
in cryptologia contains analyses and breaking techniques for a few of the
popular security packages of the late 1980s.

a new , proprietary algorithm \? no way.

if the us is permitting general export of this thing , it has
to be weak that 's how the current regulations work. currently there 's
a willingness to allow systems with short keys (32 bits appears to be
no problem the 56 bits of des are too many) or weak algorithms
(i think word perfect qualifies under that rule) to be exported.
i ca n't believe these guys shepherded their technique through the

when it comes down to that , it looks suspiciously like some government

someone had said what can it hurt to allow the government to have
continued access to our communications , they already have it. the
problem is that , yes the do have access , and probably more than
we realize. the government wants exclusive access to communications
intercept here in the united states , cutting out other access detrimental

i also doubt that a certain3 letter agency , that originated the encryption

stikes me that all this concern over the government 's ability
to eavesdrop is a little overblown... what ca n't they do today \?
my understanding is that they already can tap , listen , get access
exc. to our phone lines , bank records , etc. etc again.

well , they ca n't listen in on much of mine , since i already use
cryptography for much of my electronic mail , and will start using it
for my telephony as soon as practical.

however , allow me to tell a parable.

there was once a far away land called ruritania , and in ruritania
there was a strange phenonmenon all the trees that grew in
ruritainia were transparent. now , in the days when people had lived in
mud huts , this had not been a problem , but now high tech wood
technology had been developed , and in the new age of wood , everyone in
ruritania found that their homes were all 100 see through. now , until
this point , no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on
someone 's home , but the new technology made this tempting. this being
a civilized country , however , warrants were required to use binoculars
and watch someone in their home. the police , taking advantage of this ,
would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going
on. occassionally , they would use binoculars without a warrant , but
everyone pretended that this did n't happen.

one day , a smart man invented paint and if you painted your house ,
suddenly the police could n't watch all your actions at will. things
would go back to the way they were in the old age completely
private.

indignant , the state decided to try to require that all homes have
video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. after all , they
said , with this new development crime could run rampant. installing
video cameras does n't mean that the police get any new capability
they are just keeping the old one.

a wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy , that the police had survived all through the
mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will , and that
ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was
expedient was permitted. for instance , in a neighboring country , it
had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to
solve crimes. ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its
expedience. indeed , why have warrants at all , he asked , if we are
interested only in expedience \?

a famous paint technologist , dorothy quisling , intervened however. she
noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating
should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards ,
and the law was passed.

soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths
while speaking to each other , thus preventing the police from reading
their lips through the video cameras. this had to be prevented , the
police said. after all , it was preventing them from conducting their
lawful surveilance. the wise man pointed out that the police had never
before been allowed to listen in on people 's homes , but dorothy
quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of
covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and
mutilation of children. no one in the legislature wanted to be accused
of being in favor of mutilating children , but then again , no one
wanted to interfere in people 's rights to wear what they liked , so a
compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with
microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. the wise man
lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old
lip reading technology , but it was too late the microphones were
installed everwhere.

however , it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities , because some of
them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not
understand. a new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at
all times only in ruritanian , and , for good measure , to require that
they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. after all ,
dorothy quisling pointed out , they might be using the opportunity to
speak in private to mask terrorist activities ! terrorism struck
terror into everyone 's hearts , and they rejoiced at the brulliance of
this new law.

meanwhile , the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all
of this was making a sham of the constitution of ruritania , of which
all ruritanians were proud. why , he asked , are we obligated to
sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police
easier \? there is n't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in
crime anyway ! all it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state !

however , the wise man made the mistake of saying this , as the law
required , in ruritanian , clearly and distinctly , and near a
microphone. soon , the newly formed ruritanian secret police arrived
and took him off , and got him to confess by torturing him. torture
was , after all , far more efficient than the old methods , and had been
recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene
thoughts about tomatoes , which dorothy quisling noted was one of the
major problems of the new age of plenty and joy.

you will not be permitted to export it. at this point , what kind of trouble

first of all , it 's not the thought police , it 's the export police.
if you move overseas with your great thoughts in your head , write the software there ,
and then sell it , the us thought police probably ca n't do too much about it ,
though you might want to check with your lawyer first.

however , if you write the program here , and sell it to furriners ,
you are now an international arms dealer and can get thrown in the
clink for many years , especially if they decide you 'd be a good example ,
and cuban drug dealers and fanatic middle eastern terrorists buy your stuff.

(definitions of public domain are different for itar purposes , so if
you 've got a good enough lawyer who 'll do your case for free after
they 've confiscated everything you own as evidence , you might win.
but nobody wants to go first , since the stakes are quite high.)

hell , just set up a spark jammer , or some other very electrically noisy

make remote monitoring a chancy proposition , at best. there is , of course ,
the consideration that these measures may (and almost cretainly will)
cause a certain amount of interference in your own systems. it 's a matter
of balancing security versus convenience.

the problem is that this will also cause a certain amount of interference
in all systems within the range of the device. a long time ago i built a
small jammer to dissuade my brother from using his radio alarm clock at
something like 4am , which had just enough range to cover my room and his.
however something powerful enough to mask all (or at least most) emissions from
your computer equipment is also going to knock out half your neighbourhoods

from mark seecof marks@wimsey.latimes.com
subject key escrow (clipper chip risks 14.51)

advances in digital computing have made it possible for ordinary people to
use powerful machine cipher techniques.

it is tempting (albeit chauvinistic) to believe that we have a new situation
here , thanks to our pet computers. this is not true. david kahn 's the
codebreakers , a history of cryptography , makes two things obvious

1. cryptography is a spontaneous invention of private human individuals
and has been going on for thousands of years. teen age slang and
cipher inventions provide a modern example of this spontaneous
creation.

2. the systems people created on their own were roughly as secure as (and
sometimes more secure than) those used by military and diplomatic
users of that time (although they seem very simple and insecure
today). e.g. , in places , the bible used a more complex simple
substitution than caesar did for his military dispatches , but before
caesar.

i commend kahn 's book to all who might be interested.

really , none of this stuff is especially hard. all you need for a true

fast enough) , a v.32 or v.32bis modem module , and maybe a
microcontroller to run the whole thing. its easy to do , its cheap. and
any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit

can handle cd quality audio in and out , and can perform arbitrary
transformation on it in the process of transmitting it across a network

perhaps there 's a market for a portable vocoder. not a crypto
device , simply an rs232 voice converter. make it capable of recording
speech and playing it back simultaneously. it has applications for
multimedia , computing for the handicapped , internet talk radio , irc ,
etc , etc , etc. it would n't be a cryptographic device at all but i
suppose someone could have it hooked to a 486 laptop with a v.32bis
modem and some crypto software. i 'd market the thing with an api for
text to speech using simple phonemes and the ability to use speech
samples. and , of course , i 'd publish the interface to it so other
folks could write any applications they wanted to talk to the thing.

most of the so called `low radiation' monitors are also useless. the description

we thought there might be a market for a monitor which was not as hugely
expensive as the military tempest kit , but which was well enough shielded to
stop eavesdropping using available receivers. we built a prototype , it works ,
and it 's still sitting on my lab bench. commercial interest was exactly zero.

in the absence of open standards , a monitor which really is `low radiation'
(and costs 500 dollars more) ca n't compete against a monitor which just
claims to be `low radiation' (and whose only extra cost of production is the
pretty blue sticker on the box).

i heard somewhere (ca n't name the source) that tempest does not necessarily
pick up just crts , but it can pick up emissions from almost any chip. if
that is true , the kind monitor would not make any difference becuase everything

somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

that was probably me.
i meant only that nobody has overreacted yet. it seemed to me that
jerry was suggesting that people are currently overreacting , and i
vehemently disagree. i see a lot of talk , but not much action.
i see now that i misunderstood jerry 's position.

the reason is very simple how many people do you want to die in a riot \?
in a new civil war \?

everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it , and i'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper.

not this bunch. they 'll just bitch on the net for a while , and
then go back to lurking.

can people work within the system before trying to break it \? examine your
history books , and find out how many armed revolutions led to democratic
(or democratic style) governments. i think you 'll only find one in over
five thousand years of written history.

actually , it 's not quite that bad , but it 's close.

i think everyone would just as soon work within the system. the presence
of the possibility of using the bullet box instead of the ballot box
is supposed to be a deterrent by keeping the price of massive abuse
unacceptable. however , governments being what they are , sure would
like to remove that deterrence , which will make the need for armed
citizens all the more great (you do n't need 'em till you do n't have 'em).
then i think we can be more accurately called 'subjects' instead of
'citizens'. the idea of the people being sovereign over the government
is sure not in vogue in the beltway these days , that is for sure...
the administration is saying we know best. we will tell you what
you need , or do n't need... after , that old fashioned anachronism
called the bill of rights is not needed in these 'enlightened times'...

look , we (collectively) have the power to throw the bums out , but we
do n't use it. we clearly do n't need to go burning things down , but we

not if the government has its way there are eight bills before congress
that will either ban , tax exhorbitantly , or register all useful weapons
in the hands of the unconnected us subject. can you say 200.00 just
for a box of cartridges for practice \? one of the current administrations
top priority items is to disarm all who are not well connected , or that
work for the government.

clearly do need to throw at least some of the bums out.
unfortunately , the bums have learned to target only small groups of
people at a single time , so the masses wo n't react and throw them out.
eventually , the masses will react , unless the bums cease their
relentless encroachment on liberty and despoilment of the economy.
the sooner it happens , the less the damages will be. i do n't want to
live in a war zone , either i want to see the bums thrown out before
they do some real damage.

another tactic is to toss out so many outrages at once that nobody can
give justice to them all. like is being done right now.

it is still easy to conceal super encryption , at least until the

provide the u key to the local cops , still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant , unless the same key is used for both directions ,
which i suppose the capstone version of the chip will probably insist on.)

i was under the impression (from reading denning 's description of the
clipper 's operation) that the same session key is used in both directions for
encrypting the message text , but that each chip uses it 's own key for
encrypting the session key into the law enforcement field. so , you only
need to know the u key for one of the phones involved to decrypt the
messages in both directions.

this is a real address. my understanding of the current process
that mail takes is it gets downloaded on floppy disk and is processed

i know for a fact , but wo n't be online for probably another month

increase (direct internet instead of compu erve to floppy) but the

in this giant bally ho over this clipper chip i noticed a rather
disturbing trend in some of the e mail and posts i 've tossing back and
forth.

somebody asked me what was wrong about overreacting in cases such as this.

the reason is very simple how many people do you want to die in a riot \?
in a new civil war \?

everybody is jumping up and down and screaming about it , and i'm worried
that people are going to reach for their hammers and rifles before their pens
and paper.

can people work within the system before trying to break it \?

a circut court judge in illinois once said when dealing with a government
that seeks continually new and more creative ways to spy on its' citizenry ,
one cannot discourage the move to empower the common citizen with the means
to parry this attack on personal privacy.

(unfortunately the comment was with regard to the banning of radar
detectors....)

the point remains. more and more i see the government slowly washing
away privacy. even unwittingly. do you think i will ever live in a
soceity that issues smart cards to citizens at birth \? do you think i
will live in a soceity that insists i register my crypto keys so they
can keep track of what i'm saying \? even if there is no evidence of my
guilt \? do you think i will ever live in a soceity that seeks to meddle
in the affairs of its' citizenry without recourse of any kind \? i'm tired
of it. there is (imho) no compromise with an administration that seeks
to implement these proposals under the guise of enhancing privacy.

more than the proposals themselves , i read the language of the press
releases , the obvious deception involved in presenting these pieces to
the public , and i am sickened. i am revolted. i am repulsed.

90 , perhaps even 95 of this country could care less about the
clipper chip , the wiretap bill , the smart card , because they are so
entrapped in the rhetoric of the clinton administration.

this saddens and frightens me.

i am a conserveative believe it or not. a law and order conserveative.
but the move to a centralized authoratarian regime really scares me ,
mostly because i know you cant go far wrong underestimating the
intelligence of the american people. tell them it 's going to keep
them safe from drug dealers and terrorists , and they will let you
put cameras in their home.

even in the wake of waco , you find those who support the increasingly
totalatarian moves.

somebody once said something like armed violence is meant only to be
used in response to an armed attack. it is not meant to be used in
agression. this is the difference between self defence and murder.

to be quite honest , the way things are going , i 'd call it self defense.

let 's try to avoid killing things , eh \? there 's enough blood shed in the
world , without adding a couple of riots , civil wars , etc.

i'm probably overreacting. but what i 've read scared me a lot. i do n't
want my children growing up in a war zone.


and i dont want mine growning up in the eyes of a security camera

subject re key registering bodies
organization netcom on line communication services (408 241 9760 guest)
lines 29

since the law requires that wiretaps be requested by the executive
branch and approved by the judicial branch , it seems clear that one
of the key registering bodies should be under the control of the
judicial branch. i suggest the supreme court , or , regionally , the
courts of appeal. more specifically , the offices of their clerks.

courts already operate substantial record keeping operations. some
of these records are confidential. so the concept of a court holding
information in confidence in accordance with law has longstanding legal
precedents. the judiciary is more immune to pressure from the executive
branch than any executive branch agency or contractor can be. so judicial
control of keys is appropriate.

for the other half of the key , i suggest a unit of congress , the
general accounting office. the gao is congress 's staff unit for keeping
tabs on the executive branch , and has an excellent reputation. it 's
controlled strictly by congress the executive branch has no authority
over it.

with keys split between the legislative and judicial branches ,
we might have a chance of this system working honestly. if , of course ,
a way can be found to keep the keys from being siphoned off before
they reach the repositories.

this should not be construed as an endorsement by me of the
whole clipper concept. but if we have to have it , splitting control
across all three branches of government might make it work.

i issue this invitation assume that you were charged with
implementing such a system , with complete regard for civil rights and
due process. what would you do differently \? in answering this
question , please accept nsa 's fundamental assumptions that both
strong cryptography against outsiders , and the ability to wiretap
some domestic users , is necessary.

i 'll accept the second assumption only for the sake of argument. in my
view the primary remaining flaw is that the encryption algorithm is
secret , leading to suspicion that there is a back door. without complete
disclosure this suspicion cannot be dispelled , no matter how many trusted
experts are allowed to look at it in isolation.

is it possible to do this whole thing with a public algorithm \? the only
concern i 've seen with making skipjack public is that someone could build
clipperphones without registering the keys. assume f can really be kept
secret as the government assumes. then as part of the initial connection ,
a clipperphone executes a protocol with the pseudophone to demonstrate
that they both know f. for example , the initiating phone picks a number q
and sends e q f . the receiver sends back e q 1 f , and the initiator
sends back e q 2 f to demonstrate that her first packet was n't just a
random 64 bit block. repeat in the opposite direction with another q so
it ca n't be defeated by somebody building up a library of sequential
numbers by remembering responses and using those responses as the initial
numbers of subsequent challenges. this way clipperphones will talk only
to other clipperphones. of course the pseudo company can build their own
proprietary skipjack phone , but the presidential fact sheet implies that
they wo n't get approval for it without equivalent key escrow.

what 's wrong with this picture \? it depends of f staying secret and on
skipjack being resistant to cryptanalysis , but the government appears to
believe in both of these. even if the particular q a i suggest has some
flaw , i imagine there 's a zero knowledge proof protocol that does n't.

smb says
the third , and most serious issue , is whether or not clipper is a good
idea even if carried out strictly according to the letter of the law.

agreed. my view , and you can quote me if it 's not worth doing , it 's
not worth doing well.

something that no one has discussed yet (or i missed it)

the fbi sets up a wiretap after the court order was handed.
only at this point they can access the line and detect
the serial number n.

what happens next , does the fbi simply asks for the keys
for n , and , since a warrant was issued for the line , the fbi
simply gets it \? what if multiple phones are used from the
same house , the fbi just asks for n1 , n2 , etc. \?

exactly who is to prevent the fbi from claiming some
other serial number , x , was also used over the wirtapped
line and get the keys for x \?

either a second court order (for the specific serial key)
is required (and i have seen no indication of this) , or
the fbi can effectively ask for any pair of keys at any
time , so the escrow key holders are a total fake.


two safeguards

1. the fbi could be asked to produce the law enforcement block to the escrow
agencies , and associate it with a particular court order

2. if the thing comes to trial the defense attorneys can probe this issue
closely. it is not too different from proving that the speaker on a legal
wiretap is the person the court order covered.

putting it another way , this question is not very different from the
pre clipper question what 's to prevent the fbi from getting a court order
to tap al capone and then using it to tap jonathan livingstone seagull
instead \?

it depends on the mode you 're using. for a single 64 bit input block , a
one bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits in other words , it essentially turns the output block into
a random number. if you 're encrypting data in cbc mode , however , only the
one 64 bit block will be affected. the next block , and all that follow it

subject how to escrow , if escrowing were ok
organization express access online communications , greenbelt , md usa
lines 24
nntp posting host access.digex.net

there is a description of something called a fair crypto system in the
may 1993 issue of byte , p. 134 , attributed to mit professor silvio micali.

the way it works is as follows

you generate your private key s , and break it up into pieces s1 , s2 , s3 ,
s4 , and s5 , such that (s1 s2 ... s5) mod p s.
you give each piece s1 , s2 , etc. to a different escrow agency.
the agencies each compute g sn mod p , and forward the result to the public
key telephone book keeper.
the public key telephone book keeper multiplies all the g sn mod p , reduces
the result to mod p , and this will be the user 's public key.

now , if there were several hundered recognized escrow agencies , and the user
could give a piece of the key to each of the ones he trusted , the result would
be something of an improvement over the proposed clipper system.

i still do n't think key escrow is a good idea , for both philosophical and
security reasons , but i do offer this suggestion simply to determine whether
escrow advocates are at all interested in considering alternatives in good
faith , or whether the goal is to insure the use of only two agencies selected
for spinelessness in the face of official requests.

i have been looking over the postings about the clipper chip and noticed
an interesting omission from the discussion.

you all mention that the algorithm is classified and have expressed
concerns and ideas of how to figure out the algorithm using software.

the question that i have is why cant someone take one of these chips
and reverse engineer it \? i mean , take the thing to a chip testing
analysis facility , one with a decent electron microscope. just pry
off the top of the chip and start scanning it with the electron
microcope and figure out the circuitry. i remembered a place that i use
to work for had one of these facilities that they used to analyze chips
that we accidently blew out while running tests. they could actually find
the area that was fried and show us where in the circuit it was.

i am sure that many companies and universities must have these facilities
and that the potential is there , especially at a university where the
security at such a facility is looser , for someone to take a clipper
apart and analyze it \?

what can the government do to prevent this \? start taking away all
microchip analysis facilities and electron microscopes \? \?

maybe so , but it 's quite common. there are millions of macintosh users who

how do you know all your business secrets are n't being stolen \? answer
1. because you trust apple
2. because if any such attempt , however sophicsticated , came out , it would
destroy apple 's credibility forever.

the reason i could theoretically trust apple (though i'm a pc person
myself ) ) is that apple has to worry about their customers deserting
them if they screw up badly enough. the government does n't have any such
worry it can change the rules by force to get the outcome it wants. this
is the ultimate reason why private enterprise is usually more efficient

a person i know , belonging to a research lab of a rivate

an hour. he had access to rather powerful des hardware , but not of an
extraordinare kind , i believe. the attack was possible because of the
amount of known plaintext in the ticket , which itself constitutes a small
message. this was two years ago.
des is no longer usable for encryption of really sensitive data. for a
lot of purposes , however , it is still very adequate.

this sounds an awful lot like a password guesser , not a weakness in
des. merritt and i pointed out this weakness in kerberos in a paper
that came out about 2.5 years ago , in both computer communications
review and usenix. for that matter , it was loudly discussed on the
kerberos mailing list even earlier.

the problem has nothing whatsoever to do with des , and everything to do
with bad password selection.

i'm perfectly willing to believe that there are cryptanalytic attacks
possible on des. i'm quite dubious that private research labs know
them. and the parameters of a brute force attack are quite well
established see , for example , the garon and outerbridge paper in the
july '91 cryptologia. you 're not going to do it in an hour with only
``rather powerful des hardware''. i 'll leave the arithmetic as an
exercise for the reader. on average , you 'll need to do 2 55 trials.
pick your own parameters for how fast the des engine runs , and for
how many such engines are used.

2 54 2 (24 60 60) 1000000 is ca. 104250.
so you must have managed to do 104250 encryptions per microsecond.

yes , i'm not very seriously bothered about the security of des yet

celp manages to sound decent at 4800 bps.

in theory , if you built a speech recognition system that turned voice

down to the information content of the speech.

with various kinds of lpc , you can get it down to 2400 bps or prehaps

on the other hand , i can easily see them recording the traffic for
interesting people , such as dissidents , suspected criminals ,
foreign telephone calls , and anybody noticed using encryption.
as ken shiriff speculates , recording encrypted traffic will probably
be judged not to be an invasion of privacy pretty soon ....

as i read the current wiretap law , it would not be legal now. on the
other hand , assuming a legislative change , recording but not decrypting
clipper conversations would probably be found constitutional by the supreme
court , using the same reasoning (or the lack thereof...) by which they
permit random roadblocks to check for drunk drivers.

incidentally , if we use that as our model , the court will likely not
uphold selective recording. (on the other hand , i do n't think they 've
thrown out ``drug courier profiles'' yet. must be that exception to
the fourth amendment that i can never find in my copy of the bill of
rights.)

a lot and i mean a lot will depend on exactly how clippertaps
(or tipperclaps , for encrypted music \? ) are used. don alvarez showed in
the latest risks digest that it 's possible to prevent the cops from
reading traffic after their warrant expires.

that is the cops send the lef to the f holder. the f holder strips
off f , and sends u k , n to the escrow agents. they send either u or k
to the cops. (don says u , i say k.) the cops ca n't use u in the
future , because they ca n't strip off f. the f holder never sees u. in
don 's model , the escrow agents ca n't read the traffic , because they
do n't have k in my model , they have k , but not the message itself.
and i trust that more because i think the cops and the fbi (the
f holder) are more likely to collaborate on breaking the rules. the
net result is that by involving the f holder and the escrow agents on
every tap , we can avoid extending permission to tap.

from crossbows to cryptography thwarting the state via
technology

given at the future of freedom conference , november 1987


you know , technology and particularly computer
technology has often gotten a bad rap in libertarian cir
cles. we tend to think of orwell 's 1984 , or terry gilliam 's
brazil , or the proximity detectors keeping east berlin 's
slave citizens on their own side of the border , or the so
phisticated bugging devices nixon used to harass those on
his enemies list. or , we recognize that for the price of
a ticket on the concorde we can fly at twice the speed of
sound , but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run by
a government policeman , and permit him to paw thru our be
longings if it beeps.

but i think that mind set is a mistake. before there
were cattle prods , governments tortured their prisoners with
clubs and rubber hoses. before there were lasers for
eavesdropping , governments used binoculars and lip readers.
though government certainly uses technology to oppress , the
evil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.

in fact , technology represents one of the most promis
ing avenues available for re capturing our freedoms from
those who have stolen them. by its very nature , it favors
the bright (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can
not). it favors the adaptable (who are quick to see the
merit of the new (over the sluggish (who cling to time
tested ways). and what two better words are there to de
scribe government bureaucracy than dull and sluggish \?

one of the clearest , classic triumphs of technology
over tyranny i see is the invention of the man portable
crossbow. with it , an untrained peasant could now reliably
and lethally engage a target out to fifty meters even if
that target were a mounted , chain mailed knight. (unlike
the longbow , which , admittedly was more powerful , and could
get off more shots per unit time , the crossbow required no
formal training to utilize. whereas the longbow required
elaborate visual , tactile and kinesthetic coordination to
achieve any degree of accuracy , the wielder of a crossbow
could simply put the weapon to his shoulder , sight along the
arrow itself , and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar
get.)

moreover , since just about the only mounted knights
likely to visit your average peasant would be government
soldiers and tax collectors , the utility of the device was
plain with it , the common rabble could defend themselves
not only against one another , but against their governmental
masters. it was the medieval equivalent of the armor
piercing bullet , and , consequently , kings and priests (the
medieval equivalent of a bureau of alcohol , tobacco and
crossbows) threatened death and excommunication , respec
tively , for its unlawful possession.

looking at later developments , we see how technology
like the firearm particularly the repeating rifle and the
handgun , later followed by the gatling gun and more advanced
machine guns radically altered the balance of interpersonal
and inter group power. not without reason was the colt .45
called the equalizer. a frail dance hall hostess with one
in her possession was now fully able to protect herself
against the brawniest roughneck in any saloon. advertise
ments for the period also reflect the merchandising of the
repeating cartridge rifle by declaring that a man on
horseback , armed with one of these rifles , simply cannot be
captured. and , as long as his captors were relying upon
flintlocks or single shot rifles , the quote is doubtless a
true one.

updating now to the present , the public key cipher
(with a personal computer to run it) represents an equiv
alent quantum leap in a defensive weapon. not only can
such a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one 's
own possession , but it can also permit two strangers to ex
change information over an insecure communications
channel a wiretapped phone line , for example , or
skywriting , for that matter) without ever having previously
met to exchange cipher keys. with a thousand dollar com
puter , you can create a cipher that a multi megabuck cray
x mp ca n't crack in a year. within a few years , it should
be economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi
cations soon after that , full color digitized video images.
technology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete , it
will have totally demolished government 's control over in
formation transfer.

i 'd like to take just a moment to sketch the mathemat
ics which makes this principle possible. this algorithm is
called the rsa algorithm , after rivest , shamir , and adleman
who jointly created it. its security derives from the fact
that , if a very large number is the product of two very
large primes , then it is extremely difficult to obtain the
two prime factors from analysis of their product. ex
tremely in the sense that if primes p and q have 100
digits apiece , then their 200 digit product cannot in gen
eral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful
computer now in existence.

the public part of the key consists of (1) the prod
uct pq of the two large primes p and q , and (2) one fac
tor , call it x , of the product xy where xy (p 1)
(q 1) 1 . the private part of the key consists of the
other factor y.

each block of the text to be encrypted is first turned
into an integer either by using ascii , or even a simple
a 01 , b 02 , c 03 , ... , z 26 representation. this integer
is then raised to the power x (modulo pq) and the resulting
integer is then sent as the encrypted message. the receiver
decrypts by taking this integer to the (secret) power y
(modulo pq). it can be shown that this process will always
yield the original number started with.

what makes this a groundbreaking development , and why
it is called public key cryptography , is that i can
openly publish the product pq and the number x , while
keeping secret the number y so that anyone can send me
an encrypted message , namely
x
a (mod pq) ,
but only i can recover the original message a , by taking
what they send , raising it to the power y and taking the
result (mod pq). the risky step (meeting to exchange cipher
keys) has been eliminated. so people who may not even trust
each other enough to want to meet , may still reliably ex
change encrypted messages each party having selected and
disseminated his own pq and his x , while maintaining
the secrecy of his own y.

another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a dig
ital signature , to enable one to authenticate the source of
a given message. normally , if i want to send you a message ,
i raise my plaintext a to your x and take the result (mod
your pq) and send that.

however , if in my message , i take the plaintext a and
raise it to my (secret) power y , take the result (mod my
pq) , then raise that result to your x (mod your pq) and
send this , then even after you have normally decrypted the
message , it will still look like garbage. however , if you
then raise it to my public power x , and take the result
(mod my public pq ) , so you will not only recover the ori
ginal plaintext message , but you will know that no one but i
could have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret
y).

and these are the very concerns by the way that are to
day tormenting the soviet union about the whole question of
personal computers. on the one hand , they recognize that
american schoolchildren are right now growing up with com
puters as commonplace as sliderules used to be more so , in
fact , because there are things computers can do which will
interest (and instruct) 3 and 4 year olds. and it is pre
cisely these students who one generation hence will be going
head to head against their soviet counterparts. for the
soviets to hold back might be a suicidal as continuing to
teach swordsmanship while your adversaries are learning
ballistics. on the other hand , whatever else a personal
computer may be , it is also an exquisitely efficient copying
machine a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50 , 000 words of
text , and can be copied in a couple of minutes. if this
were n't threatening enough , the computer that performs the
copy can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but
unbreakable. remember that in soviet society publicly ac
cessible xerox machines are unknown. (the relatively few
copying machines in existence are controlled more inten
sively than machine guns are in the united states.)

now the conservative position is that we should not
sell these computers to the soviets , because they could use
them in weapons systems. the liberal position is that we
should sell them , in the interests of mutual trade and
cooperation and anyway , if we do n't make the sale , there
will certainly be some other nation willing to.

for my part , i'm ready to suggest that the libertarian
position should be to give them to the soviets for free , and
if necessary , make them take them . . . and if that does n't
work load up an sr 71 blackbird and air drop them over
moscow in the middle of the night. paid for by private sub
scription , of course , not taxation . . . i confess that this
is not a position that has gained much support among members
of the conventional left right political spectrum , but , af
ter all , in the words of one of illuminatus 's characters , we
are political non euclideans the shortest distance to a
particular goal may not look anything like what most people
would consider a straight line. taking a long enough
world view , it is arguable that breaking the soviet govern
ment monopoly on information transfer could better lead to
the enfeeblement and , indeed , to the ultimate dissolution of
the soviet empire than would the production of another dozen
missiles aimed at moscow.

but there 's the rub a long enough world view does
suggest that the evil , the oppressive , the coercive and the
simply stupid will get what they deserve , but what 's not
immediately clear is how the rest of us can escape being
killed , enslaved , or pauperized in the process.

when the liberals and other collectivists began to at
tack freedom , they possessed a reasonably stable , healthy ,
functioning economy , and almost unlimited time to proceed to
hamstring and dismantle it. a policy of political
gradualism was at least conceivable. but now , we have
patchwork crazy quilt economy held together by baling wire
and spit. the state not only taxes us to feed the poor
while also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive
up food prices it then simultaneously turns around and sub
sidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in
crease yields of milk from the cows left alive. or witness
the fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as
potentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years
ago. when the price went up , we were told , the economy
risked collapse for for want of energy. the price increase
was called the moral equivalent of war and the feds swung
into action. for the first time in american history , the
speed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be
came an issue of federal concern. now , when the price of
oil drops , again we risk problems , this time because ameri
can oil companies and third world basket case nations who
sell oil may not be able to ever pay their debts to our
grossly over extended banks. the suggested panacea is that
government should now re raise the oil prices that opec has
lowered , via a new oil tax. since the government is seeking
to raise oil prices to about the same extent as opec did ,
what can we call this except the moral equivalent of civil
war the government against its own people \?

and , classically , in international trade , can you imag
ine any entity in the world except a government going to
court claiming that a vendor was selling it goods too
cheaply and demanding not only that that naughty vendor be
compelled by the court to raise its prices , but also that it
be punished for the act of lowering them in the first place \?

so while the statists could afford to take a couple of
hundred years to trash our economy and our liberties we
certainly cannot count on having an equivalent period of
stability in which to reclaim them. i contend that there
exists almost a black hole effect in the evolution of
nation states just as in the evolution of stars. once free
dom contracts beyond a certain minimum extent , the state
warps the fabric of the political continuum about itself to
the degree that subsequent re emergence of freedom becomes
all but impossible. a good illustration of this can be seen
in the area of so called welfare payments. when those who
sup at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those
whose taxes must replenish the trough , then what possible
choice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak
ing from the few for the unearned benefit of the many \? go
down to the nearest welfare office , find just two people
on the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form
a voting bloc that can forever outvote you on the question
of who owns your life and the fruits of your life 's labor.

so essentially those who love liberty need an edge of
some sort if we 're ultimately going to prevail. we obvi
ously ca n't use the altruists' other directedness of
work , slave , suffer , sacrifice , so that next generation of
a billion random strangers can live in a better world.
recognize that , however immoral such an appeal might be , it
is nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today 's culture.
if you can convince people to work energetically for a
cause , caring only enough for their personal welfare so as
to remain alive enough and healthy enough to continue
working then you have a truly massive reservoir of energy
to draw from. equally clearly , this is just the sort of ap
peal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or
libertarian goals. if i were to stand up before you tonight
and say something like , listen , follow me as i enunciate my
noble cause , contribute your money to support the cause ,
give up your free time to work for the cause , strive
selflessly to bring it about , and then (after you and your
children are dead) maybe your children 's children will actu
ally live under egoism you 'd all think i 'd gone mad. and
of course you 'd be right. because the point i'm trying to
make is that libertarianism and or egoism will be spread if ,
when , and as , individual libertarians and or egoists find it
profitable and or enjoyable to do so. and probably only
then.

while i certainly do not disparage the concept of poli
tical action , i do n't believe that it is the only , nor even
necessarily the most cost effective path toward increasing
freedom in our time. consider that , for a fraction of the
investment in time , money and effort i might expend in try
ing to convince the state to abolish wiretapping and all
forms of censorship i can teach every libertarian who 's in
terested how to use cryptography to abolish them
unilaterally.

there is a maxim a proverb generally attributed to
the eskimoes , which very likely most libertarians have al
ready heard. and while you likely would not quarrel with
the saying , you might well feel that you 've heard it often
enough already , and that it has nothing further to teach us ,
and moreover , that maybe you 're even tired of hearing it. i
shall therefore repeat it now

if you give a man a fish , the saying runs , you feed him
for a day. but if you teach a man how to fish , you feed him
for a lifetime.

your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of
a workfare vs. welfare context namely , that if you
genuinely wish to help someone in need , you should teach him
how to earn his sustenance , not simply how to beg for it.
and of course this is true , if only because the next time he
is hungry , there might not be anybody around willing or even
able to give him a fish , whereas with the information on how
to fish , he is completely self sufficient.

but i submit that this exhausts only the first order
content of the quote , and if there were nothing further to
glean from it , i would have wasted your time by citing it
again. after all , it seems to have almost a crypto altruist
slant , as though to imply that we should structure our ac
tivities so as to maximize the benefits to such hungry
beggars as we may encounter.

but consider

suppose this eskimo does n't know how to fish , but he
does know how to hunt walruses. you , on the other hand ,
have often gone hungry while traveling thru walrus country
because you had no idea how to catch the damn things , and
they ate most of the fish you could catch. and now suppose
the two of you decide to exchange information , bartering
fishing knowledge for hunting knowledge. well , the first
thing to observe is that a transaction of this type
categorically and unambiguously refutes the marxist premise
that every trade must have a winner and a loser the
idea that if one person gains , it must necessarily be at the
expense of another person who loses. clearly , under this
scenario , such is not the case. each party has gained some
thing he did not have before , and neither has been dimin
ished in any way. when it comes to exchange of information
(rather than material objects) life is no longer a zero sum
game. this is an extremely powerful notion. the law of
diminishing returns , the first and second laws of
thermodynamics all those laws which constrain our possi
bilities in other contexts no longer bind us ! now that 's
anarchy !

or consider another possibility suppose this hungry
eskimo never learned to fish because the ruler of his
nation state had decreed fishing illegal. because fish
contain dangerous tiny bones , and sometimes sharp spines , he
tells us , the state has decreed that their consumption and
even their possession are too hazardous to the people 's
health to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable , willing
adults. perhaps it is because citizens' bodies are thought
to be government property , and therefore it is the function
of the state to punish those who improperly care for govern
ment property. or perhaps it is because the state gener
ously extends to competent adults the benefits it provides
to children and to the mentally ill namely , a full time ,
all pervasive supervisory conservatorship so that they need
not trouble themselves with making choices about behavior
thought physically risky or morally naughty. but , in any
case , you stare stupefied , while your eskimo informant re
lates how this law is taken so seriously that a friend of
his was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of pos
session of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.

now you may conclude that a society so grotesquely
oppressive as to enforce a law of this type is simply an
affront to the dignity of all human beings. you may go far
ther and decide to commit some portion of your discretion
ary , recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting
this tyrant 's goal. (your rationale may be altruistic in
the sense of wanting to liberate the oppressed , or
egoistic in the sense of proving you can outsmart the
oppressor or very likely some combination of these or per
haps even other motives.)

but , since you have zero desire to become a martyr to
your cause , you 're not about to mount a military campaign ,
or even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.
however , it is here that technology and in particular in
formation technology can multiply your efficacy literally a
hundredfold. i say literally , because for a fraction of
the effort (and virtually none of the risk) attendant to
smuggling in a hundred fish , you can quite readily produce a
hundred xerox copies of fishing instructions. (if the tar
geted government , like present day america , at least permits
open discussion of topics whose implementation is re
stricted , then that should suffice. but , if the government
attempts to suppress the flow of information as well , then
you will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write
your fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to
your mythical eskimo 's public key parameters. but as far as
increasing real world access to fish you have made genuine
nonzero headway which may continue to snowball as others
re disseminate the information you have provided. and you
have not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id
eological adversaries , or even trying to win over the unde
cided. recall harry browne 's dictum from freedom in an
unfree world that the success of any endeavor is in general
inversely proportional to the number of people whose persua
sion is necessary to its fulfilment.

if you look at history , you cannot deny that it has
been dramatically shaped by men with names like washington ,
lincoln , . . . nixon . . . marcos . . . duvalier . . .
khadaffi . . . and their ilk. but it has also been shaped
by people with names like edison , curie , marconi , tesla and
wozniak. and this latter shaping has been at least as per
vasive , and not nearly so bloody.

and that 's where i'm trying to take the libertech
project. rather than beseeching the state to please not en
slave , plunder or constrain us , i propose a libertarian net
work spreading the technologies by which we may seize
freedom for ourselves.

but here we must be a bit careful. while it is not (at
present) illegal to encrypt information when government
wants to spy on you , there is no guarantee of what the fu
ture may hold. there have been bills introduced , for exam
ple , which would have made it a crime to wear body armor
when government wants to shoot you. that is , if you were to
commit certain crimes while wearing a kevlar vest , then that
fact would constitute a separate federal crime of its own.
this law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . . but
it does indicate how government thinks.

other technological applications , however , do indeed
pose legal risks. we recognize , for example , that anyone
who helped a pre civil war slave escape on the underground
railroad was making a clearly illegal use of technology as
the sovereign government of the united states of america at
that time found the buying and selling of human beings quite
as acceptable as the buying and selling of cattle. simi
larly , during prohibition , anyone who used his bathtub to
ferment yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug ,
alcohol the controlled substance , wine was using technol
ogy in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents
for his crime unfortunately not to be restored to life
when congress reversed itself and re permitted use of this
drug.

so . . . to quote a former president , un indicted co
conspirator and pardoned felon . . . let me make one thing
perfectly clear the libertech project does not advocate ,
participate in , or conspire in the violation of any law no
matter how oppressive , unconstitutional or simply stupid
such law may be. it does engage in description (for educa
tional and informational purposes only) of technological
processes , and some of these processes (like flying a plane
or manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li
censing to perform legally. fortunately , no license is
needed for the distribution or receipt of information it
self.

so , the next time you look at the political scene and
despair , thinking , well , if 51 of the nation and 51 of
this state , and 51 of this city have to turn libertarian
before i 'll be free , then somebody might as well cut my
goddamn throat now , and put me out of my misery recognize
that such is not the case. there exist ways to make your
self free.

if you wish to explore such techniques via the project ,
you are welcome to give me your name and address or a fake
name and mail drop , for that matter and you 'll go on the
mailing list for my erratically published newsletter. any
friends or acquaintances whom you think would be interested
are welcome as well. i'm not even asking for stamped self
addressed envelopes , since my printer can handle mailing la
bels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared
with the other efforts in getting an issue out. if you
should have an idea to share , or even a useful product to
plug , i 'll be glad to have you write it up for publication.
even if you want to be the proverbial free rider and just
benefit from what others contribute you 're still welcome
everything will be public domain feel free to copy it or
give it away (or sell it , for that matter , 'cause if you can
get money for it while i'm taking full page ads trying to
give it away , you 're certainly entitled to your capitalist
profit . . .) anyway , every application of these principles
should make the world just a little freer , and i'm certainly
willing to underwrite that , at least for the forseeable fu
ture.

i will leave you with one final thought if you do n't
learn how to beat your plowshares into swords before they
outlaw swords , then you sure as hell ought to learn before
they outlaw plowshares too.

the chips are programmed by mykotronx , inc. , which calls them the
myk 78. the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc.

all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif (secure compartmented
information facility) , which is essentially a vault. the scif contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips. about 300 chips
are programmed during a single session. the scif is located at
mykotronx.

acknowledgment and distribution notice. this article is based on
information provided by nsa , nist , fbi , and mykotronx. permission to
distribute this document is granted.

so , who is mykotronx , inc. \? it would be nice to know that they are
not a front company used by an intelligence or other agency of the
u.s. government.

while we are at it , the chip design(s) should be examined and verified
against silicon to insure no trap doors or hidden protocols exist in silicon ,
regardless of the security level of the encryption algorithm. there is
no proof that the chip wo n't squeel and role over for someone with the
proper knowledge to interrogate it via the communications link.

the design examination should be done to the gate level. also , how does one
verify that what you are looking at is reflected in tapeout , or masks \?

the silicon should be examined as well , the design in hand (a clean room
publicly defined clipper chip) can be merged with another design later , or
changed between completion and mask out. there is little proof that what
you are told is in the chip is all that is in the chip.

put the (verified) masks in escrow , and use them for chip production ,
use a third escrow party for programming the chips.

the government is asking for a lot of blind trust the encryption algorithm ,
operating protocols , the agency having physical control of the devices , the
silicon implementation. if the government is so trustworthy , why escrow
anything \?

brad yearwood posts a long response to the issue of registering a

it does n't wash.

recall that law enforcement gets a court order to tap a suspect 's phone
calls. they do what they do now figure out which lines to tap. they then
record the stuff. if it 's clipper , they read the law enforcement block ,
extract the serial number , and get the keys using the court order.

no new difficulties (such as using someone else 's phone instrument or phone
line) are introduced that would n't have existed absent clipper. if the
crooks were going to use a pay phone (say) , they could have done so without
clipper. if the government figures out they 're so doing , they listen in , and
if it 's a clipper conversation they get the serial number and then the keys.

if the crooks use an innocent person 's clipper phone on the tapped line
there 's no problem. the feds do n't care whose phone instrument is used , just
that the conversation is by the suspect on the tapped line. they get the
serial number , get the keys , and they are in business.

i think it very unlikely there are back doors in clipper , for two reasons

1. the government does n't need them if it can get the key (and yes , i assume
that the official government obeys court orders , etc. and that the design
of the chip and its approval were official )

2. it would defeat the whole purpose of providing secure crypto for american

a legitimate and genuine purpose , and as many think , the nsa can read des ,
why bother otherwise \?

i question whether celp is the best approach for this application. it produces
great compression but at the expense of tremendous cpu loads. we want
something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high end pc 's

a better starting point.

yes. i'm not sure if my xposting to comp.speech made it to here too , but
i 've found that a low sample rate (3300 samples sec at 8 bits per sample)

glad to ! you are correct , it is illegal to send cryptographic
code (and lots of other things) out of the country without a license.
however , every us citizen has a general export license , allowing
export of lots of things , including constitutionally protected speech.
this has the effect that it is legal for us citizens to export some
things which it is illegal for a us corporation to export without
first obtaining a license.

dunno if you 'd get one for the particular code you have the only
way to find out is to apply for a license.

nope , talk to a good lawyer in the area of export law. but , in
general , the government has to have a very good national security case
to try prevent the export of anything you personally might wish to
publish. (yes , i worded that the way i did intentionally. it is a
lot easier for the government to try to prevent the export of
information than to charge someone with a crime after the fact.
espionage is probably the only exception.)

note that you need to distinguish between what is legal to send
to canada if you have such a license , and what is legal to send
if you do n't.

if you are a us citizen , you have a general license. (i am not a
lawyer , so take some of this with a grain of salt. however , i have
also had to swim through both itar and export regs in a few cases.)

the easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. this makes
the funding separate from government.

it also has the neat side property that if the chip does n't catch on , the
scheme breaks down , and the government is back to the drawing boards ,
assuming that they have n't prohibited alternatives in the meantime.

in fact , maybe this should be part of the official system. before the
government is allowed to move this past the experimental stage , they
should have to demonstrate economic viability by mass adoption.

david ,

while i disagree strongly with you on the issue of our trusting the government ,
i think you have a good idea here. there is danger that , with funding coming
from asset forfeitures , the government could continue to promulgate a bad
product in spite of poor acceptance. making the product pay its way (as
it must for private ventures) would be a good incentive for quality and
listening to we , the ranters. )

i 've got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints
i have about the clipper chip. pass a law stating that if , within a
year of performaing a wiretap on someone , a police agency has n't
managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant wiretap was for ,
then that agency owes the suspect 1 million to repay him her for
lost privacy.
of course , there are still problems with the technical aspects of
clipper , and with the one size fits all mentality that would be behind
an attempt to enforce it as a standard. but this would be a way for
those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will
only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are
all but certain that there really will be a conviction....

any normal company trying to put one out will likely get a visit

products are too expensive.

hah. they 're not that much more expensive. besides , if a drug dealer
can afford a rolex and a mercedes , he can darn well afford cylink phones.
no , cylink sells their phones because they 're willing to make different
stuff for domestic use vs. export. qualcomm is n't. so cylink makes
money that 's capitalism , comrade.

someone out there will build a unit to do all this. better yet ,
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a

at the risk of getting lost in the clipper chip discussion i give a
summary on my recent question

in article pqscbcnh@minnie.zdv.uni mainz.de i wrote
the recent discussion in this news group suggests that a key search
attack
against des is quite feasible now. but normally des is applied in cbc or
cfb
mode where one chooses a random init vector of 8 bytes. questions

makes it sense to handle the init vector as an additional key \? then
we have
a 56 64 120 bit key.

if yes is anything known about the security of this key scheme \? can
we
break it faster than by exhaustive search through the 120 bit key space \?

unfortunately the answer is no concealing the initialisation vector
essentially does n't give any additional security. i got 3 answers (from
grady@netcom.com , mark.lomas@cl.cam.ac.uk , smb@research.att.com) that
opened my eyes. it 's pretty simple

say e is encryption (and d decryption) with key k on 64 bit blocks.

let c 0 be the initialisation vector ,
m 1 , m 2 , ... the message blocks ,
c 1 , c 2 , ... the cipher text blocks.

then encryption in cipher block chaining (cbc) mode works by the formula

c i e(m i xor c i 1 ) ,

and decryption by

m i c i 1 xor d(c i ).

so if the attacker does n't have c 0 this only affects the first message
block m 1 . but she can do her key search attack on m 2 , m 3 , ...

the situation in cipher feedback (cfb) mode is a bit more complicated but
similar and left as an exercise for the reader )

finally there is the modified output feedback mode (ofb) where des (or
whatever block cipher you use) simply acts as random generator by

s i e(s i 1 ) with initialisation vector ( seed) s 0 ,

and encryption is given by

c i m i xor s i .

here the usual `known plaintext' attack against xor bitstream ciphers
reduces the cracking to key search for k.

is it realistic for the government to try to keep the details
of the encrytion algorithm secret if it intends to use evidence from...
james b. shearer

i do not think they can use the eavesdropping as evidence at all. however ,
using the info they gather while listening , they can go searching the right
place and find good , strong evidence , which they can use in court.

question currently , it is easy to wire tap , from the technical point of
view , at least. anybody using the appropriate radio receiver can listen
to communications between a car telephone and the ground station. the police
also , obviously. the clipper chip will make it much more difficult for the
non authorized person to eavesdrop (note that i do not write impossible ).
the privacy will thus improve from the current situation. poeple who really
have something to hide already do not use the phone to speak of these things.
if an illegal operation is really worth , one can afford having critical data
carried by a person rather than sending it electronically.
the clipper chip will not change this.

the problem is more politic. foreign countries will never accept the clipper
chip is the access to the escrow cannot be directly granted to their own
police following their own law , not the us law. i.e. each country will have
its own escrow. how then will it be possible to monitor the international
traffic \? or , will encrypted international traffic be possible \? or will there
be an international escrow , some kind of u.n. thing \?

forbidding crypted communication is impractical how is it possible to spot
a crypted communication in the thousands of megabytes of data which circulate
on the various existing networks. what about private networks \? and this will
be more and more impossible as the volume of electronic traffic will increrase
in the next years.

i think that the clipper chip can only be an interesting device to limit the
risk of , for instance , one 's girlfriend 's husband listening to his wife 's
communications. it will bring no more as regards to security. is it worth \?
i think so if its cost is limited , i think that many privacy invasions are done
not only by official services , but also by private entities. the clipper can
help reducing these. provided we do not hope too much of it , it is not a real
danger and it can be helpful.

you are correct (several times). tempest is a codeword for a standard , shared between the nato governments , to limit the inadvertent emission of information by either electromagnetic radiation or conduction. the limits set in the
standard are classified but there is open source information to the effect
that either the electrical or magnetic components of electromagnetism can be
exploited. it is a basic rule of physics that there is an electromagnetic
field associated with any path that conducts a flow of electrons.

among other things , i drive a 1987 korean built at clone and an associated 24 pin dotmatrix printer. the major source of unintentional emission is the crt. to that can be added the video driver card , the rs232 parallel cable and the
printer head. the emissions from these are gross can be detected with the
crudest of equipment. were i to apply good test equipment and some
intelligence to measuring emission levels , i would find many other potential
sources of leaked information.

where cryptography is used for serious purposes , poor tempest protection
becomes an important security hazard.

in the early eighties , the need to allow some commercial concerns ,
particularly financial institutions , a level of protection against tempest
threat led to a series of briefings to invited corporations and to the
'release' of a cut down tempest stansard for commercial use. i say 'release'
for while equipment to meet the standard is available (at a price and to
approved customers) afaik even the commercial standard remains classified. if
you think about it , it would really have to would n't it \?

some of the messages here seem to reflect the view that the government is

a little perspective might be in order.

the number of court ordered wire taps is pretty low. law enforcement has to
present pretty good evidence to get even that limited number of
authorizations.

thus the overwhelming majority of conversations are neither tapped nor
recorded by the government , and for that to happen they have to
a) have a pretty good reason , with evidence
b) use this sparingly on highest priority pretty good reasons.

information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not
tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
that they have no right to , even under their own laws. given the long
history of members of the us government ignoring the laws that apply
to them , it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid , and
given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these
individuals once they are discovered , it is no wonder that so many people
in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for clipper.

the chips are programmed by mykotronx , inc. , which calls them the
myk 78. the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc. they are
implemented in 1 micron technology and will initially sell for about
30 each in quantities of 10 , 000 or more. the price should drop as the
technology is shrunk to .8 micron.

hmmmmmm. 30 seems a bit expensive. how big is the chip \? what kind
of packages will be used \? 3 volt or 5 volt technology \? how much
current will it draw \? i think there are many practical questions
that have n't been answered , especially since this chip already exists !

all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif (secure compartmented
information facility) , which is essentially a vault. the scif contains
a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips. about 300 chips
are programmed during a single session. the scif is located at
mykotronx.

at the beginning of a session , a trusted agent from each of the two key
escrow agencies enters the vault. agent 1 enters a secret , random
80 bit value s1 into the laptop and agent 2 enters a secret , random
80 bit value s2. these random values serve as seeds to generate unit
keys for a sequence of serial numbers. thus , the unit keys are a
function of 160 secret , random bits , where each agent knows only 80.

ok , i 've got a big problem with all of this. how in the world do you
expect to sell these chips for even 30 after all the overhead involved
in this programming procedure \? 2 4 people , a laptop , only 300 chips at
a time give me a break. and how long does all of this take \? even if
it is a minute per chip , it will take the greater part of a day to
turn out 300 of these things. how long do you suppose it will take to
program those 10 , 000 chips mentioned above \? this is highly impractical !

to see how the chip is used , imagine that it is embedded in the at t
telephone security device (as it will be). suppose i call someone and
we both have such a device. after pushing a button to start a secure
conversation , my security device will negotiate an 80 bit session key k
with the device at the other end.

so where can i find info on this at t device \? what kind of vocoder
does it use \? does it require isdn phone lines \? if not , is it full
duplex \? how does it sound \? what kind of synchronization scheme is
used \? will all other little black boxes have to conform to at ts choices
of protocol , etc. \? will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that
conform to these specifications \?

about scanning clipper and reverse engineering the algorithm
am i missing something obvious here \? what could have the government done
to address this possibility \? do they really care if it stays classified \?

yeah , you 're missing the obvious fact that since the algorithm
is classified , if you reverse engineer it from the chip , and later
publish it , or build a compatible chip , you 're divulging classified
information and are in a big load of trouble.

i do n't think they can do that without changing the law. the chip itself
is n't classified , and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)
unless prohibited by a valid contract. the algorithm may be classified ,
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information , but obtained from unclassified sources , is freely
publishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)

qualcomm had spare cycles in the dsps for their new cdma digital
cellular phones. they wanted to put strong crypto into them since they
had the capacity. the government decided to discourage them.

you 're blowing smoke. qualcomm wants to sell to nice , lucrative overseas
markets like japan and the ec. the government told them do n't do encryption
if you ever hope to export this technology . the reason that cdma does n't
have encryption is not because the g men came a'knocking at qualcomm 's door.
it 's because qualcomm does n't think that the us market for digital cellular
is big enough for them. this is just the international traffic in arms
regulations all over again.

perry has already stated on the net that qualcomm wanted to sell overseas , and
the government told them they would n't be allowed to export ,
so he 's only blowing the same smoke you are )
sure , they probably could have made a us version , and a non crypto
export version , and contracted with a bulgarian or japanese software house to
develop an overseas crypto rom , but that 's getting pretty expensive.

no , cylink sells their phones because they 're willing to make different
stuff for domestic use vs. export. qualcomm is n't. so cylink makes
money that 's capitalism , comrade.

well , some people like capitalism , and others prefer free enterprise
they 're different ! using the government to stifle your competition is capitalist.

someone out there will build a unit to do all this. better yet ,
prehaps someone will produce a package that turns any 486 box with a
sound card into a secure phone.
someone this and someone that. if you think it 's so easy , why are
you whining on the net instead of getting your butt in gear and writing it \?

writing good crypto code is something most good programmers can do
writing good new crypto algorithms is a very specialized skill.
developing new voice coding algorithms is also pretty specialized ,
but finding ways to implement the more complex ones when you do n't
have enough horsepower is still fairly hairy stuff.
once the 586 pentium becomes widespread , or the next generation of
sound boards has dsps on it , i suspect we 'll see it happen.
maybe the vanilla 486 soundblaster is enough.

pray for peace bill

ever since craig rowland posted his piece new encryption
to sci.crypt there has been some discussion of our company ,
secured communications technologies , inc , and on encryption
algorithm , nea.
i spoke to craig at length on 4 21 93 and we covered a lot
of ground. some of the information in the posting requires some
clarification , and i would like to answer some of the questions
raised on sci.crypt.
sct is a small company based in silver spring maryland. our
two main products at this time are a pc based secure
communications program called secom and a general purpose
encryption chip which uses the nea algorithm developed for secom.
secom provides an encrypted secure communication link
between two pc 's connected over dial up telephone lines. it
supports simultaneous bi directional file transfer and keyboard
to screen chat . it has its own proprietary communications
protocol which is tightly integrated to the encryption. all
though it is a packetized link , the data stream appears to be
continuous because the packet boundaries are hidden.
when secom was initially developed , it was implemented to
use des encryption. a business decision was made to seek export
approval for the product because it was perceived that the
overseas market was a large one and provided a good marketing
opportunity.
we soon found out that we would never be granted general
export approval for anything using des. all though the reason
for this was never explicitly stated , it seems to have something
to do with secret government to government agreements which are
still in effect.
in any event , the decision was made to develop a new and
different algorithm which would take the place of des. this was
the reason nea (new encryption algorithm) was born.
at this time nea is being held as a trade secret. the
preliminary work of patenting it has begun , and the plan is to
make it public once the patent process is complete. all though
one can make certain legal arguments for keeping it an ongoing
secret , i think in the case of an encryption algorithm it is
necessary to let people shoot at it over an extended period of
time to prove its worth.
in order to get export approval for secom nea , it was
necessary to go through nsa and to reveal to them the details of
the program and algorithm. this was done only after we had a
finished product to submit.
let me state unequivocally that there is no back door to
the program or the algorithm. secured communications
technologies is a closely held private company and
nsa fbi cia nist whatever has no financial interest in any way
whatsoever with the company or any of the people involved.
from a practical business standpoint , we are interested in
selling chips and software (hopefully in large quantities) and a
back door to the encryption , if found out , could destroy our
credibility and our business.
with the encryption algorithm approved for export , we set
out to talk to a number of potential customers for encryption
products and systems. we were able to identify several common
threads of functionality requirements. this led to the design of
a chip with the encryption algorithm cast in silicon and
certain other capabilities added so that the chip could fulfill
the broad range of requirements that we identified.
we are strongly opposed to the clipper capstone chips. in a
press release today , our president , dr. stephen bryen stated

it seems as if the government has an unlimited source
of funds to use to push its new bugged chips on the american
public. but do we not understand how the national security
agency , which is not supposed to be involved in domestic
spying , can fund the development of a commercial chip
intended to accommodate u.s. government domestic spying
activities.

if they had asked me to put a back door in nea i would
have told them to g f ed.
can nsa break nea \? or for that matter can they break des ,
rsa , idea , diffy hellman , pgp , rc2 , rc4 , or whatever \? i do n't
know and probably never will.

from these figures , estimate the number of clipper tap requests the fbi
is expecting. publish this figure. compare it on a per capita basis
with the amount of tapping now known or suspected.

the attorney general publishes the number of court ordered taps each year.
it is n't enough (around a thousand) for the average non crook , non spy to
worry about. in fact , considering any reasonable guess about the number of
big time crooks and spies around , it may not be enough even for most crooks
and spies to worry about.

there 's no reason to believe that it will go up with clipper , since the
number of taps now includes many targets too stupid to use encryption (based
on the playbacks we 've heard in court cases).
