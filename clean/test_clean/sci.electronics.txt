can anyone offer a suggestion on a problem i am having \?
i have several boards whose sole purpose is to decode dtmf tones and send
the resultant in ascii to a pc. these boards run on the serial interface.
i need to run of the boards somwehat simultaneously. i need to be able to ho
ok them up to a pc the problem is , how do i hook up 8 serial devices to one
pc inexpensivley , so that all can send data simulataneously (or close to it) \?
any help would be greatly appreciated !


are the boards at all intelligent \? (i.e. , run by microcontrollers \? ) the
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the pc. when this line was true , the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data. this is n't a perfect solution ,
though , since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards do n't
decide to talk at the exact same time .

other than that , i think you will need to hook up each board to something
that speaks rs 232. this actually is n't as hard (or as expensive ! ) as it
used to be , though. assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 bps
or slower) , the pics can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data. (this is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system. and it assumes that each board does n't talk more
than 1 8th of the time , of for very long , since a pic is n't going to be
able to buffer more than , maybe 20 some bytes ! )

you might want to check into the prices of multi serial card for your pc ,
though. i recently bought a boca research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports , 4
rs 232 ports) for a very reasonable 85.

one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys...

for our class project , we need to design and build a power supply
to the following specs

voltatge adjustable from 1 12v
current limited at 1a

voltage must stay within 2 of designated value for i from 0 1a
ac ripple less than 5 mv (rms)

of course , we ca n't just use an adjustable voltage , current limiting
regulator chip )

our problem is with the current limiting (i.e. we 've found stuff to
do the rest of the parts of the circuit). what the supply must do ,
if presented with a load which would draw more than 1a , given the
supply voltage , is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal
one amp. thus , if we were to short the thing with the ammeter , we
should read one amp. if we measure the current through a 1 ohm
resistor at 12v , we should read one amp (and the output voltage , by
necessity , must be 1v.

the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves
a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output
power transistor , and therefore reduce the output.

so , does anybody have any ideas we could work from \?

thanks in advance.

but i still have to do it , its graded )


you can design for ramp shutoff , brick wall current limit or even
fold back cutoff....sounds like you want brick wall current limit.

your lead is correct to pull down the bias to the series regulator base
drive. in order to get the brick wall , you need enough voltage gain on
the current sensor. normally a darlington on the current sensing
resistor will be adequate , but for infinite gain.. use an op amp to sense
the current releative to a stable voltage reference and use a driver to
turn off the base bias on the series pass transistor. phase compensation
may be necessary with this closed loop control system if yopu have more
than 180 degrees phase shift in your feedabck circuit at unity gain ok \? \?

hey , can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers \? just
a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool. i have the clues
on type a , b , and ab already and stuff , but these other ones are mentioned
occasionally and i dont know what they do. i think type d is like a pwm scheme
or something. thanx in advanced.


the whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency.

class d amps are pwm (pulse width modulation) amps which work very much like
switching power supplies. i think i 've seen these things called class s
before as well. they 're capable of very high efficiencies , and would be suitable
for very high power. i 've yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile
amp , though. i 've been trying to design a three kilowatter for the last year
(to be used as an inverter for an ups) , but have been having serious problems
with layout parasitics (10 irf 450 's in parallel... any help with a do able
isolated drive ckt would be appreciated ) )

i'm not absolutely positive about this , but i beleive a 'class g' amp is one that
operates off a variable or switched power supply rail voltage. the carver
amps do something like this. they use some sort of phase control circuit
(i do not fully understand its operation) to reduce the transformer size , and
i beleive that is patented. i had an m400 apart (trying to fix) and found that
it had three rail voltages that it switched between. i ran a simulation on
pspice and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation (heat)
under large signal conditions , or when driving reactive loads (which draw high
current at the zero voltage crossings).

brian@ucsd.edu (brian kantor) writes
while it 's possible that it 's a ham radio transmitter that you 're
hearing , it is n't likely every bit of signal that does n't go out the
antenna is wasted , as far as a ham is concerned , and most hams are

it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem.

technically competent to ensure that they do n't waste any signal if they
can possibly avoid it. to get their ham license , they had to pass a
government exam that tests them on that point , among others.

however , you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure there are
lots of other services where the operators aren't required to be
technically competent citizens band ( cb ) , for example.

there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical
competence at all. it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions
and answers. however , that said , most hams that i know do spend quite
a bit of time gaining some technical skill.

listen to the interference. if you hear voices clearly , it almost
certainly isn't ham radio , and might well be cb. if you can record a

do n't count on that.

bit of it , you could take the tape over to a local ham operator 's house
and ask him for his opinion of what you 're hearing. most communities

you cannot do that legally. however , you can ask a ham over to listen.
if the interference occurs at a specific time each day , then it would
be possible to do such scheduling. if nothing else , you could invite
the ham over to transmit from your driveway , to see if he interferes.
if he does , then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to
make it immune to rf interference.

have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing
to help you resolve interference complaints. look in the phone book , or
ask at the local ham radio store , or call the fcc for contact info.

the fcc may , or may not , have such information. they have enough to do
without getting calls for such information. if nothing else , call your
city offices or police department (general business number). they should
have the name of a local ham contact.

if it 's a ham , he 's more than likely willing to help get rid of the
problem. after all , it would be his signal he 's wasting. if it is n't ,
the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions.

see above your concept of wasted signal is erroneous. if his rig is
transmitting properly , then the chance of interference (with the exception
of harmonic television interference) is the greatest since he is putting
out the strongest signal.

it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is
operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a
piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of
the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device
that would n't affect one person in a thousand , but which bites you.
often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable
person , perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you 're
hearing.

unfortunately , most consumer equipment is succeptable it is all poorly
designed.

(btw hams are allowed amplifiers cb is n't. illegal ham amplifier
does n't compute.)

it does , but not for a mobile radio. there are very few mobile rigs that
could power a 1500 watt amplifier.

the discussion under the old topic went in the wrong direction. some people ,
instead of discussing the issue itself , they decided to discuss the
non technical part of the issue. so , here i go with my limited knowledge
about this issue. hoping you guys cut the crap and talk about the real
technical ways to do this. the methods that i am aware that are effective
are

1 laser hole burning. this would leave the disk damaged , so if you format
that particular sector of the disk you can not write to it. it is very

laser holes are (or were) used to prevent someone from making exact copies
of a disk. you do not want to write to the damaged disk , only read and use
the programs.

hard for crackers to damage the disk exactly the same way.


i remember a program called copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser
hole in it. i think it simulates the laser hole. after copying the disk the
program is , if necessary , used in conjunction with a program called nokey or
something. (the program tells you which program to use)

no solution.

this is not a good idea.. i upgraded my motherboard last fall. i would
have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to
reinstall simply because i changed motherboards.

opinion is understandable. ) i assume you have a tape drive \? not all
of us have about 200 floppies around for backup , you know.

actually , no i do n't have a tape drive. in the event of a total
hard disk failure , i reinstall the apps from originals , and restore the data
from the backups i keep of that. with upwards of 100mb of stuff on my hard
disk , there is no way i'm going to try and back it all up without a tape
drive. ) would be nice to have one though !

ram is something you add all the time , so no. it 's more like bios
manufacturer and or processor type (386 486 etc). data cannot be used ,
esp with these new flash rom bios machines with updates on a diskette.

maybe , maybe not. today it does n't happen as often (i would hope) ,
but then if a bios is buggy and the user gets an upgrade , the bios
information is going to change , at least the date anyway. tagging the bios
manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the
motherboard. this type of upgrade does n't require a hard disk
backup restore.

on the other hand , to make this less intrusive it could be disguised as
please insert original disk xx as i need file yyyyyy for update . )
it would be perfectly reasonable... sort of.

as long as it was n't done too terribly often. otherwise i think it
would get annoying and the user would go looking for other software.

this is silly. it 's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk , and then
give them that. your scheme is n't going to stop anyone.

of course it is easier. are you saying then the originals should allow
only one install \? what is your point \?

of course not. if something gets corrupted and my app needs to be
reinstalled , the worst thing i want that software telling me is this
software has already been registered to blank and it is against the law to
install it on other machines. or something similar access for windows
does this and it only requires a click on ok to go away. pretty
non intrusive , but it gets the point across.

what i said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the
restrict to one machine) until the program is registered with the
manufacturer. the manufacturer will then supply the
then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction
and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the registered to xxx screen.

this is a great idea. i like the key system that some shareware
products use. the only problem is that it will be difficult for big
software companies to implement this without it getting very
cost ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users.

well , the fastest , crudest mixer (aside from just physically connecting
all your inputs together directly) is to run each signal through a
resistor to a common output. the resistors give some isolation so the
signal sources are n't driving directly into each other.

taking a wild , seat of the pants guess , i 'd say that if you are mixing
high impedance sources like some dynamic mikes , electric guitar pickups ,
etc. , your resistors ought to be maybe 5k 10k or so. if you are mixing
line level stuff or the outputs of a walkman , or such , i 'd go with 1k.

can someone tell me where to find 120volt 3 watt 40 ma fans that
fit the standard computer mounting size )ie. 3 and 1 8 inch wide
and 4 inches diagonal from hole to hole (hole where bolt or screw
goes through. i have found higher (noisy) fans that are 120 v
6 watt , but i need a quite fan. i can use 12 volt as well , but
found just about all 12 volt fans to be noisy. i also find that
the 120 v fans are not only quieter , but the blade shape has a lot
to do with it. i have a dead fan that was quiet in it 's day. it
has long blades (like fan blades in a tturbo engine on a jet is
the only way i can describe it. the dead fan is etri model 126lh.
actually it 's not dead , it just makes a hideous rattle noise so
it 's stealthy qualities are void. thanks.

there are several types of copy protection , and the point is to make
sure the
user is using a legitimate copy. the simplest and virtually fool proof
way is
for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed
on
(some sort of checksum , serial number , whatever) so a copy put on a
different
machine (not installed from original disks) will not work.


okay , so what do you do if some part of the machine (presumably the part
on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself
upon goes bad , you replace that part , and now your program wo n't run
because it 's on a different computer \? \? \?

this is , of course , assuming that the program uses something in rom (like
the bios serial number , maybe \? ) and not a disk based code number.
obviously if the drive goes bad you 'll be reinstalling the stuff anyway.

i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system.
we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred
machines , both pc and macintosh , as well as administering a network of
over 50 next machines. i personally am concerned only with a small lab
with ten pc 's and ten mac 's. (i'm not the manager , but help him with
admin often). imho , copy protection schemes of any sort are nothing more
than a major headache for the legitimate user. anyone who wants a copy of
your program and does n't care about legality will get a copy. period.
pirate board or no pirate board. i too have friends who blatantly and
quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their
sleep.

let 's consider what goes on in our lab. almost daily we have at least one
machine down , sometimes several , due to some goofball screwing up some
setting or other on a piece of software. admittedly , we (being students ,
mostly) are not the world 's most efficient and effective network
administrators , but we try. keeping even the twenty machines that are
(partly) my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to
the average user , and maintaining behind the scenes consistency is a
real headache , but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty
different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his
disk.

often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do
some parts swapping to get stuff working temporarily. . . .

well , i 'll cut to the chase and quit boring y'all . . ..

the point is , often we have to re install software and copy configuration
files etc. from machine to machine. by far the easiest way we have found
to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to , then
copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine (of that
machine 's type). this ensures us that (for at least ten minutes) we have
ten identical machines to work with. having them networked simplifies
this considerably , as our major packages (wordperfect , windows , etc.) are
all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with.

often , however , we need to install a package requested by some instructor
to one , some , or all of the machines for a special project. this is
usually a hand written or shareware , etc. program similar to what i believe
the original poster was asking about. the few we have had with copy
protection schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain
. .

in short , do n't waste your time with a copy protection scheme. it 's sort
of like outlawing guns. the criminals will get your program anyway , and
you will only be hurting the legitimate , honest user. write a good user 's
guide and tech manual , whatever else for your program (please do this
regardless of whether you copy protect the thing ! ! ! ) , and only distribute
the manual to licensed users. jack the price to cut your losses , but
please take a cue from the major companies (who can admittedly afford the
costs of illegal copies far better than you) and do n't burden the
legitimate user with a copy protection scheme !

the program is definitely backupable , if restored to the same machine
(depends
on the programmer... do n't use a disk drive characteristic ! ) if the
user
did an upgrade to the machine , he she should reinstall all programs any
way.
no document look up , no disk wear and tear !

i did not say that the originals would allow only one install. the
user 's
conscience should do that.

i know , i 'll get flamed for this... but with the increasing number of
casual
users who either unknowingly or do n't care about the software copyrights
(it 's the truth. i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest
games
all the time , and when i refused , they went after somebody else.) ,
casual
pirating is becoming more of a problem. some sort of copy protection
will
discourage the casual copying. i 've seen what some of my friends dug
up
somewhere... latest and the greatest games , all cracked , within days of
actual
release ! you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to
disable
the quiz \? two ! yes , two ! (and do n't ask me which ones they are.)
determined
pirates are unstoppable , given enough time , but their results do not
spread
that far , since pirate boards are not that well known , and easily
tracked once
found by authorities. it is the casual pirates that the copy
protection is
determined to discourage.

what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
registered to xxxxx address , city , state zip and disables the
above.
two benefits 1) encourages registration , 2) cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable , because if the patch 's registration message is
encrypted , it will be quite hard to change , and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands , and thus
violated their license agreement.

this way , the legitimate users who does not register will experience
minimal
discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently \? ) as
only
problem they have is they wo n't be able to restore to another computer.

the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and
therefore
gains full rights , and can restore to different machines. on the other
hand ,
the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is
supposed to be. if this user 's copy was found to be somewhere it was
not
supposed to be , we know who has broken their license agreement. of
course ,
a hacker can break that eventually , but that 's not the point , is it \?

i 'd like blinking leds that can be set for approx 5 hz , 10 hz ,
15 hz , or 20 hz. something like that... i'm interested in what 's
out there for flash rates. i like the idea of leds with flasher
circuits already in them. i hate soldering ics in general. guess i
do n't have a hell of a lot of patience.


thanks ,

dana

if you want slow led flash rates , adjustable by switches (or by a
4066 4016 digitally controlled switch) , i suggest looking at a 555
oscillator chip. they cost 1 at radio shack (much cheaper in
quantity at quality places) , and you will be able to find good info
about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook (i think forest
mims has one at radio shack). you 'll have to toy with
resistor capacitor values or you can use your head with a little math
to get the right frequencies. any engineer worth his salt , can make a
555 osciallator... it 's in the book , and left up to you to see (i hate
doing ascii circuit graphics). the 555 can accurately go from a few hz
to about 500 khz (i think).

about the tape recorder gizmo , you could alter a stereo tape deck to
use one channel as a data line (for flashing led) , and one as audio
line (for voice or music). this would eliminate a lot of noise.

the data line is probably most easily done
by some kind of pll or bandpass filter (using just an op amp). the 565
chip is a good pll , and not hard to work with. however if you nothing
about how a pll works , i suggest you do n't try this. op amp
information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack
info booklets , and the popular 741 op amp is a snap to work with.
setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy , so i
would suggest the 555 method firstmost... i have no idea what this is
going into , so i am really generalizing...

as for manufacturing techniques , if you 're only goofing with it , i
suggest you breadboard the thing... no need to solder. wire wrap would
be the next , more permanent step. and lastly , soldering pcb making.
hope that clears things......

i'm wondering if it 's possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver \?

seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. this would be for short distances (2000 ft) ,
and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so.

this would be susceptible to fading , multi path etc. we used to use a
system at the shop made by tellurometer in south africa. it used a
10 ghz signal between 2 units across the distance to be measured.
the 10 ghz was just the carrier the real signals were several switched
ones around 7.5 mhz or so , whose relative phases at the receiver would
read out the digits of the distance down to 10 cm if needed. the units
came with psychrometers (sp \? ) to measure the relative humidity and
instructions for correction of the measurements due to rh and temp.
they were rather heavy and required an operator at each end.
current technology uses polarized reflectors , dual polaization tx rx
and psuedo random coding of a radar pulse. about the same resolution
at x band , much better at 47ghz. (only one end is heavy ) ).

lots of stuff deleted

the lead acid secondary cell discharge reaction is exothermic. i am glad
you do not dispute this point. if you do n't want the lead storage battery
to discharge , it should be stored such that its charged state is the
equilibrium state. during winter , the ground , be it covered with
concrete , dirt , or wood , maintains a cooler temperature on average than
the surrounding air or the battery. the heat capacity of air is less than
that of concrete , dirt , or wood , so it heats faster. conversely , air cools
faster , too.

the normal storage procedure for a battery is to leave it in an unheated
garage or basement. the storage surface is often cooler than the
surrounding air , with the battery temperature somewhere in between. e.g. ,
the basement air temperature may be 70 f , the floor temperature 65 f , and
the battery temperature 66 f.

the air temperature is higher than the battery temperature. the heat of
reaction is not going to move up the gradient. the floor temperature is
lower than the battery temperature , and heat is going to move to it. the
floor is an incredible heat sink.


might depend on where you live .. i know locally , for most of the winter
the ground , and concrete floor , within sheds and garages (unheated) is
signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature. the air does get
warmer during the day , but during the night , the ground and concrete
is definitely warmer , especially when protected by the walls from the
albedo effect. and the nights are longer by several hours than the
days.

pink noise and white noise are equal amounts of all frequencies. this

control have them i know the c 101 does.

wrong , wrong , completely wrong (and a little misleading , too).

white noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth. that is , a 5 hz wide band at 20 hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a 5 hz band at 20 khz.

pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth. thus , a 5 wide band of noise at 20 hz (whose
bandwidth is 1 hz) will contain the same energy as a 5 wide band at 20
khz (whose bandwidth is 1000 hz wide).

white noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths , pink noise is used with audio type real time analyzers whose
bandwidths are centert frequency dependent (often described as 1 3
octave or 1 2 octave or some such terminology).

white noise , relative to pink noise , has more energy at high frequencies
(at a rate equal to 3 db per octave). pink noise , relative to white noise ,
has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to , again , 3
db octave).

down on a downgrade , so you hit the push to talk button.

well 100 amps anyway. transmissions are generally for a short interval.
the battery would supply the rest. of course , if you transmitted too much ,
you would run the battery down.

it really would not be that much of a brake. even at 50 efficiency , 1500
watts would only consume 4 horsepower.

you do n't say what kind of electronic equipment you mean. it 's hard

when we 've needed to do an emergency cleaning job on things , we 've just

is completely dry before powering it up again. we let it dry for
several days to be damn sure.

i doubt that methanol has significant advantages over water. i would

i was wondering , what copy protection techniques are avaliable , and how
effective are they \? has anyone have any experience in this area \?

with highest regards ,
babak sehari.

uh oh...
umm , there are a number of copy protection schemes. some involve
modifying the physical media , and some involve encryption schemes , c.
all of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have
been successful for a time. i recall , however , near monthly releases of new
ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest releases. the fact
is , none of them are completely secure , or anywhere near it. some are more or
less difficult to crack , and some have already been cracked.
i guess what i am saying is that your question is difficult , if not
impossible , to answer. what exactly do you want to know \? do you need a good
one for a project you are working on \? how secure must it be \? are you trying
to crack one that someone else has used \? i can probably make suggestions ,
assuming the activity is strictly legal. (in general , it is a bad idea ,
legally , to tamper with copy protection. it can also lead to corruption of
files which you necessarily do not have back ups of (being as they are copy
protected , ) which can be devestating.) do you have absolutely no ideas for
practical applications , and are merely curious \?
please clear up those questions , and i 'll try to help as much as i
can.

incidentally , the uh oh... at the top is indicative of the dread
anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels
when they are asked how to hack. the area you are broaching is wrought with
dangers , many of which include breaking the law , or at least addressing it
(from one side or the other.)

i have written a program and i want to market it. i would like certain degree
of protection , since my main custmers are individuals and not the
cooperations. i know laser hole burning method , and hardware key method ,
however , my software is going to cost only 15.00 , so i can not afford that.
also , at this low price i can not afford people make too many copy of my
software. well , i guess say upto 20 illigal copying is ok by me.

however , i do not want someone to get a copy of pctools and copy my software.
off course , i never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying , since they
can develope a better program anyway.

with highest regards ,
babak sehari.




one of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask
you for a word from page x , line y , and word z , but this is pitifully simple to
remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program , and
some self rewriting code to confuse some people. also , make sure that your
program can not be run out a debugger.

another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk ,
just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector. to help you here ,
you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph.
make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with
garbage as well , or they (wanna be crackers) can just look for the junk in
some random sector.

like you mentioned , there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys , but they
are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end user , which you is the
opposite of what you want.

another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the
machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can
think of. if the program does not find that this is the same system , it
requests being installed by the original disk again. the original disk should
be encrypted , compacted , have many sectors that should be checked , and anything
else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied. once
again , you must put code encryption , self rewriting code , and multiple crc
checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed. among other
things , this also protects your program from virii. if the program detects a
change in its code , tell the user that a virus has been detected in the
program. tell them the program is virus secure , and remember , you have
helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses. feel good.

i hope that i have helped. have fun. knock some cracking out (well , you ca n't
do it , everything that can be written can be cracked , but you 'll piss'em off in
the process ! ). goodbye.

greetings. i 've recently decided to chuck the linear regulators
and learn the black magic art of switching power supplies...
(before anyone flames me , i know , both have their place )

anyways , i 've built the basic up down converters with pretty
good results ( 80 efficiency) but i'm running into problems
when i try to design build anything that puts out serious
amps... i know it can be done (i have some 5v@200a guts on my
bench) but something puzzles me i'm using a simple choke as
the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)
but all commercial models use transformers with many windings.
i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose
me... what are they for \? better than that , anyone have a full
schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of \? i 'd
love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
low volume )

my other problems (in getting high amps good efficiency) are
1) lack of sources of ideal components (calculated) and 2)
limited knowledge of the whole topic... i'm doing this on my
own (not school) mind you (in fact , i have yet to take any
course that covers transistors )

so , is the answer to 1 the accumulation of dead commercial
models and truning into a scavanger (not that it 's not what
i'm doing now...) and 2 getting understanding schematics
and a bit more of the mind boggling theory \?

take care.

p.s. my goal is 12v @ 25a in (car battery) 250vac out and
(on the other end) 250v 5vdc @ 5a , 5v @ 1a , 12vdc @8a
and 12vdc @1a... the distance between the two will be
more than 100 feet (of 14 16 gauge) but less than 300 feet.
would like to have a working model in a year or so... )

the atari 2600 used a 6502 cpu , just like their entire 8 bit line
(400 , 800 , 1200 , 1400 , 1440 , 130xe , 65xe computers , as well as the 5200
game machine).

wrong , it has a 6507.

the 2600 had some extra asic chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and pia 's for the joysticks.

it had one custome chip (not an asic in the sense that word is now understood)
the tia (sometimes known as the 6526 , although most other manufacturers list
that as the cia complex interface adapter.) tia stands for television
interface adapter , and it handles sound , paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

there was also a standard 6532 ram , i o , timer (riot) , plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer. that 's all.

later model 2600
might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci , as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.

not according to the servicing documentation i have here. the 2600 did not
change intenally very much at all.

additionally , i think the 2600 used 2k , 4k , and up to 8k of rom for
their games.

roms were mapped into the upper 4k of the 6507 's address space. 2k and 4k
games were fine , but later 8k and 16k games needed bank switching. atari
(and others) made much of these huge cartridges.

i have no idea how much ram it had to work with , but i
would hazard a guess of 2 or 4k ram.

wrong , it had 128 bytes of ram from the riot. this was multiply mapped into
both page 0 (pseudo registers) and page 1 (stack) , and also throughout the
bottom 4k of memory. tia registers also sat in this address space.

as 128 bytes of ram was somewhat limiting , some later cartridges also carried
ram themselves , which was interesting as atari had provided no write line
to the cart. this was managed by mapping the reads from ram into one address
range , and the writes into another , but all the time this scheme ate into
the very scarce rom address space.

our sluggish retinae of a discrete image projected for 1 300 second.

this is a 1950s idea. supposedly , splicing in a frame of buy

(b) see fcc information bulletin , subliminal projection (sic , at least in my
rules service copy of the rules) , dated november 1977.

since i do n't have either old copies of the federal register or the information
bulletin around , i ca n't tell you what you ca n't do on tv ( or radio) but i
seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late '70s.

practically speaking , i dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits
in mtv promos , badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such , but
maby that 's just because the contrast between the single frame and the
surrounding material was significant. i never believed in the one frame type
of sp being real.

on the other hand , the coca cola or brand (insert desired name here) beer cans
conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched ,
that 's another story , and if your tv station or network was paid by the beer
company for the privilege of doing that , there has to be a promotional
consideration paid by ...) or similar message included with the program but if
the tv station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company
and did n't get any of the payment for brand visibility that the film company
got , then they do n't have to run the message.

a few years ago , some junior person at an advertising agency
re invented subliminal projection and one commercial went out on tape
with single frame messages. it aired on a few stations , but a tech
at one station , previewing the tape , noticed a flicker and looked at
the tape frame by frame to find the defect . big flap. fcc notified.
commercial pulled. press reports. embarassed ad agency. you could
probably find the press reports via dialog or nexis if you wanted.

now that everybody has vcrs , it 's not likely that anybody could
get away with this on tv.

the data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such , of course) ,
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 khz , 16 bit , two channel data.
oversampling takes two discrete data points , and interpolates n 1 points
between them for n times oversampling. when i asked , people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation , but significantly more
complicated.

you are quite correct in your understanding.

in case you care , the filtering method uses an fir (finite impulse response)
filter. i 'd guess that cd makers use the same kind of method. anybody out
there know the real answer \?

typical (in the old 2x oversampling units) was a thirteen tap
fir , implemented as a dedicated hardware addition circuit. at this kind
of speed (slow , by digital standards) such an adder is much less
expensive than analog components of comparable precision.

i gleaned this information from a hardware manual for
an old cd player design where one would find similar info for
a particular cd (the digital filter is an interesting component ,
from my point of view) , i have no idea. the digital filter
is a kind of interpolation scheme (read a book on numerical

assuming you are refering to standard pots or ground start lines

if you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions , the ring
conductor is the one with approximately 48 to 52 vdc with respect to
ground while the tip conductor is at or very near ground potential (be sure
to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements).

if you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions , the ring
conductor will be the one with approximately 48 to 52 vdc while the tip
conductor would look like it 's floating (you may see some potential from
line capacitance it will bleed off over time). remember to use the telco
ground as your reference when making measurements.

i 've talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you
are lucky i.e. if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in
front of you , and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your
detector. otherwise it wo n't work. regular radar , of course , travels
in all directions hence it is more detectable. any comments \?

escort has a deal (till the end of april , i think) , where if you buy
their wideband (passport 3200 x , k , ka) and laser detectors , you 'll
save 60 off of buying them separately. in this case , the addition of
the laser detector over the passport 3200 is only 40 (i.e. passport
1000 normally costs 100).

uniden makes an all in one unit (x , k , ka , laser) for about 130.
colorado radar sells passive radar jammers , the passive supposedly being legal ,

discussion on piracy deleted

off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a
backup copy \? almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk ,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste
of time , space , and money , as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
out the backups.

my own practice with new software

make a copy of the original floppies to a second set of floppies.

install to hard drive from second set of floppies.

put originals in a box in room number one.

put copies in box in room number two.

1) accidents do happen to original floppies.
2) accidents can happen to the installation floppy.
3) sometimes software goes out on floppies that are just marginally good. or
gets too close to a magnet in shipping or storage.

i 've had experience with something like the last. i purchased a compiler from
a reputable vendor. the debugger in the package just would not install to the
hard drive. no way. repeated floppy to floppy copies finally got a clean read
of the disk. i don't recall if i used diskcopy , copy b , or xcopy .

i made a second copy of the marginal floppy and installed from that. no problenms ( except with my typing ) ) since.

i regard backup floppies as cheap insurance.

just my side of the question...

the atari 2600 used a 6502 cpu , just like their entire 8 bit line
(400 , 800 , 1200 , 1400 , 1440 , 130xe , 65xe computers , as well as the 5200
game machine).

wrong , it has a 6507.

sorry ian , i have n't toyed with it in several years. i have n't seen
the insides in quite a few years. i just saw the post lagging for
quite a few days , and thought i 'd toss in my 0.02. i assume the 6507
was functionally similar to the 6502 (was it also made by mos
technologies \? ). i really am more versed in the (6502 based) atari
computers. the 2600 came later on.


the 2600 had some extra asic chips that were basically
modified graphics chips and pia 's for the joysticks.

it had one custome chip (not an asic in the sense that word is now understood)
the tia (sometimes known as the 6526 , although most other manufacturers list
that as the cia complex interface adapter.) tia stands for television
interface adapter , and it handles sound , paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

in the atari computers , the cia chip you refer to sounds an awful
lot like the ctia (color television interface adapter) chip used in
the early models. later atari upgraded this to the gtia (graphics
...). other colorful literature stated that the gtia might have stood
for george , the developer of the chip.


there was also a standard 6532 ram , i o , timer (riot) , plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer. that 's all.

later model 2600
might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci , as the weight
of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years.

not according to the servicing documentation i have here. the 2600 did not
change intenally very much at all.

funny , i had an old and new model. the old one was significantly heavier.

additionally , i think the 2600 used 2k , 4k , and up to 8k of rom for
their games.

roms were mapped into the upper 4k of the 6507 's address space. 2k and 4k
games were fine , but later 8k and 16k games needed bank switching. atari
(and others) made much of these huge cartridges.

i have no idea how much ram it had to work with , but i
would hazard a guess of 2 or 4k ram.

sorry , i am way out of line here. my first microcontroller i built was
a mc68701 based chipset with 128 bytes onboard. that was not easy to
work with (in addtion to a small 2k on board eprom).

wrong , it had 128 bytes of ram from the riot. this was multiply mapped into
both page 0 (pseudo registers) and page 1 (stack) , and also throughout the
bottom 4k of memory. tia registers also sat in this address space.

as 128 bytes of ram was somewhat limiting , some later cartridges also carried
ram themselves , which was interesting as atari had provided no write line
to the cart. this was managed by mapping the reads from ram into one address
range , and the writes into another , but all the time this scheme ate into
the very scarce rom address space.

mike , ring is the red wire. tip is the green wire of most standard
phone lines. they two constitute the two wires most often used for
voice telephone (the two live lines). they are the two innermost
connectors of an rj 11 phone jack.

another way of telling is that if you measure voltage from red to
green (ring to tip. tip green being at ground potential of the
voltmeter) , it should read 48 volts in the on hook no ring position).
i am 98 sure it 's 48 v and not 48 volts. does n't hurt a phone too
much if they 're reversed , it 's just bad if one happens to somehow get
grounded to earth ground elsewhere).

additionally , when off hook , the voltage drops to about 4 to 9 volts
dc. i think it is supposed to correspond to a 36 to 40 ma current
loop. and lastly , when ringing , the two wires develop an ac potential
of about 80 v p p at 20 to 30 hz across them (where you get the
electromechanical old fashioned bell ringer from).

hope that clears things...

i would be interested in knowing more about the sensing hardware. what did
you use for the detector \? could you detect the angle of location , or did
the system simply respond to the presence of the transmitter in the sensors
field of view \?

phototransistor x100 x100 ne567
with 330kohm limiter
feedback to base
to control operating point (i expect this really hurts noise figure ! any
comments from phototransistor experts \? )

we intended to use this atop a stepper motor , to provide headings to the
beacons. the plan was to have 3 or 4 beacons , of different frequencies , in
each room , and tell the 567 what frequency to phase lock to. we did not do so.
one challenge was that the available stepper had 8 degree steps !
knowing the headings to each beacon , we would have used the surveyor
technique of resection to determine robot location. (no , i ai n't going to
explain resection over the net.)

given hindsight , i would digitize the amplified output of the self nulling
phototransistor circuit , and correlate in phase quadrature square waves at
the several expected frequencies , to extract amplitude of each beacon.
by doing this at the numerous steps , even with 8 degree steps , with knowledge
of the angular response of the phototransistor , you should be able to
rather more accurately determine the heading to each beacon.

after talking about 63 37 tin lead alloy and the eutectic point...
occasionally , impurities may be added to solder , to vary charactersitics
within the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance. for
example , addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce
the amount solder moves under stress when solid. for particular
applications additions of impurities may be warranted but , in general , it
is best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible.

i guess this is the good oil for commercial operations , but it does n't

i was just wondering one thing , actually two. ( i hope that this is the
proper place to post this subject)

why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
when stored on a concrete floor \?
i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year , to preserve them and i just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work , but
they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that , 'cause it ruins them ,
but he could n't tell me why.

i do n't see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the
battery.

however , you would have been better off leaving them outside. keeping
them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside.
a warm battery will self discharge faster than a cold one.

when you are storing a battery it 's a good idea to charge it once a month.
letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it (i suspect this is
what caused your problems).

rubbish. the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
mask that is used. older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used
a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them. these days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). the light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them (usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced). the blue (and red

i thought the first thread was hilarious , so here goes another post.

some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.

one year , i left the batteries in the garage. the garage is unheated.
they were left in their places that they needed to be. one in the riding
lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle. the battery in the
riding lawnmower was about 3 4 years old , and one of the cycle batteries
was new , and one was around 5 years old. upon spring time , i discovered
that all of the batteries were dead , and needed to be recharged. they all
worked properly , except for the older ones , and they had to be replaced
about halfway through the summer. (they had originally been stored
in the garage , and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring)
last year , i decided to bring them in to the basement , which has two parts.
one is dirt and brick , and the other is concrete. i brought in all three , and
discovered in the spring , (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries
dead , but when i put the charger on them , the charger said hmmmmmmmm and
the amp meter read around 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 (in other words , it was pinned)
the internal circut tripped , and i went on to the other batteries. they
were the same.
realizing that we still had 2 gigantic sailboat batteries , also lead
acid , i decided to put the charger on them. (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years , on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only
needed a small charge , around 2 hours or so on trickle. i tested them
by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts , and they
worked fine for around 25 of 'em.
this leads me to believe one of several things.
1) i bought really tty batteries last year. (sorta true)
2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
batteries.
3) there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the
room where the concrete is ,
4) the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
better than concrete.

(btw , i can almost waterski in the dirt room)

any other ideas \?
could be the aliens , anything is possible.


the lead acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following
chemical reaction

pb pbo2 2h2so4 2pbso4 2h20

lead and lead (iv) oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water

the standard heats of formation at 25 c (77 f) of the various compounds are

heat of formation
compound at 25 c , kcal mole

pb 0.00
pbo2 65.0
h2so4 193.69
pbso4 218.5
h20 68.3174

the heat of reaction at 25 c is therefore 60.6 kcal per mole pbso4 produced.
note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water
at 25 c) , and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
occurring , or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery. (i am almost
sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms , but i may be
wrong. oh well , i do n't have a corroded battery to corrobate , and i do n't feel
like thinking through it right now.)

what is important to notice here is that the reaction , as you knew it would be ,
is exothermic , or energy discharging. if moisture with dissolved electrolytes
(acid rain) condenses on the battery , a conductive path between the terminals
may form. this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds.
the reaction is reversible , if electricity (from an alternator or battery
charger) is put back into the battery.

lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge. each
cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction. the non reacting posts
(terminals) of the lead acid battery are there to remove (or add) electric
energy during a discharge (or charge). because the reaction is exothermic , it
has a tendency to happen , though quite slowly under normal circumstances. so
while keeping the battery dry is a good idea , it is not a total solution.

to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on
concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt) , one should recall lechatelier 's
principle , which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will
act to move to a more comfortable position. here are the thermal conductivities
of a some selected materials

note that the thermal conductivity for dirt (diatomaceous earth) goes down
with temperature. also , 204 c is about 400 k , and the values for earth powder
are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth. the thermal conductivity
of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt , and is 2 4
times greater than wood.

it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on
concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood. at any instant the
discharge reaction is occurring , energy is being released , either as electricity
or heat. (thermal conductivity of air is about 0.015 btu (hr ft ft)(f ft).)
during storage , except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on
the battery , this energy is mostly released as heat. the higher conductivity
surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity
surface. thus , if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom
surface , at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature ,
the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster
than that on dirt.

this is where lechatelier 's principle comes into play. removing energy from
the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion. if the
reaction normally occurs at room temperature , keeping the battery at that
temperature requires the removal of any heat produced. a concrete surface is
a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface. store a battery in the corner
of a poured concrete basement , and you have 3 surfaces removing energy , which
pulls the reaction along.

also , if water evaporates from the battery , that elevates the ratio of sulfuric
acid to water. this will tend to drive the discharge reaction.

the battery goes dead primarily becaust the floor is cold. the temperature
combined with self discharge promotes sulfation which ruins the plates of
the battery. i strongly suspect that the only reason the battery does n't
go dead as quickly on a dirt surface is because cement tends to be quite
cooler.

the lead acid secondary cell releases energy (electricity) with the following
chemical reaction

pb pbo2 2h2so4 2pbso4 2h20

lead and lead (iv) oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water
heats of formation deleted
the heat of reaction at 25 c is therefore 60.6 kcal per mole pbso4 produced.
note that lead sulfate is not very soluble (0.0048 grams per 100 grams water
at 25 c) , and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is
occurring , or the cathode (positive terminal) of the battery. (i am almost
sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms , but i may be
wrong. oh well , i do n't have a corroded battery to corrobate , and i do n't feel
like thinking through it right now.)

the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution.
pbso4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out. also , h2so4
is in a water solution as 2h30 and so4 . thus the heats of formation of
pbso4 and h2so4 are for the most part irrelevant.

what is important to notice here is that the reaction , as you knew it would be ,
is exothermic , or energy discharging.

as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic (heat producing).
(more about this later.)

what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this
(we 're talking lead acid batteries of course)
the battery slowly self discharges. as this discharge takes place two things
happen. the level of pb ions in the acid solution increases (i.e. the lead
and lead oxide plates are dissolved).
the level of h30 ions in the acid solution decreases (i.e. the solution
becomes less acidic , or more like water if you like).
now , as the post to which i am responding correctly stated , pbso4 will precipitate
in a water (non acid) solution. when the battery dies (i.e. is fully discharged)
we end up with a high concentration of pb and so4 in water. so pbso4
forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery (of course this
happens in varying degrees , the more discharged , the more precipitate forms).

the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery. if
there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate
(more common in a newer battery) a dead short results.

i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition , but they
are for the most part useless. they can dissolve the pbso4 but cannot restore
the lead and lead oxide plates properly. you may have some success with
these products for a newer battery.

stuff deleted
to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on
concrete as opposed to wood or earth (dirt) , one should recall lechatelier 's
principle , which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will
act to move to a more comfortable position. here are the thermal conductivities
of a some selected materials
stuff deleted
this is where lechatelier 's principle comes into play. removing energy from
the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion. if the
reaction normally occurs at room temperature , keeping the battery at that
temperature requires the removal of any heat produced. a concrete surface is
a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface. store a battery in the corner
of a poured concrete basement , and you have 3 surfaces removing energy , which
pulls the reaction along.

this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid.
in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher
temperatures. a logical consequence of the above argument is this
if you really want your car to start , lower the battery temperature to
50 to 'pull' the reaction along. we all know from experience (at
least those of us in canada do (it gets cold up here)) that this is
not true. if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm
the battery.

(besides which , there is not enough energy released through self discharge
to appreciably raise the temperature. the air would amply dissipate any
such heat , whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not. this
is of course irrelevant , since you would want the battery to be cool
during storage.)

just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged !

two benefits 1) encourages registration , 2) cuts down on pirating and

you take two copies with a different registration id , compare them byte for

with regards to what you wrote , how does one adjust for room dynamics
and stuff like that \? i asked a professor that question just
last week and he did n't really know himself. since pink noise is believed
to be due to surface states (say , the surface of the silicon where there 's
a lack of a covalent bond) that act as traps to nearby elecrons , and since
this happens at low frequencies (because at high frequencies they are n't
able to trap electrons) , how do you compensate for that \? it seems to me
that you would n't be able to compensate for pink noise. i have seen the
pink noise feature , however , on many eqs , and i was wondering
how they are suppose to compensate for noise when pink noise is not due to
man made noise like power lines , crosstalks , coupling , etc. if you have
any information about this , it would be appreciated. hope this did n't sound

have to) , but would that do the trick \?

two things to watch for
in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing , so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
in sweden , the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed down by one position this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
otherwise , it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the german or swedish phone system.
otoh neither you nor i would ever try that , as it is of course
illegal.


i am not quite so sure about the illegality of using a regular american phone
on your home system. i vaguely remember a few years ago , when deutsche
bundespost split into postdienst , postbank , and telekom there was some
discussion about a new regulation. i know that cordless or cellular phones
still have to be approved by the telekom , but does that hold true for regular
phones \? in my areacode in germany (2234 frechen , near koeln) you can use
touch tone dialing. i assume , however , that most areas are still exclusively
set to pulse dialing. last time i checked (jan '93) the cologne areacode 221
was still solely pulse dialing.

btw , touch tone does become more common in germany , bringin with it the
flourishing of 1 900 services (in germany 0190). i just hope we 'll all have

it 's not the concrete floor that does it. the problem is that lead acid
cells self discharge over time. even high quality cells (gates for instance)
will discharge 50 60 over a 3 5 month period of time. non sealed cells
self discharge even faster. if the battery was not completly charged
when left sitting , it probably discharged past the the point where cell
sulfiding occurs , which in many cases means a ruined battery.

technology program , and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot
wide stage from 50 feet away.

very interesting application , controlled lighting and environment , moderate
distances ... might be more interesting than my application. just a thought ,
you could use a roof mounted ir sender , similar in operation to a tv remote
control that tells each persons coded ir pulser to send a pulse. a hamamatsu
detector , as was mentioned in a previous message in this thread , would give
the current position. store and collate this on a computer and you could
replay the movements on the screen. interesting !

hi ,
i am looking an integrated circuits for my z80 based
computer.
the circuit is called z80 sti (serial timer interrupt) ,
mk3801 , and
made by mostek. mostek is called sgs thompson today.

i have been in contact with sgs thompson , unfortunately
they me told that z80 sti is obsolete.

so , my question is if anyone know if i can get hold of that
circuits. are there any companies that specialize in selling
circuits that are no longer in production \? i have contacted
several electronic brokers in
sweden , but without any success. i would appreciate if you
could give me hint where i should continue looking. even
companies in the united states would be fine , since this
circuit is pretty crucial to me.


thanks in advance.

i built a little project using the radio shack 5vdc relays to switch
audio. i got pretty bad 'clicks' when the thing switched. i was doing
most of the common things one is supposed to do when using relays and
nothing seemed to get rid of the clicks.

my question is

is there a good relay relay circuit that i can use for switching
audio , so that there will be no noise of any kind on the audio lines.

i will appreciate any advice or references to advice. also , exact part
numbers company names etc. for the relays will help !

the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component , intentional
or not , on the audio lines to be switched. if neither the output or
input presents an unintentional dc level (let 's say they 're capacitively
coupled) , then putting a 22 k resistor from each input to ground , and
from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any
coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click.

if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than
just coupling capacitor leakage , then you need to remove the dc before
switching with coupling capacitors of your own.

if you have more than one relay (each relay switching one input
through to a common output) , you can use make before break switching
where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch
change. this may mask the switch click.

an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and
making your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor (ldr)
sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink. many broadcast consoles
use this older , but time honored technique. claro actually makes
a complete optisolator like this , but i do n't have a part number handy.
radio shack has a ldr grab bag (276 1657) you might want to try.

for a simple , solid state clickless switch that is cheap , you might try
looking at the cd4066 analog switch that is commonly available (or its
older predecessor , the 4016). again , the dc component must be removed
prior to switching. other alternatives include jfet switches (both discrete
and ic) and diode switching (which works relatively well , surprisingly).
all the above , with their pitfalls and application tips could easily
make a subject for a multi page article.

solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on
due to charge being injected into the audio line through device
capacitance when the control signal changes state. techniques to
minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through
the switch , differential switching , and slowing the risetime of the
control pulse. with the 4016 , cutting the click can be as simple as
putting 10k 47k resistors in series with the control pins.

hope this helps at least get you started.

it 's possible to make boards in other colors , and i have an ad
for laser light show equipment which offers the circuit boards in your
choice of day glo (tm) colors.

the usual light green color is just the natural color of fiberglas.
the dark green or blue is the solder mask layer , and i suspect that color

flyback , the other was the assembly where the windings of the yoke
came together.

first i found by poking around the windings on that assembly ,
the thing would make noise. i guess that there was enough of a potential
in that assembly to leak , so i sprayed it with a dielectric insulation
spray i think it was urethane or acyrilic. that fixed it.

second flyback...for the life of me , i ca n't isolate this one. if i
leave the cover off , the tv will be quiet. if i put the cover back on ,
and let it heat up , it 'll start to whine kinda hard to solve with the
cover on ! ! (

a friend of mine who used to fix tv 's says there might be a pin hole
leak somewhere on the flyback. usually it 's surrounded by a bunch of
black dust dirt.

i hope this is a start...if you find something out , let me know !

i think it 's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is

it could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered

this may contribute to discharging but would be reversible.


the same thing happens to my car (citroen 2cv) damp gets under the
bonnet (us hood ) and shorts the spark plugs to earth so it wo n't start.

the solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with
wd 40 (moisture repellant). if damp is the problem , then storing the

well , this is off topic , but back in the days when i used to drive bangers
i never found wd 40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did'nt do.
i think the effectiveness of wd 40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns
the company.

battery off the ground may help. i'm not sure if spraying with wd 40
would be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).

for those who do n't know , methyl ethyl ketone is more commonly known

oh dear , time for me to try to remember my chemistry. let 's see if i

mek acetone

c c c c c c c

the hydrogens are not shown , and represents double bond. mek has a
methyl (ch3) on one side , and an ethyl (c2h5) on the other. acetone
has two methyls. so acetone is not methyl ethyl ketone , but instead
is dimethyl ketone. both solvents have similar properties. i think
that mek may be a little less flammable but a lot worse to breathe.
it 's a lot harder to buy mek than it once was. use acetone.

nail polish remover consists almost entirely of acetone. if you buy
some for your workshop , get the very cheapest , because the more
expensive kind has oils and perfumes that you do n't need.

wow , what a concept ! does anybody want to speculate on how this
non connection would fit into the theft of cable services laws \?
it seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into
the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to
stand upon in court.

well , the catv company , in the us , is accountable to the fcc for how
much transmission their cables make. in fact , i 've heard first hand
about how the catv company asked to inspect the wiring in a
home business to find the source of rf leaks. i 've heard many of their
vans have rf detectors and they keep one eye on them as they drive down
the street.

if the cable is leaky enough to have usable signal , i would guess that
they 're probably in violation of fcc transmission laws.

in england they do (did \? ) require permits to operate a tv ! ! !
supposedly , the tv police drove around with rf detectors looking for
the if or whatever produced by a receiver that was n't registered. i'm
guessing the purpose was just something else they could get away with
taxing. i do n't know if the tv police were are just urban legend or
an actuality.

the tv police are still with us i'm afraid. a 1000 pound fine goes out to

two things to watch for
in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing , so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
in sweden , the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed down by one position this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.

this is just basicly right. the connections that cannot handle touchtone dialing is very few. i would estimate a couple of percents and if you are in a bigger
town , there is none that cannot handle tone dialing.
and regarding our swedish dialing system (a rather screwd up system) , that does
just apply to pulsdialing. not to touchtone.
btw norway is even more interesting. they got both system ! so you need different phones depending on where in the country you live.

hey , now will you stop encouraging him \? copy protection only serves one pur
pose to keep the honest buyer from making (legal) backup copies. it will
definitely not stop any pirates. if you want to protect you soft , supply a
good documentation and support. this is imho the only way of effectively
protecting software.

there are several types of copy protection , and the point is to make sure the
user is using a legitimate copy. the simplest and virtually fool proof way is
for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on
(some sort of checksum , serial number , whatever) so a copy put on a different
machine (not installed from original disks) will not work.

the program is definitely backupable , if restored to the same machine (depends
on the programmer... do n't use a disk drive characteristic ! ) if the user
did an upgrade to the machine , he she should reinstall all programs any way.
no document look up , no disk wear and tear !

i did not say that the originals would allow only one install. the user 's
conscience should do that.

i know , i 'll get flamed for this... but with the increasing number of casual
users who either unknowingly or do n't care about the software copyrights
(it 's the truth. i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest games
all the time , and when i refused , they went after somebody else.) , casual
pirating is becoming more of a problem. some sort of copy protection will
discourage the casual copying. i 've seen what some of my friends dug up
somewhere... latest and the greatest games , all cracked , within days of actual
release ! you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable
the quiz \? two ! yes , two ! (and do n't ask me which ones they are.) determined
pirates are unstoppable , given enough time , but their results do not spread
that far , since pirate boards are not that well known , and easily tracked once
found by authorities. it is the casual pirates that the copy protection is
determined to discourage.

what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
registered to xxxxx address , city , state zip and disables the above.
two benefits 1) encourages registration , 2) cuts down on pirating and
makes it more traceable , because if the patch 's registration message is
encrypted , it will be quite hard to change , and therefore provides a
stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands , and thus
violated their license agreement.

this way , the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal
discomfort (who does major upgrades to their computer frequently \? ) as only
problem they have is they wo n't be able to restore to another computer.

the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore
gains full rights , and can restore to different machines. on the other hand ,
the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is
supposed to be. if this user 's copy was found to be somewhere it was not
supposed to be , we know who has broken their license agreement. of course ,
a hacker can break that eventually , but that 's not the point , is it \?

it is essential that the external device not try to pull these

if an external device should be driving data on these pins (in

i will accept no responsibility if you incur damages of any kind

nothing , but if you read my whole suggestion , i'm saying that you register
via mail by mailing in your registration card , then the company send you
the patch which includes the info you put on the registration card.

kasey chang

i'm glad to see this idea come up because i 've had something similar in mind.
what if you had an authorization key that computed from the name and address
data. when the user registers , you do n't even need to send executable code ,
just compute his her key and send him her instructions to enter in the
appropriate place the following

name joe doe
address 123 main street
city anytown , ca
key ldslfoialsdkcdsngsikhsfd

every user needs a unique key. the executable can propagate as much as you
like , the author can respond to the registration by e mail , post card ,
whatever. unauthorized users would have to put up with someone else 's name
showing up (maybe on a main menu screen as well as a startup message).
authorized users can make as many copies as they like , upgrade their
machines , whatever. the main motivation here is guilt and irritation at
seeing someone other than yourself as the registered owner .

why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
when stored on a concrete floor \?
i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year , to preserve them and i just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work , but
they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that , 'cause it ruins them ,
but he could n't tell me why.

this topic was beaten to death a year or so ago.

the concrete is not the problem.

lead acid batteries often fail from disuse (not being charged for a long
time) , but there 's no way the concrete floor could be the cause of the
problem.

the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate. that 's
why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery
thermally. it you 'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam , it will
self discharge even slower. the best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly , but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow
cycle the charge in the battery. such mild exercising of a lead acid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage. if you do remove the electrolyte , may sure you keep separate storage
containers for each cell 's electrolyte and put it back into the same cells
when you refill the battery. this is n't so critical for a brand new battery
in a fully charged state , but will maximize the restored output of an older
battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for
storage.

just thought i would add 0.02 to deskjet thread. i got my
first one in college about 5 or so years ago.

i 've been a happy hp user of the deskwriter for macintosh for
past 5 years. i got one just a few months after their release. and i
got software revision 1.0a (now i'm up to rev. 3.1. our family (sister
and father) have each purchased their own dw 's after seeing mine go
for one year unscathed (their stuck to their trusty imagewriter ii 's).
the original dw has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use. i would
say that it has gone through at least 15 , 000 sheets , and around one
(small) ink cartridge every 3 months or so.

my brother might take this dw now (i'm probably gonna give it
to him) , and i am looking to upgrade to a color dw. the chief
advantages disadvantages i 've found over the years are

advantages quick (2 3 ppm) , quiet (roomate can sleep while it 's
printing) , appletalk networkable (unfortunately the original was n't ,
so look out if you buy used. i rewired our home with phonenet
appletalk connectors , and while home , we can all use my dad 's one
dw ! ) , and cheap (now run 300). btw , you can upgrade older dw 's to
color or for appletalk , i dunno if hp still does the upgrades , but i
received many offers (i just did n't ned it however). also , crisp
laser quality output is a wonder (used to really impress those
imagewriter dot matrix people so much so , that i had to charge 0.25
per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all
hours of the night....)

disadvantages. ink used to be hard to find , and was n't cheap , and
was n't originally water proof. while hp has done wonders with the ink
(i dunno if it 's still toxic) , it is still subjet to smearing and
running (if you run around in the damp boston rain , and get your
bookbag completely soaked). ink now runs about 14 15 for small carts
(i get mine from elek tek in chicago , i think they 're now down to
12). the ink carts used to say they 're dated for only 6 months , but
i do n't think they say so anymore. we stick to a 4 month supply (of
about 3 carts). we use cheap hammerhill laser print paper (after
fooling for a long time. laser xerox paper is also good). smearing
does n't happen , unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the
paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine.
other disadvantages are no postscript (this can be an advantage in
speed , usually). ways around this are ghostscript or freedom of press
software solutions. i bet hp probably has a ps prototype inkjet , but
they wo n't release it for fear of hurting lj sales.

in the end , the primary advantages of laser are true postscript
(unless you go for cheap lasers) , and fused toner (no smearing , even
when soaking in water). lasers are slightly sharper , but the only
instance where i needed precise layouts was printed circuit board
transparencies for photoetching. i found a textronix color phaser
postscript (thermal wax transfer) to work the best to make pcb
negatives directly onto a transparency.

well , hope my babbling has helped.

wrong , it has a 6507.

for those who would like to know , the 6507 was a 6502 without irq or nmi ,
and with only 13 address lines (giving 8k memory space).

yes , but still not a 6502 for those differences. same instruction set ,
of course.

it had one custom chip (not an asic in the sense that word is now understood)
the tia (sometimes known as the 6526 , although most other manufacturers list
that as the cia complex interface adapter.) tia stands for television
interface adapter , and it handles sound , paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

did n't know about it being called the 6526 thats the cia found in the
commodore 64 (i do n't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around).

yes , the same number , but an entirely different device. i should have
qualified this further by stating that this was the pal version of the tia
i am not 100 sure that the ntsc tia would have a different number.

the tia was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0 , and shadowed in the
bottom 128 bytes of page 1. to get an image on the screen , you had to wait
until the raster line your picture started at , load bitmaps for this line
into the 'sprite' registers , tell them what x positions to take , how many
duplicates you wanted , etc , then do it all again for the next line. this
took all of the processor 's time during the visible portion of the
display.

does anyone on the net actually have details of the tia , as this is the only
device i have not yet discovered details about \? atari australia , when asked ,
claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the 2600
had failed , as the us head office had refused to provide it.

to chip selects. the 6507 likes to have rom right at the top of memory , so
the 2600 had to use roms with active high chip selects not exactly
normal , so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more
usual active low chip select.

i saw a couple of cheaper devices with pn2222 's and a couple of resistors
hooked up as a cheap inverter. nasty , but workable , and cheaper than a
7404 inverter if labor costs almost nothing.

it could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered
by moisture or damp air , which would short out the terminals.

the same thing happens to my car (citroen 2cv) damp gets under the
bonnet (us hood ) and shorts the spark plugs to earth so it wo n't start.

the solution (for the car) is to clean the plug leads and spray with
wd 40 (moisture repellant). if damp is the problem , then storing the

would be safe since it is very flammable (high percentage petroleum).

x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl8


i thought the first thread was hilarious , so here goes another post.

some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries.

one year , i left the batteries in the garage. the garage is unheated.
they were left in their places that they needed to be. one in the riding
lawnmower (what a lux) and one in each motorcycle. the battery in the
riding lawnmower was about 3 4 years old , and one of the cycle batteries
was new , and one was around 5 years old. upon spring time , i discovered
that all of the batteries were dead , and needed to be recharged. they all
worked properly , except for the older ones , and they had to be replaced
about halfway through the summer. (they had originally been stored
in the garage , and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring)
last year , i decided to bring them in to the basement , which has two parts.
one is dirt and brick , and the other is concrete. i brought in all three , and
discovered in the spring , (about 15 days ago) that not only were the batteries
dead , but when i put the charger on them , the charger said hmmmmmmmm and
the amp meter read around 1 , 000 , 000 , 000 (in other words , it was pinned)
the internal circut tripped , and i went on to the other batteries. they
were the same.
realizing that we still had 2 gigantic sailboat batteries , also lead
acid , i decided to put the charger on them. (these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years , on the brick and dirt part) and noticed that they only
needed a small charge , around 2 hours or so on trickle. i tested them
by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts , and they
worked fine for around 25 of 'em.
this leads me to believe one of several things.
1) i bought really tty batteries last year. (sorta true)
2) the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the
batteries.
3) there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the
room where the concrete is ,
4) the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air
better than concrete.

(btw , i can almost waterski in the dirt room)

any other ideas \?
could be the aliens , anything is possible.

the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a
colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate. that 's
why the old wives' tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works
to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery
thermally. it you 'll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam , it will
self discharge even slower.

there are a number of inaccuracies here
1) in fact , a colder battery will self discharge more slowly. this is why
batteries should be stored in a cool , dry place.
2) an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed
on wood. the battery , the wood , and the concrete will all be at the
same general temperature (ignoring temperature fluctuations) and thus
none will effect the other.

the best thing would be to attach a small load
such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it
on constantly , but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow
cycle the charge in the battery. such mild exercising of a lead acid
battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for
storage.

there is no need to 'exercise' the battery. just keep it charged. (a trickle
charger will do the job.)

hams can legally run up to 1500 watts. it is very unlikely , however ,
that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car. ham rigs

not possible either. you 'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier. i can just see it. you need to slow
down on a downgrade , so you hit the push to talk button.

now , that indeed is possible. a good friend of mine is running about 1 kw
pep from his car. yes , he does have a second alternator. yes , he calls
the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down.

it has been a while since i knew the electronics of ham radio , but i seem
to remember that pep is actually 4x the real power. which makes 1kw pep
actually around 250w. or was it 2x \? i disremember.

effective transmitted power is also odd , in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry. which is why a tv station with a 50kw klystron
might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
cn tower ).

this is like sears hp )

though , 1500 real watts still is n't impossible. about 125 150a with
a 12v alternator , less if the alternator produces higher voltages.

it 's only three horsepower (taking into account inefficiencies). you 'll
feel it when you hit the key. but not too much.

anyways , i 've built the basic up down converters with pretty
good results ( 80 efficiency) but i'm running into problems
when i try to design build anything that puts out serious
amps... i know it can be done (i have some 5v@200a guts on my
bench) but something puzzles me i'm using a simple choke as
the storage element (basicly a toroid with a single winding)
but all commercial models use transformers with many windings.
i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for
the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose
me... what are they for \? better than that , anyone have a full
schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of \? i 'd
love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such
low volume )

most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage
that 's handled by the big caps on the primary side , those which in a
linearly regulated power supply would be considered the filter caps ,
coming right after the bridge. the transformer is just that a
transformer. it 's there primarily to step the voltage up or down. (although
the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not
negligible , as anyone who 's zapped said transistor from either failing to
get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a
snubber diode across it would tell you. actually , many transistors intended
for switcher use today have the diode built in.)

the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this (in
a somewhat simplified manner) the ac line is rectified to produce a
high voltage , more or less unregulated dc rail. the energy storage (or
filter ) caps appear across this rail , as does the switching transistor.
the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer ,
resulting in stepped up or stepped down pulses out the secondary , which
are then rectified and filtered. at least one of the transformer 's outputs
is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor ,
which acts in a pulse width modulation (pwm) fashion to control (by varying
the pulse width) the amount of energy being dumped into the primary , and
therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary. the remaining outputs
may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will , more or less
tracking the regulated output , or they may have some additional linear
regulation added. you may also note that the feedback between the
regulated output and the pwm control (which is most typically an ic)
is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various
safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be
electrically isolated. often , the feedback path involves an optoisolator
to meet this requirement.

while the transformer is n't the primary energy storage device in these
designs , this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can
be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a
bad time (as noted above) , you also need to worry about getting all the
energy that went in to the transformer back out again , one way or another.
in some designs , this happens more or less automatically but in others ,
you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core does n't
saturate , which again would have disastrous results (best left to the
imagination ! )).

i'm not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer
hopefully , a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors
in the above.

if you can modify the design of the dtmf decoder , the ideal comunications
would be over a multi drop system , like rs 485. rs 485 boards are available
for pc 's , probably cheaper than a bunch of rs 232 channels , and rs 485 is
cheaper to build onto your satellite modules , using only a single supply
8 pin dip driver chip. software at the pc end would be similarly complex
for either rs 232 or rs 485 , in my opinion. the higher data rates possible
with rs 485 would permit quasi simultaneous data transmission.
hope this helps.

and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so.

depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes , in
a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this
concept.

how about measuring vertical distance as well , any chance or am i getting
ridiculous \?

what is the difference between vertical and horizontal \?

what frequencies would be best for this \? or does matter \?

this depends on the required range , the required accuracy , the allowable
ambiguity in range , the frequencies the fcc (etc) allow you to use.

i did not say that the originals would allow only one install. the user 's

this is silly. it 's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk , and then give
them that. your scheme is n't going to stop anyone.

little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing. using pklite or
some similar utility would help , but only if the resulting compressed .exe

what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup

this is by far the best idea you presented in your post. making it

all the physics aside , from a practicle standpoint the author 's said
they built a prototype with nothing more than a small sony lavelier
mike laid up against a large aluminum disk. in demonstrating it at

the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them.

anyway...i want to build some to use as choir mikes (wide coverage).

but for a buck or two more i got the ones spec 'd to go out to 20khz

the distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of

puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate , or mounting
it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a

dplatt@ntg.com (dave platt) writes

what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects \?
the affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road...

might be a couple of hundred watts , from the sound of it. kicking sound
out of the tv and stereo speakers by direct rf rectification requires a
mighty strong carrier ! i 've heard of linears so powerful that
triggering them while the car was idling , would stall the engine by
pulling down the battery voltage.

it would take a lot more than that. it sounds like the radio equipment is
actually not shut completely off but just goes to a standby situation.

i suspect that the stories are just that , stories. the voltage can only
be sucked down so far instantaneously. when you try to jumpstart someones
car , when your vehicle is at idle , does your car stall \? no , the other car
just does not crank well. now , the engine might stall because the idle
was too low to start with. when the extra current is drawn , the idle speed
will drop as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the
increased amperage requirement.

is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company , the fcc , or both \?

ultimately it 's likely to be your problem to resolve , i'm afraid. the
fcc is so understaffed that they do n't pay much attention to citizen
complains about rfi (or so i 've heard)... they 'll just send you a
pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures.

talking to the power company might help they might be able to install
filtering devices at your service panel (or recommend a type which you
could have installed by a licensed electrician).

a transmitter is not going to be affecting house power. if surges are
occurring there , it is due to another cause not a transmitter.

unfortunately , there 's a fair chance that enough signal is being picked
up by your house wiring that a simple service panel filter wo n't
suffice. you may need to install heavy duty rfi filters at the power
connections of your affected equipment.

it is probably not that much of a problem. often toroid coils on the
power leads will solve that part of the interference problem. it will
not solve internal equipment deficiencies.

if the problem occurs regularly , you may need to stake out the street
in question , and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by
at the time interference occurs. if you can identify the vehicle which
is transmitting , you may be able to contact its owner and complain.

it is probably not the transmitter that is at fault. if the person is an
amateur , then he she will probably be willing to help if you explain
that the person is causing interference.

nope. your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the
long cable from the generator , or just plain not having enough power. i
would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short
peaks.

you can try using larger (and shorter) cables to the generator , or try
strapping the amps for 240v service and running 240v mains cables out ,
which will minimize the line drop. if these do n't work , though , you 're
going to need a bigger generator.

i assume that you 're using well maintained generators , and have watched the
voltage output on the generator properly. if you do n't have 120v coming out
of the unloaded generator you 'll never get 120v at the other end.

i recommend you talk with an electrician who has experience in this sort of

i never found wd 40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did'nt do.
i think the effectiveness of wd 40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns
the company.

back in high school i used to work for a detailing company , and one of the
services we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil before you
sell the car... ). unfortunately , we did not have a high pressure
washer so we would use one several miles from the shop. on more than one
occasion after washing the engine , it would not start as water would have

minimize this) , around the spark plug wires , etc and it would be nearly
impossible to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. the usual
solution was to carry a can of wd 40 , and when the car would n't start to spray
all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.

it may be a myth , but it certainly kept me from being stranded at a car wash...

when constructing active filters , odd values of resistor are often required
(i.e. something like a 3.14 k ohm resistor).(it seems best to choose common

is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such
a resistance , given fixed resistors of the standard 12 values per decade \? .(1 ,
1.2 , 1.5 , 1.8 , 2.2 , 3.3 etc ). it is a common enough problem , yet i cant
recall seing a program that tells that rx ry rz gives rq , starting with
q and finding prefered values x , y and z.

i once wrote such a program (in bbc basic...) it was very crude , and took
around 5 seconds to do an exhaustive search (with a small amount of
intelligence) , and told you the best combination rq and the best below rq.

if you want to write one , just store the prefered values in an array , and
then search the solution space using three nested loops. i'm sure you
could knock this up in an hour.

why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)
when stored on a concrete floor \?

when will people learn !

the trouble is the ballast in the concrete and as every fool knows ballast
resistors are used to discharge batteries. furthermore it is very silly to
store the battery with the terminals downwards as you must have done to
contact the ballast.

seriously self discharge (the actual problem , as stated by others) does vary
greatly with certain types and freaks show low self discharge. i have in
fact seen ordinary automotive batteries which have effectively held full
charge for 2 years so it must be possible.

if your garage is heated , store the batteries somewhere cooler but above
freezing (flat batteries freeze more easily). occasionally charge it (once a
month \? ) or even leave it on 'float' charge permanently (special charger ,
don't do this unless you know what you are doing , seriously dangerous).

anouther point is the unsuitability of automotive batteries for things like
electric mowers they are not generally designed to be repeatedly deep
discharged and their life may be greatly shorted. some early zero maintenance
automotive batteries in fact responded to a full discharge with total failure
shortly afterwards but modern ones are superb. (6yrs , 95000 miles and
counting)

this is called silver bearing solder. it is used to solder to
devices that have silvered contacts. one application is soldering
to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old tektronix scopes. these
were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches.
if you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver
off of the ceramic. the silver was quite thin. the 2 is a saturated
solution of silver in tin and lead. thus , no more silver can be
disolved in the solder solution. other devices that use silver contacts
are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers.

technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
not tought about it (yet) \?

juha
the color of the board shows the composition of it , hence the use of it.

original and older boards were bakelite composition , and were brown.
phenolic (spelling) was a tan
most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green.
filled fiberglass is blue.
teflon is white.

as boards evolved more and more demands were made of them. first boards were
used mainly in audio circuitry. could n't be used in high voltage or rf because
it would arc and burn. most boards today are fiberglass , the type being chosen
by its use and cost.

boards in satellite and microwave communication are teflon (and ceramic) as the
fiberglass , and other boards are conductive (they actually work more as a
capacitive dialectric , but the word conductive simplifies explaination) at the
high frequencies.

another printed circuit material used mainly in automotive and interconnections
is a thin flexible (mostly mylar) material and is used to connect the front of
the vehicle (etc) to the back instead of wiring harnesses. camcorders use this
to intereconnect the boards inside where wires would be a nuisance.

am working on a generator made by hewlet packard right now and the entire board
is gold plated , boy it looks expensive ! ! !

hope i got most of my facts right as i am working from memory of material read.

with respect to acceleration. you do n't say what the range of acceleration
you want to measure is , and there are other ways in which to measure it
other than using an accelerometer. additional information would be helpful
to anyone who may respond.

i'm trying to bring in 8 bits to a pc , and would like

bits \? lpt seems to have only a few inputs , but i 've heard
rumours that some lpts have bidirectional lines. anybody
know fer sure \? if any bi d lpts , which boards have them
(i 'll be running a new 386dx 33) \?


yes , it is possible. i'm making a 7 stepper controller board ,
with 7 digital inputs , and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the port.
one main thing that will tell you whether the port is
bi directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it. look for a chip
numbered 74ls245. if you do n't have this , then it 's probably a 74ls244 ,
which will do you no good for reading in.

now , if you do have the '245 then do the following
first , find the address of the port , (decimal) either 888 , or 632.
in pascal , you would write(port xxx ) where xxx is the address in
either hex or decimal. the status lines , pins 14 , 16 , 17 , as well as the
strobe , pin 1 , are bi directional lines , and are read by base address 2 ,
so for 888 , to read from status , then read from 890. you can also output
to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines. in pascal ,
do port xxx value
.

hope this helps.
let me know if you need more help.

backupable , if restored to the same machine (depends on the

this is not a good idea.. i upgraded my motherboard last fall. i would
have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to
reinstall simply because i changed motherboards.

opinion is understandable. ) i assume you have a tape drive \? not all
of us have about 200 floppies around for backup , you know.

any info in the bios is too volatile to use as a checksum. are you
going to require that a user re install all their software if they add
4mb of ram to their computer \? i did that a couple of weeks ago. it 's in
the bios , and if software had told me this is n't the machine you
installed me on i would never have used that software again. really bad
idea.

ram is something you add all the time , so no. it 's more like bios
manufacturer and or processor type (386 486 etc). data cannot be used ,
esp with these new flash rom bios machines with updates on a diskette.

on the other hand , to make this less intrusive it could be disguised as
please insert original disk xx as i need file yyyyyy for update . )
it would be perfectly reasonable... sort of.

i did not say that the originals would allow only one install. the
user 's conscience should do that.

this is silly. it 's much easier to loan disks to a friend and let
them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk , and then
give them that. your scheme is n't going to stop anyone.

of course it is easier. are you saying then the originals should allow
only one install \? what is your point \?

you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable
the quiz \? two ! yes , two ! (and do n't ask me which ones they are.)

do you know any assembly language at all \? all anyone needs to do if
find the part of the code that does the quiz , and insert a jmp
instruction to just completely skip it. not that difficult , really ! and
there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing.
using pklite or some similar utility would help , but only if the
resulting compressed .exe were tagged as uncompressable.

i know x86 and 680x0 assembly quite well , thank you. i know exactly which
two bytes need to be changed , i have the code to do them too. i just said
do n't ask me which ones. i did n't say i do n't know what that means.

such hacking can be easily discouraged by adding anti patching code which
does a self check upon execution and refuse to load if crc does not match
value stored (encrypted , of course) in the program. it could be claimed
as a part of anti virus code , and it would not be far from the truth.

what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus
a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup
registered to xxxxx address , city , state zip and disables the
above.

this is by far the best idea you presented in your post. making it
plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates. but , the
determined ones are just going to answer joe blow to the question of
what 's your name so this wo n't stop them in the long run.

did anyone read what i wrote \? that is not what i wrote ! (or meant ! )

what i said was the program should have certain restriction (such as the
restrict to one machine) until the program is registered with the
manufacturer. the manufacturer will then supply the
then proven legitimate user with a patch that will disable the restriction
and proudly proclaim the legal copy with the registered to xxx screen.

pirates are always going to win this fight. they simply have more
time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme.

of course they will , but that was not my point. the purpose of copy
protection is to discourage casual pirates ( oh , can i have a copy of
that \? sure , here. ) and the less sophisticated pirates ( let 's look for
all those calls to int13h... ) . any one determined enough to break copy
protection can and will succeed. they can always backtrace the entire
load sequence of the program. the point of copy protection is to make
such attempts take as long as possible while not intruding upon the uses
(or to minimize such intrusion) of legitimate use. pirates who see copy
protection as a challenge love breaking them , and no amount of copy
protection will stop them , but the rest of us will be stopped. how many
of these hardcore pirates are there compared to rest of us \? not that many.

the problem with this scheme , is that when i buy a game , i want to play it
that day...mailing a card to and from california would probably take a week
or more.

i did n't say the program is disabled , did i \? (i hate ! ! ! ! it when people
take my words out of context...) i mean that once you have installed it ,
you cannot deinstall it without registering it , or transfer it to another
machine , or some sort of limitation (the author will decide) , which will
be removed when the program is registered.


what \? \? ! ! ! !

you ca n't remove it , unless you register \?
you gotta be joking , right \?
what happens if i get a demo version of that program , install it , and then
decide that i do n't like it. do i have to register to be able to get rid
of it \? (hell , no , that is the last thing i would think of ! )
if that is what you mean , then you would better make pretty sure , that a
statement to that effect is printed loud and clear on the package !


a better way to implement the above mentioned scheme is (imho) to allow
anyone to install the program , but if they register , they get some
additional features enabled. it could mean only one new .exe file needed
to be copied , to have got the full version of the program.
of course anyone is free to delete or remove that program at whatever
time they like.

still , we face the trouble of 'moving' the new .exe file around. that
could be solved by having the user registering him self , and get back a
specially marked for him (or her) a new .exe file.


as for some sort of limitations , here are some suggestions
limit the size of data that the program can work with ,
disable saving the data ,
print it out with some defects in the output (but be sure to mark them as
such)
let some pop up screen appear for ca. 10 secs. when the program is started
and or exited

etc....
but don't have it that you must register to be able to remove it.

when trying to choose a resistor with a tolerance better than 1 , you
need a trimmer or to screen devices , it ca n't be made from adding 2
resitors of 1 value in parallel , since the smaller device will have the
error of 1 to cope with.
you have 3 choices
a) live with the error of 1 tolerance devices for low q circuits or low
sensitivity designs
b) buy resistors with better than 1 tolerance (vishay dale)
c) use trimmers or sot 's (select on test)

two things to watch for
in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing , so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
in sweden , the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed down by one position this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
otherwise , it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the german or swedish phone system.

all the physics aside , from a practicle standpoint the author 's said
they built a prototype with nothing more than a small sony lavelier
mike laid up against a large aluminum disk. in demonstrating it at
a presentation to audio engineers , this was impressive enough that
the people present were bugging them about where they could buy them.

yup , it 's not all that difficult to do.

but for a buck or two more i got the ones spec 'd to go out to 20khz
with a bit flatter response.

the panasonic cartridges are n't bad , but they are n't spectacular.

the distance of the mike opening from the flat plate is kind of
critical. i'm debating whether to mount it on it 's side , which
puts the opening a shade under 2mm from the plate , or mounting
it with the opening actually pointing down into the plate at a
small clearance. i have n't dissected a unit like you can buy at
radio shack to see how they do it. thoughts \?

do n't mount it on the side. call up crown , the company that has the
patent on the pzm , and ask them for information on construction and
use of the things. you may have to determine the correct spacing
emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the
design of the panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of
the electret element to increase the high frequency response , and you
are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance.

crown has a nice book on the subject , though it 's unfortunately rather
short on mathematics. there 's a jaes article from many years back , too.

still , for your application , you 'll be a lot better off buying the cheap

for putting solder mask on circuit board used for box covers ).

i wonder if any manufacturer actually puts a solder mask on their
low noise microwave preamps \? often , microwave circuits have odd
bits of wire foil metal attached to wherever whatever is necessary
to make the unit work properly (this is a commercial product \? ). a
solder mask would certainly make doing this tougher , never mind
the finding something that minimally degrades the circuits. (q dope
for coils does not improve the q it just holds things together with

mask that is used. older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used
a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them. these days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). the light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them (usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced). the blue (and red

a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the
distributor register the copy when the software was sold. the clerk sticks it

that 's kind of extra work that one cannot expect the store people to do.
imho it would be easier if companies sell their software as cheaply as
possible and to sell the customers detail manuals (for the brain deads)
, quick reference books , how to do books and videos , paid support hot line
(1 900 ). for the registered purchasers , these can be part of their package.
i have seen many books to teach people how to use dos , wp and other software. i
i suspect either users ca n't read the manuals or they do n't have manuals.
either way , there is to be made. btw books are quite a bit more
expensive to reproduce than a 1 disk.

what is the problem with parallel port security keys \? i have n't used anything
that had hardware key copy protection schemes , so i do n't know what the
drawbacks are. i know the companies that make them claim they 're uncrackable ,

with the popularity of multitasking and pseudo multitasking systems
(eg. os0.5 , windoze , mack system 7) , it is pretty easy to run a debugger
and figure out the protection schemes by disassembling tracing trapping
the application during run time. schemes like compressed software
special loaders would be easy pray even to beginner hackers.

hardware keys (unless well designed and totally transparent) is a
pain in the b t. we having using a piece of software under windoze
that uses a hardware key. the key interfers with the printer stuff
with other programs and often has to be unplugged for those software
to work properly.

but i 've seen cracks of autodesk 3d studio floating around (i do n't have one
so do n't ask) and i had heard that it had parralel port keys.

all the hacker has to do is to remove modify code that communicate with
the port.

for those who are interested , the fcc does indeed care about cable
leakage , particularly into the aviation nav band , or leakage that
is causing interference to other services .

part 76.611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage , and
measurement technique. if you will clearly document your problem ,
and measurement technique (a signal level meter with dipole is the
normal approach , remember to correct between measurement data and
microvolts per meter) and fax or mail the details to mr. john wong
cable branch , fcc 1919 m st. nw wash dc , and a copy of your letter
to the local cable company , you will get results. in fact the cable
company will probably start treating you much better when they realize
you have figured out how to get the fccs attention.

what is important is to document your case as it relates to the
applicable rules. however the cable company is required to
at least check out every complaint of leakage. they must file
with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement
report that details the results of leakage testing.

but remember , call the cable company first , and give them a
chance to work to correct the problem before contacting
the commission.

i am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via
the airborne method.

subject re laser vs bubblejet \?
organization northeastern ohio universities college of medicine

there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers
available from hewlett packard. older original deskjet and
possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with
rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right
side (viewed from front) of the printer. newer printers have a
gray or white plastic slide. the black plastic slide can allow
your cartridge to dry out. there was and may still be information
packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation. hp placed a
coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new
capping mechanism. i did this on my printer and did indeed find
that the cartidges now last longer.

i do n't have the information handy. i suggest contacting your
nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit.

hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical
components that vary depending on the starting level printer and
the level to which you wish to upgrade. i upgraded my original
desket to a dekjet 500. the kit was fairly expensive. you are
likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new
deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much. upgrading an
original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill , but no
soldering. upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping
the processor card and changing a few minor parts. contact your hp
service center for further information.

the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from
the pcl used by laser printers , especially the newer laser
printers. the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a
raster end command after each scan line. this makes no material
difference for lasers , but causes the deskjet to print the
accumulated raster. as you might guess , the result is hideously
slow printing. the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are
still guilty of this particular behavior. from the way wordperfect
works , this would not be easy to change. windows wordperfect works
efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows'.

the pcl4 dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that
permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one
megabyte of memory. an uncompressed image could be as large as
about 909 kbytes , but the printer needs about 300k of memory for
its internal house keeping. laserjet iv models support banded
printing that allows incrmental download of the image with
compression in limited memory situations. deskjet downloadable
fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts.

a single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds. this
is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet
printer. the presumption , of course , being that the laser printer
has completed its warm up cyle.

until ink chemistry is changed , wicking resulting in image
deterioration is unavoidable. i wo n't use the word impossible , but
matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely.
chosing an appropriate paper type helps , but does not eliminate the
problem.

laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable
components. hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges ,
mitigating the material waste problem to a degree. energy waste
could use more work. warm up times have decreased , allowing
stand by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the
laserjet iv.

kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous
silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system. the image
drum is good for approximately 100k copies. it is a very nice
print engine. i wish hp used the kyocera engine. kyocera also has
a neat modular paper source and stacker system.

the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower
than any of hp 's laser printers. the pick up pressure rollers are
subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out. the
usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper.
the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a
single part from hp service. replacement cost for the transport is
almost 200. the feed rollers are not separately replacable ,
though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician.
i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer.

it depends upon the application which printer is best for you. if
you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the
appearance of output , the deskjet is a very good choice. as noted ,
the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use.

the color of the board shows the composition of it , hence the use of it.

original and older boards were bakelite composition , and were brown.
phenolic (spelling) was a tan
most non filled fiberglass boards used in computers are green.
filled fiberglass is blue.
teflon is white.


rubbish. the reason for the colour of the boards depends on the solder
mask that is used. older boards (bakelite and phenolic) rarely used
a solder mask (these boards are not suited well to automatic stuffing
and soldering techniques) and hence are the colour of the compound
used to make them. these days boards are made of fibreglass for most
general purpose uses and have a solder mask applied to them to prevent
close traces shorting to one another during soldering (and also to prevent
the decomposition of traces under harsh environments). the light and dark
green boards ofter seen have a dry film mask applied to them (usually
applied as a complete film photographically produced). the blue (and red
or orange) boards are a two part epoxy or a liquid imageable resist
formulation and are applied in a different manner. there 's a lot of info

sorry geoff ,

agree solder mask is green , but in the old days we did n't have wave soldering
machines (which are another topic again). i had a crew of a dozen ladies which
could stuff and hand solder a board like lightning !

board under the mask was the original query.

btw cheap inport electronic devices (mainly from 3rd world countries) are done
with brown pheonolic boards. is seems the electronics industry has discovered
the cheap labor pools. workers are paid by the board to assemble circuits at
home. they are very obviously hand soldered. quite a few tape recorders are
being brought into canada from red china. in china there is no warranty for
the equipment other than if you plug it in and it works it 's yours. one of my
co workers spent a year there and he said the failure rate out of the box was
almost 50 .

also , the original method for making printed with conductive ink on a regular
printing press. an old lithographer friend had a press for this. after the
etching method was developed he used the press to print wood grain on doors.

for the most part , silver solder is not used for general soldering
tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth. silver solder , when
exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field , will actually
grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically
short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field. for this
reason , silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies.
fortunatly , tin lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites
as fast as silver solder. therefore , it is used extensively.

why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally

i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the
motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year , to preserve them and i just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work , but
they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend

what happens is that (i heard this discussed on northern exposure ) there
is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the
molecules in the concrete. this acts as an attractant to ufos (actually
their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery concrete
combination.

then they proceed to suck all the energy out of the batteries !

remedy set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.

hams can legally run up to 1500 watts. it is very unlikely , however ,

not possible either. you 'd need about a 300 amp alternator for
just the amplifier. i can just see it. you need to slow
down on a downgrade , so you hit the push to talk button.

now , that indeed is possible. a good friend of mine is running about 1 kw
pep from his car. yes , he does have a second alternator. yes , he calls
the rig an electronic brake since the engine noticeably slows when the
key is down.

it has been a while since i knew the electronics of ham radio , but i seem
to remember that pep is actually 4x the real power. which makes 1kw pep
actually around 250w. or was it 2x \? i disremember.

effective transmitted power is also odd , in that it takes into account
antenna height and geometry. which is why a tv station with a 50kw klystron
might advertise a megawatt (if their antenna is on the top of the
cn tower ).

this is like sears hp )

though , 1500 real watts still is n't impossible. about 125 150a with

being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now ,
i was wondering what the best way to scale an ac voltage using an 8 bit
digital word is. i am thinking of using the common method of sending the
word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage (converted
to a sawtooth wave) to get a duty cycle. however , i am leary of this
method because it a) requires a lot of parts , and , more importantly , b)
creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line. i
realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference ,
but that would require more parts and boost the price further.
someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input 8
bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all on chip.
unfortunately , he could n't remember the chip number or the manufacturer
if anyone else has heard of this chip , please e mail me.
i am building this project as a dimmer box for a light
controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains
very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user
wishes to control (well , each channel , at least). therefor , if each box
costs 150 , i doubt that an end user will want to dish out ( 150 x 16
2400) for sixteen channels... this is something i have noticed about
today 's dimmer boxes they are so expensive !
anyway , any help which someone could offer on either a method of
easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me (always
the preferred method... ) will be greatly appreciated !

to put it bluntly , they are full of it.

paying a tape is playing a tape. there is no difference whether the
output goes to a second vcr or to a tv. (how the vcr or tv reacts to
this signal is a different story see messages pertaining to macrovision
copy protection.)

in order for the tape to self destruct , it would have to have circuitry
of its own within the tape case. the circuit would have to somehow
magically determine what the output of the vcr is connected to. the
circuit would then have to have an erasing head to actually do anything.

it is a pretty lame scare tactic. (i 've seen something similar on a bbs.
when the sysop wanted to , he could have a message sent to the user 's end
saying that it is sending the code to format your hd.)

... question why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the

because the temperature of your hand , unlike that of the battery , is
determined by the balance between internal heat production and external
heat loss. you 're feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object
(your hand) which is kept much warmer than its surroundings. in the case
of an object with no significant internal heat production , this will
affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings (if
it started out not in equilibrium with them) but wo n't affect the final
temperature.

for the same reason , windchill affects whether you will freeze but not

the concrete simply sucks all the electrons out of the battery and drains

another explanation , implausible as it is , is that the lead acid battery

hmmm...
a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the
distributor register the copy when the software was sold. the clerk sticks it
in the store pc and asks for the buyers id. later , if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser. in addition copies which were
sent to distributors stores would have a vendor reg or serial in order to
track in store piracy.

possible additional program security schemes would be
1. having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in
and registration. (inconvenient)
2. taking dire legal action on anyone caught (expensive)
3. encryption , crc check , self modifying code (limited effectiveness)
4. have an independent watchdog program in the installation setup config or
memory manager , etc. which would check the main program 's crc.
(only as effective as above methods at best.)
5. have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked
copies of the program and or the offenders hard drive. (risky , and probably
illegal , certainly immoral)

if i threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective.

tis' only a gleam in my eye at this point. i have yet to chose a tracking

in one of eight zones across the stage. i did some experiments with
pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite
zone transition. and dancers stand still alot , so their ir signature goes
away. the good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional
to the size of the warm body (or body part) , and the velocity of said body.
this could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture.

dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their
bodies , but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked.

the current toy i have been working with is a program called mandala for the
amiga , used with a live ! video digitizer. this works with a video camera
trained on the stage. you can set thresholds for a zone within the field of
view , and an object brighter than the threshold will trigger an event. events
can be midi objects or sequences , amiga sounds or graphic objects. it 's been
fun to play with , but the documentaion is arcane , and the digitizer is noisy.
still , it 's very appealing , the dancers do n't have to wear any appliances ,
you can have ots of zone , s , it speaks midi , which can be used to control lights ,

possible advantages would be
free distribution
fast acceptance
online discussion between authors and readers

this would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the
articles and one perhaps without for discussion.


i think its a great , but idealistic idea. a reseacher will first of all try
to publish a worthy paper in a credible , professional magazine and not in a
community like usenet which is infamous for lots (not all) of junk
information. the papers that will be published here will , in general , be
of low quality. also , it is improbable that any credit will be given to a
researcher who publish here and sadly , that is nowadays a main reason for
publishing.

usenet is great for informal discussions and free exchange of ideas keep
it like that. a new , specialist group is just not worth it.

i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to
deliver 6 joules at 250 volts... the ubiquitous
camera flash circuit is what i want , but i cant get mine apart without
breaking it...

charlie brett 's suggestion buy one of the disposable flash cameras , use
the film , then take the thing apart is a good one. note , though , that
you wo n't get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing , and it
may be a single point design that wo n't adapt well to off nominal operation.

the things are easy to dismantle. the key piece of information is that
when you advance the film on one of them , you are winding it into the
film cassette it is unwound from the cassette in the factory , when
the camera is made. so no darkroom is needed for dismantling. it 's
standard film , so just take the cassette in for processing.

all the camera store people do when you bring in one of the disposables
is rip it apart , toss the film cassette into the to be processed bin ,
and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in
another. if you take it apart yourself , you get an aa alkaline battery
(still with a fair bit of life in it) and all kinds of little bits and
pieces from the camera.

i expect you could even re load and re use the camera if you were really
determined.

lots of stuff deleted

the lead acid secondary cell discharge reaction is exothermic. i am glad
you do not dispute this point. if you do n't want the lead storage battery
to discharge , it should be stored such that its charged state is the
equilibrium state. during winter , the ground , be it covered with
concrete , dirt , or wood , maintains a cooler temperature on average than
the surrounding air or the battery. the heat capacity of air is less than
that of concrete , dirt , or wood , so it heats faster. conversely , air cools
faster , too.

the normal storage procedure for a battery is to leave it in an unheated
garage or basement. the storage surface is often cooler than the
surrounding air , with the battery temperature somewhere in between. e.g. ,
the basement air temperature may be 70 f , the floor temperature 65 f , and
the battery temperature 66 f.

the air temperature is higher than the battery temperature. the heat of
reaction is not going to move up the gradient. the floor temperature is
lower than the battery temperature , and heat is going to move to it. the
floor is an incredible heat sink.


might depend on where you live .. i know locally , for most of the winter
the ground , and concrete floor , within sheds and garages (unheated) is
signifacantly warmer than the average air temperature. the air does get
warmer during the day , but during the night , the ground and concrete
is definitely warmer , especially when protected by the walls from the
albedo effect. and the nights are longer by several hours than the
days.

sorry about following up my own article , but i wanted to continue
that what might be being missed here is that the important thing
might not be temperature differences per se , but the action of
heat sinking the battery.

perhap someone could conduct an experiment , taking two identical
lead acid batteries , placing both on wooden shelves , but putting
one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink. this
would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect' , and keep both batteries
at the same ambient temperature.

i think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent , but the
one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have
some validity.

to decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of

in the first case , you can use a ube of a transistor as a voltage reference
of about 0.7 vdc with a temp drift of 2mv k. in the second case its better
you use a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum current.
the output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current.

why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead (totally unuseable)

i decided to bring the battery in from the lawn mower and the motorcycle
from the unheated garage this year , to preserve them and i just
went to use them and noticed that not only do they not work , but
they act like the two terminals are shorted. i asked a friend
and he said that you should never do that , 'cause it ruins them ,
but he could n't tell me why.

camter28@astro.ocis.temple.edu

i am not a battery expert , but from recent reading , a lead acid battery
will self discharge at a relatively high rate , and if stored in a discharged
state , will develop a condition i think is called sulfation. in storage ,
either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use (fat chance
i 'd ever do that at home) , or the battery should be stored on a trickle
charge. i have also (i think) read that the condition may be reversable
if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a long period of time.
the refernce i remember is to use c 50 (where c is the amp hours) as the
charging circuit , and leave it hooked up for weeks. some of this may
only apply to gel type cells , but i suspect the same applies to the liquid
type.

technical reason or could it be that the marketing geniuses have
not tought about it (yet) \?

the green layer is a solder mask , and is used to make a finished board
look neat , and to avoid solder bridges , especially when using wave
soldering (or any other mechanized approach). i 've seen red mask ,
but most that i 've seen are green.

a bakelite board will look brown in colour , and , if the solder mask
is put on , looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side
(or just one side) of the board.
a fibreglass board will look green from the side , because the green
solder mask makes the board appear that colour. if you got a fibreglass
board with no mask , it would be a whitish grey colour.
teflon boards do exist , as well... but i'm not sure about that one.

i 'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green , so they 're
not about to change. also , any change in any chemical probably requires
a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards. a lot
of companies do not make their own boards... they ship them to a real
boardhouse.

seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. this would be for short distances (2000 ft) ,
and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so.

you might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems. they
work best for close work( 1 mile and under).

rf is used for much longer distances in two major modes. transponder and
phase measurment. transponder requires you send a pulse to another station
and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the
receiver time.

phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the
same frequency signal multiplexed in time. a receiver can pick them up and
measure the phase shift between signals. maps can be drawn that plot the
lines of position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two
stations.

it had a flip flop , a resistor and a cap , and a comparator op amp i

hi folks ,

i borrowed a vhs tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying
that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the
original. i found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different
processes. however , i 've never seen this tape being sold anywhere so i do n't
want to take the chance even it 's small.

anyone has experience in this kind of self destructing video tapes \?

thanks in advance.

where scientific articles can be published (or perhaps just summaries).
possible advantages would be
free disribution
fast acceptance
online discussion between authers and readers

this would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the
articles and one perhaps without for discussion.

the best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which
would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready. perhaps
postscript or rich text format \?

in article hcbc5un9l.dd0@netcom.com hcb@netcom.com (h. c. bowman) writes

i just bought a new portable cd player for the office , and i notice that
it proudly proclaims 8 times oversampling on the box. now while i think
i understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor) ,
i do n't understand this 8 times business... it seems to me that when
i bought my first cd player (was it really 10 years ago \? ! ) , the specs
said 4 times ... could someone please tell me whether i'm getting
senile \? if i'm not , then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate \?

the data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such , of course) ,
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 khz , 16 bit , two channel data.
oversampling takes two discrete data points , and interpolates n 1 points
between them for n times oversampling. when i asked , people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation , but significantly more
complicated.

you are quite correct in your understanding. the filtering is not
interpolation , as that would distort the frequency content of the signal

they do interpolate it 's not linear interpolation though. you are correct
that the frequency content is not altered (more specifically , the baseband
spectrum is preserved , and so is every nth image spectrum. the other
(n 1) in n image spectra are removed , where n is the oversampling rate)

you are listening to. generally , these players run the samples thru an
all pass filter network. i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person 's

ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0hz to 22050hz , and a gain of 0
from 22050 to the new nyquist frequency. in practice a finite transition
band is required , and there is also a certain amount of pass band ripple
and stop band leakage. with a high order (eg 200 taps) digital filter ,
a very good approximation can be easily achieved.

bit deleted about observations of interpolation filter at work

in case you care , the filtering method uses an fir (finite impulse response)
filter. i 'd guess that cd makers use the same kind of method. anybody out
there know the real answer \? i 'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering. this strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs.

no , they actually use a digital fir just like yours , but built in hardware ,
on custom vlsi chips for (mainly) economic reasons.

anyway , then , the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective
sampling rate up to n times 44.1 khz , in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters. for the same quality filter , higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters , whereas for the same price filter , higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters. so , assuming the quality of
all other components in a cd player remained the same , oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti alias
filtering.

actually , i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic. i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not. you can use sloppier components and
give the filter a roll off that is n't so sharp. it 's too bad that they
charge more for something that (i think) is actually less costly to build.

i guess that the answer is somewhere between the two.

as an interesting ( \? ) aside , some of you out there may be aware of a scheme
used by pioneer and wadia , which is called (by pioneer , at least) legato
link. i have n't heard one of these players , but by reading advertising
blurb , and a couple of pseudo technical articles i deduced that all they
do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter , and let a load of the
first image (ie aliassed) spectrum through. talking to bob stuart (of
boothroyd stuart , aka meridian) confirmed my suspicion. he said that it
sounded awful , but then he would , would n't he...

i'm wondering if i can tote my american touch tone phone around with me

for that in europe. the question is if the general electronics work
the same. i can buy a different wall plug and refit it (i'm sure i 'd
have to) , but would that do the trick \?

two things to watch for
in germany (and i think the same holds for sweden) only some
of the connections can handle tone dialing , so make sure the
phone can be set to pulse dialing.
in sweden , the '0' is the first digit and all other digits
are pushed down by one position this makes dialing (and
in the process converting numbers) an interesting task.
otherwise , it is technically no problem to connect a foreign
phone to either the german or swedish phone system.
otoh neither you nor i would ever try that , as it is of course
illegal.

as the phone uses dtmf dialing , which by some magic all telecom
operators seems to have agreed on , this is a complete non issue.

i do n't think there are any switches in sweden that ca n't handle dtmf
dialing. most switches are now digital and thoses that are n't have
been retrofitted with magic fingers that converts from dtmf to pulse
dialing.

summary effect of heat on sound quality
lines 43

much deleted about assembly in usa vs. other ,
i wish to focus on the subject of warm running amplifiers

sure the amp runs very fairly
hot but that 's how you get an amp to sound incredibly good.

an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it 's gonna sound.
the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day.

because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted
to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs ! hmmmmm....


there is a correclation between warm running amps and good sound ,
or in your words , it does have a bearing on.... .

now , i do n't suggest that everyone run out and create combination
stove amplifiers that will degrade lifespan ,
but a cold running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature
variation with varrying current than is a warm running one. and since
junction resistance is a function of temperature , this has a detrimental
effect on linearity.

a few facts
bias points vary with temperature
junction resist varrie with temp
adcom products do not run class a

if you still do n't beleive this assertion , consider the warm up requirements
for most good test equipment , or better yet , just listen to an amplifier
warm up. on many designs its quite audible , on mine , about 20 minutes for
the output stage , many hours for the drivers. fortunately the drivers
are not switched.

in any experiment , or when drawing conclusions from listening ,
betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias
(idle current) level. both have a positive correlation with low
distortion and good sound quality , and high bias results in
warmer operation , all other factors being equal.

check the station 's master sync generator. you 'll probably find that

another possibility is to find a genlockable sync generator with hd and vd

if neither of these is possible , then you 'll have to build a sync

what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments \?
tony

pink noise is a random signal with more low frequency components
than white noise.

if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency
analyzer , you will find that the spectrum power density is flat , which
means that every frequency is present in the noise signal.

often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low pass
filtering a white noise signal. therefore pink noise contains much more
low frequency components.

the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring
animals. an additional low pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will
explain you why.

enjoy it.

off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a
backup copy \? almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk ,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste
of time , space , and money , as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
out the backups.

we 've destroyed about six sets of original microsoft word for mac 5.0 and
word for windows (may have been a bad batch of disks). do n't have the
faintest idea what happened to them , they just went bad. were n't stored
near any magnetic fields or otherwise mistreated , indeed they were only
used once. given this , and the massive headaches finding a working set of
disks to fix some of the machines that periodically go down , i 'd say
having working backups is a godsend. i sure wish we 'd had them (sometimes
i think murphy 's law holds true more often than newton 's ! ! ) when we needed
them. i think it 's sortof like snake antivenin. 99.995 of the time you
have absolutely no use for it , but when you need it , boy do you ever need
it !


ditto 's ... in fact .. at work , where things are dead if the backup
is no good , i insist on having at least a 2 level backup system.
it seems that whenever you have 2 good backups , you never need them ,
but if you do n't have them , murphy guarantees that you 'll suffer for it.

i do n't have backups of my originals at home but then my machine does n't
see anywhere near the use abuse of these here at the lab , and so i
consider it less of a risk. still , i usually make working copies of
them when i install them and then eventually re use these working copies
for something else. . ..

in article hcbc5un9l.dd0@netcom.com hcb@netcom.com (h. c. bowman) writes

i just bought a new portable cd player for the office , and i notice that
it proudly proclaims 8 times oversampling on the box. now while i think
i understand what oversampling is (the rate of discrete samples
exceeds the highest frequency component of interest by some factor) ,
i do n't understand this 8 times business... it seems to me that when
i bought my first cd player (was it really 10 years ago \? ! ) , the specs
said 4 times ... could someone please tell me whether i'm getting
senile \? if i'm not , then what good does it do for the player to take
samples at a higher rate \?

the data is only ever read once (barring mistracks and such , of course) ,
and eventually gets turned into 44.1 khz , 16 bit , two channel data.
oversampling takes two discrete data points , and interpolates n 1 points
between them for n times oversampling. when i asked , people said that the
interpolation was not simply linear interpolation , but significantly more
complicated.

you are quite correct in your understanding. the filtering is not
interpolation , as that would distort the frequency content of the signal
you are listening to. generally , these players run the samples thru an
all pass filter network. i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person 's
heart , and the effect is rather spooky. it actually reconstructs peaks
that were n't there (correctly , too ! ) and fills in the gaps with the
properly computed values , just as if there had been a real sample taken at
that point. i use a cpu to do all the math. it takes a decent (but not
unreasonable) amount of cpu time to do this. you can keep up with things
in realtime if you write efficient code.

in case you care , the filtering method uses an fir (finite impulse response)
filter. i 'd guess that cd makers use the same kind of method. anybody out
there know the real answer \? i 'd say that they use a tapped delay line with
resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering. this strikes me as
the most cost effective method for volume production runs.


anyway , then , the purpose of oversampling is to move the effective
sampling rate up to n times 44.1 khz , in order to use higher frequency
antialiasing filters. for the same quality filter , higher oversampling
lets you build cheaper filters , whereas for the same price filter , higher
oversamplings lets you build better filters. so , assuming the quality of
all other components in a cd player remained the same , oversampling should
allow a manufacturer to produce slightly better sound due to anti alias
filtering.

actually , i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that
they have a marketting gimic. i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to
filter an oversampled signal than not. you can use sloppier components and
give the filter a roll off that is n't so sharp. it 's too bad that they
charge more for something that (i think) is actually less costly to build.

i seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better. they are
built to a price spec , and that spec says cheap as possible ! .

judging by your .sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge.
information of how to build an eeprom cartidge for the vectrex is available
via anonymous ftp at 'csus.edu'.

since you 've chosen the 27c512 you are probably trying to make a 'multicart'.
to do this simply
1. load the game images into the eeprom at 2000 , 4000 , etc. (your eeprom
burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into
one file yourself with suitable gaps.)
2. wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game
console , and the high bits going to switches to choose between games.

to directly answer your question above , the pin that 'kicks up the address'
is simply another address line.

for a concrete example , with the 27c512 and 8k games images , you would
wire a0 a12 to the cartridge , and a13 a15 to 3 switches. the 3 switches
would allow you to pick from the 8 games on the eeprom.

i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video (vs.

65 mhz , which would mean detecting a 15 ns pulse. it should also be
able to tell the difference between a blank screen (about 300 mv)
and a dim screen (say , around 310 mv). oh yes , it also needs to be
cheap.

my first circuit was a dismal failure. i used 3 compariators each
compariator had the input going to one of the guns , the input
went to a reference created by a voltage divider(a potentiometer).

the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow.. i
needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the
compariators , so i could have a whole screen full of text , but my

the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then
the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen. in
fact the difference between completely black and completely white is
only 650 mv. i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the
video signals to make this work.

there are faster compariators , but they are expensive , and require
split supplies. i would need to replace my .49 quad compariator
with three 1.89 compariators , and create a whole new power supply
circuit.

at this point , i think what i need is some sort of transistor
circuit. transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick...

unfortunately , i am way out of my league when it comes to designing
transistor circuits , so i am appealing to the net for help. any
ideas , tips , circuits , pointers , references , etc. would be greatly
appreciated.

oh yes , i only sample the output of this thing every second or so , so
i do n't need a fast response time at all , however , i have n't found a
way to take advantage of that fact.

in order to get the 15 ns response time you need , you are better off

with a dos manual can copy a disk , or copy anything (hidden files dont
go far if you are dealing with anyone who is not comletely dos ignorant) off
of a hard disk. 'professional' crackers aren t interested in copying disks.
they are programmers who get some thrill out of going through unassembly
listings of programs to disable copy protection such as serial number
dialog boxes , volume label checks , and who knows what when it comes to
computer games.

those people are in the minority , however. in my experience with the world of
people and software , it seems that a good majority of people (say 80 ) will
at some point copy a friend 's program ( gee , you really oughta try this ) or
accept a copy. these are people who normally would buy a software package
or do without , but decided that just once it would n't matter.

if you 're talking a 20 max goal of pirated copies , i bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy , and ca n't be easily copied from a hard drive , will
suffice.
i hate hard copy manuals , and would rather have all docs online not
because i want to copy the program , but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book i ca n't find.

off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a

so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste

drawbacks are. i know the companies that make them claim they 're uncrackable ,
but i 've seen cracks of autodesk 3d studio floating around (i do n't have one
so do n't ask) and i had heard that it had parralel port keys.

if you put another computer on the port instead of the key , you can hack
them by reading what happens. so i 've been told , i 've never seen this done
but i think it 's possible. you 'd need some hardware knowledge and some
software to read the port !

the atari 2600 used a 6502 cpu , just like their entire 8 bit line
(400 , 800 , 1200 , 1400 , 1440 , 130xe , 65xe computers , as well as the 5200
game machine).

wrong , it has a 6507.

for those who would like to know , the 6507 was a 6502 without irq or nmi ,
and with only 13 address lines (giving 8k memory space).

it had one custome chip (not an asic in the sense that word is now understood)
the tia (sometimes known as the 6526 , although most other manufacturers list
that as the cia complex interface adapter.) tia stands for television
interface adapter , and it handles sound , paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

did n't know about it being called the 6526 thats the cia found in the
commodore 64 (i do n't believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around).
the tia was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0 , and shadowed in the
bottom 128 bytes of page 1. to get an image on the screen , you had to wait
until the raster line your picture started at , load bitmaps for this line
into the 'sprite' registers , tell them what x positions to take , how many
duplicates you wanted , etc , then do it all again for the next line. this
took all of the processor 's time during the visible portion of the
display.

there was also a standard 6532 ram , i o , timer (riot) , plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer. that 's all.

the ram was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0 , and shadowed in page
1. the 6502 has a zero page addressing mode on most instructions that is
both shorter and faster than the normal ones , so it is important on a
machine like this to have the scratchpad ram in page 0. unfortunately , it
also wants its stack to be in page 1 (the stack pointer is 8 bits , and the
high byte of the address is hardwired to 1).

the iot section was mapped into page 2 somewhere. 2 8 bit i o registers
(ca n't remember if each bit could be independantly set to i or o like the
6522 and 6526) , and 1( \? ) 8( \? ) bit timer with a programmable prescaler (i
think this was some power of 2). there were no interrupts in the system , so
many games would set up the timer at some known time , go away and do
something else for a while , then sit and wait for the timer to run down.

there was no logic in the box to do address decoding the riot had at
least 2 chip select pins (probably one active high , one active low) , and i
imagine the tia was much the same. various address lines were fed directly
to chip selects. the 6507 likes to have rom right at the top of memory , so
the 2600 had to use roms with active high chip selects not exactly
normal , so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more
usual active low chip select.

cooler.

please explain how cement is able to maintain a lower average temperature

it 's not the temperature , it 's the karma. you see , dirt has good karma ,
since it 's all organic and full of living things , but cement is all squared
off and artificial looking , and has lost its karma in the process. being
a karma sink , it sucks all of the good karma out of the battery which is no

a board between the battery and the cement will fix the problems.

the buddha nature is in the acid , but it is also in the lead plate. the

in sci.electronics , rgc3679@bcstec.ca.boeing.com (robert g. carpenter) writes

i'm wondering if it 's possible to use radio waves to measure the
distance between a transmitter(s) and receiver \?

yes. it 's called radar.
well , actually not quite. both radar and radio altimeters measure distances
by measuring the time required to transmit a signal , then receive its
reflection from a target. radar generally uses pulses , while radio altimeters
use either pulses or a modulated continuous wave transmission. in the case of
the latter , highly accurate distance measurement can be made. as an example ,
the original bendix ala 52 radio altimeter was accurate to 1 8 foot at 2500
feet altitude.

note , however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster
originally asked about. the problem with gaining accurate measurements between
a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate
time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter
triggers. this cannot be wire connected , since radio waves will actually
travel faster in free space (air , in this case) than wire (the difference
is called the velocity factor of the cable). so you need to resort to a
common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance , etc. something
like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick , triggering both
the transmitter and receiver simultaneously. sound expensive \? not too bad ,
but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort.

why not go to a different method \? surveyors use a laser light system where again
the reflection time is measured. why not try this \? (sounds like something a p.e.
should know about anyway ).

seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength
and determine distance. this would be for short distances (2000 ft) ,
and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches , or so.

this is actually highly inaccurate , since the power output of a transmitter
varies from unit to unit , there are variances in the antenna and transmission
line , and the receiver may also vary , both from unit to unit , and the same unit
over time. you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system. with
the radio altimeter this is also done , but since everything is located at
one place , it is much easier to do. note especially that the time base for
the r.a. receiver and transmitter is one unit also...

depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes , in
a dynamic environment (with objects moving about) the multipath kills this
concept.

nope. fm capture effect says that the strongest signal wins. that is , unless
the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength.
this is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes.
signals bouncing off runways tend to be very strong...

what frequencies would be best for this \? or does matter \?

as high as possible to eliminate outside influence , and also to enhance
attenuation of multipath signals. radio altimeters typically use frequencies
around 4 ghz.

hope this helps...

i am trying to build a synchronous demodulator and i 've hit a snag.
in my application i want to be able to change the gain of an

the most obvious way i 've come up with is to use analog switches
to adjust the gain of the op amp. the only analog switch i have
experience with it the 4066. unfortunately i want to switch an
ac signal which goes from about 5v to 5v , and the 4066 is only
for positive signals.


i have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal. i simply
ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply , 8v in this case. as long as your
analog input signal stays between the supply rails , the 4066 will work fine.
of course , your control (logic) input must use 8v as the logic low and
8v as the logic high reference , so that either (1) all your driving logic
must be 4000 cmos with the same bipolar supply or (2) you must provide
some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the
control logic. in my case , i was able to use the bipolar supply all the
way.

symptoms may help someone diagnose the error

i know that whatever lithium memory backup it had has long died
thus if i unplug it it wo n't remember the presets

it has given up listening to the remote. (i tried changing the remote 's
batteries) when i try a remote function the receiver registers that it
received it (a green remote light flashes) but the right function
does n't happen if any function at all. (also strange when i hit
the mute button , for example , the display panel goes black yikes
i 've never seen that before ...)

before all the strangeness started , the system turned itself off and on
again by itself

sometimes it wo n't play a radio station , so i have to kinda twist it
(yes kinda flex the motherboard , chasis) for it to get the radio
tuning back the aux in function always works however....

it is inconvenient , but not inconvenient enough to pay an
expensive repair fee. while , i'm not a hardware guy , i wonder
if something as simple as a surge supressor will be a quick fix.
the strange thing is that these symptoms come and go ...

now , if you do have the '245 then do the following
first , find the address of the port , (decimal) either 888 , or 632.
in pascal , you would write(port xxx ) where xxx is the address in
either hex or decimal. the status lines , pins 14 , 16 , 17 , as well as the

so for 888 , to read from status , then read from 890. you can also output

material is used in the cryogenics industrya and marine industries as a
structural material and is called g 10. fr 4 and g 10 are both green. they
are not green because of a solder masking agent. the basic ingredients are
a clear epoxy resin and glass fibers. i am not sure what the specs are on
the resin , but if you are really curious you can call nema (national
electronics manufacturing association) or ciba geigy (a major manufacturer
of epoxy resins) to find out. as an aside , i occasionally mix clear epoxy
and glass microsphres to cast small structures for cryogenics experiments.
the proportions of glass to epoxy are about the same as in g 10. they are
the same green color.

i am looking for a text reference that will include pinouts ,

does such a text exist \? are there docs on the internet that
reference ic 's \? it would be a great idea if each major
ic manufacturer made available to the public an anonymous
ftp site with all it 's data books in the form of text files.
(ala rfc style). this would save time and money for the
ic manufacturer since a text file costs nothing to send
around the world via internet and since most users of
ic 's
are found in the internet anyway.

are there any books available for purchase that reference
(as many as possible) \? or am i going to be stuck obtaining
a zillion databooks from the manufacturers (those little
phonebook type books that are obsoleted every couple years)

anybody have a 'scoop' on fairly low priced blue led 's \? \? \?

what is pink noise and how is it used in sound experiments \?

pink noise has constant power per geometric frequency increment
(octave , 1 3 octave , etc). thus the 10khz 20khz octave has the same
amount of noise power as the 10hz 20hz octave.
white noise has constant power per arithmetic frequency increment
(hz , khz , etc). thus the 10khz 10.1khz band has the same amount of
noise power as the 10hz 110hz band (both bands are 100hz wide).
pink noise can be made by passing white noise thru a 3db octave
filter (usually approximated by a network of several rc pairs).
note you ca n't get 3db octave by using half a 6db octave network
(
pink noise is commonly used in audio power response measurements.
it shows up on audio spectrum analyzers (with octave related bands)
as a flat line across the bands.

we use a cd rom based system here. there are about 45 cd rom disks and a
4 disk changer hooked to a dedicated ms dos computer. it contains scanned
images of data book pages for several thousand parts. when you ask it for
something it knows about (mostly active ic parts) , it works quite well.
they do n't handle all the varieties of transistors or diodes that exist.
it is definately a start in the right direction , but they need to expand
the data base to handle more types of stuff.

these systems are n't cheap. we paid about 7 , 000 for the liscence and get
monthly updates of some of the cd rom disks. we send the old ones back to
them so that they will keep sending us the updates. i think we pay a
yearly maintainence fee of about 1 , 500 to get the updates.

if you find the part you want , you can look at the data sheet on a
page sized monitor (it 's a special monitor from sigmasystems). you can
also print each page of the datasheet you want on a laserjet printer. page
printing takes a couple of minutes per page. it can take a while to dump
the 5 or 6 pages you usually need.

i have a feeling the maker would n't like it if we made the data available
to all internet users. )

i strongly disagree. i think most pirating is done by amateurs , who wo n't
copy the program if diskcopy ca n't do it.

i hate to disagree , but i will. )
(note i do n't pirate software , nor do i trade it. i simply have met and
talked extensively with those who have. that 's it. the fbi can tap someone
else 's phone )
most pirating is done by people who do n't use the programs they pirate.
a cracked program tends to get passed on , resplendant in the various graphics
and animations that advertise whoever performed the modification(s).

i admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in 'giving'
copies of programs to one 's fellow workers , maybe taking it home for use
on one 's own pc , but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most
spread throughout the business as a whole how many times have you had
someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks \?

it 's mostly a matter of convenience a person sees a program they want to
use and they feel justified in making a copy since someone 's already paid
for it , etc. , etc. (a note this is starting to change a bit. not much
though.)

if you 're talking a 20 max goal of pirated copies , i bet that anything that
will beat diskcopy , and ca n't be easily copied from a hard drive , will
suffice.

what about commercially available copy programs \? copyii \?
how about programs like teledisk , that can do things diskcopy ca n't \?
and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy
would n't know about this
after working with people around computers , one comes to realize that
the 'average' user does n't know much. any computer enthusiast is at least
200x better at pre guessing commands and how to use them (can you sit down
and use something without reading the manual \? ) and it is these people who
are doing the '20 pirating' , not joe windows user who ca n't remember a few
arguments to the dir command.

i hate hard copy manuals , and would rather have all docs online not
because i want to copy the program , but because its usually faster and
and convenient than sifting through an old book i ca n't find.

really \? i find it evens out the online stuff can be read through faster ,
but you 're stuck reading it in linear flow start to finish , unless you
jump ahead with a search or such. a book , though , you can flip through
faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty
index too !

but i partially agree i often wish i could grep something that was written
down.

off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a
backup copy \? almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk ,
so you are left with the originals as your backups. i think its a waste
of time , space , and money , as well as it makes it to tempting to lend
out the backups.

what if they need to re install \? the idea of a backup still holds if
the original disk goes bad , they 're out of luck for about 1 2 weeks , which
is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks
if they 'll do it without a charge.

actually detecting a break is done by watching for a character containing
all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt. this

true enough , but...

means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit
time slot , which basically indicates a break. there is no special way to
detect break that i have found other than this there 's no magic signal
generated by uarts , etc.

zilog scc

rr0 7 break detect

this is a very popular part , but it has a number of quirks , especially
in hdlc mode.

signetics 68562 duscc

rsr 2 break start detect
rsr 3 break end detect

two of the bits in the receiver status register. you can enable an interrupt
on either of these bits going high , too. also , only one null will be put
in the fifo per break detected.

this is simply the best serial chip i 've ever worked with. many less
quirks than the scc , which is imho second best. (death to 8250 devices ! )


and i thought i knew a lot about serial devices. perhaps i should just
keep my big mouth shut. sorry.
