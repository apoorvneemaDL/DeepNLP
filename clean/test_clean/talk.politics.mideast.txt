muslim in ex yugoslavia was a nation not a religion. in fact , not
all muslims in b h are followers of islam. therefore , there do (did \? )

yeah ! that 's it ! ) you 've really outdone yourself this time nick...
do n't forget the davidian muslims ... )

islam is not a race. it 's a religion. you can be white , black ,
fijian or alaskan.

this does not change the fact that muslim is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former yugoslavia , and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely independent and immaterial of
any religious considerations.
not to muslims )


it is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens. the croat , muslim , and serb political leaders all
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.


that could be arguable.. (for bandwith and flames sake , i wont say more)



terms of secession \? you are , of course , joking , right nick \? nobody
chose to fight. bosnia and croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the serbs attacked and started on their
well documented genocide. that makes them an outside aggressor. it 's
a simple genocide , a classical example of ethnic cleansing. there is
no question of civil war...

you only wish it were so.
it is a civil war , but the serbian generals who allow rape are not fighting
fair. yah i know .. war is hell .. those serbian generals are propretuating
both..

more than 2 , 000 , 000 residents of croatia and b h have not accepted the
terms of secession which tudjman and izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them. croats and muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the entire territories of the former
yugoslav republics of croatia and b h.
lines and bordres .. money .. power .. fear ..

oh , btw , yugoslavia was internationally recognized when it was
destroyed by tudjman , izetbegovic , milosevic , and the international
community led by germany. if yugoslavia 's borders could be changed
against its will , then certainly croatia 's borders and b h 's borders
can be changed as well.
let 's change canadian bordres while we are at it )
i see this as civvil war..
(sp borders)

as i have stated many times the civil war in ex yugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession (borders , etc.) for croatia and b h are
finally agreed upon. serbs , croats , and muslims will all have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.


possibly.. i do agree that it is a civil war , which makes the donation of
humanitarian aid even more complex... i mean serbs are bleeding too and i heardthat a few croats had raped serbian women.. (unconfurmable at this point)

ilyess sez
so how would have you defended saudi arabia and rolled
back the iraqi invasion , were you in charge of saudi arabia \? \? \?

all muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy iraq , not
to liberate kuwait , the people who were killed by the invasion are
more (many many more) , than the ones that were killed by the iraqis
in their smaller invasion. i lived in the west , and i have seen how
your media prepared you (helpless naive americans) for a war against

no doubt you plan on exploiting helpless naive americans for your own
purposes. hmm...let 's see

iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that
led to the invasion , as the cia correctly predicted (and pretended to
be surprised not to know).
it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.

what would i have done most muslims would choose 300 dead kuwaitis over
200 , 000 dead iraqis and 1000 dead kuwaitis. the first case would happen
if no western intervention happened , and the second case was a direct
or indirect result of western envolvement.

possibly , if 200 , 000 iraqis had indeed died , but this number is based on
greenpeace estimates. greenpeace had compromised its alleged
impartiality during the war by condemning the potential environmental
consequences of allied miiltary action , while initially completely
ignoring iraq 's horrible environmental crimes , starting with the dumping
of millions of barrels of oil into the gulf at ahmadi to the blowing of
over 700 oil wells. what is the real number \? there has been a lot of
work on this in the last two years , none of it reported as the
greenpeace figure seems to get continuously bandied about. the real
number seems to be around 10 , 000 , on the same order as the number of
kuwaitis killed , tortured and kidnapped during the occupation. i 've
included an article i recently posted below , but this is really old
news. independent television news reported a figure around 15 , 000 only
a few months after the war , but it was hardly reported.

for the allies to have killed 200 , 000 iraqis , they would have had to
kill twice the total number of iraqis in kuwait.

the favored image of the hysterics is the last battle of the war at
mutla'. this was yet another example of the american and european media
playing into the hands of iraq and its de facto allies. the
destruction of the iraqi convoy at mutla' was portrayed as an all out
slaughter. this is simply not true. the head and tail of the convoy
was bombed initially , resulting in a lot of casualties at these points.
before bombers came back , most of the rest of the iraqi soldiers fled
on foot.

furthermore , your estimates of kuwaiti war dead if allies had n't invaded
is completely ridiculous. you have acknowledged (certainly implicitly)
that saddam is a barbarous brute. you have acknowledged the hundreds
of thousands he has been responible for killing in his own country .
you know that the man he appointed as governor of kuwait , ali majid ,
was his most brutal henchman , presiding over the near genocide of the
kurds in the late 80 's and , more recently , the shi'a. yet , when it
comes to his treatment of kuwaitis , he is an angel. in your estimate ,
he would 've killed fewer than he already had when the war started.
what a joke !


apn 03 09 0006 iraq war dead

copyright , 1993. the associated press. all rights reserved.

by nick ludington
associated press writer
washington (ap) after the persian gulf war ended , the world was
told that
as many as 100 , 000 iraqi soldiers were killed. at one point , even baghdad put
the toll that high , as did the u.s. defense intelligence agency in private.
but u.s. officials have been backpedaling ever since , even though the
pentagon has yet to settle on an official estimate to release to the public.
now , one former dia analyst says the number of iraqi troops killed may
have been
as low as 1 , 500.
that conclusion by john heidenrich , writing in the current issue of the
quarterly magazine foreign policy , represents the lowest estimate yet
from u.s.
defense sources.
the revisions suggesting a less devastating iraqi toll fit a pattern of
vastly moderated u.s. military claims in the months after the war ended.
claims
for a number of u.s. weapons also were scaled down.
despite the dramatic videotapes of successful weaponry or the shocking
pictures of iraq 's disastrous retreat from kuwait , arguments have continued
unabated about what really happened in the gulf war.
heidenrich is not the first to question the iraqi death toll numbers that
originally were aired. more that a year ago , air force lt. gen. charles
horner ,
the commander of the air campaign in the gulf war , said he believed the iraqi
military death toll was fewer than 10 , 000 for the entire war.
the pentagon itself still refuses to provide an estimate of the number of
iraqis who died in the 42 day war against the u.s. led coalition in
january and
february 1991. on monday , pentagon spokesman lt. cmdr. joe gradisher
reiterated
past statements that there just is n't a number , that is credible.
but some current internal estimates range from 8 , 000 to 25 , 000 iraqi troops
killed , said one analyst , speaking on condition of anonymity , who is familiar
with the pentagon 's reports.
allied deaths were put at 146 americans , 35 by friendly fire 24 british , 9
by american fire 2 frenchmen , 1 italian and 39 among various arab allies.
of the postwar reassessments , the most widely publicized was the army 's
reluctant acknowledgement , months later , that its touted patriot air defense
system was nowhere near so effective as claimed against iraq 's scud missiles.
the bush administration initially claimed an almost perfect record for the
patriot last spring it revised the hit ratio to 60 percent.
the success record of the navy 's tomahawk high tech cruise missile used
against targets in baghdad and other parts of iraq also turned out to be more
modest than initially indicated by the pentagon.
the first iraqi casualty figures to surface after the war came in a
may 1991
report by the environmental group greenpeace , which said 100 , 000 to 120 , 000
iraqi soldiers were killed. it estimated that 5 , 000 to 15 , 000 iraqi civilians
were also killed.
the same month , published reports said the defense intelligence agency
estimated 100 , 000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300 , 000 wounded in the
air and
ground campaigns although the agency qualified that by saying the estimate
could be off by as much as 50 percent in either direction.
but as more information became available , those figures gradually were
revised downward.
the house armed services committee staff estimated 9 , 000 dead and 17 , 000
wounded after a review last year.
but heidenrich , writing in the current issue of the quarterly foreign
policy ,
estimated the total death toll from both the air and ground offensives
as low as
1 , 500 with about 3 , 000 wounded.
heidenrich based the conclusion in his article on the number of
bodies found
and buried by u.s. troops 577 and on prisoner of war interviews.
he noted
that only about 2 , 000 of 69 , 000 iraqi prisoners of war were wounded.
based on the calculation that about half as many wounded escaped as were
captured , he put the number of wounded at about 3 , 000. using a conservative
ratio of one dead to two wounded , applicable to third world armies like
iraq , he
set battlefield deaths at 1 , 500.
maybe the figures are too low , he wrote. maybe the real death toll
on the
battlefield was 2 , 000 or 3 , 000 or even 6 , 000. even then , the evidence
suggests a
death toll of well below 100 , 000 or even 10 , 000.
in an interview , he said the 100 , 000 figure was obviously off base
because it
would mean that virtually all the iraqi soldiers in the kuwait theater of
operations were casualties.
he said today 's bloodiest wars were not those fought with high technology ,
but rather the drawn out conflicts such as those in yugoslavia and somalia.

reflections on bosnia

lord owen and the serbs

in early february '93 , lord owen made appearances in new york city
on the donahue and charlie rose shows. on a couple of occasions on
those shows lord owen gave away his pro serbian position when he
made the point that much or most of the bosnian territory then in
dispute or already overrun by serbian forces had been controlled
and occupied by serbs before wwii. it was as if he were saying
that since the serbs had previously occupied those territories and
lost them during the hitler years , they should be allowed to
reconquer them today.

i was familiar with this view because my father , a yugoslav jew
who escaped to this country during the war , was aided and found
sympathy among the serbs during those harrowing years. in recent
months when the subject of serbian aggression was mentioned , my
father would make the point that 850 , 000 serbs were killed by nazi
and pro nazi croatian forces known as the ustasha. my father is
so pro serbian that he dismissed reports of serbian atrocities. my
father also excoriated new york times columnist anthony lewis ,
because , my father said , anthony lewis is always talking about
the muslims.

update april 28 , 1993 after an uneasy truce in and around
sbernica , shelling has resumed in nearby areas by all sides and
the killing and the misery continues apace while the clinton
administration dithers its response. in the days leading to the
collapse of resistance at sbernica , lord owen changed his tune.
previously he had opposed military intervention on the grounds
that it would endanger u.n. relief workers. when serbian forces
began to march on sbernica , the threat to u.n. relief soldiers
went unmentioned while lord owen called for outside intervention
to stop serbian aggression , including the use of air strikes. the
current disastrous situation can be seen as a failure of the west
and a failure of the vance owen initiative which did nothing to
halt the serbs. now that it 's too late to save muslim areas that
lord owen felt should be in a muslim state , lord owen belatedly
calls for strong action.

clinton and bosnia

in the summer of 1992 , george kenney , a senior state department
official , the undersecretary in charge of the yugoslav desk , made
news when he resigned from the state department because of the
bush administration 's refusal to take any action to halt serbian
aggression. as kenney saw it , bush 's inaction was largely due to
the president 's unwillingness to risk any political capital by
getting involved there.

apparently the same is true of the clinton administration.
clinton gives the impression that he cares more than bush did
about the terrible ongoing tragedy , but the practical effect has
so far been the same.

according to the new york times , (4 16 93) the clinton
administration did everything it could to suppress a mid march
report by its own experts which called for military action if
necessary to protect safe havens for the muslims. at one point ,
senate majority leader , george mitchell was so incensed that the
report was kept from congress , that he called for an
investigation.

instead of helping the desperate bosnians , clinton has signalled
again and again that milosevic and the serbs are free to do what
they want in bosnia indeed , clinton and the west have been
signalling that the serbs should get on with the job and finish
off the bosnians as quickly as possible while we turn the other
way. a key signal was when clinton made it clear that he would
not send in american military forces on the ground. on this
issue , clinton has made me wistful for bush. bush and baker could
not have done worse , and might have been pressured to do better
well before this time. lives in bosnia might have been saved and
the destruction might have been curtailed..

the nation , the left and the bosnian quandary

typical of the left 's inability to come to grips with the core
issue involved in bosnia , i.e. , a clear aggressor destroying
hundreds of thousands of lives , is the editorial on the bosnian
quandary in the nation (4 26 93). in the end the editorial votes
to do nothing , even while noticing the ghastly atrocities of the
bosnian serbs and that the greater and lesser powers...dither
and fuss and hang back. ( before anything else happens , the
clinton administration ought to pay the 530 million the united
states owes the u.n. the editorial concludes.)

in its most striking passage , the editorial writer warns that
those who are pushing president clinton to intervene on the side
of the bosnians had better review u.s. foreign policy since world
war ii. the editorial argues for inaction on the basis that the
bosnian serbs are no worse than any number of u.s. clients
including the chileans , the south africans , the greek fascists and
others. (in a subsequent column for the nation , christopher
hitchens correctly called this editorial , contemptible. )



william pfaff , a european based journalist who writes for the the
new yorker and the los angeles times , is among a group of liberal
columnists like anthony lewis , and leslie gelb who have clearly
and consistently called for strong western and american
intervention to stop the serbs. pfaff 's most recent column
(liberal opinion week 4 19 93) is entitled international
cowardice worsened bosnian tragedy.

he clarifies the international failure which has led to present
situation in one sentence. having refused to intervene to
sanction the threat to minority rights in newly independent
croatia in june 1991 , or to block or penalize the military
aggression by serbia that immediately followed , and the atrocious
ethnic cleansing which followed that , the united nations now
contemplates deploying in bosnia military force on a scale which
two years ago could have deterred the horrors yugoslavia has since
experienced. he goes on to explain that u.n. plans now envisaged
call for a more daunting and open ended military assignment than
a direct military intervention to halt the aggression would have
been a year ago.

aryeh neier on the serbs in his watching rights column in the
the nation (5 3 93) aryeh neier gets to the heart of the
motivation of the aggressors the preferred term for the serbian
forces who have been besieging and shelling sarajevo for more than
a year. he explains that there is no military purpose that is
served by the destruction of its fabric and its people...above
all , few of those aligned with the forces attacking sarajevo would
want to live there even if the city could be rebuilt. they are
not city people.

it is this , i believe aside from a desire to break the morale of
bosnians and make them press their government to accept peace at
any price that explains the conduct of the siege of
sarajevo... i t is a loathing for all that is urban , pluralist and
cosmopolitan that has made sarajevo the object for devastation.

historically , most of the serbian population in bosnia and
herzegovina has been rural , while muslims , who were the civil
servants and intelligentsia during the centuries of ottoman rule ,
made up a disproportionate share of the urban population....the
destruction of sarajevo is not only an expression of hostility
against this city it is also an attack on the urban idea....the
demagogues who whipped up the passions let loose by this war
exploited not only ethnic and religious bigotry but also hatred
for all that is cosmopolitan.

the light that neier sheds on the issue helps to clarify what is
at stake. the serbs represent the know nothing , anti secularist ,
fundamentalist , fascist forces who are attacking the urban ,
cosmopolitan , secular , multi cultural idea. they are attacking
the rest of us , just as hitler did. one irony is that at the
beginning of the crisis over bosnia , it was for awhile maintained
by the serbs and their supporters that they were responding to a
threat by the bosnian muslims to create a fundamentalist state.

neier has shown that it is the serbs who are the great threat to
secularism , multi culturalism , diversity and democracy. it 's the
serbs who are attacking the democratic notion , the democratic
idea.

anthony lewis comes close to the point when he asks why does
respect for clinton 's presidency depend...on his acting
effectively against serbian aggression \? ...first of all because to
do nothing about genocide would be such a betrayal of the values
we and our allies profess. (times , 4 26 93) but it 's not merely
a betrayal of our values. it 's because the serbs are attacking us
by proxy , just as hitler was.

one argument for decisive action by the west that is heard in a
different form , is that war in the balkans is destablizing for
europe. we hear it as , the bosnians are europe 's palestinians
that is to say , just as the palestinian refugee problem has been
the key to instability in the middle east , just so will the
hundreds of thousands of yugoslav refugees of all ethnicities
result in turmoil in europe for decades to come.

one of the lessons of the twentieth century is that even though
the atlantic ocean divides us , the americas are ultimately tied to
the destiny of europe. if europe is destabilized , the u.s. will
inevitably be affected and drawn into its problems. as in a
whirlpool , sooner or later we will be drawn into the maelstrom.
and as past history and pfaff have shown , it 's much better if we
do so decisively , quickly and on our terms.

sincerely , ronald bleier

in article 1su5iminnnap@mojo.eng.umd.edu josip@eng.umd.edu (josip loncaric) writes

and (1) was soundly rejected. the reasons are pragmatic even if
bosnian muslims are croats and serbs who converted to islam under
turkish rule centuries ago , none of the present generation has any
clue what was their ancestor 's actual nationality. in fact , although

i am forced to disagree with you. first of all , one may have been
born from a non turkish , non muslim parent outside the turkish land ,
yet still can be a turk , provided this person calls himself or herself
a turk. because the designation of a turk is not a genetic feature ,
not a racial or religious feature. it is a matter of identifying
with the turkish values. secondly , the following observations by
westerners were written in french by ahmet cevat

if turks had behaved like christians to use force to convert to islam the
nations which they brought under their power , to which no one could have
opposed , today there would be no eastern problem. but turks did not do so.
they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody to worship in their own
way centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum. thus ,
in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when
people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs
differed from theirs , the ottoman empire became the sole country where the
inquisition did not exist , where deaths at the stake were unheard of and
where accusations of witchcraft were not made. and the barbarian ( ! ) turkey
was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere
by the christians , could find asylum. these facts demonstrate that muslim
countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian
countries. 1

the turks , who are a conquering nation , did not turkify the nations that came
under their rule instead , they respected their religions and traditions. it
was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of
russian or austrian rule. because otherwise there would not have been a
romanian nation today (popescu ciocanel).

turks rule over people under their administration only externally , without
interfering with their internal structures. on account of this , the autonomy
of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most
advanced european countries. 2

...human beings hate each other on account of religious differences. this flaw
is older than islam and christianity. but there has never been any examples
of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account
of his religion. if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of
simple contempt among us too , or if it did not keep translating itself into
action , many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves
happy ! (a. de mortraye). 3

turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the
inquisition. on the contrary , it served as an asylum for the unfortunate
victims of christian fanaticism. if you look into history , you will see that
in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and
portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been
living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years ,
and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the
cruelty of christians , especially that of the orthodoxes. no jew is able to
appear in public during easter celebrations in athens , even today. in turkey ,
however , if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities ,
local courts immediately take them under their protection.

in that vast and calm country of the sultan , all religions and nations are
living together peacefully. although the mosque is superior to the church and
the synagogue , it does not replace them. because of this , the catholic sect is
more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon. in addition
to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the open air ceremonies of this
sect , neither does any law imprison its cross in the church. while the
dead are being taken to the graves , a long line of priests bear processional
candles and chant catholic hymns. when all the priests in all the churches in
the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical
processions during the eucharist celebrations , chanting hymns and bearing
their crosses and religious banners , a detachment of soldiers escorts them
which forces even the turks to stand in respect around the group of
priests. (a. ubicini). 4

no wonder you clown are in such a mess. let 's take sarkis atamian 's (an

105. atamian quotes

... the immediate question concerned itself with the organization and
tactics of revolution. the liberation of armenia , the immediate aim of
the party , was to be attained by

1. oral and written propaganda.
2. terrorism both as punishment against the enemy and as a measure
of self defense.
3. the creation of an avant garde of revolutionary groups to be
equipped and prepared for action when other nations were prepared
for a general uprising.
4. the organization of larger committees to be in constant contact with
each other and subject to a central body.
5. organization of units of guerilla fighters.

now , on page 105 , atamian 's book quotes of armenian constitution

... if the means was revolution , how was the revolution to be attained \?
by

1. propaganda
2. preparation of combat units and their indoctrination
3. encouragement of the revolutionary morale of the people
4. the arming of the people
5. organization of revolutionary committees
6. espionage throughout the country and the exchange of information with
the official bodies and journals
7. organization of financial zones for public collection
8. 'fighting and using' the weapon of the terror on corrupt government
officers , spies , traitors , grafters , and all sorts of oppressors
9. defense of the people against attacks from the brigandry
10. building of roads for the transport of arms
11. wrecking and looting of governmental institutions.

many of the recent armenian terrorist acts against the turkish people
were committed by the brainwashed members of the tzeghagron , namely ,
race worshipers of the dashnag youth organization. ironically , again ,
tzeghagron was set up by an undisputed armenian nazi , karekin nejdeh ,
in 1941 (see atamian , loc cit , page 389).

the quality of 'research' we 're about to see.

has been cut off from the world for weeks.

so i suppose that the footage on cnn last night was archival ,
and ted turner was faking it after the nbc style \? or is this
another wee little exaggeration for the sake of a greater truth \?

the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of
gaza , some 700.000 people , by denying them the right to leave the
strip and seek work in israel.

hey ! you forgot that israel has also denied syrians the same
'right'. come to think of it , mexico is denying me that 'right'
evan as i write this ! or are you ever so gently suggesting that
israel , unlike every other country on earth , should n't be allowed
to control traffic across its borders \?

while polish non jews risked their lives to save jews from the
ghetto , no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help
the gazan resistance. the only help given to gazans by israeli
jews , only dozens of people , is humanitarian assistance.

this sounds like a parallel , but it is n't. tell us how many poles
went into the ghetto to join the jews there. oops ! for a moment
there i forgot that in poland , 'humanitarian assistance could
get you killed. come to think of it , humanitarian assistance to
the gazans can get israelis killed , too. except that in gaza ,
it 's likely to be by a gazan death squad in your own office.

so let 's keep the parallel. since the gross numbers are n't the
same , we 'll need a proportionality value. should we use
gazan vs jewish initial population \?
gazan vs jewish death rates \?
gazans vs jews who survived five years of occupation \?
israelis vs nazis attacked by the 'resistance' \?
israelis vs poles charged with aiding the victims \?
since the two cases are so comparable , it should n't matter
which we pick , they 'll all be about the same , right \?



contrary to popular hyperbole , the idf could quite easily kill
off the entire population of gaza in hours if they wanted to.
(no , i'm not exaggerating. and i really do n't want to discuss how.)
note that a million dead gazans do n't get much more headline
space than a dozen , and are just as soon forgotten and once
exterminated , they ca n't keep popping up as headlines.

so if a final solution for gaza would be so much better from
a realpolitik standpoint , why does n't israel go for it \? a
difficult question to answer for those who ca n't believe anything
good about jews , and probably why they keep trying to force fit
the facts into the theory.

3) all they want is to get people angry.
4) posses a lousy sense of humor.
5) write incoherently and jump from topic to topic without any logical

6) describe themselves as intelligent and knowledgeable , although everything
in their posters points to the opposite.
7) very childish.

the libertarians believe in getting the government off the
backs of the people , so that the free market can solve problems.

libertarians believe in an end to the welfare state , an end to
government subsidies of all sorts. the basic idea is that the
government is way too big and way too expensive , and should be shrunk
down to a reasonable size.

they also believe in a complete end to foreign aid , including
the stationing of american troops overseas. we can not and should not
be policing the world.


i agree that the people who come into this group and describe
themselves as libertarians seem to posses the charictaristics you
describe , but heck , we 're not all like this. i'm a libertarian , and
i 've got a great sense of humor ! )

pts the conflict over nagorno karabakh an azeri perspective
pts
pts by alec rasizade
pts
pts

ar western readers have learned of the nagorno (upper) karabakh
ar controversy through reports from that remote area by western
ar correspondents and from commentaries by member of the long established
ar armenian american community. azeri views on this dispute have
ar appeared rarely if at all in the western news media. therefore let me
ar present washington report readers with some basic truths about the
ar origins of the conflict.

during the past two years , if one reads all the commentaries on the subject ,
a small minority of the writers have been armenia or azeri.

the following should be interesting.

ar armenian leaders claim that azerbaijan was the first to oppress and
ar expel the armenian minority from the azerbaijani republic. actually ,
ar the initiative to banish the azeri minority and convert the armenian
ar republic into a homogeneous state began in the winter of 1987 1988 ,
ar when 165 , 000 azeris were driven out of armenia. following that move ,
ar there were massacres of armenians in the azerbaijani cities of sumgait
ar in february 1988 and two years later , in baku in january 1990.

this not true. other than simply checking the newspapers , i will quote from an
independent human rights report. in the pax cristi netherlands , 29 september
1991 , page 28 , we read

by mid november , many incidents took place in several places in
azerbaijan. the apf azeri popular front challenged the communist party
for power. ... after ten days , the authorities came in with tanks to
reimpose their power. in nakhitchevan , the last armenian villages were
deported. in ganja , armenians were attacked and killed. all 40 , 000
armenian inhabitants fled the city...

between 22 november and 8 december 1988 , refugees from ganja arrived in
armenia while all 167 , 000 azeris in armenia were chased away.

in this part of the world february 1988 start of organized anti armenian
pogroms in azerbaijan come before november and december of 1988 !

ar azeri parliamentary committees have compiled evidence indicating that
ar both events were inspired from moscow to secure russian imperial rule
ar in the transcaucasus , according to the roman principle of divide and
ar rule. similar conspiracies are evident throughout the five year
ar history of the conflict.

it is interesting that the azeris killed , burnt , raped the armenians but the
perpetrators blame russians , and armenians themselves on other occasions.

ar each time the parties have been about to reach an agreement (in
ar zheleznovodsk , moscow , tehran , rome , geneva and alma ata) , an
ar invisible hand provoked further bloodshed. those interested in
ar maintaining the azeri armenian conflict , as well as the georgian
ar turmoil , are imperialist forces in russia , and probably in iran.

incorrect ! when were the people of nagorno karabakh ever involved in an
agreement \? never. until azerbaijan sits down with the armenians of nagorno
karabakh there will never be an end to this conflict.

ar the armenian offensive last spring created more than 100 , 000 new azeri
ar refugees from the captured towns of upper and lower karabakh and
ar adjacent rural districts. today 500 , 000 azeri refugees throng the
ar city of baku and environs , providing more problems for the newly
ar elected popular front government , which is opposed by the rigidly
ar nationalistic national independence party.

it 's called war. if the azerbaijanis did n't try to deport and allow the
armenians of nagorno karabakh to live in their ways , keep their armenian
culture , these armenians would not have had to defend their existence. the
azeris should not have assumed that armenians were going to roll over and
play dead.

ar how can a western style democracy survive in a small muslim country
ar where 1 million of the 7 million inhabitants are unemployed \? in the
ar absence of any international effort to help azeri refugees , as kurdish
ar and bosnian refugees have been helped , how can the azeri government
ar reject the demand of these exiles to recapture their lands , homes and
ar possessions \?

the azeri government should have thought about such thnings before they
attempted to deprive armenians of lands , homes , and possessions .

ar such simple realities must be understood in the west.
ar misunderstanding caucasian politics leads both western and russian
ar public opinion to imagine a permanent , and therefore irreversible ,
ar ethnic and religious rivalry in the caucasus.

true , and you , dr. alec rasizade , should practice what you preach !

ar i think western reluctance to interfere derives from this idea.
ar meanwhile , continuation of the war could draw both eastern and western
ar states into the conflict through activation of various security
ar alliances. these include , on the armenian side , the moscow led
ar commonwealth forces under the tashkent mutual security pact , signed
ar may 15 , 1992. on the azeri side , should turkey get involved as the
ar guarantor of the nakhichevan autonomy through the kars treaty of oct.
ar 13 , 1921 , these include the north atlantic treaty forces.

western interference ! turkish intervention ! the moment turkey dares step into
this conflict it will close the doors of any chance of turkey being part of
europe (as if it ever will) and will destroy the eastern third of anatolia !
dr. rasizade , international realpolitik is not as simple minded as you would
have us believe.

ar upper karabakh generally is described in western press reports as an
ar armenian enclave within azerbaijan. the truth is that the armenians
ar began to appear there only in the middle of the last century.

incorrect once again. a brief scan of history addresses such a foolish
claim.

armenians today , refer to the area of nagorno karabakh as artsakh , which
comes from the urartian term urtekhe urtekhini . no azeris yet !

ancient greeks referred to artsakh as orkhistena . no azeris yet !

in the first half of the 6th century b.c. , artsakh , as part of ervandid
armenia of media. no azeris yet !

from the end of the 4th century b.c. , artsakh was part of the armenian kingdom
of ervan. no azeris yet !

artsakh was still part of the armenian empire of tigran. orkhistena , or
artsakh is refereed to by strabo , as part of armenia. no azeris yet !

after armenia was divided between the persian and byzantine empires in 387
a.d. until 428 , artsakh was part of armenia. no azeris yet !

end of the 5th century , utik and artsakh became principalities of the
aranshakhiks. no azeris yet !

by the 7th century an artsakh dialect of armenian formed. no azeris yet !

emperor konstantin (913 959) addressees a letter to the prince of khachen to
armenia . khachen was the central principality of artsakh. no azeris yet !

in the decree of paul i (1797) , the number of armenian families in this area
was stated as 11 , 000.

it was from the 16th to the 18th centuries that non armenians from central
asia , asia minor , and kurdistan first began to be exercise political influence
in the planes of artsakh. caucasian muslims around karabakh !

in 1813 karabagh becomes part of russia. officiallt part of russia 1828. some
muslims in karabakh !

in 1914 , the number of armenian churches in nagorno karabagh was 224 , 188
priests , 206 , 768 parishioners in 224 armenian towns and villages. the armenian
percentage of the population was over 90 . max 10 azeris in karabakh
assuming no kurds !

consider the following statement by the azerbaijani revcom on december 1 , 1920

the worker peasant government of azerbaidzan , having been informed of the
proclamation of armenia a soviet socialist republic , sends its greetings
to the brother people. from this day the previous boundaries between
armenia and azerbaidzan are annulled. nagornyi karabakh , zangezur , and
nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the armenian socialis
republic.

long live the brotherhood and union of the workers and peasants of soviet
armenia and azerbaidzan !

ar a few years ago they celebrated the 150th anniversary of their
ar resettlement from persia to karabakh , after it came under russian
ar rule.

no , incorrect. the 1988 celebration was the 150th anniversary of russian rule
in the caucasus , including karabakh !

ar at the same time the russian colonial administration also drew
ar in russian and german settlers , who were welcomed by azeris. how
ar would americans react if the large numbers of armenians living in
ar southern california suddenly claimed an armenian homeland , and
ar demanded separation from california \?

non sequitur.

ar armenian historians insist that before the armenian resettlement
ar karabakh was inhabited by aboriginal christians. that is correct.

armenian historians do n't say this !

ar the people of medieval caucasian albania adopted christianity in the
ar fourth century. but those ancient residents had no link to and
ar nothing in common with armenians.

considering the caucasian albans were of the armenian apostolic faith , and
their utilization of the armenian language in their liturgy , makes such an
argument totally invalid !

ar azeris would have a better claim to
ar be successors of albania , since azeris have for centuries inhabited ,
ar dominated , and developed the karabakh part of the azeri nation.

wishing to be part of a people non existent for nearly a millennium for geo
political advantage is rather outrageous. in addition to such absurdity ,
azeris claim to be turks , persians , and all the while are azerizing their
minorities , such as the lezgians , kurds , tat , talish , and a host of other
nationalities which may amount to nearly half the population of azerbaijan.

ar both armenia and azerbaijan last year signed the final act of the
ar conference on security and cooperation in europe of 1975 , and the
ar paris charter for new europe of 1990 , confirming their mutual
ar adherence to the principle of inviolability of existing borders. this
ar principle means that the borders and territorial integrity of the
ar republic of azerbaijan are to be guaranteed by all of the signatory
ar nations , not just by turkey.

such agreements do not give azerbaijan the right to de populate karabakh of
armenians.

ar this is one key to intervention on behalf either of the u.n. , the
ar csce , the commonwealth , nato or iran. the second key to untying the
ar caucasian knot is to determine who is the aggressor , according to the
ar u.n. definition of 1974.

fine , so why has azerbaijan refused to allow un troops into the armenian
enclave \? what is azerbaijan afraid of \? perhaps the fact that the territory
is the home of armenians , the un , would by definition , support the local
population !

ar when that is accomplished , the international community can and should
ar apply to the aggressor in the caucasus international sanctions such as
ar those presently being employed against serbia and montenegro in the
ar former yugoslavia. such decisive collective international action can
ar halt further aggression in karabakh , and prevent the armenian azeri
ar conflict from growing and spreading.

azerbaijan 's refusal to allow the armenians of karabakh to determine their
own future the is issue , not viewing isolating events out of context are
actions that will address the karabakh conflict. viewing events in a war
in isolation and out of context is like viewing the landing at normandy as
an act of allied aggression !

ar of azerbaijan , is a visiting researcher at the harriman institute of
ar columbia university in new york.

the cases are n't really comparable. a project like a freeway requires
public hearings , court action , appeals , advance determination of
restitution , and so on. the razing of the moghrabi district in east
jerusalem happened within hours of the end of the hostilities of the 6
day war. the residents were given only two or three hours' notice to
pack up and find accomodations elsewhere. they had no chance of
public hearing , debate , appeal , negotiation or anything. it was get
out or die in the rubble.

in today 's jerusalem post magazine there is a feature story about the
ongoing restoration of synagogues in the jewish quarter. the author ,
leah abramowitz , writes that there were fifty seven synagogues in the
quarter in 1948 , all of which were destroyed , some , she says , used as
donkey stables. the building shells , that is.

i still find it really , really hard to understand why the demolition
of the buildings in front of the kotel continues to evoke more outrage
than this. everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the jews.

'after all , who remembers today the extermination of the tartars \? '

the turkish holocaust turk soykirimi , p. 213.)


the crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination
of the muslim population in soviet republic of armenia , karabag ,
bosnia and herzegovina is an 'islamic holocaust' comparable to the
extermination of 2.5 million muslims by the armenian government
during the wwi and of over 6 million european jews during the wwii.
(tovfik kasimov azeri leader september 25 , 1992)


today 's ethnic cleansing policies by the serbian dictatorship against
croatians and muslims of yugoslavia , as well as the soviet republic
of armenia 's against the muslim population of neighboring azerbaijan ,
are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide
perpetrated by the armenian government 78 years ago against the
turkish and kurdish muslims and sephardic jews living in these
lands. (cebbar leygara kurdish leader october 13 , 1992)

i do not want to convince anyone. this is just usenet , not the real

i present my opinion. i think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas. i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything.

fine. now if your opinion is n't convincing anyone , and it 's getting
refuted regularly by the facts (which is the case) , is n't it likely that
your opinions need some revision \?

as i said , i do not want to convice anyone , so , why should my opinions
convince anyone \?
i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts.


first , and i repeat it , i never said that the idea of jews having the
right to have a state is racist.
zionism , as a movement , is more than just that idea.

in a word utter and complete horse puckey. look the term up in the
dictionary.

maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here. one thing is the
accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary , and sometimes a completely
different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time.



i think that zionism
in the way it defines who is a jew , for example , is racist like.

ok , now how would you define it. and by the way , you 're wrong again.
there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements.
you know this is the case , it 's been pointed out on the net directly to
you before , and yet you continue to maintain this delusion.

ok. tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a
different way , and how many are who define jew based on a religious way.

in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do
not support the bombing and killing of the ira , i believe that jews have
a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now.

comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing
those of the us to those of chile under pinochet (for example) , with the
ira in the role of pinochet. you really need to get your history
straight. you also need a basic dictionary.

you need to start reading before answering.
my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic , it
does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic. i did not comapre
israel to the ira. i think that you are starting to put words on my
mouth and that is wrong.



stuff deleted by pinkas. his statement , which i was responding to
with the below , asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic

i never said that zionism is monolithic. if you are going to attribute
me things , present the quotes where i said that.


that is what makes the basis for zionist movements. however , i am not
considering just that , but the rest of it.

in a word i do n't believe you. your words tell a very different
story. especially since they are not based on fact , but innuendo and
misrepresentation.

that is your problem. i could certainly interpret this like you are
running out of arguments. first , you put words in my mouth , now , you
say you do ot believe me.


which makes an interesting point. people living in a jewish state have
shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are
not the same. so , the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown
us that there are some problems in a state where 80 of the people is secular
but judaism is define according to religious standards , or where marriage
is a religious stage , or where the law of return defines a jew according to
a religious standard.

no , it does n't ! nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be
religious or even believe in g d to become a citizen of israel
thereunder.

why do n't you try reading for a change \? did i say that the law of return
demand a person to be religious \? now , how does the law of return define
who is a jew and who is not \? i said that it uses a religious standard
if your mother is a jew , you are a jew , if your mother is not jewish ,
neither you are.
do not twist my words , please.


true , there are debates in israel and abroad about who is
a jew \? , but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular.
would you say that religious people should not have a say in that \?
would you deny them their right of free speech \?

i am not talking about the debate. i am talking about how things are right
now. when the debate is over , i 'll see what happens.
right now , things are like they are.
let me ask you one thing. i understand that israel differenciates between
citizenship and nationality. suppose m(ale) and f(emale) have a child in
israel. which nationality will the child 's id show , according to each one
of the following cases

a) f and m are both jewish.
b) f is jewsh and m is not.
c) f is muslim and m is jewish.
d) f is christian and m is jewish.
e) f and m are both non jewish.




did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become
non jews \? why should they still define then a jew based on what is a
religious definition \?

it 's called history. how do you think jews stuck together through
pogroms for millenia in europe \? we had to know who was our own. i for
one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent
is no less legit than is matrilineal (which is not the religious jew 's
point of view). there 's plenty of room for that in zionism as you
well know.

it called history. at some point it was ok. now , i believe , it is not.


according to webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary , merriam webster inc ,
publishers , springfield , massachusetts , u.s.a. , 1986 , page 593 ,

hy poc ri sy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not.

so , saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people
having the right to nationalism , but disregarding the right of the palestinian
people to do the same , according to this dictionary , is hypocrisy.

utter baloney. by the way , i do believe the palestinians have a right
to self determination , have stated so on this net , and i know you 've

seen it.


interesting. how do you know \? had i ever talked to you about this and
forgotten about that \?

but that right to self determination cannot be at israel 's
expense. israel 's security comes first and that security must be
maintained. you 're also twisting words now beyond belief. if you think
that 's what that definition means in this context , you need a first grade
course in english.


which definition are you now talking here about \?
i do not know why you are so touchy. i never said that you did not support
palestinian self determination. i just gave an example of hypocrisy. i never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it. it was just an example. nothing
more , nothing less than that. why did you have to clarify what you think \?

if you did n't use different meanings of words than are in the
dictionary , you might be believable.

here you have several problems.
first , you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
the dictionary.
second , it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more
words than those in the dictionary.
third , we can exchange ideas if you want , but you come out with this nonsense
about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary.
it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
others. sad.

if your facts at all resembled
even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be
believable.

if you did not put words in my mouth , it might be that you might
start reading what i had actually said. so far , you come over and over
twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said
them. in this way , you are answering to yourself. that is why you do not
find it believable. maybe , if you start reading what i had actually said ,
and not what you added , you might change your mind.

but the fact is that there is nothing resembling fact in
what you 've said on this thread. and the fact also is that you 're using
different definitions for your words based on baloney than anyone
else does.

first , there is nothing resembling a fact in what you added to what i said ,
as if i had said it.
seconf , anyone else is supposed to mean than i do \?

i agree with all you write except that terrorist orgs. were not shelling
israel from the golan heights in 1982 , but rather from lebanon. the golan
heights have been held by israel since 1967 , and therefore the plo could
not have been shelling israel from there , unless there is something i am
not aware of.

oops...small mistake. thanks for mentioning it. i just read on

labour 's enclaves policy in the occupied territories

by israel shahak
publ. in middle east international , london , 30.4.93

it is not difficult to discover israel 's policy towards the
palestinians at any given time. it can be easily inferred
from the facts on the ground and from the information
provided by the hebrew press. there is one condition ,
though. the torrents of claptrap about the peace
process must be totally ignored , as must israel 's official
pronouncements , whole sole purpose is to distort reality.
by concentrating only on the facts , it was early apparent
that labour 's policies were no different from those of
shamir but for their greater reliance on deceit and their
more effective implementation.

likud 's policies were accurately described by ariel
sharon in an article , accompanied by a map , in yediot
aharonot last august. the sharon plan envisaged a
division of the west bank into seven , and the gaza strip
into four , autonomous palestinian enclaves , all of them
under israeli supervision. the total area of these
enclaves amounted to about 15 per cent of the
territories. the rest was to be controlled by the israeli
settlements and the highways built around the enclaves.
the entire area around jerusalem , from the outskirts of
ramallah to the boundaries of bethlehem , has already
been turned into a greater jerusalem where the arab
inhabited localities amount to small enclaves surrounded
by areas occupied by israeli settlements or reserved for
them.

judging from labour 's settlement policy , it may be
assumed that it may content itself with a lesser number
of arab enclaves of a rather larger size than sharon had
planned. but the principle of surrounding the enclaves by
settlements strategically dispersed along the highways
remains unchanged. labour plans only four enclaves in
the west bank two in samaria and two in judea (i.e.
north and south of jerusalem respectively) , and no more
than two in the gaza strip. in regard to greater
jerusalem , labour 's policies hardly deviate from
sharon 's.

a saner version of likud policy

as some israeli correspondents at once realised , labour
policies were but a saner version of sharon 's
extravaganza. last july , gideon eshet wrote in yediot
aharonot that , while barely a few months ago labour
supported the demand to freeze all construction beyond
the green line , no specific decision to freeze
construction in the territories has been taken . and uzi
benziman wrote in ha'aretz that as far as can be judged
on the basis of the internal political discussions in
jerusalem , rabin intends to stick to likud 's ways .

the two biggest enclaves envisaged by labour are
located in samaria . therefore the belt of settlements
around the trans samaria highway , designed to
separate those enclaves from each other , is of paramount
importance. according to the latest data , the percentage
of israeli settlers in the entire west bank population
(apart from east jerusalem) is a mere 5.5 per cent. but
for the area around the trans samaria highway , the
corresponding figure is almost 20 per cent , and it is
increasing steadily. the situation in the settlements of
the efrat block south of jerusalem , designed to sever
the enclave around bethlehem from the one around
hebron , is pretty much the same. the efrat block is now
being connected with west jerusalem by a highway.

the project is costly in the extreme , because the highway
is designed to bypass bethlehem by a sequence of long
tunnels. the final decision to build this highway was
suspended until rabin 's return from his us visit in
march. the subsequent decision to renew its construction
can be seen as us approval for the enclaves plan as a
whole.

process of impoverishment

the enclaves plan implies deliberate and steady
impoverishment of the palestinians. this is well known
in israel but ignored abroad by all who should be
concerned , including the plo. in regard to the gaza strip ,
the whole process was best described by ze'ev shiff in
ha'aretz in march. he mentions having seen a pamphlet
issued six years ago by the civil administration
forecasting the conditions in the gaza strip under israeli
rule in 2000 . his analysis deserves to be quoted
extensively

we continue to steal the strip 's water , even though its
quality deteriorates from year to year. we continue to
steal the strip 's tiny land resources , in order to found
there more and more settlements , as if we deliberately
want to make the inhabitants despair , and in their
despair think in termws of having nothing to lose. it is
by our own doing that the strip 's workers must now
spend travelling to their workplaces almost as much time
as they spend working. from the military point of view ,
we have kept control of no more than half the strip 's
area at an increasingly exorbitant price in manpower and
resources. about a year before moshe arens left the
defence ministry , i heard him saying that we should
withdraw from the strip come what may. his argument
was that israel sinks into the strip ever deeper and
deeper. he told me he had proposed this to yitzhak
shamir but he rejected it. yitzhak rabin rejects it too.

enormous state support for the qatif block settlers can
also be cited as proof that the enclaves plan is being
implemented. the qatif block settlements , founded by
the first rabin government of 1974 77 , are intended to
divide the gaza strip into two separate enclaves. efraim
davidi of davar had data showing how vital for israeli
this enterprise is. the qatif block is now producing 40
per cent of israeli tomatoes destined for export , and a
substantial proportion of cut flowers. he also deals with
the subsidies the settlers receive , considerably
augmented by the present government. owing to them ,
housing units are cheap. the present government does
not spare efforts to recruit new settlers to the block.
any prospective settler will get a 95 per cent mortgage
for his house on top of a grant of 18 , 000 shekels
( 6 , 500).

such data shows that israel 's plans apply whether the
palestinians of the gaza strip are allowed or forbidden to
work in israel. the economic motivations were explained
by danny rubinstein in ha'aretz in march

from the economic viewpoint gaza could already be
sealed off hermetically and all the strip 's workers could
be barred from entering israel...even though accurate
data is hard to come by , it is indisputable that during the
last two years the numbes of gazan workers arriving
daily to work in israel has markedly decreased , from
80 , 000 in the mid'80s to 40 , 000 today. but the decrease
is not only due to restrictions imposed on entering israel
from gaza. it is also due to the drastic curtailment of
demand for gazan labour in israel. with unemployment
in israel soaring and the construction of apartments
blocks virtually halted , the workers from gaza are no
longer really needed...

gaza 's total dependence

the entire economy of the gaza strip is totally dependent
on israel. in recent years in the gaza strip there has
been an increase in sub contracted work for israeli
factories , mostly footware and textiles. thousands of
small workshops , employing an average of four workers ,
get their raw materials or unfinished products , together
with detailed working instructions , from israeli factories.
rubinstein attributes this development to the fact that
the average wage in the gaza strip is merely 40 per cent
of that in the west bank , which in turn stands at half the
average wage in israel and besides the gazan employer
does not pay any social security for his employees. if
the average wage in the gaza strip is just a fifth of that
in israel , the profits of israeli factories and even of
palestinian sub contractors must be vast.

they are higher still when a gazan sub contractor
provides labour to be performed at home , with the
family 's help. the livelihood of tens of thousands of
gazans depends on such sub contracted work. many of
them are women and children , paid about ten shekels
( 3.50) a day which can last 12 hours or more. there can
be no doubt that profits from exploiting cheap gazan
labour are one of the reasons for the stubborn opposition
of rabin and other israeli ministers to withdrawal from
the strip.

economic conditions in the gaza strip differ little from
what was created straight after israel 's conquest in
1967 . in this respect , one should not be deluded by the
talk , nowadays fashionable , about israeli gestures
intended to encourage economic development in the
territories , as israeli journalists point out , all permits
for opening new businesses depend on a prior approval
by the shin bet. behind all the professed goodwill there
is no desire to solve problems , just the attitude of a good
colonialist , willing to do something for the benefit of the
natives , but on condition that they behave nicely , do not
become rebellious , and never do anything against the
interests of the metropolis , its economic interests
included , wrote michal sela in davar in february. the
development of sub contracted work in the gaza strip
accords perfectly with sela 's diagnosis.

sela also shows how exactly the economic controls work.
in all branches of the economy , lobbies have been set in
motion for purposes of freeing israeli production from
the threat of any palestinian competition. the method is
simplicity itself. as soon as any israeli producer succeeds
in persuading the government , or even the trade and
industry minister alone , a military order is issued
prohibiting the export of a given produce to israel. if this
does not suffice , a palestinian factory may be denied a
licence to operate or bureaucratic obstacles may paralyse
its production. among the most active of such lobbies is
the agricultural one. it has succeeded in limiting exports
of gazan vegetables (except for those grown by settlers)
not only to israel but also to europe , where they
otherwise might compete with israeli exports.

perpetuaring apartheid

labour 's goal is to perpetuate this apartheid regime in
the territories. the same goal is shared by the us , which
otherwise could not support the labour government so
firmly. in my view one of the reasons the us feels
happier about supporting labour than likud is its
greater efficiency in pursuing the settlement drive. this
point was brought home by ofer shelah in ma'ariv , who
deplored the settlers' failure which he attributed to
likud 's inefficiency. he showed that the peak yearly
settlement growth occured during the term of office of
the national unity government (i.e. 1984 90) in which
rabin served throughout as the defence minister .
likud 's reputation for settling the territories better than
labour is false , attributable to the many tiny settlements
without strategic value founded under shamir for
symbolic reasons.

to sum up labour 's policy , unconditionally supported by
the us differs from that of likud primarily in the
efficiency with which it is implemented. according to
that policy the territories are to be divided into two
parts. the major part is to be ruled by israel directly ,
and the minor part indirectly. in my view , this racist
scheme is doomed to ultimately fail , but at a horrifying
price in human suffering. the sooner its true nature is
recognised , the less suffering it may cause.

greeks do not like turks not because of what they did to us but because of
what they plan to do to us.

let me improve this one for you , then. for nearly one thousand years ,
the turkish and kurdish people lived on their homeland the last
one hundred under the oppressive soviet and armenian occupation. the
persecutions culminated in 1914 the armenian government planned and
carried out a genocide against its muslim subjects. 2.5 million turks
and kurds were murdered and the remainder driven out of their homeland.
after one thousand years , turkish and kurdish lands were empty of turks
and kurds.

the survivors found a safe heaven in turkiye.

today , x soviet armenian government rejects the right of turks and
kurds to return to their muslim lands occupied by x soviet armenia.

today , x soviet armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against
humanity.

x soviet armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the muslims
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the turks and kurds.

turks and kurds demand the right to return to their lands ,
to determine their own future as a nation in their own homeland.

...on this occasion , we once again reiterate the unquestioned
justice of the restitution of turkish and kurdish rights and...

we demand that the x soviet armenian government admit its
responsibility for the turkish and kurdish genocide , render
reparations to the muslim people , and return the land to its
rightful owners. the recognition of the genocide has become an
issue which cannot be delayed further , and it is imperative that
artificial obstacles created for political manipulations be removed.

we believe the time has come to demand from the the united states
that it formally recognizes the turkish and kurdish genocide , adopts
the principles of our demands and refuses to accede to armenian pressures
to the contrary.

as taxpayers of the united states , we express our vehement
protest to the present u.s. government policy of continued
coddling , protection and unqualified assistance towards x soviet
armenia.

our territorial demands are strictly aimed at x soviet armenia 's.

figure in adl spy case arrested at s.f. airport

espionage former police officer is taken into custody upon
arriving from philippines , where he had fled after fbi
interrogation.

by jenifer warren , times staff writer

san francisco a former san francisco police officer who fled to the
philippines amid accusations that he funneled confidential law
enforcement information to an investigator for the anti defamation
league was arrested at the airport here on 11 felony charges , police
said friday.

thomas j. gerard who abruptly left the united states in october after
the fbi questioned him about his activities , was apprehended thursday
night after a source in the philippines told investigators that gerard
was returning home.

gerard , 50 , was booked into san francisco county jail early friday
morning on eight counts of theft of government documents and one count
each of computer theft , burglary and conspiracy.

if convicted on all charges , gerard could face 16 years in prison and
40 , 000 in fines. bail was initially set at 250 , 000 after police
argued that he was a flight risk , but it was later reduced to 20 , 000.
a friend of gerard was trying to post bail late friday afternoon , a
sheriff 's spokeswoman said.

gerard returned to the united because he missed his wife and child ,
with whom he lived on a houseboat in sausalito , and wanted to have
his day in court , said police capt. john willett , his former boss and
one of two arresting officers.

gerard , an undercover agent for the central intelligence agency from
1982 to 1985 , also feared that the cia was out to kill him , willett
said. in an interview with the times last month , gerard threatened to
disclose illegal cia support of death squads in central america if he
was indicted and tried on the san francisco spying charges.

gerard is a central figure in a scandal over an intelligence network
operated by the anti defamation league , a prominent jewish civil
rights organization. investigators allege that gerard illegally gave
criminal histories to roy bullock , a san francisco art dealer who said
he has been an undercover adl intelligence operative for 40 years.

investigators said they found confidential police files in bullock 's
home computer which contained entries on 10 , 000 people and 950
groups and in boxes in his apartment. files have also been seized
under search warrants from adl offices in san francisco and los
angeles but authorities have not disclosed their contents.

gerard could not be reached for comment friday , and his attorney ,
james lassart , did not return telephone calls seeking comment. in the
interview with the times last month , however , gerard acknowledged
snooping and sharing some information with bullock , but denied any
criminal wrongdoing.

bullock and gerard also are under investigation for selling
intelligence to south africa.

adl officials have described bullock as a 550 a week independent
contractor and have vigorously denied knowledge of any illegal
activity. on friday , adl lawyer jerrold ladar said gerard 's arrest
has nothing to do with adl. other than that , we have no comment on
the case.

arab american groups which were a main target of the spying ,
according to police applauded the arrest and pressed authorities to
pursue the investigation.

we urge investigators to carry this case forward and to publicly
disclose the full extent of adl and law enforcement involvement , said
james zogby , head of the arab american institute in washington.

police , meanwhile , characterized gerard 's arrest the first in the
inquiry into the spying scandal as an unexpected breakthrough. a
former police colleague of gerard , inspector fred mollat , visited
gerard several weeks ago and urged him to return home.

i knew he would n't want to live on an island on the lam forever , but
we did n't think it would happen this quickly , capt. willett said.
this development really speeds up our timetable on the case.

during his 25 year career on the police force , gerard was a highly
regarded officer known for his work in the department 's intelligence
division. his last assignment was on the gang task force.

after fbi agents questioned gerard last fall , he took early retirement
and fled to the remote jungle island of palawan , 300 miles south of
manila.

gerard was arrested at 8 40 p.m. as he stepped from his philippines
airlines flight. he was traveling alone and looked tanned but haggard
after his six month hiatus , police said.

he was surprised when he saw us standing there , and got a shocked
look on his face , willett said. then he said , 'hello , i'm back.'

a perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of
400 men who advocated murdering jews and destroying the state
of israel , compared to the deafening silence over the abusive
treatment of jews in arab countries during the past 50 years.

never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial.

repeat a lie often enough and people will start to believe it , eh \?

the hamas terrorists were given the opportunity to appeal. they 've
chosen not to , obviously because they get better propaganda mileage
out of refusing.

israel also agreed that they could return immediately , provided they
agreed to stop killing jews. their refusal speaks for itself.

a few things about the university. it is more fun than some may
admit. partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked
one of playboy 's top party schools. but we do study and more
importantly learn a lot. the overall uva drug use is actually
lower than the average college in the u.s.
there is no hate law on the books even though they (the
forces of pc) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar
law at the university of wisconsin \? was found unconstitutional
last year). there is a law
against relationship of professors with their students or
advisees that just passed.
thomas jefferson was the sole author of the virginia
statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten
amendments) , though he is not given full credit for righting

the bill of rights. so someone who picked on me for that is
right.
by the way , we 're the man in everything. sports
academics and partying. i'm sure a lot of other schools are
good at what they do as well , so do n't start mailing me junk.
i'm happy where i am and maybe i 'll go to one of y'alls medical
schools in a couple of years.
oh my god. my spelling and grammer suck. i guess i need some
sleep. i said righting (instead of writing). what 's the chance
of that. thank god i caught it before everyone started picking
on it. i hope i did n't cause mr.jefferson too much shame.

which was my point. by converting to another religion i do not loose
my cultural identity , i just loose my religious identification.

i disagree. by converting to another religion , you certainly
do change your cultural identity , and lose that part of you which was
jewish.


at the moment you converted , you officially anounced to the world
that you do not consider yourself to be part of the jewish nation.
so , why should the jewish nation consider you to be a member \?

to be a part or not of the jeish nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion. actually , if i am an atheist , which is in fact like
converting into a non jewish in terms of religion , i am still considered as
part of the jewish nation.

no , there is a serious cultural and religios difference
between renouncing the jewish god and accepting a new one. thou
shall have no other gods before me. conversion is a violation of
this , atheism you might be able to wiggle around with.

it seems that , to keep the peace talks going , israel has to keep
making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture , while palestinian
arabs continue to go around hunting jews.

you know that putting something like this out on the newsgroup is only
going to generate flames , not discussion. try adding some substance to
the issue of gestures you mentioned.

if the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success ,
the arabs are going to have to start reciprocating , especially since
they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return
for giving up only intangibles.

what is it you feel that israel has offered as a gesture \? what would
you ( realistically ) expect to see presented by the arabs palestinians
in the way of gesture \?

if they keep trying to change the already agreed upon rules , which seems
to be one of their favorite games , the israelis are not likely to be very
confident that the intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table
will be worth the parchment they 're written on.

what are the rules that have been bent by arab actions \? it would seem
that the israeli deportations were seen by the other side as an example
of changing the rules .

it takes two to negotiate a peace. it 's time for the arabs to start
doing their share.

there is still time....the tactic reached its goal....wide

money , jewish power and jewish enthusiasm

israel , trial and error , harper , 1949 , p.244)

he sent to the sinai on may 14 1967 would not have
been sufficient to launch an offensive against israel. he
knew it and we knew it.
(yitzhak rabin , le monde , 29 february 1968)

27. to pretend that the egyptian forces massed on our
frontiers in 1967 were in position to threaten the
existence of israel constitutes an insult not only to the
intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of
situation , but above all an insult to the zahal israeli
army
(general res. matti peled , ha'aretz , 19 march 1972)

28. when we have broken the strength of the arab
legion and bombarded amman , we would wipe out
transjordan after that syria would fall....we would thus
end the war , and would have put paid to egypt , assyria
and chaldea on behalf of our ancestors
(david ben gurion in his diaries , quoted in michael bar
zohar , the armed prophet , a biography of ben gurion ,
prentice hall , 1967 , p.139)

29. these jews of the diaspora would like to see us , for
their own reasons , heroes with our backs to the wall. but
this wish can in no way change the realities.
(israeli general ezer weizmann , le monde , 3 june 1972)

30. let us not today fling accusations at the palestinian
arab murderers. who are we that we should argue
against their hatred \? for eight years now they sit in
their refugee camps in gaza , and before their very eyes ,
we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in
which they and their forefathers have lived. we are a
generation of settlers , and without the steel helmet and
the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. let
us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting
and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of arabs ,
who sit all around us. let us not avert our gaze , so that
our hand shall not slip. this is the fate of our generation ,
the choice of our life to be prepared and armed , strong
and tough or otherwise , the sword will slip from our
first , and our life will be snuffed out.

on march 1 , 1992 , but in the guardian sunday section. the story was
not filed frim agdam but from london.

i 'll let the rest of the net judge this on its own merits.

source 'the sunday times , ' 1 march 1992 (a british weekly , written by
thomas goltz , from agdam , azerbaijan.)

armenian soldiers massacre hundreds of fleeing families.

the spiralling violence gripping the outer republics of the former
soviet union gained new impetus yesterday with cold blooded slaughter of
hundreds of women and children in war racked nagorno karabakh.
survivors reported that armenian soldiers shot and bayoneted more
than 450 azeris , many of them women and children , who were fleeing an
attack on their town. hundreds , possibly thousands , were missing and
feared dead.
the attackers killed most of the soldiers and volunteers defending
the women and children. they then turned their guns on the terrified
refugees. the few survivors later described what happened that 's when
the real slaughter began , said azer hajiev , one of three soldiers to
survive. the armenians just shot and shot. and then they came in and
started carving up people with their bayonets and knives.
they were shooting , shooting , shooting , echoed rasia aslanova , who
arrived in agdam with other women and children who made their way through
armenian lines. she said her husband , kayun , and a son in law were killed
in front of her. her daughter was still missing.
one boy who arrived in agdam had an ear sliced off.

the survivors said 2000 others , some of whom had fled separately ,
were still missing in the gruelling terrain many could perish from their
wounds or the cold.
by late yesterday , 479 deaths had been registered at the morgue in
agdam 's morgue , and 29 bodies had been buried in the cemetery. of the
seven corpses i saw awaiting burial , two were children and three were
women , one shot through the chest at point blank range.
agdam hospital was a scene of carnage and terror. doctors said they
had 140 patients who escaped slaughter , most with bullet injuries or deep
stab wounds.
nor were they safe in agdam. on friday night rockets fell on the city
which has a population of 150 , 000 , destroying several buildings and
killing one person.

now wait , there is more.

it's inhumane to ignore this violence

the stories of survivors of karabag massacre

69 year old hatin nine telling

''my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. they told
me we wo n't kill you. but the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old huseyin ibrahimoglu

''our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours.
while killing children and babies mercilessly they said you are
turks , you must die.''

28 year old gulsum huseyin

''they bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
my eyes.''

are these stories lies \? have the eye witnesses been day dreaming \?
were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region \?

the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british
journalists , too. two days before we had quoted from a sunday times
article. they british reported the events in karabag even before
turkish journalists. what is more here are the pictures. pictures
of people who were bayonetted , whose eyes were gouged , ears cut off.

even the armenian radio could n't claim these lies. they are saying
exaggeration. that means ' 'somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. perhaps that village of khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours , instead of 2... or gulsum huseyin 's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. the effects of
this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

some of the western press' , led by some french newspapers , ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

yesterday we gave samples from le figaro. until yesterday 's print
no news about the real events in karabag were printed. so were the
french tv channels.. the subject they considered related to karabag
was ''the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks.''

the age we are living in is termed a human rights age. there are lots
of organizations such as united nations and csce(conference on security
and cooperation in europe) , and rules , all designed to fight against human
rights violations. international reactions must be made with international
cooperation. with support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty \? where
is the cooperation \? where are the reactions \? and the intellectuals ,
journalists , writers , tv stations of certain western countries such
as france who are fast to claim leadership of human rights \?
where are you \?

with arabs in different villages and asked them to
whisper in the ears of some arabs that a great jewish
reinforcement has arrived in galilee and that it is going
to burn all of the villages of the huleh. they should
suggest to these arabs , as their friends , to escape while
there is still time....the tactic reached its goal....wide

fine. now if your opinion is n't convincing anyone , and it 's getting

your opinions need some revision \?

as i said , i do not want to convice anyone , so , why should my opinions
convince anyone \?
i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts.

then you have n't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against
them. they have been , over and over again. they will be again.

so far , you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine. i would
hardly take them as facts.


maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here. one thing is the
accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary , and sometimes a completely
different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time.

hey , what do you think dictionaries are for \? you quite obviously need
one. a good dictionary gives both , and you well know it.

i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (spanish) , that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary. even more , i
could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different
from those in the dictionary.

ok. tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a
different way , and how many are who define jew based on a religious way.

i do n't think that data exist on this directly.

and guess why. is n't it curious that we do not know how many people define
in how many different ways the term jew , which is the basis of the movement
itself \?
so , the evidence shows that up to now , jew , when considered in terms of israel ,
the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity , even if 80 of those defined as jews in isreal
are not religious.



in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do
not support the bombing and killing of the ira , i believe that jews have
a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now.

comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing
those of the us to those of chile under pinochet (for example) , with the
ira in the role of pinochet. you really need to get your history
straight. you also need a basic dictionary.

you need to start reading before answering.
my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic , it
does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic. i did not comapre
israel to the ira. i think that you are starting to put words on my
mouth and that is wrong.

that is no problem. but once again you are defining zionism as one
movement. you are implying that it is monolithic. you know this is
not and has never been the case.

that is a problem. i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is
now. i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals. does that change the
final results of what happened in the ussr \?
in the same way , even if the zionist movement is not homogeneous , it
does not matter. what matters is the result.

i never said that zionism is monolithic. if you are going to attribute
me things , present the quotes where i said that.

you do n't say it directly. you implied it , and i showed explicitly
where and how you implied it. now you 're trying to wriggle out of it.
wo n't wash , and you know it.

i never said it directly nor indirectly. i am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here. i am sure most of them are good ,
honest and caring people. i am talking about the results of the zionist
movement. i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a
law of return with a religious definition of jew , a country that defines
nationality based on religion. i am talking about something i consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief.
after all , if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they
were not born in the right religion.


what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious
standards. now this can have several different meanings , and you know
it. one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who
are religious are defined as jews . another is to say that only those
who meet the religious definition of a jew is one. and there are
others. i'm not twisting your words. i'm trying to make you aware that
your words do n't mean what you think they do.

i had never heard the definition only those who are religious are defined as jews.
i had always seen the definition a person is a jew is his her mother is was
a jew , and if such person does not convert , although i had seen people
argue about the last part.


i am not talking about the debate. i am talking about how things are right
now. when the debate is over , i 'll see what happens.
right now , things are like they are.
let me ask you one thing. i understand that israel differenciates between
citizenship and nationality. suppose m(ale) and f(emale) have a child in
israel. which nationality will the child 's id show , according to each one
of the following cases

actually , it does n't. and the citizens' rights are exactly the same in
both cases , anyway.

so , there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel \?
or what do you mean by actually , it does n't \?


a) f and m are both jewish.

jewish

b) f is jewsh and m is not.

jewish

c) f is muslim and m is jewish.
d) f is christian and m is jewish.

it 'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house. the original
law of return would still admit such a person if they were jewish , if
memory serves.

so , it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. that is what
i call a form of racism.


i do not know why you are so touchy. i never said that you did not support
palestinian self determination. i just gave an example of hypocrisy.

no you did n't. you had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees
in order to do so , and everyone else knows it. i'm not being touchy.

you do not need to assume the representation of everybody else to
make your points. you should assume that you are just talking for yourself.
about the other stuff , i still believe that the example was a valid one.
it would be a hypocrisy to say that one supports nationalism for all and
then support zionism and then disregard the palestinian 's right.


i never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it. it was just an example. nothing
more , nothing less than that. why did you have to clarify what you think \?

because what you gave was not an example. it was an example of how
the definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees.

it was an example. you are trying to justify something nobody has
talked about.


first , you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
the dictionary.

oh , so now what are dictionaries for \?

reference.



it 's not nonsense. when people read what you write , they have to try to
associate a meaning to those words. dictionaries give the meanings of
words , do n't they \?

yes , but not all of them. a language is something that evolves all the time.


it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
others. sad.

not at all. what i cannot abide is utter bombast when you 've been
proven completely wrong.

not really. i posted in another post the definition of zionism. and , in
this post you have showed for me what i was telling you from the
begining. zionism is a form of racism , even if most zionists are not
racist in their individual and private lifes. a movement that ask
for a state and national rights for a people , and then in practice ,
that people are defined according to religion is , for me , racist like.



i never put even one syllable in your mouth. you have tried to prove
this and you failed.

you did it. next time be more careful.

ha ! there 's nothing resembling fact in what you 've said. i never added
anything to what you said.

do you know the difference between opinion and fact \?

it was five years ago that karabakh voted overwhelmingly to seperate
from azerbaijan , why is the un not enforcing their will \?

is that how the mind of a compulsive liar works \? the scenario and
genocide staged by the armenians 78 years ago in x soviet armenia
is being reenacted again this time in azerbaijan. there are remarkable
similarities between the plots , the perpetrators , and the underdogs.

the stories of survivors of karabag massacre

69 year old hatin nine telling

''my twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. they told
me we wo n't kill you. but the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old huseyin ibrahimoglu

''our turkish village in khojalu town was blown up in two hours.
while killing children and babies mercilessly they said you are
turks , you must die.''

28 year old gulsum huseyin

''they bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
my eyes.''

are these stories lies \? have the eye witnesses been day dreaming \?
were these stories forged by turkish journalists in the region \?

the nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of british
journalists , too. two days before we had quoted from a sunday times
article. they british reported the events in karabag even before
turkish journalists. what is more here are the pictures. pictures
of people who were bayonetted , whose eyes were gouged , ears cut off.

even the armenian radio could n't claim these lies. they are saying
exaggeration. that means ' 'somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. perhaps that village of khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours , instead of 2... or gulsum huseyin 's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

the massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. the effects of
this massacre on karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

some of the western press' , led by some french newspapers , ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

yesterday we gave samples from le figaro. until yesterday 's print
no news about the real events in karabag were printed. so were the
french tv channels.. the subject they considered related to karabag
was ''the necessity of protecting armenians against azeri attacks.''

the age we are living in is termed a human rights age. there are lots
of organizations such as united nations and csce(conference on security
and cooperation in europe) , and rules , all designed to fight against human
rights violations. international reactions must be made with international
cooperation. with support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty \? where
is the cooperation \? where are the reactions \? and the intellectuals ,
journalists , writers , tv stations of certain western countries such
as france who are fast to claim leadership of human rights \?
where are you \?

13th ss divison , made primerily of bosnian muslim volunteers , did
quite a job in the former yugoslavia during wwii. these folks are now
in their 60 's 70 's. makes me wonder how many of them occupy positions

that is the result of watching anti muslim 'sdpa' nazis crooks idiots
too much. still covering up the crimes of your fascist armenian grandparents
and nazi armenian parents \? not a chance. as early as 1934 , k. s. papazian
asserted in 'patriotism perverted' that the armenians

'lean toward fascism and hitlerism.' 1

at that time , he could not have foreseen that the armenians would
actively assume a pro german stance and even collaborate in world
war ii. his book was dealing with the armenian genocide of the muslim
population of eastern anatolia. however , extreme rightwing ideological
tendencies could be observed within the dashnagtzoutune long before
the outbreak of the second world war.

in 1936 , for example , o. zarmooni of the 'tzeghagrons' was quoted
in the 'hairenik weekly '

the race is force it is treasure. if we follow history we shall
see that races , due to their innate force , have created the nations
and these have been secure only insofar as they have reverted to
the race after becoming a nation. today germany and italy are
strong because as nations they live and breath in terms of race.
on the other hand , russia is comparatively weak because she is
bereft of social sanctities. 2

1934) , preface.
2 'hairenik weekly , ' friday , april 10 , 1936 , 'the race is our
refuge' by o. zarmooni.

in april 1942 , hitler was preparing for the invasion of the caucasus.
a number of nazi armenian leaders began submitting plans to german
officials in spring and summer 1942. one of them was souren begzadian
paikhar , son of a former ambassador of the armenian republic in baku.
paikhar wrote a letter to hitler , asking for german support to his
armenian national socialist movement hossank and suggesting the
creation of an armenian ss formation in order

to educate the youth of liberated armenia according to the
spirit of the nazi ideas.

he wanted to unite the armenians of the already occupied territories
of the ussr in his movement and with them conquer historic turkish
homeland. paikhar was confined to serving the nazis in goebbels
propaganda ministry as a speaker for armenian and french language
radio broadcastings. 1 the armenian language broadcastings were
produced by yet another nazi armenian viguen chanth. 2

jahre deutsch armenische beziehungen , ' (heinz holzberg

the establishment of armenian units in the german army was favored
by general dro (the butcher). he played an important role in the
establishment of the armenian 'legions' without assuming any
official position. his views were represented by his men in the
respective organs. an interesting meeting took place between dro
and reichsfuehrer ss heinrich himmler toward the end of 1942.
dro discussed matters of collaboration with himmler and after
a long conversation , asked if he could visit pow camp close to
berlin. himmler provided dro with his private car. 1

a minor problem was that some of the soviet nationals were not
'aryans' but 'subhumans' according to the official nazi philosophy.
as such , they were subject to german racism. however , armenians
were the least threatened and indeed most privileged. in august
1933 , armenians had been recognized as aryans by the bureau of
racial investigation in the ministry for domestic affairs.

condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans

he went on to say that the reason for that is out right religious
bigotry

actually , this strife in yugoslavia goes back a long way. bosinan
muslims ,
in collaboration with the nazis , did to serbians after the first world
war what serbs are doing to muslims now.

this kind of racialist generalization is utterly inappropriate. some
bosnian muslims cooperated with the nazis in world war 2. other bosnian
muslims risked their lifes to hide jews from the nazis and ustashe , and
those jews who survived the war remember that. in fact the jewish leader
in sarajevo has remained there saying he wants to repay the debt to the
bosnian muslims that saved so many jewish lives in ww2.

similarly , some serbs are doing to muslims now. this is a group of
serial killers , rapists , and thieves who have control of the vast
yugoslav army arsenal. many other serbs oppose these atrocities. as one
of serbian heritage who condemns emphatically the genocide being carried
out against muslims by both hvo and mladic forces , i condemn your
generalization about bosnian muslims and about serbs.


this is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred , destruction , ...

every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and
destruction. the holocaust was not a fresh case. it was another
chapter in a 900 year history of attacks on jews in europe. that did n't
make it acceptable. and balkan history does not make the genocide against
bosnian muslims acceptable.

not taking sides in this
perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry.

standing by and allowing well armed criminals to slaughter bosnian muslim
civilians , while enforcing an arms embargo against the bosnian muslims is
not only religious bigotry it is direct complicity in mass murder.


it could just
be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does
not even know the meaning of the word.

you tell us a region on earth that does have a long history of war. nato
is the largest military police force in the world. it was not
helpless. it could have stopped the carnage a year ago.

showing they were christians , someone made the (correct) remark that
lenin 's maternal grandfather was a jew who converted to christianity.

to counter the fact that stalin was a christian who , during his youth ,
was trained to be a priest , mr. salah wrote yes , it says he was trained
to be a priest , but not for what religion ! (btw , stalin developed
strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).

mr. salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against jews by posting

for such a statement.

what a dope ! there is no value for mohammed elabdellaoui to be here
at a western university. third worldist and islamic brain rot has
made it impossible for him to acquire and analyze facts appropriately.

the history of the efforts of the mufti of jerusalem to serve the
nazis in the south balkans and set up muslim ss divisions is
well documented. in general , nazism and the leader principle
resonated well among muslim peoples. khomeini 's concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance. in fact , totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation islam.

to be fair , the mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
muslims to join the ss. but the rather small muslim ss unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size. there were
also muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of muslim leaders to entice muslim people to serve the nazi cause
actively. and the turkish government ignored practically all nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the nazis against the soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.

last time i heard , the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies. and if your statment
were true , do n't you think israel would of used it to point to what a muslim
neighbor (palestine) could do to them if they allowed it to be \? the jewish
lobby and power is very strong , and if what you said is true , we would of

sarajevo , bosnia herzegovina in this land of historic hatreds , a tiny
jewish community is braving serbian shells to repay a 50 year old debt to
muslims who saved jews from the holocaust.

ivica ceresnjes , president of the jewish community of sarajevo , says he
and about 1 , 000 other jews chose to remain in sarajevo , rather than leave
for israel , to keep a feeding center in the medieval old town district
running.

ceresnjes said that was partly in gratitude to the muslims who hid jews during
the nazi occupation and partly to keep intact the centuries old presence of
jews living in sarajevo.

``some with guns are defending bosnia , but i fight in bosnia by keeping
people alive , '' ceresnjes said.

as a student of balkan history , ceresnjes said he saw this war coming and
had ready plans to evacuate children and the elderly. a year before the war
erupted here last april , ceresnjes said the jewish center began
stockpiling supplies , ensuring everyone had passports and arranging for
places in israel and europe for the evacuees.

they were so well prepared , he said , that only five days after the
shooting began the first plane left. of about 2 , 000 jews in bosnia
herzegovina , he estimates half have left. many of those who stayed behind
work in sarajevo 's downtown synagogue , which has been turned into a
wartime feeding center that has so far given away 380 , 000 meals.

the center , which has been shelled several times along with most of
sarajevo , also runs a radio station , mail center and distributes food
packages sent by jewish organizations around the world.

while muslims and jews are fighting each other in the mideast , jews here
say there 's a long tradition of cooperation , inter marriage and
tolerance between the two communities in sarajevo that goes back to
centuries of turkish occupation.

sarajevo 's jews trace their ancestry back to their expulsion from roman
catholic spain in 1492. the community numbered more than 14 , 000 before
world war ii. but only 10 survived the holocaust which was carried out
by the pro nazi croatian ustache in yugoslavia. many of the survivors were
hidden by muslim families in mostar.

please , do n't be offended at this question who are the muslims in the
bosnian context \?

bosnian muslims are citizens od bosnia herzegovina who identify themselves
with bosnian muslim cultural and religious tradition.

i know that a moslem muslim is a believer in islam. islam
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. but it is not
, yes definitely not , an ethinic group. ok ! so , these bosnian muslims , who
are they \? to which ethnic group do they belong \? what language(s) do they
speak \? do they have a different language from that of the serbs or croats \?

in bosnia , muslim is not merely a religious category , but an ethnic
one as well. actually , here are the two contradictory arguments
made by people on this subject

(1) there is only serbian and croatian nationality , and bosnian muslims
are simply croats and serbs of islamic faith.

(2) bosnian muslims are a separate nationality since they do not feel
themselves to be croats nor serbs.

in 1968 , argument (2) was accepted by former yugoslavia as valid ,
and (1) was soundly rejected. the reasons are pragmatic even if
bosnian muslims are croats and serbs who converted to islam under
turkish rule centuries ago , none of the present generation has any
clue what was their ancestor 's actual nationality. in fact , although
bosnian muslims have felt drawn to croatian or serbian national
allegiance , most of them feel they have a separate cultural and
historic identity. so , arguments like yes , but your ancestors were
croats or serbs carry very little weight. regardless of what
their ancestors might have been , as long as bosnian muslims feel
that they are a separate national group , that ends the debate.
what outsiders say is simply not relevant.

the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this bosnian debacle has
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim moslem i knew from childhood was
changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended !

in the case of former yugoslavia , the date is 1971 , when muslim nationality
appeared as a census category for the first time. this was the result
of a sequence of decisions over the past decade , from recognizing
bosniaks as an ethnic group (1961) to february 1968 resolution (in b h)
declaring that muslims are a separate nation , to formal endorsement
of this in january 1969 , and eventually to the 1971 inclusion of
muslim nationality choice in census forms.

for comparison , in 1948 census there were three national categories
available to muslims in bosnia herzegovina

serb muslims 71 , 991
croat muslims 25 , 295
muslims , ethnically undeclared 788 , 403

this clearly demonstrates that muslims feel themselves to be their own
nationality. only a tiny minority felt able to choose serb or croat
nationality. census results show that bosnian muslims have
consistently opted for a third category in 1948 they chose undeclared ,
in 1953 they chose yugoslavs , in 1961 both yugoslavs and bosniak
ethnic group , and in 1971 , 1981 and 1991 they chose muslim nationality .

perhaps the term bosnian muslim nationality is too confusing for
the rest of the world. but , in the present context , we are talking
about muslims as nationality not as a religous group within some
separate national identity. the reasons are mostly historical and
cultural. religion plays a smaller role , as a part of culture in general ,
because the area is simply not known for religious fanaticism. political
fanaticism , yes religious fanaticism , no. group security and survival
dominate people 's thinking not fine points of theology. in fact ,
bosnia herzegovina is as well known for religious tolerance in peacetime
as it is known for terrible carnage in wartime.

sincerely ,
josip

objections to a particular policy while feeling that there is no
alternative choice .

sealing off the gaza strip has the interesting side effect of
demonstrating the non viability of gaza as an independent state.
where are all of these people going to go to find work if they are
separated from israel \? if they complain about having to show id cards
on the way to work , how will they feel about showing passports on the
way to work \?

throughout the years of the israel arab palestinian conflict , the internal
palestinian popultation has found itself essentially relegated to the
lower tiers of the economy. given the major kinds of positions required
by the israeli and the palestinian economy , there are essentially two
different ones existing side by side are n't holding down many of the
skilled positions. so , when gaza has to operate on its own , there are
few residents trained to fill the need for middle and upper management.

for such a statement.

what a dope ! there is no value for mohammed elabdellaoui to be here

and is there a reason or value for such a brainless shit for brains asshole
to be haer. you are a self hating bastard. neither your name nor your
ideas , which i 've come across before and thought were too stupid and
uncivlized to respond to , prove your first worldist claim and civility.


the history of the efforts of the mufti of jerusalem to serve the
nazis in the south balkans and set up muslim ss divisions is
well documented. in general , nazism and the leader principle
resonated well among muslim peoples. khomeini 's concept of the faqih
is a recent example of such resonance. in fact , totalitarianism is
etymologically a reasonable translation islam.

to be fair , the mufti did not succeed in getting large numbers of
muslims to join the ss. but the rather small muslim ss unit did
manage to commit attrocities disproportionate to it size. there were
also muslim people who were less than enthusiastic about the attempt
of muslim leaders to entice muslim people to serve the nazi cause
actively. and the turkish government ignored practically all nazi
overtures even though an alliance with the nazis against the soviet
government would have made a great deal of tactical sense.

give me sources to read it or shut up. you think i will take such an
ignorant as yourself on his words \? \?


last time i heard , the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies. and if your statment
were true , do n't you think israel would of used it to point to what a muslim
neighbor (palestine) could do to them if they allowed it to be \? the jewish
lobby and power is very strong , and if what you said is true , we would of
heard it from them before you could come up with it.
and you dare say that you are taking no sides ! !

yes , the typical primitive muslim psychopathological psychotic
behavior upon hearing or reading a disagreeable fact start whining
about the jews. what a jerk.


there is nothing primitive about islam except in your mind. i do read and
live daily with disagreable facts , and i only ask them to prove themselves.
the last time i checked , this was truly a 1st worldist civilized approach to
facts and figures. i did not whine about the jews , i merely stated a fact
thet is strange to nobody. as far as me being jerk , fuck you. (sorry to

ethiopian jews and not quite jews

the israeli press has published items about ethiopian
jews waiting in camps in addis ababa for immigration to
israel , who are dying of starvation. the following are
excerpts from an interview with the former general
director of the jdc project for development and welfare
of ethiopian jews , kobi friedman (hadashot , 21 april
1993) , who has stated that there are people dying in
addis ababa , but they are converts to christianity

hadashor published the item about the dying jews after
viewing a video tape filmed last week in adis ababa.
how do you know that they are actually converts to
chritianity \?

if there are jews on the tape , then i do n't know what to
say. i am speaking from experience when i say that those
who remained in ethiopia are christians. i know that
there have previously been things published in the press
by interesting parties , and there is no connection
between them and reality.

what interested parties \?

ethiopian immigrants who want their christian relatives
to come here.

what to you recommend that ethiopian children in israel
do , when their parents and the rest of their relatives
remain in ethiopia \?

i ask if it is the job of the state of israel to bring in the
40 relatives who stayed in ethiopia. well , my answer is
that it is not. it would be a better solution , economically
as well , for that young man to buy a one way ticket to
ethiopia and reunite with his family there.

great , someone will be posting from 'protocols of the elders of zion' next

unlike the plo 's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets ,

at this time the plo did not exist and would not for the next 20 years.
you knew that did n't you \? perhaps you might want to add up all the jewish
civilians killed during the 48 war. i 'll opt for the massacre at deir yassin.
which do you think is the greater \?

in 1983 , however , eric silver of the guardian (britain)
interviewed a survivor , mophammed sammour , who testified that 116 out
of a population of 800 1000 were killed.

while we are talking about this man i have included more of his testimony
that harry naturally does not use nor does myths and facts. i wonder why.
no doubt he was lying right harry \?

the reason was mainly economic. that is
to capture booty in order to maintain
the bases which we had then established
with very poor resources. the main idea ,
despite this , remained the conquest of
the village by force of arms , something
which was then unknown in the country ,
and became a turning point in jewish
military operations

yehuda lapidot , jabontinsky archives testimony

apart from the military discussion , the
lehi put forward a proposal to liqui
date the residents of the village after
the conquest , in order to show the arabs
what happens when the izl and the lehi
set out together on an operation , and for
another main reason it would cause a
great uproar throughout the land and
would be an important turning point in
the course of the battles. the clear aim
was to break the arab morale and raise
somewhat the morale of the jewish commu
nity in jerusalem , which had been hit
hard time after time , especially recenctly
by the desecration of jewish bodies which
fell into arab hands

yehuda lapidot , jabotinsky archives
testimony as quoted by yisrael segal in
the deir yassin file , published by
koteret rashit 19th january 1983

so it was n't like the holocaust more like lidice a warning , a punishment.
collective and inflicted on unarmed innocents just not as through.

when it comes to prisoners , old people
and children , there were differences
of opinion , but the majority was for
liquidation of all the men in the village
and any other force that opposed us ,
whether it be old people , women or children

benzion cohen
commander of the attack on deir yassin ,
(j.a.t.)

let me put in some words here
a. premeditated
b. murder
what do you say about the eyewitness testimony of the man in command \?

we had prisoners and before the retreat
we decided to liquidate them. we also
liquidated the wounded , as anyway we could
not give them first aid. in one place
about eighty arab prisoners were killed
after some of them had opened fire and
killed one of the people who came to give
them first aid. arabs who dressed up
as arab women were also found , and so
they started to shoot the women also who
did not hurry to the area where the
prisoners were concentrated

(j.a.t.)

shooting prisoners , the wounded , as a warning to hurry \? sounds very
familiar to me , how about you \? heard of other people other places doing
these things \?

in one case the zahran family only
one out of twenty five survived. in
another house they caught the sixteen
year old son fuad. his mother was holding
him. they killed him with a knife. the
mother spent twenty years after that in
a mental hospital. a young woman and her
two year old baby were shot in the
street. their bodies were left there.
they moved to the centre of the village
and started to kill everybody they saw or
heard , as soon as anybody opened his
door. they were using bombs grenades ,
machine guns , submachine guns. my cousin
escaped with bullet holes in his clothes.
one of the officers put his machinegun
through a window and started shooting
outwards , killing everybody who moved.
they killed my uncle , ali hassan zeidan ,
and my aunt fatima. she heard him call
'help me'. she ran to him and they killed
her. another neighbour haj yarah ,
heard some voices and came out. they killed
him too. his son muhammad , who was
about seventeen , heard his father call
him and went to the same place. they
killed him. his mother heard her son cry
for help. she ran out and they killed
her. that was near my house. i saw this

muhammad arif sammour

funny how 'myths and facts' does not see fit to include this too after all
if he is reliable enough to report casualties why not the actual events \? what
do you say about this harry \?

in the exchange that followed four men
were killed and a dozen were wounded..
..by noon time the battle was over and
the shooting had ceased. although there
was a calm , the village had not yet surrendered.
the irgun and lehi men came
out of hiding and began to 'clean' the houses.
they shot whoever they saw , women
and children included , the commanders did
not try and stop the massacre...i
pleaded with the commander to order his
men to cease fire , but to no avail. in
the meantime twenty five arabs had been
loaded on a truck and driven through
mahane yehuda and zichron yosef. at the
end of the drive , they were taken to
the quarry bvetween deir yassin and givat
shaul , and murdered in cold blood

there are arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what

first of all , the arab standing in any party , or as any party , is solely
dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively.

it is not a question of an individuals standing. when a party puts up an
arab for a cabinet post and that arab is rejected but the position is given
to a jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.
would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with labour
coalitions \?

in the past , they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming
a single bloc in the knesset. on the few occasions when this was done ,
some of the parties took stands that were extremist , and ineffect precluded
themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet.

not their party them as individuals . even when they belong to nice
peaceful zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. it
sure looks like racism to me.

arabs are excluded from cabinet , even when they do the things you
suggest , because they are arabs. unless of course you have a better
reason \? i am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist jew
is less of a security risk than a leftist arab from the same party.

who are travelling friday night to participate there. contact the local islamic center

the declaratio of independence of 1776 was written by thomas jefferson.

gaza city , israeli occupied gaza strip (upi) palestinian gunmen
sunday shot and killed two israelis who entered gaza to buy cheap
produce , and two arabs who were assisting them.
elsewhere in the crowded strip , israeli troops killed a 18 month old
infant and a 12 year old boy during rock throwing clashes at two refugee
camps.
can anybody guess this from the title \?

not me , i thought that a clash between israelis and arabs resulted
in four deaths on one side and two on the other.

the drive by shooting outside the jewish settlement of gadid in
southern gaza prompted prime minister yitzhak rabin to warn israelis
they were ``endangering their lives'' by doing illegal business in the
occupied territories.

how about being illegally settled there \?
i am not sure about the signals the israelis are sending , one day
they are willing to accept a jordan west bank federation , the other
they do not recognize the west bank as occupied territory (neither
did the u.s , the honest brocker )
(details of the killings omitted , plo , hamas graffiti both claim responsability)

the israelis had entered gaza in a car driven by the man from hebron ,

now do n't tell me that this could not be an israeli spy.
we will know later.

which carried the easily identified blue license plates of arab vehicles
in the west bank. when israelis enter gaza with their own cars , which
carry yellow plates , they are usually stoned and burned by angry

palestinian residents.
now the upi shows its ugly face once and for all.

it happened once this year , once last year. out of possibly thousands
or more. man how low can you get.

tell you something that is at least as close to the truth as the above
babies children who venture outside their homes are usually shot and killed
by the israeli soldiers.
....
army officials said the joint operation by members of the plo tied
fatah hawks and the hamas connected kassem brigade , arose from their
anger at the army 's killing of six fugitives from each group over the
past month.
the groups sprayed graffiti on walls in khan yunis , calling the
attack ``an act of revenge'' for the killing of their comrades.

how to help palestinian education

(from 'educational network' , no. 11 , april 1993 ,
publ. by ramallah friends schools , p.o.box 66 ,
ramallah , west bank , via israel
tel. 972 2 956230 , fax. 972 2 956231)

many of our readers have written to us asking how
individuals and organizations can help palestinian
education. we have compiled a list of suggestions to guide
you. if you are interested in pursuing one or more of
these suggested activities , the educational network can
aid you by coordinating the initial contacts , following
up , and providing any other support you may need.

1. link your teachers' union with a teachers' union here
linkage should be based on a shared pedagogical
enterprise.

2. get your union to actively support the right of
palestinian teachers in the occupied territories to form
unions

a. through the international labor organization (if your
union is a member)
b. contacting other international unions which have
supported our right to form a union we can supply
names and addresses.

3. establish a scholarship fund for one or more
palestinian students to study at a palestinian university
or school or establish a scholarship fund for a
palestinian student or teacher to study at a university
abroad.

4. reproduce and publish information about palestinian
education

a. for your union membership
b. for the outside community.

the educational network can supply up to date
information and statistics.

5. send delegations of teachers to visit the occupied
territories during periods when our schools are in
session.

the network can arrange an itinerary , make hotel and
local travel arrangements , and provide a guide for the
visit.

6. sponsor palestinian teachers to visit your city for an
educational tour

a. to see schools and speak with educators in order to
learn about progressive pedagogical ideas and
experiences

b. to speak about the conditions of palestinian
education.

the network will coordinate from palestine.

7. establish teacher exchange programs for one year in
which a palestinian teacher from a private school teaches
at a public or private school abroad while a teacher from
that school spends a year in a palestinian private school.

8. send an experienced educator to the occupied
territories to give workshops (all day workshops or two
day workshops) on innovative teaching techniques.

the network will pay for the person 's food , lodging , and
travel while in palestine , and will serve as guide.

9. set up a pen pal program with a palestinian school in
either english or french.

10. set up a sister school program with a palestinian
school which would actively involve teachers as well as
students at both schools a great tool for building
international understanding and mutual sensitivity.

11. keep the educational network informed about
important educational conferences so that we can send a
palestinian teacher to attend.

12. send to the educational network articles or other
writings or books dealing with innovative approaches and
ideas in the field of education so that we can then
disseminate the information locally.

13. support an educational development project in the
occupied territories.

i 've read most of the history books dealing with this period ,
good and bad , and while it is possible that i missed one or two ,
none of those i 've read documents any razing of mosques. so i
think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation.

jake disrespectfully demands , and adam requires specific documentation
of the razing of mosques in jerusalem. if either of them had been
reading t.p.m for a while , they would already have seen such
documentation. for the forgetful or newcomers , however , here are the
references.

thanks for posting the references. i do not normally read t.p.m. ,
and i posted my request for references because jim 's article
was cross posted to soc.culture.jewish. allegations of jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture , and
rumors of church and host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel. the stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.
if such a claim is cross posted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before , such as s.c.j , a reference should be
given the first time it appears. now that the claim has been
documented , i regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful. especially so because the official who failed to
provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted jordanians
was probably jewish , and as a jew i know that he should have
known better.

so how would have you defended saudi arabia and rolled
back the iraqi invasion , were you in charge of saudi arabia \? \? \?

all muslims knew that the whole thing was set up to destroy iraq , not
to liberate kuwait , the people who were killed by the invasion are
more (many many more) , than the ones that were killed by the iraqis
in their smaller invasion. i lived in the west , and i have seen how
your media prepared you (helpless naive americans) for a war against
iraq even before the artificial conflict between iraq and kuwait that
led to the invasion , as the cia correctly predicted (and pretended to
be surprised not to know).
it just happened that saddam was so predictible and so arrogant and stupid.

what would i have done most muslims would choose 300 dead kuwaitis over
200 , 000 dead iraqis and 1000 dead kuwaitis. the first case would happen
if no western intervention happened , and the second case was a direct
or indirect result of western envolvement.

human rights in kuwait \? what about human rights in iraq \? why the west
gave saddam a green light to slaughter his own people \? i will give my
reason because the rich kuwaitis do not mind to be your salves , so
they deserve some democracy , but iraqis might not , so they do n't.

as simple as that , whether or not you want to admit it.

i think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an
official religion (de facto or de jure) , because with human nature
like it is , the ambitious and not the pious will always be the
ones who rise to power. there are just too many people in this
world (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a
leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.

not necessarily the best solution , my view of an islamic state (and
that of turabi that your media made you hate) includes all the benefits
of a secular state minus the injustices. did you ever read a book by
rashid al ghannoushi (tunisia) , hassan turabi (sudan) \? you only know
about them from your self censured , self controlled media.

if they make this kind of campaign against such a moderate thinker as
turabi is , and keep quite about such an extremist muslim scholar as bin
bez of saudi arabia is , it just does not encourage any moderation in
our arab world.

you make it sound like these guys are angels , ilyess. (in your
clarinet posting you edited out some stuff was it the following \? \? \? )

no it was not that , it was just some irrelevent stuff that i took out
to go around the copyright ( ))

i ceased to take the newyork times seriously. in issues concerning islam
it has become one of the biggest enemies (although less than the other
newyork daily since mortimer took it over). it lies , selects facts that
fits its agenda and even prints racist and open anti muslim editorials.

what they claimed in that articles is a bunch of lies because while
the selected facts are true about some of those persons , the other members
are actually defence lawyers and university science professors who wanted
to fight corruption , uncover atrocities against opposition activists and
shia minority , and generally increase awareness about the rights of all
citizens. the only thing that is common between those people is their concern
for the deterioration of human rights since the saudi clan took a green
light from america (after the gulf) to do whatever is necessary to stay
in power.


do you know that all of the saudi ulema have been taught the same things \?
the ones in the official iftaa are as conservative as the ones that are
opposing it. some of the members of the human rights committe are more
pro women and wanted to defend them , and that is precisely one reason that
bin bez 's fatwah implied for the illegality of this committee
and for his claim that it represents outside interests

there is a human rights issue in saudi arabia , and you and ny times chose
to ignore the main issue and select some of the members of that committee
and actually defend the actions done against them (including banning them
from their jobs.

what a hypocricy. i am not surprised really , this is not the first time.

the official ulema are the most extremist anti women meat heads in saudi
arabia , the west continues on its campaign to discredit itself in the
muslim community , by supporting them. well after bosnia , i guess it has
zero credibility to begin with , so what the heck.

idha lam tastahi faf'aal ma shi'it (if you feel no shame , then do whatever
you want , hadith).
(actually a better translation of the meaning would be if you do not
feel ashamed (from god) , you will do whatever you want)

yedi'ot ahronot , april 9 , 1993. excerpt.

each one and his own nevo

( a reference to general azri'el nevo , shamir 's military secretary.
irrelevant to this excerpt.)

by nahum barne'a

. . .

in mid '91 shabak found itself in the center of another storm ... .
a year and a half earlier , khaled sheikh ali , 27 , a member of the
islamic jihad , died at the shabak installation in gaza prison. the
two shabak interrogators who were responsible for his death were put
on trial. in september '91 the supreme court rejected their appeal and
sentenced them to 6 months in prison. as far as is known , this was
the first time in israel 's history that shabak operatives were sent to
prison. the supreme court unanimously rejected the warning by the
director of shabak that the sentence will be detrimental the
effectiveness of other interrogators. ... the judges in the case
were ... barak , goldberg , and matza.

when they realized that they were on their own , the interrogators
agreed to talk. deputy state attorney rachel sukkar sp \? was placed
in charge of investigating the affair. she ... questioned the
directors of all shabak divisions. she investigated only the matter
of the death in gaza prison. she discovered that not only torture ,
but also the culture of lies , which judge landau had described in
his report of two years before , were still very much in existence.
nothing had changed.

the report was classified and was seen by only some ten people , among
them the prime minister , the people at the top of the judicial system
and judge landau. the director of shabak claimed that he did not
know. after all , they were dealing only with a single jail and with
low ranking people. the system bit the bullet and accepted the
explanation. one of shabak 's high ranking officials was transfered
from his very high position to a less high position.

. . .

the culture of lies referred to above is the shabak interrogators'
policy of lying in court when denying detainees claims that they were
tortured in the course of interrogation. the landau commission sought
to correct this problem by legalizing a list of torture methods
thus eliminating the fear that a detainee might be released if those
methods were used to extract a confession. the fact that the need to
lie still persists would seem to indicate that shabak is not sticking
to the approved torture methods. yigal

and , this is precisely why israeli society has been tremendously harmed
by the actions it (its government) has felt it had to take in response
to an other perceived as a threat. just as with you , there has long
been a strident and emotional debate about the pain israelis feel when

rtw 12 23 0859 gulf arabs demand iran withdrawal from islands

(eds updates with end of summit details , quotes)
by youssef azmeh
abu dhabi , dec 23 , reuter gulf arab states , emerging from a summit
that restored
their unity after almost three months of crisis , piled pressure on iran
on wednesday to
reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic gulf island.
they issued a statement after a three day gulf cooperation council
summit saying iran
had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding
measures that rocked
gulf stability and security.
the leaders avoided the anti iranian rhetoric of recent statements
by egypt , which
engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between saudi arabia
and qatar that
allowed all members to attend the summit.
egypt said its fears about iranian intentions in the region and
tehran 's alleged
encouragement of moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind
president hosni
mubarak 's mediation.
the gcc statement stressed that developing relations between the
gulf arab states and
iran is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures iran might take
in line with its
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and
territorial integrity of the region 's states.
it denounced iran 's measures on the island of abu musa , which it
shares with the
united arab emirates , and the continued occupation of the greater and
lesser tumbs
islands.
iran earlier this year extended its control over abu musa beyond a
small garrison it
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the uae emirate of sharjah.
it has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the
uae government. but diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority
over the whole
island , which the uae sess as as virtual annexation.
the tumbs were occupied by the former shah of iran in 1971 and the
uae has since the
abu musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general
settlement.
the gcc leaders called on the u.n. to maintain sanctions against
iraq for not fully
implementing security council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of
kuwait.
they endorsed once again the damascus declaration , a pact signed
with egypt and
syria after their troops took part in the u.s. led alliance that drove
iraqi troops out of
kuwait.
but delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a
fund they
announced they would create at their last summit in kuwait last year
which would have
helped egypt 's and syria 's economic development programme.
they said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of
contributions from each state
although the total amount had been scaled down to 6 billion from the
10 billion agreed
last year.
the fact that the leaders of all gcc states saudi arabia ,
bahrain , kuwait , oman and
qatar attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although
their unity was only
maintained with outside help.
most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow
progress of the
conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the
region that boasts
the bulk of global oil and gas reserves.
the leaders were unable to choose between two proposals.
one put forward by a summit committee headed by oman 's sultan qaboos
to create a
100 , 000 man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member
against external
aggression , such as iraq 's invasion of kuwait.
another was a saudi supported plan to expand the existing 10 , 000 man
peninsula
shield force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is
commanded by a saudi
general.
little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market
although the summit
called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year 's summit due
to be held in
saudi arabia next december.

rtw 12 23 0835 gulf leaders end summit

abu dhabi , dec 23 , reuter gulf arab states ended a three day
annual summit on
wednesday with an appeal to iran to end its occupation of three
strategic gulf islands as
a condition for restoring friendly ties across the gulf.
a joint statement issued after the summit , marked by relief over the
settlement of a
row between two gulf cooperation council members , also called for
continued u.n. sanctions
against iraq.
it said baghdad had failed to implement key security council
decisions following the
expulsion of its troops from kuwait early last year.
the summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a gulf common
market , but called on
officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six
members to the next
summit which will be held in saudi arabia in december 1993.
the statement stressed that developing relations between the gulf
arab states and iran
is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures iran might take in
line with its
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and
territorial integrity of the region 's states.
it denounced iran 's measures on the island of abu musa , which it
shares with the
united arab emirates , and the continued occupation of the smaller
islands , the greater and
lesser tumbs.
it expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified
iranian measures
which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on
iran to rescind
those measures and end the occupation which it said was shaking peace
and stability in
the area.
iran earlier this year extended its control over abu musa beyond a
small garrison it
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the uae emirate of sharjah.
it has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the
uae government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces
continue to
exercise their authority over the whole island.
the uae has seen this as virtual annexation.
the tumbs were occupied by the former shah of iran in 1971 and the
uae has since the
abu musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general
settlement.

(eds updates with snsc statement)
nicosia , dec 26 , reuter iran told its gulf arab neighbours on
saturday it was ready
to defend militarily three disputed islands , reminding them of its
eight year war with
iraq.
our eight year defence (in the 1980 88 iran iraq war) has proved to
the world that
our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and
safeguard the
territorial integrity of iran , iran 's supreme national security council
(snsc) said.
a meeting of the heads of the six nation gulf cooperation council
voiced full support
on wednesday for the united arab emirates (uae) in its dispute with iran
over the gulf
islands of abu musa , greater tumb and lesser tumb.
the move has triggered strong iranian criticism and warnings.
besides the uae , the gcc
also groups bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar and saudi arabia.
iranian president akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who chaired the snsc 's
meeting on
saturday , said during his friday prayer sermon at tehran university
iran is surely
stronger than the likes of you. to reach these islands one has to cross
a sea of blood.
the snsc , quoted by the official iranian news agency irna received
in cyprus , also
criticised the gcc and described its support of the uae as irresponsible.
no country will ever be able to covet even an inch of iranian soil ,
said the snsc.
earlier on saturday , the english language tehran times , believed to
be close to the
foreign ministry , said the uae should be aware that iran 's
self restraint had certain
limits.
it dismissed a uae claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971
agreement to
share abu musa with the uae emirate of sharjah still applied.
the idea of abu dhabi officials that tehran would always refrain
from responding to
the blows inflicted by them was childish , tehran times said.
irna said the newspaper was commenting on the gcc statement which
urged iran to
reverse what it says is the annexation of abu musa island and to pull
out of the two other
islands.
iran says the islands near the entrance to the gulf have
historically belonged to it.
the dispute flared this year after iran tightened its control over abu musa.

rtw 12 28 1011 tehran paper wants iran revive claim to bahrain

tehran , dec 28 , reuter radical iranian newspapers , angered by gulf
arab claims to
three disputed islands , are hitting back with demands that tehran revive
its claim to
bahrain and consider improving ties with iraq.
president akbar hashemi rafsanjani and senior officials strongly
condemned a statement
last week by leaders of the gulf cooperation council (gcc) backing the
united arab
emirates (uae) in its dispute with iran over the gulf islands.
but the newspapers salam and jomhuri eslami demanded that tehran go
further than
restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of abu
musa , greater tumb
and lesser tumb.
it is not very clear why the sheikh of bahrain has joined the
others , jomhuri eslami
said. the gcc groups bahrain , kuwait , oman , qatar , saudi arabia and the uae.
if historical records are to be the criterion , the sheikh of
bahrain should go about
his own business and the rule of iranian people in bahrain , which
belonged to iran until
1970 , should be re established , the paper said.
it is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of
iran 's sovereignty
over bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the
separation of bahrain
from iran , it added.
the late shah of iran relinquished iran 's claim to bahrain in 1970 ,
a year before the
island became an independent state.
iranian leaders since the 1979 islamic revolution have carefully
avoided raising the
bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during
periods of
tension with conservative arab states across the gulf.
salam newspaper said the gcc stand showed that the policy of
appeasing pro western
gulf arab rulers had backfired.
no matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of
the persian gulf , it
is the united states and the west which speak the last word , it said.
they (the sheikhs) are nobody , salam said , adding that iran should
revise its policy
towards its neighbours , especially its former war enemy iraq.
disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with
iraq...and going along with
some saudi backed trends among the iraqi opposition have played a role
in the formation of
the current situation , the paper said.
ties between iran and iraq , which fought a war from 1980 to 1988 ,
improved briefly
after iraq invaded kuwait in 1990.
but tehran , which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the
ensuing war ,
again called for president saddam hussein 's overthrow when he suppressed
a shi'ite moslem
revolt which swept southern iraq after his 1991 defeat in kuwait.

islamabad (upi) representatives from 51 islamic nations were
considering tuesday a request from bosnia herzegovina for 260 million
and weapons to fight the bosnian serbs.
....
the only commitment so far is 20 million from saudi arabia , which

compare that to the liberation of q8 and to what they gave to some
weird causes.. o.k at least they are paying.

damned if you do and damned if you do n't !


has already donated 100 million to bosnia herzegovina.
sources on the political committee said delegates were in agreement
on the need to help the bosnian muslims , but the request for weapons had
delayed a decision.
``it may interpreted as violating the united nations' embargo on
supplying arms to bosnia , '' warned egyptian foreign minister amer
moussa.

mr. amr moussa was not worried about international law when he tortured
to death many of his citizens and when he shot people praying in a mosque ,
or when he is causing trouble to his neighbor just becasue the cia says so.
why does n't he just shut up , he wo n't be involved in any bosnian effort
anyway , or does the west have to be represented even in an islamic conference \?

just for the record , egyptian troops were one of the first to be
stationed there. i ca n't remember the exact date but it was late last
year. in fact , they lost at least one man there as far as i know.

when i was in jerusalem a couple of years ago , our guide told
us the story of that mosque not sure if it was true.

apparently , it was built by a jewish convert to islam. he had
had a dispute with his neighbours , and built the mosque davka to
annoy them. it 's a cute story , but not sure if it 's true...

if he gives you the same story explaining the presence of several
synagogues in the moslem quarter , then the story becomes suspect...

in reality , the old city was not as neighborhooded in the past as it
became after 1948. in pre israel jerusalem , there were many jews in
what is now called the moslem quarter. there are postal and telephone
directories from that time to prove it. it 's really rather
interesting to hear arabs there claim that a house or store has been
in the family for centuries even when there are clear photos and
documents that show a jewish owned business at the same location just
a few decades ago.

deposition of karine borisovna melkumian 1

born 1963
teacher
boarding school no. 1

resident at building 2b , apartment 21
block 41a
sumgait azerbaijan

this is my fate i had everything , we were a happy family , and now , at 25 ,
i 've become a widow , i'm left to raise my three children alone the third , not
yet two months old , was born in yerevan. igor and i had thought that if it was
a girl we would call her raisa , after my mother in law , and if it was a boy ,
we 'd call him arsen , after igor 's grandfather. i had a girl , and i , without
igor , named her raisa , in honor of her dead grandmother.

our family and the melkumians had been neighbors since 1965. igor and i grew
up together , we were friends from childhood on. we got engaged when i was 16.
in 1981 , when i was 18 , we were married. two children were born to us in
sumgait. my daughter is now 6 years old , her name is kristina , and my son ,
seryozha , is four and a half.

first i shall tell what happened on february 27. that day on my way home from
work i passed lenin square , where about 1 , 500 people had gathered. there were
komsomol members there , and pioneers children 's organization , and there were
both party members and non party people there as well. all of them were
shouting , there 's no room for christians here ! and when we finish with the
armenians , we 'll go after the russians ! and some even cried out , death to
the armenians ! absurd rumors had been circulating about town. i became
frightened. i came home , breathless , and told about everything i had seen
downtown. my family could n't believe it. my father in law sogomon markovich
melkumian , was n't home , he was at an azerbaijani wedding. by eight o'clock he
returned and had barely finished parking the car when his rear window was
smashed with a rock. he got out of the car but there was no one there. well i
was telling him everything , too , and he said , what , is there no longer any
government \? that same day igor said , papa , something terrible is happening
in the city. and he said , we 'll stay at home , no one will drive us from our
own home.

the day passed. on february 28 , that was sunday , we did n't go out. we called
our relatives and asked them all kinds of questions , and they all said the
same thing. sometime around evening they started smashing the car of an
armenian from the neighboring building. ira , my brother in law 's wife , and i
called the police they 're wrecking a car , help. we called and called , and
nonetheless they did n't come and they did n't do anything.

on february 29 , on monday , even though there were troops in the city , we were
afraid to go to work. i called the school i had the keys to the classroom. i
told the senior teacher that he should send someone for the keys , i would n't
be coming in. he agreed , and even said , fine , do n't come in , we understand
what 's going on in town , do n't come in.

before that , on the 28th , the ambartsumian family came over. they came to my
father in law and said , uncle sergey , they broke our windows , bad things are
happening in town. uncle misha ambartsumian even said , with my own eyes i
saw them chasing naked girls through the streets. i do n't know , he said , we
should leave town. well on the 29th we were already trying to decide where we
should go , thinking we 'd go to our dacha. we got a couple of bags together ,
clothes , food , the bare essentials. and then somewhere around 4 45 the
building manager came by and said , uncle sergey , the situation in town is
bad , do n't go out. my father even opened up to him and said , maybe we 'll
drive to the dacha , it 'll be safer there. no , he said , it 'll be worse
there , you 'll be safer at home. he said do n't be afraid , if something happens
i 'll send people to save you.

after he left about 15 minutes passed and about 200 people burst into our
courtyard. all of us were at home at the time igor and i and our two
children , ira and edik and their daughter , my sister in law ira , and my
mother and father in law. and the ambartsumian family , there were three of
them , uncle misha , zhasmen , and their daughter marina. now when they started
breaking down the door i remember edik and igor told us , go in that room
and close the door. close the door and calm the children so they wo n't hear
that there 's anyone home. the children started crying. suddenly ira , my
brother in law 's wife , suggested , let 's run out onto the balcony. we the
two daughters in law and the children , and zhasmen and marina raced out
onto the balcony. my sister in law and my mother in law ran in and said ,
quick , over to the other balcony , or they 'll kill you all. we lived on the
second floor. we needed to cross over from our balcony to our neighbor 's. at
first we could n't manage it. the balcony looked onto the street. at that time
people were coming home from work , and many just stood there , watching. i
pleaded and begged please , call someone , have someone come ! i even started
shouting. i 'll throw down the children , i 'll throw them down , you catch them
and take them somewhere , so at least the children will survive. either they
were afraid or . . . i do n't know what. they looked as though they were
watching a movie. some of them started throwing stones at us. i 'll say it
again , these were n't the bandits , these were people from the other part of the
building and from our entryway , they were just regular people , passersby. a
bus even stopped. i remember a man 's voice saying the armenians were climbing
over to the other balcony. ira , my sister in law , helped us get the children
over there. i was pregnant , about seven months pregnant. no , it was n't yet
seven , it was six and a half. i climbed over too. i think zhasmen went first
you know , i just do n't remember it all that well. zhasmen went first , i think ,
and edik 's wife ira and i had the children , and they were all screaming and
crying. my kristina said , mamma , do n't throw us over the balcony , we 're
afraid ! lilia was crying , and kristina and seryozha were crying too. kristina
did n't even want to climb over. she shouted , i'm staying with grandmother ,
i'm staying with grandma ! she loved her grandma , more than she loved me. and
my mother in law shouted , oh no , kristina 's still there , she 's still there ,
save kristina , too ! ira helped us climb over , with kristina coming last. ira
helped us and went back inside.

we started pounding on the neighbor 's balcony door. i pounded with my fist ,
sevil , open the door , open it , please ! she did n't open it. no , go away , go
anywhere , go , i'm not opening the door. she was our neighbor , we were
friends , we never refused her anything , ever ! and apparently she thought we
were going to break the windows , and she opened the door. she opened it and
said , karina , karina , go away , go anywhere , just do n't stay here , they 'll
kill us , too , because of you. i begged , please , at least take the children ,
we 'll leave , we 'll go back. no , she said , you have to leave. her sons ran
in , one had a knife. sevil 's brother , he 's around 18 , shouted at us get out
of here , leave , i 'll kill you with this knife ! i became terrified , i took the
children and went out in the entryway and went down a few stairs. i went down
and heard a loudspeaker. it was in the courtyard the armenians must be
killed , they 've taken all the best places , all the best apartments ! one of
them said , let the armenian blood flow , none of them should survive ! when i
heard that i went upstairs and started knocking on doors. no one opened their
door for me ! not on the third floor , or the fourth. i could n't see zhasmen any
longer. ira came upstairs later. i even thought that they had let her stay ,
that they would save her.

my head was spinning. they were killing my family , and here i was in the next
entryway with two children. seryozha was four , and kristina was five and a
half. they were crying , mamma , we 're scared ! they were so frightened that i
did n't even know how to calm them , should i try to calm them or myself \? it was
awful. but on the third floor a man did open his door. i asked , open up , let
me inside ! he opened the door slightly and said , no ! no and that was it !
he said it so sternly no ! i went up to the fifth floor. i pounded my fists
on the door with all my might. he opened up , the man of the house , and stood
there , looking at me. i was ready to get down on my knees. i almost did get
down on my knees. please , i beg of you , at least take the children. he
was n't an azerbaijani , he was a lezgin. i do n't even know how , but he let me
inside. and when i went in , zhasmen was already there. two minutes had n't
passed when ira and lilia came up the stairs. lilia was crying. he did n't want
to open the door. and again i started pleading , please , open the door , it 's
our ira and lilia ! open the door ! and he said , no , i'm afraid. i said again
and again , please , open the door , please ! he looked at me. he looked at me
for a long time and then opened the door after all. ira came in with lilia. we
threw ourselves into each other 's arms , crying. then the man locked us into
the bathroom. we sat there for a long time. through the door he told us , calm
the children , and calm yourselves down , too.

calm down \? this man was hiding us , but what of our family \? when i was still in
our apartment i had sensed that none of us would come out of this alive. i
said , igor , edik , let 's say farewell. and edik turned around and looked at
me as if to say , is that some kind of joke \? all the same i thought they would
kill all of us. igor looked at me , too . . . but it was already too late ! they
started pounding on the door , igor was standing next to the door. before that
he had told us , go lock yourselves in that room and sit tight. he thought we
were in the room. but before we went out onto the balcony we went to them
edik , igor , let 's say farewell. igor did n't think we could climb over to the
other balcony. and we did get over there , and i myself ca n't believe we were
able to save ourselves.

igor put on a helmet , and edik had his coat on , and he put on a fur hat. all
the men igor , edik , their father , and misha ambartsumian they all stood next
to the door. they thought they would pound on it a while and leave. but from
the other side of the door they ordered in azerbaijani open the door ! we
were all silent , waiting. someone outside the door said , they 're home ,
they 're in there , break down the door ! and i remember my father in law
whispering , they 're going to break it down now , it 's coming down now . . .

he had something in his hands , i think it was a knife if they got in , we were
going to defend ourselves. in the hall near the door there were two metal
chair legs. from outside the door they said , we 're counting to five , open
up ! but we were all quiet , we did n't answer them. we made like no one was
home. we figured they 'd leave , they 'd get tired and leave. my father in law
had said , it 's not possible they 'd come into my home. how can that be \?
everyone knows us , all of sumgait knows our family , we are on good terms with
everyone. and indeed a day did not pass that there was n't an azerbaijani
guest at our table. we had a nice dacha , everyone would get together there
often , azerbaijanis liked being with us there too. but now we had to save
ourselves , we had to flee from our own home. ira , i remember , said , i'm not
leaving here , my brothers and my parents are here , i'm going to fight
alongside them. that 's just what she said. she picked up a knife and said ,
if they open the door and come into the apartment then i'm going to fight
alongside my family , i'm not going anywhere.

we were at sevil 's when they broke into our apartment. we heard fighting and
shouting. the noise was terrible. and when we hid upstairs on the fifth floor
at the lezgin 's apartment , you could hear everything up there , too. even ira 's
voice. i remember her calling her mother several times. she called her for a
long time . . . i started pounding on the door in the bathroom open the
door , what are they doing to ira , who 's shouting , that 's ira shouting , that 's
her voice ! but the lezgin said , it 's nothing , calm down , no , it 's not in
your apartment. he was lying to me so i 'd calm down. two hours went by and
the lezgin opened the door and said , karina , igor got away , calm down. he ran
away. he saw igor break away and run off with his own eyes. they killed him
outside , next to the building.

while we were in the bathroom i experienced every possible human terror. the
way ira shouted ! she shouted , save me , mamma , save me ! . . . mamma , mamma !
she repeated it several times. there was a wild din. there were very many
people there , all of them shouting , all of them bellowing , howling ,
whistling you just ca n't imagine what was going on , what the roar was like.

apparently , after they had killed ira those murderers came into the entryway
where we were hiding and came upstairs , all the way up to the fifth floor. i
do n't know if they were just looking for any armenians or for us in
particular , but i think they were looking for us because when we had climbed
over the balconies someone on the street was saying that the daughters in law
were climbing over the balconies. and after we heard ira we heard them coming
up the stairs in the entryway and hammering on the doors. i thought those were
our last moments , and started saying good bye to my children , kissing them.
they were sleeping. i woke them up kristina ! seryozha , wake up ! and i tell
ira ira , if something happens , we 'll throw ourselves off the balcony. we
were on the fifth floor. apparently our lezgin neighbor had opened the door
too , because later he said , i opened the door and told them there were no
armenians inside. and after they all left our neighbor went out on the
balcony himself to see they were gone.

we were n't friends with those lezgin neighbors , we only knew each other from
the building. but the people we were friends with would n't even consider
hiding us.

the lezgin let us out of the bathroom. they had a candle burning. he said ,
karina , there 're no lights on in our block. the whole block was dark , the
whole block ! it 's a huge block , too. the lezgin said , i'm afraid to keep
you until morning , i'm afraid of the neighbors , they might kill me for saving
you. i said , what are you saying , we 'll leave now. but we ca n't just leave
with the children in the middle of the night. give us time to find somewhere
else to hide. he said , well ok , go look. i asked ira , ira , do you want to
go \? ira said , no , i 'll stay with the children , karina. i said , fine , then
i 'll go. zhasmen and i went downstairs together. it was very dark. no one
was in the courtyard. it was dark , pitch black. l was afraid to go out at
after seven , igor always met me after work and accompanied me home , i never
went out alone. and now here i was out in the middle of the night and after a
slaughter like that , too. it was probably after eleven. later i called the
boarding school and my director answered. he said , karina , where are you \? i
did n't know , i was calling from a public phone outside and did n't know where i
was. i got confused and hung up the receiver. from him i only found out what
time it was , i asked him , what time is it \? he said 11 20 , i think , but i
do n't really remember. so anyway zhasmen and i went out into the courtyard. i
look and see what appears to be a person not far from our apartment. and there
was the smell of something burnt. i became horrified. i looked at the corpse
for a long time. it was either ira or edik. i only saw one of them , zhasmen
grabbed my hand and squeezed it hurry up , let 's go . . . hurry up , come on ,
what are you turning around for \? i turned around and saw a large truck , it
must have belonged to the bandits , because they came to kill us in a truck
like that. we lived in the third entryway , and that truck was next to the
fourth. we walked quickly , holding hands. i thought , if i go to the police
then they 'll put me away. i could n't count on them. before i reached the
police station i saw a military vehicle. we went over and i said , soldier , in
block 41 , i do n't know if they 've killed people or injured them we need to
save them ! and he said , go to the police station and tell them everything.
i said , i'm afraid to go there , i'm afraid of them. he said , do n't be
afraid.

we went to the police and they wrote down the address , and the military
vehicle went to our building. i did n't go with them , they left me at the
police station. i gave the addresses of my mother and my brothers so that
they 'd rescue them , too. i did n't know where they were or what had happened to
them.

after a while they brought my children and ira and lilia. first they took us
to the kgb , that was at two or three in the morning. then around five they
took us to the city party committee , and there were very many people there ,
very many. i was pregnant and was wearing nothing but a dress. seryozha was
only wearing a shirt , and kristina had a little dress on. no coat , no boots ,
nothing ! and we sat there for three whole days in the city party committee.

the lezgin had told me that igor escaped. and i thought that he was probably
alive. but then after two and a half days , they took us , the armenians of
sumgait , to nasosny. on march 6 some people from the central committee came
and told us , karina , ira , we need you , come with us to the city party
committee. my mamma had come to nasosny , and she had been looking for me for
six days. mama , my brothers , and my uncle. we went to the city party committee
and waited there in the courtyard. i was wearing nothing but a dress , and ira
had only a dress on as well. there was a strong wind on march 6. an hour went
by. and then one of the functionaries told us , karina , ira , gather your
courage. would you like to go to the burial \? i said , what , did they really
kill all of them \? ! he said , let 's look. he had a long list , and he started
reading them off igor melkumian , my husband , eduard melkumian , my brother in
law , irina melkumian , my sister in law , sogomon melkumian , my father in law ,
and raisa melkumian , my mother in law. he read off all their names and said ,
get in the car , let 's go to the burial.

we buried our family. i could n't believe it at the time , i could n't conceive
of it or imagine it . . . and even now i think how shall i explain it to my
children when they 're older \?

my children were very attached to their father and their grandfather and
grandmother. kristina did n't love me the way she loved her grandfather and
grandmother , they spoiled her. kristina would always announce , my grandma is
better than anyone ! now , even though she is getting used to my mother , it 's
difficult for her , and once she told her you 're a bad grandmother.

i do n't know why , i asked her , kristina , where 's papa \? and she said , they
killed him. she knows , she understands it all. and recently i scolded
seryozha severely for something , and he started shouting at me , when papa
comes i'm going to tell him everything !

you appear to be referring to moshe dayan. how do you know that the
evicted jordanians were not provided with something else \? in fact ,
this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
not own but received compensation for their loss , anyways ! woe to
jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
by force (with ethnic cleansing of any remaining jews) is
disgusting and shameful .

does anyone have a reference to the claim that the arabs in the
moghrabi district were squatters \? i have n't seen this in the books
i have read. i have n't seen the opposite , either...

what is a shame is that in austria , daily reports of
the inhuman acts commited by israeli soldiers and the blessing
received from the government makes some of the holocaust guilt
go away. after all , look how the jews are treating other races
when they got power. it is unfortunate.


this can be turned around. the austrians who should feel guilty about
their actions during wwii , but do n't , justify their anti semetism by making
every israeli action into an atrocity. the austrians , germans and other
europeans have extensive trading relations with the arab block being
pro arab is good for business. i do n't think that ethics has a thing to
do about it.

he has a bigger database.

with your level of understanding , my dear friend mutlu probably
thought that he 'd be nice and help you genocide apologist to get
the point. besides , all your article reflects is your abundant
ignorance. ignorance is probably the main reason why you historical
revisionist are in such a mess. you even make nazi criminal armenians
laugh.


in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul.
it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
create for ourselves. it certainly is possible to severe the artificial
life support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats
in this alien land.
(sahak melkonian 1920 preserving the armenian purity )


an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of
the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at
least 30 40 percent of the population of that republic. the
memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and
eye witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in
1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound.

memoirs of the chief armenian delegate to the paris peace conference

volume 15 (fall 1962) to volume 17 (spring 1964). these memoirs
include an interview between aharonian and british foreign minister
lord curzon in which above mentioned genocide was discussed. the
official report mentioned by lord curzon is the report of british
high commissioner to caucasia , sir oliver wardrop.

the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the
area of transcaucasia to over 130 , 000 square miles. the estimated population
of the entire region in 1886 was 4 , 700 , 000 , of whom 940 , 000 (20 percent) were
armenian , 1 , 200 , 000 (25 percent) georgian , and 2 , 220 , 000 (45 percent) moslem.
of the latter group , 1 , 140 , 000 were tatars. paradoxically , barely one third
of transcaucasia 's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia , where the
christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan
uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44 , 000 armenians
as compared to 68 , 000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897 ,
however , the armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the
guberniia it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670 , 000 of the 1 , 120 , 000
inhabitants. this impressive change in the province 's ethnic character
notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the armenian
republic , a solid block of 370 , 000 tartars who continued to dominate the
southern districts , from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia.
(see also map 1. historic armenia and map 4. administrative subdivisions of
transcaucasia).

in 1920 , '0' percent turk.

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work
of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village.
little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts
into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets
completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they
found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole
length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to
akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain
plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
tartar villages. they are quiet now , those villages , except for
howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the
scattered bones of the dead.

please cite specific examples where an arab party member was rejected
while a jewish party member was accepted.

if you look at the bottom of this article you will see that i have very
kindly dug up one of yigal arens previous postings (entirely without his
permission , i hope he does n't mind) containing translations from ha'arezt
detailing just such a case. perhaps you think that ha'arezt lies \? would
you like to provide me with an assurance that this practise never occurs \?

if you examine these i am
sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power
base that his jewish counterpart had.

right , arabs have been voting in israel for how long \? and in all that time
not one arab ever gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow
party members to put in a ministry \? this is about as likely as sprouting
wings and flying to rio. what basis do you have for explaining this odd
failure \? you seem very confident that you are right , exactly how do you
know , why are you sure \?

once again , if for arguments sake , all the arab israelis were to vote
for labor at the next election , you can rest assured that the number of
arab mks and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift.

exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the labour party
has never put an arab into a cabinet post and insists its coalition
members do the same \? why and on what basis are you reassuring me in
the face of 50 years of discriminatory practise \?

you are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base.

hey what \? \? as i said even when their party puts them up they get knocked
back. it surely could n't be because they are arabs is it \?

the reasoning i see at work is purely political. as far as security
goes i think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing jews
as well e.g. sharon.

well yes , but security is the reason most often given by people who
want to make excuses. i merely thought it would crop up and so
pre empted it.

start of article (all commets in .... are mine not dr. arens)

comments in square brackets are mine yigal

from the other front , july 29 , 1992. translation of ha'aretz article.

racism in the knesset


coalition requirements on one hand , and the presence of progressive mks
from meretz in the coalition on the other , have compelled rabin and
his friends to change , to some extent , their attitude towards the arab
public and their representatives in the knesset. although he did refuse
to view them as partners , taking part in the coalition and joining the
government , he did agree to meet with them and to give them a document
of intentions which included a commitment to work towards a decrease in
the discrimination between jewish and arab citizens . decrease what \? ! \? !
but posters have told us time and again that such discrimination does
not exist at all ! is rabin , too , a closet self hater \? \? \? yigal .

however , racism has not disappeared. when the knesset sat to consider
who would staff its various committees , a request was made to put an mk
from hadash the communist party , one of the arab parties yigal on
the state comptroller 's committee. and oh , did that ever stir up a
storm including in the ranks of labor since many knesset members
find it unthinkable that an arab mk sit on one of the important house
committees. security secrets are liable to fall into their hands...

this attitude which until recently had not even aroused criticism ,
being so natural and so deeply embossed upon people 's hearts holds
that there are knesset members who , despite having been elected by tens
of thousands of votes , are not entitled to be full partners in the body
which represents the people of israel. we are not speaking here of
political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but
of racial discrimination. the proof one of the compromises proposed
was that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replaced by tamar
gojanski a jew yigal from the same party. it was not the member 's
party which was considered unfit , but his race...

here is a documented case in a respected israeli newspaper.

it is worth noting that for the first time since the state 's founding , a
public debate has arisen on this subject , as witness the following
article


a test of self confidence

by gid'on levi , ha'aretz , july 26 , 1992

revelations of discrimination against arabs have become such an integral
part of our daily routine that there is not much effort made to deal
with them. do you hear that , \? please contact this levi fellow
and explain to him how little he knows about israel. please ! yigal .
except that sometimes the demon bursts out from behind the government 's
window dressing , and then the phenomenon is seven times more serious.

last week provided two more such examples the israeli knesset is
finding it very difficult to allow arab representation on its more
important committees and israel television is finding it no less
difficult to give a platform to arabs from the territories. seemingly
two entirely different matters , but in fact they are one and the same.

the 13th knesset proved last week that , even though one third of its
members are new faces , it has not renewed its own face at all , at least
on one issue. parliamentary traditions may be modernized and
parliamentary traditions may become obsolete , and only one tradition
endures forever no arab shall set foot in the more important committees
of the house. there has never been and never will be an arab mk on the
external affairs and defense committee or on the finance committee.
worlds have been overturned over the question of whether or not to
give arabs , for the first time , a place on the state comptroller 's
committee.

the arguments are old and well known in all three of the above
committees innumerable secrets are revealed and woe unto us if an
arab should hear them. one must not make light of such arguments , but
their significance should also not be exaggerated. every arab mk is not
spending all his time waiting for the opportune moment to hand over
information from the knesset committee room to black panther
headquarters in jenin and not all the aforementioned committees are
continually occupied in the discussion of top secret matters , which
could safely be revealed , for example , to mks supportive of the jewish
underground , but not to an arab mk from the likud , labor , or even from
hadash.

the arabs themselves would probably forego membership in the subcommittee
on secret service matters , but what would happen , one may ask , if mk
nawaf masalha were to hear , god forbid , a review of the foreign minister
in an open meeting of the foreign affairs and defense committee , or even
a review of the army chief of staff which , in any case , are regularly
leaked to the next edition of the news. and what would happen if mk
hashem mahamid were to report on what he had seen with his own eyes at
al najah \?

their non participation in important committees and that of their
colleagues , creates an intolerable situation , where arab members of the
elected house have only semi positions. they are good enough for
addressing plenary sessions , and for voting for or against the
government and participating in the deliberations of the immigration and
absorption committee. but they must not , for example , participate in
the process of formulating the state budget in the finance committee or
in the allocation of resources to local authorities. in any case , they
have little part in that.

labor 's dependence on the support of the arab parties has brought about
some improvement mk hashem mahamid , will , it seems , participate in the
state comptroller 's committee. earlier , there had been a ridiculous
attempt made to dictate to hadash who their representative should be ,
and thus to prevent the arab from entering this dubious holy of holies ,
but it soon became clear that there was no legal or constitutional
backing for such a step.

but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices. the
new committee chair , roni milo , has already announced that he will set up
subcommittees aplenty for his committee. thus he will decide where it
is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not. a solution
such as this could , by the way , also have been adopted for the rest of
the committees , thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets
being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from
the knesset.

you guys are funny. it 's funny to see people lose control and

comparing israel to nazi germany is name calling of the lowest kind.
please do n't be disingenuous.

they civil libertarians would support the
jews against the nazis or anyone else who tries to oppress them
and they would support the arabs against the israelis and any
other such oppressive regimes (iraq etc.)

do civil libertarians make no distinction between the nazis and
israel \? would you say that the iraqis are like the nazis \?

if you do not make such distinctions , then all injustices are
equally evil , and the world is a completely evil place. in that

so far , you have presented your opinions as opposed to mine. i would
hardly take them as facts.

because you do n't agree with them , hmm \? \?

no , because a fact and an opinion are two different things. what you are
expressing here are opinions , not facts.

in the abstract , what you 're saying is true. but the facts happen to
agree with me , and disagree completely with you.

i could give you hundreds of words in my mother tongue (spanish) , that
are comonly use and you will never find in a dictionary. even more , i
could show you a lot of meanings that words in spanish have different
from those in the dictionary.

we 're talking about the latter , not the former. and what you 're talking
about is slang in the latter. that clearly has never been the case
here.

no , i am not talking about slang. i am talking about different uses of the
same language in different places.

listen , pinkas. i'm going to count on the supposition that you think
through the opinions you have something which is , by the way , against
my better judgment based on what i 've seen from you to date. we are
agreed , are n't we , that dictionaries are reference books for the usage
of a given language , and in particular for the meanings of the words and
phrases which comprise that language \? now , you are using meanings
completely different from , indeed in some cases diametrically different
from , those given in the dictionary. as a reference book , a dictionary
contains those meanings in both past and (as much as it can) in current
use. that 's also why they are updated so often. now , if you are saying
things which you give different meanings than the dictionary does , and
using non standard meanings about every word , what is your chance of
being taken at face value... \?

just about none. just about no one will take you that way because the
words mean something different to them. it 's quite clear to me from
the response this thread has been getting that that is exactly what is
happening. ponder that.


and guess why. is n't it curious that we do not know how many people define
in how many different ways the term jew , which is the basis of the movement
itself \?

no , probably because the question has n't been asked \? gee , i hate it
when people draw conclusions without information , do n't you \?

i hate people who cannot read. i did not draw any conclusion. i just
said that it is curious , considering how heterogeneous the movement is.

what you did was ask a leading question. in english idiom , the phrase
and guess why... in the way you used it is a loaded question , with
only one answer expected.

i also take offense at being told i cannot read by someone who is
obviously having trouble with the subject himself. mr. pinkas , i am a
phd candidate in my field. one does not get to phd candidacy if one
cannot read.


the law of return and jewish nationality is defined in terms of religion and
not of cultural identity , even if 80 of those defined as jews in isreal
are not religious.

for the umpteenth time it is not defined in terms of religion.
this has been proven to you over and over again.

no , it has not. the law of return defines a jew as someone who has a
jewish mother and has not converted to another religion. that is
pretty the same as the religious definition.



that is a problem. i am saying that i do not support zionism as it is
now. i believe that among the people in the soviet communist party some
might even had been inspired by noble ideals. does that change the
final results of what happened in the ussr \?

are you now wishing to compare the ussr and israel \? or what \? israel
does not practice cruelty.

now i understand. you are unable to make abstractions. you cannot
get the idea from a text and you take everything literally.
bad thing.

balderdash. you know this is false. i would be able to make the
abstraction if it bore any resemblance to the facts of the matter.
yours did not. the analogy is utterly inapplicable.

i would n't be in the field i'm in astrophysics if i could n't make
abstractions and speculate about the general grand scheme of things. i
also would n't be in education which i am (and my students give me
rather good reviews i 'd add) if i could n't draw such analogies.

about israel not practicing cruelty , ask those palestinians in israeli
prisons , those who were tortured , those whose houses had been blown
by the army.

the vast majority of palestinians in israeli prisons are n't tortured ,
and their houses were n't blown up by the army. in fact , you 've seen me
protesting such measures on this net before. are you now trying to
intimate my agreement with them \?

i never said it directly nor indirectly. i am not talking about individuals
who defined themselves as zionists here. i am sure most of them are good ,
honest and caring people. i am talking about the results of the zionist
movement.

in other words , you are taking that as a monolith , and ignoring the
dissension within it , disagreement that is expressed freely , and is
widely based. just as bad.

can you read or are you just typing at random \?

do you know the meanings of the words you use or do you expect the
reader to read your mind \? i can read just fine thank you. and i do n't
need someone who is obviously having some troubles with a tongue which
is n't his native one telling me how to read the words in my own native
tongue. if it were spanish , i 'd ask you.

i am talking about a movement whose actions resulted in a
law of return with a religious definition of jew , a country that defines
nationality based on religion.

then you 're not talking about the movement as it exists today , as i 've
been trying to tell you. please read the arguments i 've given you ! if
you can still say this after reading them you need to read them again.





i am talking about something i consider
a form of racism such as differenciation based on religious belief.
after all , if arabs in israel cannot serve in the army is becasue they
were not born in the right religion.

arabs in israel not only can but do serve in the idf. as you well
know.

they can serve , it is true , but they are not allowed to do the all the
same things as the israeli citizens who happen to be jews.

yes , they are. as you well know.


ok , fine. now we know what you 're talking about. but do you see my
point about how your words could easily have been taken differently \?

it is not we , it was you as in the second person in singular , who cannot
understand a text if things are not explicitly said.

balderdash. see above. once again , you have a lot of gall and
absolutely no right to lecture a native speaker of a language , who is
well educated in it , in a language which is n't your own native tongue
and with which you 're obviously having problems.


so , there is no difference between citizenship and nationality in israel \?
or what do you mean by actually , it does n't \?

i mean exactly that. arab and jewish citizens of israel have the same
rights.

if there is no difference between them , why keeping them in id 's \?
better yet , are you going to tell me that there are no differences in
social life between arabs and jews \?

social life is one thing , legal status is another. once again , this is
a leading question.

so , it follows a religious definition and not a cultural one. that is what
i call a form of racism.

no , because the jewish religion and culture are intimately , inseparably
intertwined. if one renounces judaism , one renounces judaism.

i do not believe that this is true.

final question is it possible to be both jewish and muslim \? jewish
and christian \? your response will be enlightening.

exist in ex yugoslavia christian muslims.

yeah ! that 's it ! ) you 've really outdone yourself this time nick...
do n't forget the davidian muslims ... )

islam is not a race. it 's a religion. you can be white , black ,
fijian or alaskan.

this does not change the fact that muslim is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former yugoslavia , and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely independent and immaterial of
any religious considerations.


it is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens. the croat , muslim , and serb political leaders all
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and
peacefully negotiating multilateral secession agreements.

terms of secession \? you are , of course , joking , right nick \? nobody
chose to fight. bosnia and croatia were internationally
recognized nations when the serbs attacked and started on their
well documented genocide. that makes them an outside aggressor. it 's
a simple genocide , a classical example of ethnic cleansing. there is
no question of civil war...

you only wish it were so.

more than 2 , 000 , 000 residents of croatia and b h have not accepted the
terms of secession which tudjman and izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them. croats and muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the entire territories of the former
yugoslav republics of croatia and b h.

oh , btw , yugoslavia was internationally recognized when it was
destroyed by tudjman , izetbegovic , milosevic , and the international
community led by germany. if yugoslavia 's borders could be changed
against its will , then certainly croatia 's borders and b h 's borders
can be changed as well.

as i have stated many times the civil war in ex yugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession (borders , etc.) for croatia and b h are
finally agreed upon. serbs , croats , and muslims will all have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.

x soviet armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million
turkish men , women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide.
you , and those like you , will not get away with the genocide 's cover up.

during the first world war and the ensuing years 1914 1920 ,
the armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide ,
tried to complete its centuries old policy of annihilation against
the turks and kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million muslims and
deporting the rest from their 1 , 000 year homeland.

the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people.

as the the peace talks resume in the middle east , i would humbly
like to make some personal observations as to their prospects of success
or failure and what 's at stake.

the present talks were suspended for over 4 months after the
israeli expulsion of more the 400 palestinians for alleged links with
the extremist islamic organisation hamas. the future of the talks was
in the balance and their continuance was only guaranteed after some
concessions by israel. now that all the parties are back to the
negotiating table , the stakes as i see is are indeed high and the future
stability of the region and perhaps the world is in the balance.

the resumption of the talks was followed by a goodwill gesture
by israel involving the return of 30 exiled palestinians from jordan to
the occupied territories. these , however were not the palestinians
expelled in december. the group constituted intellectuals and
professionals who had been exiled after the '67 war for the political
stand which was then regarded as dangerous.

the choice of these arabs , who support the peace talks ,
illustrates the dilemma now faced by israel. its erstwhile arch
enemies , ie plo and its backers now seem willing to talk peace while a
new wave of islamic fundamantalism sweeping the middle east has seen the
rise of an even more implacable foe under the banner of hamas.

while israel continues to refuse to talk to the plo , labelling
it a terrorist organisation , the window of opportunity for peace is
narrowing by the day. if the present talks are allowed to deadlock
without agreement for a long term and lasting peace that taken into
account the interest of all involved , the chances of peace will indeed
receed. the plo , by its decision to rejoin the talks , has staked its
reputation on the success of the talks. the longer the talks continue ,
and they started 1 and half years ago , without any tangible progress ,
the further will the plo support in the territories erode.

what is urgently needed is some dramatic gesture , worked out by
israel with us approval that could spur the peace process and force the
arabs and palestinians to reciprocate. vague promises as to interim
government and return of territories is evidently too little too late to
be any good. you might ask why must the israelis and not the arabs make
the first substantive moves. the answer must lie in the tenous support
at best that the talks receive among the mass of arab people and the
fact the israel holds the most important cards , namely land.

if a land for peace agreement can be reached , and real soon , the chances
of a comprehensive peace treaty is good. the arabs , once and for all ,
recognise israel 's right to exist inside secure borders , and isreal
would in turn recognise the legitimate right of the palestinians to self
deternimation and statehood. with peace guarantee by air tight
treaties , the region can then hope to dwell on the economic and social
well being of its population , rather than prepare for the next war.

lovely arguments. but do we write about historical ownership of any
place palestine , pakistan , cyprus , aegean islands (and the oil that
may lie beneath them) , whatever for any reason other than
justification for stomping others \?

does it truly matter whose ancestor lived where 20 , 200 , or 2000 years
ago \? more than how you treat the land and each other \?

who is wise enough to decree that a person 's right to life , liberty
and pursuit of happiness in a particular place depends on accidents of
birth \? who can even be sure about the precise tracks of the sperm
that birthed the people we wish to despise \?

imho , the american indians have it right. we belong to the earth , it
does not belong to us. failure to understand that is a good way to
cause lossage all the way around. my guess is that once we trash our
environment sufficiently we shall die along with it the baby eating
and killing its mother , then dying for lack of milk.

death and disease do not respect national boundaries , not as toxins ,
disease vectors , lost farmland wetlands forest cover water supplies ,
nor any other way. when we fight over which national group owns which
piece of turf , we are merely contending for the best vantage point
from which to kill others , our land and eventually ourselves.

that is something of which to be proud. very proud. makes me glad to
be human.


i'm not mindlessly rejecting all nationalism. maybe it 's fair to ask
whether a recent immigrant deserves a share of the infrastructure that
all my ancestors (hah ! ) labored to produce. but it 's an artificial
distinction is the recent immigrant , even a refugee , less likely to
contribute to the next generation 's legacy than anyone else \? in
history the reverse is often the case recent immigrants strive
hardest. if nothing else , they fill open eco(l n)ogic niches.

then again , my tribe is infinitely better than your tribe , so i can
understand you all have nothing but plot to knock me off. while i , of
course , will make sure it does n't happen , even if i must shoot muslim
infants (or bash jewish ones against the walls of schoolhouses) to do
so. that 'll prove my moral superiority , by golly , as well as the
rightness of my cause.


clearly , there is no higher purpose in life than killing others
because they are not like you. i would never get in the way of such
fun.

here you give positive , accurate facts about what happened to the beduins
and the land

after the creation of the state of israel , 80 percent of the negev
bedouin were expelled to the sinai or to southern jordan. the
10 , 000 who were allowed to remain were confined to a territory of
40 , 000 hectares in a region were annual mean precipiation was 150
mm a quantity low enough to ensure a crop failure two years out
of three. the rare water wells in the south and central negev ,
spring of life in the desert , were cemented to prevent bedouin
shepherds from roaming.

a few bedouin shepherds were allowed to stay in the central negev.
but after 1982 , when the sinai was returned to egypt , these
bedouin were also eliminated. at the same time , strong pressure
was applied on the bedouin to abandon cultivation of their fields
in order that the land could be transferred to the army.

and now you say noone knows anything about what happened there

no reliable statistics exist concerning the amount of land held
today by negev bedouin. it is a known fact that a large part of
the 40 , 000 hectares they cultivated in the 1950s has been seized
by the israeli authorities. indeed , most of the bedouin are now
confined to seven development towns , or sowetos , established
for them.

(the rest of the article is available from elias davidsson , email
elias@ismennt.is)

so what you basically say is that we know for sure that nothing good happens
there now , we know for sure that the beduins prospered before the jews arrived
and that they were driven away by the jews , noone on earth knows about
what the jews did there.

is that what you said \? could you proove any of the nonsense you wrote \?

btw , try asking beduins in sinai how they mis the israelis. not to mention
that there are enough valotaring beduins in the idf to have at least one full
brigade of them.

every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and

chapter in a 900 year history of attacks on jews in europe. that did n't
make it acceptable. and balkan history does not make the genocide against
bosnian muslims acceptable.

i guess that it was not acceptable because germany also chose
a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
other countries in peril. i wonder whether us or other countries
would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and
hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (i am no student of history
and i am just asking questions.)

if even for a moment you think that i am condoing ethnically
motivated violence and killings , you are dead wrong. let me
assure i am not. my only question is this do powerful countries
have a moral obligation to interefere in other countries if
their own interests are not threatened. i cite an essay by
charles krauthammer in the time (this week) that discusses
this issue eloquently.

for example , did us and other european countries abandon their
moral compunctions when they chose not to send military troops
to bombay when hindus , in a rare fit of impassioned rage , killed
many muslims recently. i think not !

under what conditions should us interfere in foregin countries ,
is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
accusations of religious bigotry and such.

expelled 2000 years ago , but first i convert to any other religion , can i
apply to the law of return as a member of the jewish nation or should i
apply as someone whose mother is jewish \?

i'm not sure about this but i hope the answer is that you ca n't apply under
the law of return. by conversion , you 've elected not to be a part of the
jewish nation.


which was my point. by converting to another religion i do not loose
my cultural identity , i just loose my religious identification.
i consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the
right to have a state based on religious belief is a form of racism.


5) what has change in me between the day before and the day after i converted
to loose my being part of the jewish nation \?

at the moment you converted , you officially anounced to the world that you do not
consider yourself to be part of the jewish nation. so , why should the jewish nation
consider you to be a member \?

to be a part or not of the jeish nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion. actually , if i am an atheist , which is in fact like
converting into a non jewish in terms of religion , i am still considered as
part of the jewish nation.
i can be proud of my jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
jewish religion. or , even more , i can be proud of my jewish culture while
still be convinced that the real god is another one.
i do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the american nation
because he changed of god.


suppose my father is arab. suppose he was born in palestine , in some place
which now is part of israel. suppose that his father , and his grandfather as
well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.
now suppose there is a war of independence and my father , scared by all the
fighting going on , tries to take his family to a place more secure , among
people he knows , who speak a language he understands , who worship the same
god. now , suppose that that place is some other arab country.
and , now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live , and that that country is called israel.
and , that in that country , jews from all over the world are received. and
that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and
granted full citizenship.
should i , if i decided to go back to my father 's land , where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born , have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years \?

no. as a result of wars brought by the arabs against the jews in an attempt to
annihilate israel , the arabs have lost their claim to land there. attacking israel
is was illegal and they now have to pay the price. do i feel sorry for the
palestinians \? yes i do. but i blame the arab nations for their problems , not
israel.

i still believe that we should never confusse the actions of states with
the individuals who happen to live there.
in the same way that i do not think it is right to blame all israelis for the
human rights violations of israel , i do not think that we should assume
that all arabs are guilty of the actions of the arab states.
some people fled their homes because they were scared. now they are in
there , still suffering for what they are not responsible.
and , remember that we also were told the same at some point. we ended in
the diaspora. and , of course , i am not for doing to others what i did not

this may make the term 'civil war' dubious , but it does nothing to the

not simply to prevent it from occupying the territories that do n't con

to wipe it out entirely (and , not incidentally , the entire jewish population

state , a requirement for being called a democracy in my opinion ,

was n't a requirement for democracy in athens. for that matter , is n't
a requirement for the term democracy in the united states , which does n't
let non citizens vote either. both the united states and israel have
processes whereby it is possible to acquire citizenship , with a great
deal of effort and a modicum of screening it 's just that it is n't
automatic for living in the territories. it is n't automatic for living
in new york , either.

that said , suit yourself. having never considered democracy the ultimate
in good in this world , i could care less if you feel like calling israel ,
or america , or anywhere else , a democracy. personally , i withhold the
term from israel for the same reason i withhold it from britain... the
parliamentary system is a serious handicap.

then mr. frank would be correct. as the current government neither
is willing to
enfrachise the vast majority of individuals in the territories or to
allow these people to have the right to self determination it is not
a civil war or their government , rather it is resitance to a foreign
occupier.

again , suit yourself. in which case israel is not attacking its own
people , it is fighting a war on foreign soil , in which case the residents
are entitled to play rough , yes but israel 's allowed to get just as
rough , within the bare limits of the rules of war. this includes , among
other things , the right to shoot or bomb anyone a national of the coun
try in question who is fighting them (which permits mass frontal assault
on all rock throwers) , along with the right to take out any installation
of military importance (certain villages with too good fortifications can
be handled by aerial bombing , as can waterways since they count as supply
lines to the enemy) , and the right to do anything whatsoever to whatever
constitutes a government that they can lay hands on (if hamas is trying
to set up as the ruling party , let them beware).

if this is not the scenario you want , i recommend you go back to calling
it a civil war. civil wars have to be handled nicer. you cannot say the
palestinians are a nation fighting a resistance war against a foreign
nation and still call israel a government who is treating its own people
cruelly. if the palestinians are fighting a war against a foreign country ,
so is israel , and the gloves come off .

oguocha


mr. oguocha ,
muslims in the bosnian context are in fact turks ... in fact , correct
me if i am wrong , serbs are attacking bosnians with their battle cries
death to the turks ! .

is this so shocking \? years of communism apparently suppressed their
hatred and anger towards the turks. but such hatred is obviously one that
dies hard.

serbs must understand , turks are no longer the good old barbarians world
has come to know by propaganda after propaganda.

serbs must further understand that barbarism does not work.

serbs must even further understand that barbarism would one day have
to face counter barbarism. so , i urge those people serbs to stop
killing bosnian women and children. and they must never forget that
turks in the motherland are watching...patiently.

i was n't sure that your original statement was wrong and was prepared to

your last response made me pretty damn sure that at least you ca n't give such
a proof , and you made your original statement without much ground to put it
on.

i believe that most of the world has seen pictures of israeli soldiers who
were breaking the cameras of the reporters , kicking reporters out ,
confiscating
cassettes , and showing reporters militery orders preventing them from going
to hot areas to pick pictures and make reports.

even if it 's true (and in this case i 'd take it without asking you to prove it)
it is still far from killing reporters. also whenever that happened i 'll bet
it happened as individual actions by certain soldiers and not as a policy of
the government (e.g. see the hawara case where a colonel was sentenced for
giving orders to kick arabs , as far as i remember).

this may be true but i think we jews dismiss palestinian nationalism at our
peril. its newness does n't obviate its reality.

besides , israeli nationalism is a new phenomenum as well.

israeli nationalism (also known as zionism) is the nationalism of the
jewish people. the jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.

palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of arab people. arabs have
been around for a long time. they already have some 2 dozen states ,
large and small , covering 98 of the middle east.

more specifically , palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of arabs
from the region of palestine , just as egyptian nationalism is the
nationalism of arabs from the region of egypt. one palestinean state
already exists in what was once known as palestine it is called
jordan.

there is no justification in carving out a second and tiny palestinean
state out of the only jewish state , itself very , very small , just as
there is no justification in carving out another american state out of

unlike the plo 's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets , the
100 troups from the irgun and stern group that struck at deir yassin
on april 10 , 1948 , targeted the village for its military importance.
deir yassin was on the road to jerusalem , which the arabs had

since facts and myths does n't even know where deir yassin was ,
why should we pay any attention to the rest of what it says \?

blockaded , and it housed iraqi troups and palestinian irregulars.
snipers based in deir yassin were a constant threat to jewish citizens
in jerusalem.

arab civilians were killed at deir yassin , but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the arabs have tried to
paint. the number of arabs killed was generally reported to be about
250. in 1983 , however , eric silver of the guardian (britain)
interviewed a survivor , mophammed sammour , who testified that 116 out
of a population of 800 1000 were killed. 'about three days after the
massacre , ' sammour explained , 'representatives of each of the five
clans in deir yassin met at the moslem offices in jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found (alive). we went through the
names. nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure
was wrong.'

this account from eric silver is the only valid point that m f makes.
you can find it together with other evidence and analysis in
silver 's biography of begin. also in silver 's book you will find
documentary evidence that nearly everything else in m f 's account
is pure bullshit.

unlike the plo 's deliberate attacks on civilians , the killing of
civilians at deir yassin was not premeditated. the attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left
unharmed. after the remaining arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the jewish troops , some of the attackers killed arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately. independent observers told the guardian
that among the bodies they found arab men disguised as women.

this is pretty disgusting. the guardian was told of one or two
feeble old men who dressed in women 's clothing in a pathetic
attempt to escape death. see silver 's book.

terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
arabs. these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british
soldiers

you do n't see a difference between killing british soldiers (who were

children \? ! \?

that 's ridiculuous on atleast two counts. first of all , even if you identify
yourself as completely jewish that does n't rule out the possibility that you 're
a self hating anti semite. one can always find jews who are uncomfortable with
their identities (since they only want jews to be cowering victims) and are

actually , just after the first world war , many muslims were killed by serbs.
under serbian led regime between the two world wars , many croats were
also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on jan. 6 , 1929).
some croats formed a resistance movement ustashas (insurgents) and
were forced into exile , to fascist italy , which sheltered them. in exile ,
they practiced a terrorist approach to liberating croatia while croats in
croatia followed the approach of peaceful negotiations under the leadership
of vladko macek. after the axis powers took control in the second world
war , vladko macek refused to collaborate , so ustashas were brought in
to run the newly formed puppet state. this state included both croatia and
bosnia herzegovina , and its ideology saw muslims as the best croats
( flowers of croatian people ). some muslims in bosnia herzegovina
therefore joined ustashas. however , even more others did not they
joined tito 's partisans. the ustashas membership peaked at
less than 1 of croat and muslim population of that area at that time.

after wwii , muslims were still considered a religious minority descended
from croats or serbs who converted to islam centuries ago. but , in 1968 ,
it was decided that forcing muslims to declare their nationality as
either serbs or croats is not a good policy. dobrica cosic , the current
president of the rump yugoslavia , was strongly opposed , and sought to
prevent the category muslim (in an ethnic sense) from appearing on the
next census. he was criticized and expelled from the party. so , since
that time , bosnian muslims are considered a separate nationality , although
some still deny this and insist that they choose either serb or croat
nationality.

let me remind all of those muslim haters out there who like to
mention the mufti 's cooperation with germany as a reason to let muslims
be slaughtered everywhere in the world of the following facts

1)why blame the muslims for what the nazis did and forgive italy , the croats ,
and many other europeans for being real allies to hitler \?

2)why blame muslims for supporting germany the enemy of their enemy
at the time (britain who colonized most of the middle east and was responsible
for most atrocities against muslims in the region) and forgive germany itself
eventhough it is the one who created nazism \?

3)as far as muslims are concerned there was no difference between
nazi germany , and antimuslim colonialist britain france in 1940. they were
all racist , anti arab , and full of arrogance and hate. wwii and the wars
in algeria , sudan , and other places proved that very clearly. even anti
semitism was not more spread in germany than in france or britain , it just
happened to be official policy in germany.

and we will forgive you , just set our countries free.

so any arguments about wwii behaviour coming from the people who
killed millions in that war (from either side) is just plain laughable.

on the one hand , you imply that there is a conspiracy of arab americans
that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license
registration information in california) and other forms of monitoring , including
blatant attempts by paid adl agents to discredit an american arab
organization by trying to distribute nazi propaganda. furthermore ,
you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing
to the wtc bombing , in which arab americans had no involvement.

on the other hand , you publish this excerpt , which seems to rail
against notions of a racial (jewish , in this case) conspiracy and

in a word utter and complete horse puckey. look the term up in the
dictionary.


ok. lets look into this.
according to my dictionary ,
zi on ism an international movement orig. for the establishment of a jewish
national or religious community in palestine and later for the support of
modern israel.

now , i do not support the establishment of nations based on religious
principles , while i support the establishment of nations based on cultural
identities.

so. here are some questions i have to ask for anyone to answer. my point
is what someone said long time ago in politics , like with men , it is important
to distiguish between what they say they do and what they are actually
doing.

1) my mother is jewish (and so is my father). if i apply for the law of
return , do i get in as a jew trying to return to his land , from which my
family was expelled about 2000 years ago \?
2) if i go back , which nationality would my id show \?
3) if i decided to go back to the land from which my relatives had been
expelled 2000 years ago , but first i convert to any other religion , can i
apply to the law of return as a member of the jewish nation or should i
apply as someone whose mother is jewish \?
4) which nationality would show my id in case 3) \?
5) what has change in me between the day before and the day after i converted
to loose my being part of the jewish nation \?
6) suppose i want to get married to my current wife , who is non jewish in
israel , how do i do it \?
7) how would my situation change if i decided , after going back to
israel , to convert to islam \?


now , here is one more question. i do believe that most people in a country
do not care about politics. they just want to be left alone.
suppose my father is arab. suppose he was born in palestine , in some place
which now is part of israel. suppose that his father , and his grandfather as
well as 20 or 30 generations before him were born in that place.
now suppose there is a war of independence and my father , scared by all the
fighting going on , tries to take his family to a place more secure , among
people he knows , who speak a language he understands , who worship the same
god. now , suppose that that place is some other arab country.
and , now suppose that the war is over and that there is a new country created
where my father used to live , and that that country is called israel.
and , that in that country , jews from all over the world are received. and
that people whose family left thet country 200 generation ago are recieved and
granted full citizenship.
should i , if i decided to go back to my father 's land , where he was born as
20 or 30 generations of my family were born , have the right to go back and
ask to be recognized in the same way those who are returning after 2000
years \?

then , finally , people ask me how i would define a jew , but that is irrelevant.
i am not talking about how i would define a jew , but about how people in
zionist organizations , and more important , in israel , define a jew.
how would those who are zionist define a jew \?

what a dope ! there is no value for mohammed elabdellaoui to be here

yes , the typical primitive muslim psychopathological psychotic

about the jews. what a jerk.

you should go back to your mindlessly stupid 3rd world country. your
brain has no business in a civilized first world country.

joachim carlo santos martillo ajami

if you were to substitute the word jew jewish in this posting where you
see the word muslim islamic , switch joachim and mohammed 's names around ,
and then repost this , you would get a flood of messages attacking the author
as an anti semite. and rightly so. the author of this crap is a racist , pure
and simple. he obviously has no qualms about being open with it , either ,
unlike some other arab and mulsim bashers on the net.

now , i for one , am not going to look at joachim 's posting and infer from it
that all jews think this way. sure , there might be some , but this view is not
a part of judaism , and it is stupid to believe that all jews' minds are this
twisted. however , some muslims might look at joachim 's flame as a
reaffirmation of their worst fears about jews that they all hate arabs and
are racists.

for this reason , i am alarmed that not more jews on the net have spoken out
against what joachim has said. they have the chance to possibly change the
anti semitic views of some people on the net , to show them that all jews do
not hate all arabs and muslims , just like all muslims do not hate all
jews. yet they are missing that chance. remember , to many people , silence
implies consent.

i do n't mean to sound disrespectful , but since the majority
of the contributors (and may be even readers) of this newsgroup seem
to be muslims , christians and jews , my question could be of some
interest to any of them.
it 's my impression that both islam and christianity pay great
respect to an obscure 1st century jewish lad from judea galilee. why
they chose this particular jew among all possible jews is a mystery
to me (personally , i prefer woody allen his stories are much juicier)
but perhaps it 's an accident of history.
anyway , it seems that they may be talking about two different
jews. according to the new testament his father 's name was joseph ,
while in qur'an he appears as zachariah.

bh tsiel ,

bh i would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border ,
bh starting from the early 70 's. certainly the plo did shell northern
bh israel from the arqoub region , but israel did much more shelling
bh destroying several south lebanese villages. at the very least
bh we can say that both sides exchanged shelling , with occasional
bh aerial raids by israel on lebanese villages.
bh in any case steve 's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in
bh response to years of shelling from lebanon is false. israel had
bh many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
bh in lebanon favorable to israel , and it nearly achieved this aim
bh with the election of basheer el gemayel , and his brother , amin
bh el gemayel , but the internal situation in lebanon was too hard
bh to control and predict so israel had to withdraw , and amin el gemayel
bh had to abrogate the 17 th of may agreement.

basil ,

i was only correcting steve 's statement that geurillas were shelling israel
from the golan , which was absurd.
the fact that israel did much more shelling was in response to palestinian
shelling from lebanon. israel has no intention of keeping an inch of lebanese
territory. israel will continue to fight hizbullah , plo , fplp etc. as long as
its northern border is not quiet. if the lebanese army can control these
elements then i think we can see genuine peace on the israel lebanese border.
i remind you that a couple thousand lebanese cross each day into israel to
work.
as for the election of bashir gemayel , it is true that he was favorable to
israel , is that why the syrians killed him \? his brother amin was a syrian
puppet , if he had not been , he would have been dead by now.

the atrocities and massacres which have been committed for a long time
against the muslim population within the armenian republic have been
confirmed with very accurate information , and the observations made by
rawlinson , the british representative in erzurum , have confirmed that
these atrocities are being committed by the armenians. the united states
delegation of general harbord has seen the thousands of refugees who came
to take refuge with kazim karabekir 's soldiers , hungry and miserable ,
their children and wives , their properties destroyed , and the delegation
was a witness to the cruelties. many muslim villages have been destroyed
by the soldiers of armenian troops armed with cannons and machine guns
before the eyes of karabekir 's troops and the people. when it was hoped
that this operation would end , unfortunately since the beginning of
february the cruelties inflicted on the muslim population of the region
of shuraghel , akpazar , zarshad , and childir have increased. according
to documented information , 28 muslim villages have been destroyed in the
aforementioned region , more than 2 , 000 people have been slaughtered ,
many possessions and livestock have been seized , young muslim women
have been taken to kars and gumru , thousands of women and children who
were able to flee their villages were beaten , raped and massacred in the
mountains , and this aggression against the properties , lives , chastity
and honour of the muslims continued. it was the responsibility of the
armenian government that the cruelties and massacres be stopped in order
to alleviate the tensions of muslim public opinion due to the atrocities
committed by the armenians , that the possessions taken from the muslims
be returned and that indemnities be paid , that the properties , lives ,
and honour of the muslims be protected.

i dont think you 're correct here. there have been no reports of the bosnians
muslims supporting the nazis in their genocide against the serbians. the
fact is that the croat govt. using their secret police (called the ustache ,
i think) were the prime agents of the nazis in yugoslavia against the serbs.

javed.


first of all , this is not a strife this is a massacre of innocent
moslem poeples by the christian west.

since ottoman lost the control of balkans , many tens and hundereds
of millions of muslem peoples (turks , albanians , bosnians , and others)
have been tortured , raped , massacred , and driven out of their homes
by the cristians of both the region and europe. some lucky ones
escaped to relative safety in turkiye. the remaining others are being
finished now by local christians , the usa , and the rest of europe.

the christian west is maintaining a tight arms ambargo on the muslem
peoples of bosnia so they cannot deffend themslves while letting
christian serbs and croats torture , rape , and massacre the innocent
moslem peoples of bosnia.

it took christian europe for almost six centuries to achieve this
objective of theirs and i do not think they will let it up. this will
go on untill every single moslem person (bosnian , turk , albanian , etc)
is tortured , raped , massacred , and driven out of their homes.

i consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the

although i do n't want to muddy the waters unnecessarily i disagree. any
discrimination based on religion is not and cannot be racist unless the
sole qualification for religious membership is racial. this is not the
case for israel although it might get a little closer than , say , islam.
this of course raises the vexed question of church antisemitism. jews
have been heavily discriminated against on the grounds of religion in
many christian countries. if we take russia as an example jews were
seriously persecuted but that persecution in the eyes of the church
and state stopped at the baptismal font. officially anyway. if a jew
converted there were no legal barriers in his way (that i know of anyway.)
peter the great 's interior minister came from such a convert background.
can we then claim that the russian orthodox did not teach antisemitism
and was not antisemitic \? similarly for the roman catholic church \? i
suspect so as this is not a racial 'taint' but one based on belief
and as is after all a form of racism. well maybe not. what is

not exactly the same , but reminiscent of the assassination of count

successful in negotiating a cease fire , which would have worked
territorially against the nascent israel , compared to continued war.

that operation was done by a small jewish fraction before the state even
existed and , as far as i remember , was disaproved by most of the jews.

saying that he was killed by the israelis is plain wrong because there was n't
israel at the time.

and as far as the jews liked the idea of having part of the land you can see
their reaction to the un resolution from 29 november , and the arab 's reaction
too (no , it was n't that the arabs danced in the streets with doznes of jewish

i'm unclear here. are you saying that these events did not occurr \?
as you know , the un neither condemned nor expressed outrage at any
of the events listed (i retained those that reflected policies
of murder and abuse). is that an irrelevent fact to you \?

while i do expect israel 's abusive policies to be condemned
where appropriate , are you saying that you do not notice any
degree of selective morality on the un 's part \? do you also
find it convenient (and easy) to blithely ignor particular abhorrant
acts simply because the perpetrators do n't happen to be on your
bad guys list \?

i have to say i think this is the first time there has
been something posted that opposed me without making personal
insults. congradulations tim. i think the other people answered
you on most of the factual parts(esp. about the internal
conflicts policy).
israel very often gets away with more
than most other nations (due to u.s. vetos). while i am not
familiar with every instance i know that the reason saudi
arabia was not condemned for killig the pilgrims was that the
pilgrims were iranian. yes , the un is biased but mostly in
favor of the us and its allies (including israel , saudi arabia
and pakistan) and against outlaw countries like iran and more
recently iraq. far be it from me to support the repressive
governments there but i think they get more slack than israel
for things they do wrong . again the reason some condemnations
do n't occur lies in the race or country of the victims. the
gassed iraqi kurds got associated with iran in the war and
since iran was perceived as worse than iraq no condemnation
resulted. the palestinians killed by arab countries involved
another case of who cares. it seems that until very recently no
one cared about how many palestinians died anywhere (including
in israel and the occupied territories).
again i appreciate the lack of personal insults.

it is not a question of an individuals standing. when a party puts up
an arab for a cabinet post and that arab is rejected but the position
is given to a jew from the same party we are not talking about power
but racism.

not necessarily. as shai points out , political appointments are
based on power. they are also based on favors owed , coalition
building , and deal making.

actually i am not sure you have understood what i have said. on several
occasions a minor party has put up an arab for a cabinet position. that
is the major party (labour in this case) has agreed that a minor party
can have so many seats and that party nominates an arab for one. this is
not acceptable to the major party which insists on the minor party
appointing a jew. the favours owed , deals done , have all been settled.
what remains is exactly who is going to sit in cabinet. the party that
gets the seat wants an arab but that is not acceptable. this is racism.
it has nothing to do with politics at all.

the honest answer to your question about arabs who were expelled
from jaffa , and or who fled jaffa , or anywhere else in israel , having
the right to return is yes , unfortunately , they have the right to
return. they may apply for citizenship like any other non israeli and
then go to jaffa and try to buy their house back from the jews who now
own it.

and now a question and answer for you can the jews who were
born and raised in hebron , or their descendants go back to their homes
in hebron \? the answer is absolutely not , because they were almost all
murdered by their arab neighbors the palestinians .

now , do i think the arabs should be allowed to even visit
their homes in jaffa \? hell , no. bring back the jews of hebron , petah
tikva , jerusalem , safed , etc. then , perhaps i would be in favor of arabs
returning to their jaffa homes. however , seeing as no arab has yet been
able to bring people back from the dead , i 'd say that 's out.

asia minor or lake michigan. judea and samaria are even used in
an atlas published in (what used to be) ussr circa 1970 that i have at

there was something in the nyt and other sources about this for a few

out the uae people it was briefly reported (this was many moons ago).
i do n't recall reading of any public us comment if it were a strong

those islands would be abu musa , and the greater and lesser tunbs , i presume.
i do n't know about a fourth. the latter two islands belong to iran and so

according to the ny times , the 4 islands belong to the united arab

the ny times is in error. this is not simply my opinion even the arab sources
that i use do not make this claim. this , of course , is assuming that the ny

abu musa has been in dispute and iranian occupation of that island predates

several authors assert that armenian resistance at van constituted a key
factor in the turkish evacuation of persia and motivated the ittihadist
young turk leaders to annihilate the turkish armenians. the question of
responsibility for the massacres or deportation of nearly all ottoman
armenians has evolved into a polemic. hundreds of books , articles , and
documents have been published to describe the horrifying scenes of violence
and death. many writers , such as the british bryce and toynbee , french pinon ,
german lepsius , american morganthau and gibbons , have insisted that the
massacres were predetermined and ruthlessly executed. the have refuted the
ottoman government 's official publications and justifications by
substantiating that anti armenian measures were deliberated by the
ittihadists even before the outbreak of war. the fact remains than an
estimated eight hundred thousand to over a million armenians perished within
a few months , and several hundred thousand more succumbed in the following
years to the ravages of disease , famine , and refugee life. unknown numbers
of women and children were converted forcibly to islam , possessed by
turkish men , or adopted by moslem families.

few people know of the problem i faced at ucla when professor stanford
shaw was due for promotion. i knew him to be turkey 's man due to my
reading knowledge of turkish and my seniority over him , i was a member
of the promotion committee. for that case , i sat down and read his entire
treatise history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey . it took me
three months and i found out , from volume i , that he had plagiarized
uzun jarsoglu , an eminent turkish specialist on ottoman history. shaw
himself claimed in his introduction that his treatise was the outcome
of a 20 year search through the ottoman archives. well , i went on leave
and managed to show 40 of volume i , containing around 5000 sentences ,
to be the result of plagiarism , matching each sentence with passages
from the original work. he had even reproduced the errors. so i produced a
500 pages manuscript and submitted a 60 pages report on shaw 's plagiarism.

the university , however , rejected my report and , after a closed meeting ,
promoted stanford shaw to distinguished professor. i paid a price for
all this upset by the whole process , i confronted the entire university
structure and was considered to be a chauvinist and madman. i asked for
permission to run a seminar on shaw 's book that was denied by the president
of the university. while the center for near eastern studies granted me
permission , the president was depriving me of my academic freedom. luckily ,
the dean refused to give in and i did run the seminar , attended by more
than 150 academic people , in which i uncovered stanford shaw , who refused
to attend. as a punishment , the university froze all my raises.

your note was not on target at all. armenians have had many independent
times in their long and beautiful history. including an independent

your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most ' ians'. sarkis atamian
explains in his book called 'the armenian community , new york 1955 ,
philosophical library' that , according to historians , original fatherland
of the armenians was in thessaly , greece. armenian invaders burned and
sacked the fatherland of urartus , massacred and exterminated its population
and presented to the world all those left from the urartus , as the armenian
civilization. all reliable western historians describe how armenians
ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million muslim women , children and elderly
people of eastern anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of
the muslim people between 1914 1920. it is unfortunately a truth that
armenians are known as collaborators of the nazis during world war ii
and that , even today , criminal members of the asala sdpa arf terrorism
triangle preach and instigate racism , hatred , violence and terrorism
among peoples.

please tell me how on earth armenians fully participated in the genocide
of jews during wwii , are you on some heavy drugs \?

who says 'arromdians' are no damn good \? during world war ii armenians
were carried away with the german might and cringing and fawning over
the nazis. in that zeal , the armenian publication in germany , hairenik ,
carried statements as follows 1

sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the jews)
when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease , and when it
becomes necessary for a people (the nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
method , these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. during the surgical
operation , the flow of blood is a natural thing.

now for a brief view of the armenian genocide of the muslims and jews
extracts from a letter dated december 11 , 1983 , published in the san
francisco chronicle , as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one b. amarian.

we have first hand information and evidence of armenian atrocities
against our people (jews). members of our family witnessed the
murder of 148 members of our family near erzurum , turkey , by armenian
neighbors , bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely jewish
and or muslim. armenians should look to their own history and see
the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.
armenians were in league with hitler in the last war , on his premise
to grant themselves government if , in return , the armenians would
help exterminate jews. armenians were also hearty proponents of
the anti semitic acts in league with the russian communists.

rj3s , you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the irgun
to attack dir yassin was its strategic importance. in fact , begin ,
who was in charge of the irgun , wrote that dir yassin was attacked for
its military significance.

dir yassin was merely a battle in the war of liberation. people died.
but the thing was never intended to be a masacre. that this hapenned
is a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun.

i agree with you harry , however you must also concede then that
arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war.

no one is forced to blow up airplanes. terrorism is a choice
made by people because they do not want to work for peace.

remember that the
palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in
order to further their cause.

there are lots of military targets in israel. there are
lots of legitamate targets in israel. old ladies , children , and
civilians in general are not acceptable targets.

if the only person you can kill is a civilian , you hold your
fire. if that means you ca n't kill anyone , then you ca n't kill
anyone. claiming that civilain targets are acceptable because they
are easy kills is rediculous.

if irgun had to attack civilian targets to terrorize in order that
they might obtain some objective , i'm sure they would have done so.

did they make a policy of it \?

i also do n't
exclude irgun 's action against british soldiers as terrorism.

did you mean excuse \? ) killing a soldier and killing a
civilian are two very different acts.

the british were showing signs of favoring a compromise with
regards to palestine , and the irgun and branch off groups made
a point to kill young british recruits so that mothers and
fathers back in britain would get angry at britains continued
presence in palestine.

no , they killed soldiers so that the british government would
leave. the objective was not to scare civilains , but show that the cost
of staying was way too high.

in contrast , a terrorist kills civilains to scare other
civilains. they use random violence against people to make a point
that no one is safe until their demands are met. an analogy would be
the irgun blowing up harrods or 10 downing.

sounds like a form of terrorism to me , and not much removed from
arab terrorism.

thats because you missed the essential point of arab
terrorism , which is to scare civilains away from israel , by killing
those who have something to do with israel. it is to kill jews
because they might be zionists. it is to kill people who live in
israel because of where they live. the targets are rarely soldiers ,
or other people who understand they might be attacked in the line of
duty , but innocent civilians , to underscore the message that no one
who deals with israel is safe.

i 'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy , but
i 'll favor the underdog in this case because i do think they
were a bit screwed.

oh , you mean you favor the israelis , outnumbered 2 to 1 ,
outgunned , surrounded by hostile states only one of which has signed a
peace treaty in 45 years \? you favor the jews , people like leon
klofhinger , a cripple who was thrown off a boat because he was jewish \?
you support the right of the jewish people to live in peace \?

why , thank you for your support.

providing safety and security for one 's own people is the most
fundamental responsibility of any political entity. for the palestinian
leadership to refuse to accept this responsibility , i.e. take the
responsibility to protect their people from radical palestinian elements
who are opposed to the peace process , is reprehensible. to argue that a
palestinian police force would be established in order to control peaceful
political groups only reinforces the reality that the palestinian
leadership , so far , can not exercise control over radical palestinian
elements nor effectively deal with the killing of palestinians by
palestinians. this is a problem that can only be solved by the
palestinian people.

i am replying to this because i have n't seen anyone else do so yet. it
seems rather odd really as there are so few really wierd posters left
who are n't fascists or arab extremists.

arab civilians did die at dir yassin. but there was no massacre.

yes it was and it was clearly admitted so by the troops who carried it
out and then stupidly deposited testimony in their own archives to that
effect.

first
of all , the village housed many armed troops.

source \? noone is claiming this anymore except you. would you like
to name one credible historian who asserts this \? i believe that
even begin has the decency not to claim this.

secondly , the irgun
and stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.

yes they did and thye said so they said they went their with the
intention of killing all the men and all the women who got in their
way. their own archives remember , this is not hostile testimony.

the village was attacked only for its military significance. in fact ,
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin.

sound van bogged down in a ditch. no warning given.

by all rational standards , dir yassin was not a massacre. the killing
was unintentional.

yes it was and no it was not. it was a massacre the murder of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting. the surviving men
were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head. not
intentional \? yeah right.

the village housed arab snipers and arab troops.

no it did not you have a source for this slander of course \?

thus it was attacked for its military significance. it was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.

the men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the
men. it was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.

to even compare dir yassin , in which some 120 or so arabs died , to the
holocaust is absurd.

on that we agree at least.

the irgun did not want to kill any civilians. the
village had almost 1000 inhabitants , most of whom survived.

yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.
this is of course simple to resolve , the haganah sent a soldier to report
on the massacre. he brought a photographer with him. he sent in a report.
the israeli government suppressed it. now the government was a labour
government. since then the revisionists have gotten into power but for
some reason likud did n't release the report and its pictures either.
perhaps you might want to tell me why \? if it happened as you claim then
there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied
behind their backs , no women and children shot as they slept. yet for
some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. you
have a reason for this do n't you \? i somehow doubt it. the facts are
exactly as the people responsible claim a premeditated mass murder
nothing else. no iraqi soldiers , no other fighting. just ethnic cleansing
at work.

there is not and was not any such thing like jewish killing in wwii

palestinians just did what davidians did for fourty years and more.

in fact no one was killed in any war at any time or any place.

people die that is all. no one gets killed.

maybe also vietamiese did n't die in vietnam war killed by american

harry.
this is such bullshit. deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on
the part of the jews , and a massacre defines it best in my
opinion. the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the
jews , a peace pact , but the irgun purposely broke this
agreement in order to scare off the palestinians. i might
grant that this village housed armed arabs i doubt it but
nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
this was a motivating force amongst the irgun. the deir yassin
massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
palestinians to flee the jewish homeland. , ...and contrary to
your belief , many civilians were killed. deir yassin was later
advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was
useful in getting many palestinians to leave. the palestinians
were rightfully scared off , because they did not want another
deir yassin.
i'm not necessarily condemning the israelites here
atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs.
israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
and were the good guys in the middle east. both arab and jew
suck equally.

try coming up with your own definition of any or all self hating peoples.
to me , any who reject their culture to the point where they only see the
absolute negatives of that culture (generally , or regarding a particular
event) and accept only those views purely opposing aspects of that culture
(thus , selective belief in use of historical facts and a complete ignoring
of context results) hate their culture.

i believe that things are getting mixed here.
critizicing israel and or being anti zionist is not seeing the absolute
negatives of that culture .

if that culture referred to is israeli , being anti zionist can be seen
as a complete denial of that entity 's right to exist and its legitimacy .
just as saying that islam has no right to establish and implement a
state that includes any non muslims , both are absolute , one dimensional
views of that culture with regard to the issue of state .

maybe , because a person can see the positives
of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
state of israel.

if that were the case , one would expect a few of that culture 's positives
to be discussed with regard to the issue at hand. since the issue centers
on israeli culture , i have yet to hear of any positives of that culture
in this discussion.

i , for one , consider the actions of the state of israel with respect to
the human rights of the palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
opposes what jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of
respect and what the jewish people learned about oppresion , segregation and
years in the diaspora.

i agree with you. but i also feel that when a culture feels it is confronted
by another group that wishes to see that culture disassembled , the first
culture has little choice but to try to secure its survival as well as
maintain its moral center. since the culture is not about to turn away
from either the matter of its survival or the valuing of its moral
principles , it has the virtually impossible job of balancing .

to discuss israel 's faults and crimes without any recognition of this
circumstance and reality it faces is a conscious decision based on the
discussant 's political biases , not on an honest and empathetically open
understanding of the situation. the same applies to those who attempt to
paint the palestinian movement as all bad and dispense with considerations
of the reality facing them.

that certainly describes elias ,
since he has no intention of recognizing that , alongside the palestinian
experience and perspective , there exists also that of israelis.

he might not want to recognize that. it does not make him a self hating
jew , as far as i see it. at most , he is a person who is not telling
the truth.

you beg the question by centering on the symptoms while the issue
of self hating addresses the motivations. i certainly feel that
anyone who expends so much effort inflating , distorting and robbing
human context from aspects of his her own culture is reflecting
a degree of dislike for it. since bits of that culture are bound ,
due to his her upbringing , to be a part of him her , a bit of self
dislike seems likely to be mixed in somewhere.

who is a jew \? a person whose integrity decays when unmoved
by the knowledge of wrong done to other people.
a. j. heschel

that is why i get moved when i see the israeli army killing people in
the occupied territories as much as i get moved when i see a plestinian
stabing people in israel.

and , this is precisely why israeli society has been tremendously harmed
by the actions it (its government) has felt it had to take in response
to an other perceived as a threat. just as with you , there has long
been a strident and emotional debate about the pain israelis feel when
forced to balance desires for survival and moral beliefs. the trauma
of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither
can be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political
debate) for the sake of the other , only reshaped.


but , so far , it seems that the blame is always put on the other .
if you read this newsgroup , for example , israel is never guilty by
herself. she is always responding to the actions of the other , and
it goes as if the actions of isreal do not also affect the response
of the other' in a cycle that never ends. also , there is blindness to
try to understand what the other feels and why.

as you well know , this process of blaming the other for the morally
questionable actions one side is forced (by the other , of course) to
take is thoroughly practiced by both sides . if you are only hearing
the pro israeli crowd 's self supporting arguments , that may be due to
the fact that you are not listening for anything else. i certainly
hear the similarly distorting pro palestinian pro arab element in
this newsgroup (as well as in soc.culture.arabic).

there is always and excuse. there is always a rationale to explain why
things happen as they do. and , what is the worst part for me , there
seems to be all the time an intention to try to de humanize the other ,
as if the other did not care about their future , children , peace , etc , etc.

aap

i agree , agree , agree , agree.

however , in my response to the initial discussion above between davidsson
and those opposing his presentations , i saw davidsson carefully putting
academic frills around a blatantly one sided series of i hate dislike
them , yesido , yesido , yesido. i did not find the approach of those
opposing davidsson to be centered at all on a denigration and denial
of the other side .

i certainly do wonder if the degree to which davidsson 's views on the
middle east have distorted is connected to his dislike and rejection
of his jewish lineage. having said this , however , i agree with you that
this constant accusing others of being self hating jews seems
pointless. it is not worse a label than is why , you 're on their side ,
except to perhaps imply a certain degree of overly enthusiastic
biasedness.

o.k back to reality

cairo , egypt (upi) the cairo based arab organization for human
rights (aohr) sunday called on king fahd of saudi arabia to order the
release of members of the kingdom 's first human rights group.

.....
among those group wants released was mohamed ben abdullah al masaari ,
spokesman of the committee for the defense of legitimate rights (cdlr).
al masaari was arrested just before dawn saturday at his residence in
riyadh 's king faisal university , where he worked as a physics professor ,
human rights and media sources reported.
the media reports said saudi security forces also seized
publications , books , correspondence and other documents and papers from
al masaari 's residence. he was reportedly taken to an unknown
destination.
the london based liberty human rights group claimed that the other
five members who together with al massari formed cdlr on may 3 , were
summoned for police questioning and might have been detained as well.
on thursday , the saudi government ordered the firing and disbarment
of the six activists because they established the group urging people in
the kingdom with grievances to report to cdlr.
four of the activists were sacked from their positions with two
state run saudi universities and two government departments , and two
lawyers , including al masaari 's father , were disbarred and their law
offices were closed , the aohr said.
the other lawyer , suleiman al rashoudi , was described by aohr as the
first ever to practice law in the kingdom.
aohr also claimed that about 400 other people might have been
arrested around the country in connection with the cdlr. they were
apparently people who have either responded to the group 's call for
reports on grievances or others closely linked to the founders.
saudi authorities were reported to have also been angered by reports
that al masaari and others have met with u.s. diplomats based in riyadh.
........
the kingdom 's highest religious authority , the higher council of
ulema (muslim scholars) , wednesday condemned the creation of the rights
group as illegal and unnecessary and warned of what it called
``regrettable ramifications'' the establishment of cdlr could have.
aohr , whose 1992 report listed human rights violations in saudi
arabia , criticized the ulema 's position and argued that the kingdom 's
islamic laws and courts did not preclude the creation of human rights
groups.

gaza city , israeli occupied gaza strip (upi) palestinian gunmen
sunday shot and killed two israelis who entered gaza to buy cheap
produce , and two arabs who were assisting them.
elsewhere in the crowded strip , israeli troops killed a 18 month old
infant and a 12 year old boy during rock throwing clashes at two refugee
camps.
can anybody guess this from the title \?

can anyone figure out what kind of deranged parent was stupid enough to
bring their infant on a rock throwing crusade (or jihad , sorry) \? 18 month
old infants certainly do n't walk around the streets on their own. that would
lead me to believe that some nimrod of a parent brought them along for a
little terrorism.

not me , i thought that a clash between israelis and arabs resulted
in four deaths on one side and two on the other.

thats what happened.

the drive by shooting outside the jewish settlement of gadid in
southern gaza prompted prime minister yitzhak rabin to warn israelis
they were ``endangering their lives'' by doing illegal business in the
occupied territories.

how about being illegally settled there \?
i am not sure about the signals the israelis are sending , one day
they are willing to accept a jordan west bank federation , the other
they do not recognize the west bank as occupied territory (neither
did the u.s , the honest brocker )
(details of the killings omitted , plo , hamas graffiti both claim responsability)

uhm , last i heard , the territories were disputed. israel 's occupation is not
illegal. they are legally allowed to remain there until a settlement is reached
with the arabs which , from the behavior of the palestinian negotitating team ,
will probably be never.

the israelis had entered gaza in a car driven by the man from hebron ,

now do n't tell me that this could not be an israeli spy.
we will know later.

huh \? they were buying vegetables.


which carried the easily identified blue license plates of arab vehicles
in the west bank. when israelis enter gaza with their own cars , which
carry yellow plates , they are usually stoned and burned by angry

palestinian residents.
now the upi shows its ugly face once and for all.
usually \?
it happened once this year , once last year. out of possibly thousands
or more. man how low can you get.

for those of you bigoted enough not to see what is transmitted here , i will
tell you something that is at least as close to the truth as the above
babies children who venture outside their homes are usually shot and killed
by the israeli soldiers.
....
army officials said the joint operation by members of the plo tied
fatah hawks and the hamas connected kassem brigade , arose from their
anger at the army 's killing of six fugitives from each group over the
past month.

hamid anybody has any information about the number of the people have been
hamid killed by israel during these 44 happy year \?

does anybody know how many jews , arabs , christians and others have died
in terrorist attacks and wars over these 45 years due to arab rhetoric and
rejectionism \? the number is probably close to 100 , 000 at least.

all these lives wasted because the arabs did not accept the partition plan
in 1947.

or , for that matter , with the usa. around here , nobody reroutes
freeways to avoid churches , synagogues , and so forth. they just
get condemned , paid off , and the road goes through. the same is
standard policy for any number of other public projects schools
and sports arenas being only two examples.

anticipating the objection that the cases are n't comparable how
not \? the wall has to count as the 1 tourist attraction in that
part of the world making room for the traffic would be a twenty
second decision for any city council i ever heard of.

the cases are n't really comparable. a project like a freeway requires
public hearings , court action , appeals , advance determination of
restitution , and so on. the razing of the moghrabi district in east
jerusalem happened within hours of the end of the hostilities of the 6
day war. the residents were given only two or three hours' notice to
pack up and find accomodations elsewhere. they had no chance of
public hearing , debate , appeal , negotiation or anything. it was get
out or die in the rubble.

i always believed the statement 'those who do not know their history
are condemned to repeat it (will durant \? ) , but i am beginning to
believe the opposite is true.

here in t.p.m and in other newsgroups it seems that history is
mainly remembered to foment hatred or to be used as a club. in the
history of my own people there are ample acts of shame , both done
by my people and done to my people. since i was not party to any
of those acts , i refuse to accept blame for the evil acts that my
ancestors committed , nor do i direct hatred toward the descendants
of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors.

the obsession with discussions of past (or present) events seems to be
largely centered on trying to prove that they are worse than us .
as we see over and over , that leads nowhere except to make ourselves
feel superior. it 's as if we 've become addicted to periodic injections
of self affirmation that draw their power from denigration of the
other and romanticization of ourselves. the hope is that we will begin
sometime to apply these discussions in some way towards consideration of
how to defuse the situation , advancement of negotiations and the search
for common ground between the parties involved.

of course , for this to happen we ca n't believe that the best path to
making ourselves feel better is at the expense of others. as long as
those valuing the coming together of opposing parties do not pursue
their vision with the same passion as do those polarization specialists ,
we will stay stuck in the circus of one upsmanship we now have. we 're
getting precisely what we are willing to work for.

serdar , how can a former government pay anything \? also what is this crap
about a genocide of muslims \? there was no such thing , i wo n't bother

there 's your problem right there. 'asala sdpa arf' crooks idiots stole
your brain. just watch...

source world alive , a personal story by robert dunn. crown publishers ,
inc. , new york (1952).
(memoirs of an american officer who witnessed the armenian genocide of 2.5
million muslim people)

p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).

'the most are inside houses. come you and look.'
'no , dammit ! my stomach is n't '
'one is a turkish officer in uniform. him you must see.'
we were under those trees by the mosque , in an open space....
'i do n't believe you , i said , but followed to a nail studded door. the
man pushed it ajar , then spurred away , leaving me to check on the corpse.
i thought i should , this charge was so constant , so gritted my teeth and
went inside.

the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes , and was dark at first , for
its stone walls had only window slits. rags strewed the mud floor around an
iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black
with soot. all looked bare and empty , but in an inner room flies buzzed. as
the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man 's body lying face
up , naked but for its grimy turban. he was about fifty years old by what
was left of his face a rifle butt had bashed an eye. the one left slanted ,
as with tartars rather than with turks. any uniform once on him was gone , so
i 'd no proof which he was , and quickly went out , gagging at the mess of his
slashed genitals.

p. 363 (first paragraph).

'how many people lived there \? '
'oh , about eight hundred.' he yawned.
'did you see any turk officers \? '
'no , sir. i was in at dawn. all were tartar civilians in mufti.'

the lieutenant dozed off , then i , but in the small hours a voice woke me
dro 's. he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. anyone keelhauled
so long and furiously i 'd never heard. then abruptly dro broke into
laughter , quick and simple as child 's. both were a cover for his sense
of guilt , i thought , or hoped. for somehow , despite my boast of irreligion ,
christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
have been.

from daybreak on , armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
the women plundered happily , chattering like ravens as they picked over
the carcass of djul. they hauled out every hovel 's chattels , the last
scrap of food or cloth , and staggered away , packing pots , saddlebags ,
looms , even spinning wheels.

'thank you for a lot , dro , ' i said to him back in camp. 'but now i must
leave.'...we shook hands , the captain said 'a bientot , mon camarade.' and
for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains.
like lot 's wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all , doubtless in
a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran.'

p. 354.

at morning tea , dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
high region called the karabakh. deep in tactics , they spoke russian ,
but i got their contempt for allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
of promises made by tribal chiefs. a campaign shaped more raids on
moslem villages.

p. 358.

it will be three hours to take , dro told me. we 'd close in on three
sides.
the men on foot will not shoot , but use only the bayonets , merrimanov
said , jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
that is for morale , dro put in. we must keep the moslems in terror.
soldiers or civilians \? i asked.
there is no difference , said dro. all are armed , in uniform or not.
but the women and children \?
will fly with the others as best they may.

p. 360.

the ridges circled a wide expanse , its floors still. hundreds of feet
down , the fog held , solid as cotton flock. 'djul lies under that , ' said
dro , pointing. 'our men also attack from the other sides.'

then , 'whee ee ! ' his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. bayonets
clicked upon carbines. over plunged archo , his black haunches rippling
then followed the staff , the horde nose to tail , bellies taking the
spur. armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war , even though
i heard our utica brass roar.

as i watched from the height , it took ages for djul to show clear. a tsing
of machine gun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed ,
dogs barked , invisible , while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
puddle. mist at last folded upward as men shouted , at first heard faintly.
the came a shrill wailing.

now among the cloud streaks rose darker wisps smoke. red glimmered about
house walls of stone or wattle , into dry weeds on roofs. a mosque stood in
clump of trees , thick and green. through crooked alleys on fire , horsemen
were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

'tartarski ! ' shouted the gunner by me. others pantomimed them in escape
over the rocks , while one twisted a bronze shell nose , loaded , and yanked
breech cord , firing again and again. shots wasted , i thought , when by
afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body. but these shots and
the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women 's cries.

at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward
djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and
tough , through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly ,
through alders , on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers in
arms were leading off animals , several calves and a lamb.

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

corpses came next , the first a pretty child with straight black hair ,
large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble
where meal lay scattered from the sack she 'd been toting. the bayonet
had gone through her back , i judged , for blood around was scant. between
the breasts one clot , too small for a bullet wound , crusted her homespun
dress.

the next was a boy of ten or less , in rawhide jacket and knee pants. he
lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the
pewter bowl he 'd carried , now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed
just below his neck , into the spine.

there were grownups , too , i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was
empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro 's german speaking
colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead.

p. 358.

...more stories of armenian murdering turks when the czarist troops fled
north. my hosts told me of their duty here to keep tabs on brigands ,
turkish troop shifts , hidden arms , spies christian , red or tartar
coming in from transcaucasus. then they spoke of the hell that would
break loose if versailles were to put , as threatened , the six 'armenian'
vilayets of turkey under the control of erevan...

an armenia without armenians ! turks under christian rule \? his lips
smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. that 's bloodshed just
smyrna over again on a bigger scale.

might serve as ways of escape for the turks

wow , if you were the only source of news around the
world it would seem that israel is being treated unfairly.

ok , you do n't like what i have to say. would you care to
demonstrate how the above list , or any expanded version of it you
chose to post , demonstrates fairness in the actions of the un wrt
israel \?

luckily , that is not the case. i suggest reading european
papers rather than israeli propaganda (arab papers would n't
hurt either to see the propaganda of the other side).

you make the odd assumption that i read israeli papers , not
european ones. my main source of news is the economist , a london
based magazine.

also , i do on rare occaisons , read arab papers , but its hard
to find english language papers from arab countries here.

anyway
you are an example of what happens when people chose what to
read. do n't get me wrong , it is perfectly within your rights.
just do n't go off acting like you 're objective.

have i ever claimed to be objective \? i pointed out , with a 27
item list , that israel is condemned for actions that other nations are
not condemned for. you go off and attack me for reading only israeli
newspapers.

if you 'd like to debate this , please do. if you 'd like to
make ad hominum attacks , feel free to do that too. but try not to

i agree with all you write except that terrorist orgs. were not shelling
israel from the golan heights in 1982 , but rather from lebanon. the golan
heights have been held by israel since 1967 , and therefore the plo could

there are basically three alternatives for gaza

what is this gaza \? are you purposely separating it from the west bank \?
if so , why separate the people and territories \? if not , why are you just
addressing gaza here \?

1. to throw the jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave
the middle east and go back to where they came from (russia , europe ,
usa , etc)

by all means , continue to list the etc. the reason i particularly
bring this up here is that there are many from middle eastern
and west asian countries. that fact in itself adds an important
element to any consideration of resolution of the arab israel
conflict.

2. to throw the gazans into the sea , in accordance with yitzhak rabin 's
wish and that of many zionists.

you explained what sea meant with regard to the israelis jews ,
please do so in this case.

3. for israelis and palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (i
do n't attempt to say just) settlement ,

just \? you better not ask for that because that would mean north
american tribes would be returned their lands , the pre islamic tribes
would take back their lands from the islamic invaders , the saxons get
to kick the normans out of the uk , the central and south american
tribes get to kick the spanish descendents out of thier lands.....
and , once we have returned the land to those who last possessed it ,
we have to find out from whom they stole it. at some point , every
culture stole the land they are on from previous occupants.

which would allow each person to live in dignity in his country in
freedom and equality.

but wait ! now you refer to palestinians , so what happened to gaza \?

i personnaly opt for the third alternative. how about you folks \?

as we both know , most people would choose the third alternative. and ,
since you have done so in the past , perhaps you would initiate things by
presenting your vision of resolution . in doing so , however , the worries
(not paranioas , worries ) and resonable expectations of both
parties should be considered.

i think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which
one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute
racial discrimination. these criteria are to be found for example in the
1. international convention for abolition of all forms of racial
discrimination (ratified by most countries)
2. the international covenant of political and civil rights
3. the human rights charter
4. the european convention of human rights

if one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these
legally binding instruments , and does not resort to sophistry , it is
obvious that the state of israel is guilty of racial discrimination.


the people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion
by the zionist regime are the palestinian refugees , some of whom live
under israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.

they are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole
reason that they are not jews. international law does not include any
provisions which permits such denial of rights , under any circumstance.
israel 's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. by allowing
the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in tel in any area of
the state of israel , the state would finally gain its legitimaty under
international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. it
would facilitate the peaceful integration of israel into the middle east
and constitute the best guarantee for permanent jewish presence
in the area. any attempt to create a separation , formal and human , between the
israeli jewish and palestinian arab communities , is fraught with
genociadal implications. i hope that u.s. jews , who sincerely wish that
peace prevail in israel palestine , will finally realize this fact.

tc do you , as i do , agree that this (sort) of peace process is needed \?

tc israel is (supposedly) going to propose good \? does it go too far \?
tc not far enough \?
tc if you do n't agree that a peace process is needed , what is \?

i personally think that a peace process is needed , since only through
negotiations will the future generations be able to live in stability.
unfortunately not all think like this , we have cases like
anas omran , hamza saleh , jle , mohammed reza , mehmed abu abed ,
anwar mohammed and others who think that jihad is the only solution.

if we ca n't avoid throwing out gut reactions to what we see as extremist
views here in the newsgroup , we 're certainly not going to be any better at
it in the real world. hey , it easy here. after reading the offending post ,
we can step back , take some deep breathing exercises , have a gallon of
ice cream (or sex , whichever calmsus) , and reply in something other
than the usual king of the hill mentality.

my view is that israel has made more gestures towards its arab foes than the
opposite. what have the sysrians given to us or proposed \? what have the
palestinians proposed \? if the palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their
charter , or just condemn acts of palestinian violence that would be a good
start.

perhaps , starting here with an immediate accusation is not a particularly
good way to generate open responses \? how about explaining what you see as
being israel 's real worries and how they need to be addressed \? since
the other side sees israel 's gestures in a completely different light
than you do , perhaps they also have real worries . from their point
of view , what are they \? how can those worries be addressed \?

the palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. its seems though
that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are
plagued by internal strife , that is why we are not getting anywhere.
fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories , then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of israel.

it is certainly much harder to reach compromise (or , even sit down
and talk with...) an other side which is fractured into several
different ideologies , each with its own set of demands . while it is
up to them to generate unity on their side , is there anything that
israel can do (without sacrificing its security , its position) to
encourage that unification along lines that israel prefers \?

arabs must take example on egypt. egypt came to the bargaining table ,
got what it wanted from israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries.
the tougher you play ball with israel the tougher israel gets.

coming from an idiot crook armenian , i 'd take that as a compliment.
your criminal grandparents committed unheard of crimes , resorted
to all conceivable methods of despotism , organized massacres , poured
petrol over babies and burned them , raped women and girls in front of
their parents who were bound hand and foot , took girls from their
mothers and fathers and appropriated personal property and real estate.
and today , they put azeris in the most unbearable conditions any other
nation had ever known in history.

they armenians traitorously turned turkish cities over to the russian
invader that they boasted of having raised an army of one hundred and
fifty thousand men to fight a civil war , and that they burned at least
a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population.

(responding to a discussion about a mosque in jerusalem allegedly
having been destroyed by israel)

bc in today 's jerusalem post magazine there is a feature story about the
bc ongoing restoration of synagogues in the jewish quarter. the author ,
bc leah abramowitz , writes that there were fifty seven synagogues in the
bc quarter in 1948 , all of which were destroyed , some , she says , used as
bc donkey stables. the building shells , that is.
bc
bc i still find it really , really hard to understand why the demolition
bc of the buildings in front of the kotel continues to evoke more outrage
bc than this. everything is so much cheaper when it happens to the jews.
bc
bc why \?

the double standard of human behavior regarding the jews must
be manitained.

a perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of
400 men who advocated murdering jews and destroying the state
of israel , compared to the deafening silence over the abusive
treatment of jews in arab countries during the past 50 years.

compare the tacit appoval that the world gives to muslims who
randomly murder jewish civilians to the righteous indignation
expressed if people in the occupied territories are kept from
working in israel in an effort to reduce these random murders
from occuring , while everyone knows that no country is at all
required to accept foreign workers , except israel , of course.

jewish blood has always been cheap. the non jewish world ha
never regarded any form of jewish suffering important , except
when the jews were the models of the powerless victim holding
the high moral ground , as it had been just after world war 2.
however , as soon as the jewish people started to take care of
themselves , the ancient hatred of jews was unleashed again.

i doubt if the non jewish world is even capable of having any
compassion towards jews as anti semitism is so ancient and so
basic to both christianity and islam.

golda meir said that there would be peace when the arabs love
their own children more than they hate the jews. and while i
know that there are more arab parents who love their children
than those who would send their children out into the streets
to throw rocks at men trained to defend themselves with guns ,
the world is so obsessed by a hatred of jews trying to defend
themselves that they have yet to even question the actions of
those parents who not simply allow their children to do this ,
but encourage them to throw themselves into harm 's way. even
arab children are expendable , if their tragic deaths are used
in the neverending propoganda battle to blame israel , and the
jews , for any misfortune befalling arabs in the middle east.

ed the following are quotations from zionist leaders. they appear in
ed numerous scholarly works dealing with the palestine question. i urge those
ed who have access to original sources , to verify the authenticity of the
ed source and post here their finding , adhering to the truth whatever it be.

it is your responsibility for posting quotes in context. your
phony 'research center' is the source of the most unscholarly ,
out of context , agenda ridden , and sophmoric propaganda that i
have ever seen. do n't believe me , folks \? let 's take a little
stroll through a few of elias davidsson 's contributions to our
understanding of the middle east.

ed quotations from zionist leaders

ed 1. there was no such thing as palestinians
ed (golda meir , prime minister of israel , london sunday
ed times , 15 june 1969)

and what do suggest that she meant by this \? do you think she
meant that the palestinians do n't exist \? or does it actually
mean that the people who self identify as 'palestinians , ' did
not appear to be a distinct ethnic group in the eyes of golda
meir \?


ed 2. there is , however , a difficulty from which the zionist
ed dares not avert his eyes , though he rarely likes to face it.
ed palestine proper has already its inhabitants.
ed (israel zangwill , the voice of jerusalem , london 1920 ,
ed p.88)

when this was written , seventy three years ago , the people of
the region were not all jews. they are not all jews now. no
jew but the most rabid bigot has ever called for an israel to
be only for jews. that was true then. it is true now.


ed the palestinians are beasts walking on two legs.
ed (menachem begin , prime minister of israel in a speech to
ed the knesset ,
ed quoted in amnon kapeliouk , 'begin and the beasts , new
ed statesman , 25 june 1982)

since you inserted the words 'the palestinians are' we cannot
know what begin was talking about.

for someone who wants to embellish his own importance with an
absurd pseudo organizational name like the 'center for policy
research , ' you are not a very honest person.


ed both the process of expropriation of the palestinians
ed and the removal of the poor must be carried out
ed discreetly and circumspectly .
ed (dr. theodor herzl , the complete diaries , herzl press ,
ed 1960 , i. , p.88)

herzl died eighty nine years ago. are you suggesting that he
has stated what is israel 's policy today \? have you ever seen
israel even entertain a policy to exclude non jews , let alone
actually try to remove non jews from israel \? if you actually
believe that this quote has anything to do with israel 's non
jewish citizenry today , you are an idiot. but if you realize
that israel has no intention of removing non jewish israelis ,
then you are nothing but a common liar. this one time i will
give you the benefit of the doubt , and assume you are stupid.


ed we shall try to spirit the penniless population the
ed palestinians across the border by procuring employment
ed for it in the transit countries , while denying it any
ed employment in our own country
ed (theodor herzl , the complete diaries , herzl press , 1960 ,
ed i , p.88)

once again you quote a man gone for almost a century. you do
so within the context of modern day israel.

thomas jefferson owned slaves. how does this fact define the
united states today \?


ed jews must expel arabs and take their place
ed (david ben gurion , 1937 , quoted in shabtai teveth , ben
ed gurion and the palestine arabs , oxford university press ,
ed 1985 , p. 89)

did he say 'jews , ' or did you add this \?

this was also a statement from ten years before israel became
a state. it has no bearing on israel.


ed we must do everything to ensure they the
ed palestinian refugees never do return
ed (david ben gurion , in his diary , 19 july 1948 , quoted in
ed michael bar zohar , ben gurion the armed prophet ,
ed prentice hall , 1967 , p.157)

you added the words 'the palestinian refugees.' and by doing
so , you are misleading people into believing that ben gurion ,
who was expressing his hope that people who fled their lands ,
at the encouragement of people such as king abdullah , and the
mufti of jerusalem , was gloating over people abandoning their
homes. what he was refering to were the arabs with whom jews
were at war.

ed the country was mostly an empty desert , with only
ed a few islands of arab settlement
ed (shimon peres , minister of defense , quoted in david 's
ed sling the arming of israel , weidenfeld and nicholson ,
ed 1970 , p.249)

at the time of the rebirth of israel this was certainly true ,
especially when compared to what israel has accomplished in a
few short decades.


ed all this story about the danger of extermination of
ed jews has been blown up....to justify the annexation of
ed new arab territories
ed (mordechai bentov , israeli cabinet minister , al
ed hamishmar , 14 april 1972)

since israel has not annexed even one millimeter of territory
in more twenty six years , this quote is irrelevant.


ed neither jewish ethics nor jewish tradition can
ed disqualify terrorism as a means of combat
ed (yitzhak shamir , hehazit , summer 1943 journal of the
ed lehi , the stern gang , translated from the israeli daily
ed al hamishmar , 24 december 1987

again , you are quoting a man who was fighting for what he had
been promised from a time as ancient as biblical , to the time
of the balfour declaration , just a few short years back. and
what was thought of and described as terrorism by jews did n't
include slaughtering olympic athletes , brutally murdering the
innocent , attacking school buses , and murdering another human
being for the sole reason that he or she is an arab.


ed the domination of jewish agriculture by arab
ed workers is a cancer in our body
ed (a. uzan , israeli minister of agriculture , ha'aretz , 13
ed december 1974)

there were serious concerns about a work force that consisted
of people from outside israel. it is a wise to be concerned.
a work force consisting of foreigners is not a good situation
for a country.


ed there can be only one national home in palestine ,
ed and that a jewish one , and no equality in the partnership
ed between jews and arabs
ed (montague david eder , president of the zionist
ed federation of great britain , 1931 ,
ed in doreen ingrams , comp. , palestine papers 1917 1922 ,
ed seeds of conflict , george braziller , 1973 , p. 135)

this also has no meaning for a country formed seventeen years
after this statement was made. obviously times change. this
is not what israel is about today. i believe the peace talks
make this quote irrelevant.


ed there is not a single jewish village in this country
ed that has not been built on the site of an arab village
ed (moshe dayan , ha'aretz , 4 april 1969...)

this is completely false.


ed some people talk of expelling 700 , 000 to 800 , 000
ed arabs in the event of a new war , and instruments have
ed been prepared
ed (aharon yariv , former chief of israeli military
ed intelligence , 1980 , inquiry , 8 december 1980)

expelled from where \? israel \? the occupied territories \? new
jersey \? is there any way we can read this and get an idea as
to what on earth he was talking about. obviously not.


ed we should there in palestine form a portion of the
ed rampart of europe against asia , an outpost of civilization
ed as opposed to barbarism.
ed (dr. theodor herzl , the jewish state , london , 1896 , p.
ed 29)

interesting notion. considering that this was written nearly
a century ago , it is quite visionary.


ed i deeply believe in launching preventive war
ed against the arab states without further hesitation. by
ed doing so we will achieve two targets firstly , the
ed annihilation of arab power and secondly , the expansion
ed of our territory
ed (menachem begin , in a speech to the knesset , 12 october
ed 1955)

this was said nearly forty years ago. begin is dead. and it
should be obvious to anybody that if israel was expansionist ,
it would have annexed the occupied territories right after it
captured them. israel would not be negotiating to get rid of
them.


ed during the last 100 years our people have been in a
ed process of building up the country and the nation , of
ed expansion , of getting additional jews and additional
ed settlements in order to expand the borders here. let no
ed jew say that the process has ended. let no jew say that
ed we are near the end of the road.
ed (moshe dayan , ma'ariv , 7 july 1968)

he 's dead , too. and since israel has not annexed any land at
all since 1967 , you are once again wasting bandwidth with all
of these misleading quotes. they are so out of sync with the
reality of israel , that you do nothing but make yourself look
like a fanatic desperate to sway people , by misleading them.


ed let us not today fling accusations at the palestinian
ed arab murderers. who are we that we should argue
ed against their hatred \? for eight years now they sit in
ed their refugee camps in gaza , and before their very eyes ,
ed we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in
ed which they and their forefathers have lived. we are a
ed generation of settlers , and without the steel helmet and
ed the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. let
ed us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting
ed and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of arabs ,
ed who sit all around us. let us not avert our gaze , so that
ed our hand shall not slip. this is the fate of our generation ,
ed the choice of our life to be prepared and armed , strong
ed and tough or otherwise , the sword will slip from our
ed first , and our life will be snuffed out.
ed (moshe dayan , eulogy of roy rutenberg at kibbutz nahal
ed oz , 1956 , quoted in uri avneri , israel without zionists ,
collier books , macmillan , new york , 1971 , p.154)

interesting quote. it 's true that we should never lose sight
of the plight of these people. we should also recognize that
this quote preceded the disgusting wave of arab terrorism and
violence directed at innocent people , that began in 1972 with
the massacre of the israeli athletes in munich , and continues
to this day.

if your ability to obscure was the equal of your desire to do
so , truthseekers in this group would have a problem. but you
are an easily recognized fanatic , whose stream of misleading ,
partial , and out of context quotes are totally unfettered by
the burden of truth.

contrary to ben gurion 's assertion , it must be affirmed that
during the 26 years of the british mandate over palestine and for
centuries previous , a productive human presence was to be found in
all parts of the negev desert in the very arid hills and valleys
of the southern negev as well as in the more fertile north. these
were the bedouin arabs.

in fact , this productive human presence in the desert has , in the
centuries it has been there , produced one of the greatest
civilizations in human history. they not only created the wheel , but
the printing press , the light bulb , post modern skyscraper
architecture , broadway theatre and nuclear power , as well.

the real desertification of the negev , mainly in the southern
part , occurred after israel 's dispossession of the bedouin 's
cultivated lands and pastures.

right , elias. the negev was a veritable garden of eden until the evil
jews turned off the rain and turned it into a horrible desert. part
of the international jewish conspiracy. say , who should i call to
turn off the rain here in ny , right now \?

nowadays , the majority of the
12 , 800 square kilometer negev , which represents 62 percent of the
state of israel (pre 1967 borders) , has been desertified beyond
recognition.

yeah , deserts rarely look like the garden of eden.

the main new occupiers of the formerly bedouin negev
are the israeli army the nature reserves authority , whose chief
role is to prevent bedouin from roaming their former pasture
lands

this is why nature reserves people are heavily armed with anti tank
weaponry. just what we need in the nature reserves.

and vast industrial zones , including nuclear reactors and
dumping grounds for chemical , nuclear and other wastes.

nothing like vast nuclear reactors when it comes to hiding them from
air attack. at least saddam had the sense to hide his cbn plants in
baby milk factories.

israeli
jews in the negev today cultivate less than half the surface area
cultivated by the bedouin before 1948 , and there is no jewish
pastoral activity.

indeed , many older people recall fondly those lovely tomatoes and
oranges that the bedouin exported form their garden of eden. in fact ,
that region used to supply the entire world with bananas , until the
jews pushed that business onto the banana republics .

i can defend myself quite well against pinkas , thank you.

there is nothing you need to defend yourself against. as i said
i just exchange ideas over the usenet with other people. i never

i am not a violent person , and i do not see how can anyone be threatened

i asked you to continue on email because i am not interested on a
flamefest , where you change my words or just make up some of your own

so , do not worry. you do not need to defend yourself because i am not

next time you try making such

may 13 , 1993 five russian soldiers sentenced to death in azerbaijan

moscow (upi) five soldiers who served in russia 's 7th army stationed in
armenia were sentenced to death in the azerbaijani capital baku thursday for
allegedly carrying out diversions and killing 30 azeri soldiers.

a statement released by the news service of azeri president abulfaz elchibey
said the sentence was final and was not subject to protest or appeal , the
russian state news agency itar tass reported.

but the russian foreign ministry issued an appeal for the men to be handed
over to the authorities in moscow for punishment.

this would accord with modern standards of humanity towards those who have
committed crimes , the statement reads.

the five men , together with another soldier who received a 15 year prison
sentence , were captured in september 1992 by azeri police in the kelbadzhar
district of azerbaijan , between nagorno karabakh and armenia.

the supreme court in baku said the men had gone through special training in a
company of the russian 7th army in the armenian capital yerevan , after which
they were sent across the armenian azeri border into nagorno karabakh to
carry out diversions against azeri troops.

however , the russian foreign ministry statement claimed they had deserted the
russian army and were fighting as mercenaries with armenian armed forces in
the battle zone round karabakh.

nagorno karabakh is an armenian populated enclave within azerbaijan which for
five years has been fighting for independence from baku in a war that has
left many thousands dead and uprooted hundreds of thousands from their homes.

both yerevan and baku have always claimed that russian servicemen stationed
in these caucasian republics , who were left behind after the break up of the
soviet union , are fighting as mercenaries in the karabakh war.

the statement from moscow said the russian side repeatedly appealed to the
azerbaijani government to show humanity and leniency in their treatment of the
six men , and to hand them over to the russian authorities.

it said that president boris yeltsin himself sent a letter with this request
to his azeri counterpart elchibey. itar tass said that the soldiers' defense
attorneys had lodged an appeal for clemency.

my recollection of history documentary books is slitely different.
it is my understanding that croats were allies of germany during
wwii , while serbs had sided with russia. as a result serbs did
take a beating from croats (not bosnian moslems) while germany
had the upper hand.

even today , russians consider call serbs as their slovac brothers.
this is one of the issues involved in the u.n. 's lack of active
intervention against serbs.

as for the bosnian moslems , i have not heard of any alliance with
germany or russia in recent history. therefore , i am curious
if they did or were able to treat other parties in this conflict
with same brutallity (as they are getting it today) in the past
history.

thus , while a war rages between serbs and croats as a continuation of
wwii , and older agenda , the annihilation of islam and muslims from
bosnian , is being carried out under the cover of the serbo croat war.


the annihilation of islam ( turks ) is an older serbian agenda. but
i strongly dispute your notion that croats had a similar older agenda ,
in fact , for the past century or two , croats and muslims have seen
themselves as having a lot in common , and they generally had friendly
relations. your suggestion that croat muslim relationship is
anything like serb muslim relationship is completely wrong.

to say that croats and muslims have a lot in common does not imply
they are not separate peoples. the events of the past two years
clearly show muslim determination to remain separate in their alliance
with croats , they maintained this separation. croats would have
accepted a much closer relationship , i think. this century plus
of building bridges between these two friendly peoples is now at
risk , because of the inexorable logic of war.

since bosnian serbs (32 of population) have 10 times more heavy
weapons than bosnian muslims (44 ) and croats (17 ) combined , they
have squeezed muslims and croats into only 30 of the territory.
muslims lost more territory than croats (who built defenses early on).

under these conditions , any alliance is bound to fall apart since
it is easier to recover lost land from croats than from serbs.
the only thing keeping this in check was the hope of reversal of
fortunes through foreign military intervention and lifting of the
arms embargo. since warren christopher had no luck persuading
the europeans to go along with this , this hope was dashed. having
no prospect of outside help , the former allies turned on each other ,
like two starved animals in a tight cage.

this inexorable logic , of course , got plenty of help from serbian
intelligence operatives , who were doing everything to build
mistrust between croats and muslims for over a year. a timely
intervention to stop serbian aggression would have prevented this.

sadly , nothing was done to create a balance of power on the
ground. as long as the serbs enjoy 10 1 advantage , they can
break any alliance , even among friends. this is tragic , but
hardly new divide et impera was used by ancient romans
with success. in my view , bosnian muslims and croats managed
to resist this divisive strategy reasonably well until may 9 , 1993 ,
when the hope of reversal of fortunes was lost.

i have a question for the distinguished diplomats do they
believe balkan peoples are experimental cannon fodder \? i 'd like to know
what did they expect when they decided to enforce the arms embargo which
solidified serbian 10 1 advantage in heavy weapons how did they expect
to prevent fragmentation of the muslim and croat defense forces and how
on earth do they hope to restore peace without justice \?

the implications of this immoral approach i cannot begin to predict ,
but i am filled with foreboding...

sincerely ,
josip

rabin 's plans for a palestinian police

(from the other front , alternative information center ,
jerusalem , 5 may 1993)

the decision to view the setting up of a local police force
for (sic) the palestinians as the central issue for
deliberation at the peace talks to be resumed next week
even before subjects like elections in the territories and
areas of juridiction in the framework of autonomy is a
sign of the israeli government 's serious attitude towards
the peace process.

the setting up of a police force is not part of the 'gesture
package' , but deals with the very heart and substance of
the palestinian struggle for national identity. as it turns
out , the main objective guiding the prime minister in the
setting up of a palestinian police force and apparently
also supported by foreign minister shimon peres is to
ensure the holding of democratic elections in the
territories.

thus writes amnon barzilai in his editorial (israeli daily
hadashot , 23 april) , and his position articulates the
thinking of most of the commentators who dealt with this
issue in the past two weeks. over against them stand the
settlers and rightwing parties , who also interpret the
decision to encourage the establishment of a palestinian
police force as a significant step towards the instituting of
real autonomy , something which will restrict what can be
done by the jewish settlers in the west bank and gaza
strip. with a variety of demonstrations , including street
theater on 'what will happen when there is a palestinian
police force' , rightwing elements are attempting to
frighten the israeli public and to pressure rabin to go
back on his decision. members of the kach movement
have even begun to organize a 'settler police force' in the
occupied territories , as counter balance to the future
palestinian police force.

however , as barzilai points out , the main function of the
new police force as far as the israeli government is
concerned has nothing to do with the settlers , over
whom they will apparently have no authority , but will
control political groups within the palestinian population ,
whom the government is interested in neutralizing.
writes barzilai

...according to ideas currently taking shape , the setting
up of a local police force in the territories will precede ,
not only the stage of electsion , but also the final stages of
the preparing of the interim autonomy agreement.

the willingness of the israeli government to set up a
local palestinian police force is evidence that the
government is serious about arriving at a settlement with
the palestinians...

it 's no wonder that the palestinian public is also greatly
worried about this new israeli initiative. and it is
inevitable that pressure will be brought to bear on faisal
husseini and the rest of the delegation members , from a
variety of directions , to refuse the gift which rabin would
like to give them. but at this stage , it looks like the
palestinians are cooperating in the fulfillment of his
plans.


add'l comment by e.d.
numerous palestinians fear that israel might succeed in
co opting some palestinian
circles by this idea. they fear that a palestinian police
force , controlled in fact by israel , might act even more
brutally than the idf. the idea of using a surrogate police
force is not new. it is used by israel in lebanon and was
used by the nazis to control jewish ghetto dwellers.

source hassan arfa , the kurds , (london , 1968) , pp. 25 26.

when the russian armies invaded turkey after the sarikamish disaster
of 1914 , their columns were preceded by battalions of irregular
armenian volunteers , both from the caucasus and from turkey. one of
these was commanded by a certain andranik , a blood thirsty adventurer.
these armenian volunteers committed all kinds of excesses , more
than six hundred thousand kurds being killed between 1915 and 1916 in
the eastern vilayets of turkey.

those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning
with the excuse of forced labor in road construction , they were taken
in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated. when the russian army
withdrew , a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian
massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells , they were locked
in houses and burned down , they were killed with bayonets and swords , in places
selected as butchering spots , their bellies were torn open , their lungs
were pulled out , and girls and women were hanged by their hair after
being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. a very small part
of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the
cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering
from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived
in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.
including women and children , such persons discovered so far do not
exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in
erzurum. all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled , everything
that the people had has been taken away from them , and we found them
in a destitute situation. at the present time , the people are subsisting
on some food they obtained , impelled by starvation , from russian storages
left behind after their occupation of this area.

i had received further very definite information of horrors that
had been committed by the armenian soldiery in kars plain , and as
i had been able to judge of their want of discipline by their
treatment of my own detached parties , i had wired to tiflis from
zivin that 'in the interests of humanity the armenians should not
be left in independent command of the moslem population , as , their
troops being without discipline and not under effective control ,
atrocities were constantly being committed , for which we should
with justice eventually be held to be morally responsible'.

armenian troops , who , having pillaged and destroyed all the
moslem villages in the plain....

caravans of refugees were in the meanwhile constantly arriving from the
plain , from which the whole moslem population was fleeing with as much of
their personal property as they could transport , seeking to obtain security
and protection...

p. 178 (first paragraph)

in those moslem villages in the plain below which had been searched
for arms by the armenians everything had been taken under the cloak of
such search , and not only had many moslems been killed , but horrible
tortures had been inflicted in the endeavour to obtain information as
to where valuables had been hidden , of which the armenians were aware
of the existence , although they had been unable to find them.

the armenians from the plain were attacking the kurdish line with
artillery , with probably a large force in support.

the arrival of this british brigade was followed by the announcement
that kars province had been allotted by the supreme council of the
allies to the armenians , and that announcement having been made , the
british troops were then completely withdrawn , and armenian occupation
commenced. hence all the trouble for the armenians at once commenced
the wholesale robbery and persecution of the muslem population on the
pretext that it was necessary forcibly to deprive them of their arms.
in the portion of the province which lies in the plains they were able
to carry out their purpose , and the manner in which this was done will
be referred to in due course.

the annihilation of islam ( turks ) is an older serbian agenda.

indeed , so was annihilation of germans during wwii. however , it is
important to quote adil zuflikarpasic in his interview to duga

had serbs wanted to exterminate muslims , they could have done it
after the wwi , when they were the most loved small nation in
europe.

serbs did not do that , although they supressed some rebellions
by albanian muslims and bosnian muslims quite bloodily. however ,

this is quite a misrepresentation. after wwi , many bosnian muslims were
killed and their land taken over by serbs , and the motive was plunder ,
not some fictitious supression of rebellion. even earlier , one can
point to the destruction of mosques in serbia itself and expulsion of
muslims. here is what dr. vaso cubrilovic , political adviser to the
serbian monarchic regime , says in his memorandum the expulsion of the
arnauts which he presented to the royal government of stojadinovic
on march 7 , 1937 , in belgrade

the mode of removal


describes how expulsion of ethnic albanians from kosova is to proceed
through state terror and private initiative , i.e. chetnik plunder

private initiative , too , can assist greatly in this direction. we should
distribute weapons to our colonists , as need be. the old forms of chetnik
action should be organized and secretly assisted. ...
...the whole affair should be presented as a conflict between clans and ,
if need be , ascribed to economic reasons. finally , local riots can be
incited. these will be bloodily suppressed with the clans and the
chetniks , rather than the army.

there remains one more means , which serbia employed with great practical
effect after 1878 , that is , by secretly burning down albanian villages
and city quarters.

(emphasis above is mine.) these events in serbia itself forced out virtually
all muslims during late 19th century. this policy of state terrorism
against muslims , aided by chetnik private initiative , has continued in wwii
and today. for example , muhamed hadzijahic in his book od tradicije do
identiteta geneza nacionalnog pitanja bosanskih muslimana (sarajevo
svjetlost , 1974) writes (pg. 235) how serbs killed a muslim in foca
in wwii even though he claimed to be a serbian patriot , explaining
their action as follows

inasmuch as you were a serb , you sullied the serb name , because you
are a turk i.e. muslim . and since you helped us , we shall not
torture you.

so the shot him instead of cutting his throat. in the past year , serbs
have repeated the slaughter of muslim residents of foca. destruction
of mosques , including priceless historical monuments , completes the
eradication of the muslim presence from territories claimed by serbs.


i strongly dispute your notion that croats had a similar older agenda ,
in fact , for the past century or two , croats and muslims have seen
themselves as having a lot in common , and they generally had friendly
relations. your suggestion that croat muslim relationship is
anything like serb muslim relationship is completely wrong.

to say that croats and muslims have a lot in common does not imply
they are not separate peoples. ....

how touching. i have nearly cried while i read this. unfortunately ,
mostly untrue.

which part do you claim is untrue \? explain yourself , or withdraw your claim.

croats from croatia mostly had no contacts with muslims , since they
were mostly dealt with extreme preudice long time ago. however
one of the main agendas is turning bosnia into purely catholic state.

croatia never had many muslim citizens for historical reasons , because it
was not a part of the ottoman empire. the last major battles between
austro hungarian monarchy and the ottoman empire in croatia were at the
end of the 17th century. need i remind you that modern croatian nationalism
came into being with dr. ante starcevic , who saw bosnian muslims as the
best croats , so much so that in 1853 he contemplated moving his operations
to sarajevo \? you are confusing clericalist croatianism with croatian
nationalism here. political nationalism has always been stronger. as
for your other theories , you are clearly overjoyed that croat muslim
alliance in bosnia herzegovina is now in trouble. arguments such as
yours are clearly intended to create and deepen this split.

i should add few more things. a.j. evans , in his on foot through
b h describes that catholic clergy in the last century was
apparently more scared by serbs , then by turks , because serbs were
growing stronger and , unlike turks , represented great danger for
idea of catholic bosnia. president tudjman clearly states in
his book that muslims do not exist as a separate nation from
croats and serbs , and he many times suggested , even in interviewes to
foreign papers , that solution is to split bosnia.

josip knows this and he is only working on the image of croatia.

in international relations 101 you 'll learn that unless weak unite to
counterbalance the strong player , soon they are taken over and that 's the
end of them. balance of power thinking has brought together croats
and bosnian muslims. this is only natural all other alignments are
unstable. i'm working on pointing out this basic fact croats and
muslims have been aware of it for as long as serbia has existed.
you are wrong if you think only image is at stake here. croatia has
a deep interest in her alliance with bosnian muslims , and vice versa.

i think tudjman understands this , although he does not have much choice
at this point. tensions should have been defused better earlier , before
any open confrontation developed. although i still think croatia will
survive , it will lose a lot but bosnian muslims may end up even worse
off. however , their position now is so horrible that perhaps they do not
see it getting any worse. the key point is do they still have any hope left \?
if not , then all bets are off.

mr. stojanovic is clearly very , very happy about this. i'm deeply hurt.
this is not about some image but about survival of a concept of a
partnership which i believe is natural and essential for both croats
and muslims.

sigh...

this is such bullshit. deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on
the part of the jews , and a massacre defines it best in my
opinion. the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the
jews , a peace pact , but the irgun purposely broke this
agreement in order to scare off the palestinians. i might
grant that this village housed armed arabs i doubt it but
nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
this was a motivating force amongst the irgun. the deir yassin
massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
palestinians to flee the jewish homeland. , ...and contrary to
your belief , many civilians were killed. deir yassin was later
advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was
useful in getting many palestinians to leave. the palestinians
were rightfully scared off , because they did not want another
deir yassin.
i'm not necessarily condemning the israelites here
atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs.
israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
and were the good guys in the middle east. both arab and jew
suck equally.

rj3s , you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the irgun
to attack dir yassin was its strategic importance. in fact , begin ,
who was in charge of the irgun , wrote that dir yassin was attacked for
its military significance.

dir yassin was merely a battle in the war of liberation. people died.
but the thing was never intended to be a masacre. that this hapenned
is a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun.

harry.


i agree with you harry , however you must also concede then that
arab terrorism is also a tragedy of war. remember that the
palestinians have no other effective target but civilians in
order to further their cause. if irgun had to attack civilian
targets to terrorize in order that they might obtain some
objective , i'm sure they would have done so. i also do n't
exclude irgun 's action against british soldiers as terrorism.
the british were showing signs of favoring a compromise with
regards to palestine , and the irgun and branch off groups made
a point to kill young british recruits so that mothers and
fathers back in britain would get angry at britains continued
presence in palestine. sounds like a form of terrorism to me ,
and not much removed from arab terrorism. we must not also
forget that irgun , or irgun branch off groups more likely
killed many jews who were not as hardline zionist as they , or
who cooperated with the british.
i 'll reiterate again.... both sides are screwy , but
i 'll favor the underdog in this case because i do think they
were a bit screwed.

peace talks resume today israel to offer palestinians new
proposals

israel radio , kol yisrael , reports on today 's resumption in
washington of the bilateral peace talks , following a recess which
lasted over four months. according to the report , israel is
expected to offer the palestinians new proposals regarding the
authority of the palestinian executive council , general elections ,
control over land and human rights issues in the territories.
israel will express its readiness to give the palestinians control
of more land than previously offered.

according to the radio
report , one estimate is that israel will give the palestinians
control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands , as
well as broad authority on water issues. israel will seek to
promote its offer to hold elections in the territories in hopes of
strengthening the position of the palestinian delegation to the
peace negotiations. according to israel radio , the israeli
delegation to the bilateral talks with the palestinians will offer
greater responsibilities to the palestinian executive council
allowing it certain legislative capabilities , without making it a
symbol for palestinian sovereignty. u.s. secretary of state warren
christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering
tonight. it will be the first such event since the madrid
conference. head of the american team at the bilateral peace talks ,
edward djerejian , said that tonight 's gathering is meant to
demonstrate the u.s.' active role in the peace process.

i hope , i hope , that we can begin to involve ourselves in the issues
and concerns related to this peace process. we have differing opinions ,
certainly , on these aspects but it is clear that we all share the hope
that resolution of the tensions and conflict will happen.

as we run to the defense of our side , there is no need to constantly
involve ourselves in name calling. all of us are regularly confused by
the other 's reactive posting because they spend most of the post
applying labels and presenting slogans than in just presenting their
honest views. then...when we react , we do the same thing.


do you , as i do , agree that this (sort) of peace process is needed \?
what about the particular points mentioned in the article \? is what
israel is (supposedly) going to propose good \? does it go too far \?
not far enough \?

if you do n't agree that a peace process is needed , what is \?

actually , just after the first world war , many muslims were killed by
serbs.
under serbian led regime between the two world wars , many croats were
also killed (especially during the dictatorship introduced on jan. 6 ,
1929).

josip ,

please , do n't be offended at this question who are the muslims in the
bosnian context \? i know that a moslem muslim is a believer in islam.
islam
is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. but it is
not
, yes definitely not , an ethinic group. ok ! so , these bosnian muslims ,
who
are they \? to which ethnic group do they belong \? what language(s) do they
speak \? do they have a different language from that of the serbs or
croats \?
the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this bosnian debacle
has
kept me wondering when the meaning of muslim moslem i knew from
childhood was
changed in the dictionary. this is just a question. no flames intended !

oguocha


you 've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide.
bosnian muslims are slavic in ethnicity. they speak serbo croatian. but
there is a christo slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are christian
and anyone who converted to islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion. see the poems of ngegos or the novels of ivo andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
the people (i.e. christian slavs). for this reason , the war criminals
call all the bosnian muslims turks even though they are not ethnically
turk and do not speak turkish as their first language. for this reason ,
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously other is called , paradoxically , ethnic
cleansing rather than religious cleansing.

thus , while a war rages between serbs and croats as a continuation of
wwii , and older agenda , the annihilation of islam and muslims from
bosnian , is being carried out under the cover of the serbo croat war.

regards ,

mike.

united nations (upi) the muslim dominated government in bosnia
herzegovina asked the u.n. security council tuesday to withdraw all u.n.
personnel from bosnian territory as a first step toward lifting the
international arms embargo against the former yugoslav republic.
the bosnian government , saying the presence of u.n. personnel had
become ``an impediment to critical decisions by the international
community , '' indicated the withdrawal of the peacekeepers and relief
workers would persuade western governments to lift the arms embargo so
muslims could defend themselves against bosnian serbs.

the security council imposed the arms embargo on the whole of the
former yugoslavia in 1991 when fighting erupted between serb

the imposed it knowing that serbia has a stockpile of weapons , and that
bosnia will have next to nothing to defend itself. many experts predicted
a massacre as early as march , 1992 , but the security coucil knew what it
was doing.

.......
france and britain have opposed u.s. proposals for military air
strikes against bosnian serbs , saying such strong action would lead to
retaliation against their troops and personnel.
....
the bosnian move tuesday was in part a bid to undermine the british
and french opposition to military intervention based on fears for the
safety of european peacekeeping troops and humanitarian personnel.
....
silajdzic 's ambassador to the united nations , mohamed sacirbey , who
conveyed the letter to the security council members , told reporters that
the peacekeepers' mandate should be modified or they should withdraw.
...
he said if the security council refuses to accede to the request , his
government will take ``another step.'' he did not elaborate on what
other steps the government might take.
..
in his letter to the council , silajdzic said president clinton
understood well the muslims' ``commitment and desperate plight'' because
the united states has been seeking support for lifting of the arms
embargo.
silajdzic said the international community has not realized that the
war in bosnia herzegovina was a ``war of fascist aggression'' and the
maintenance of the arms embargo was an ``act of arrogant indifference to
the fate of hundreds of thousands of loyal bosnian citizens , who plead
only for the right to defend themselves.''
``we beseech the security council to cease an arms embargo that has ,
in practice , constituted an international intervention against our
legitimate rights as a member of the united nations , '' silajdzic said.

now read this , tim clock co.
the request to the security council took some members by surprise ,
even though the complaints have been aired by the bosnian government for
some time. the only allies the muslims could find in the council are

non aligned and islamic countries , which have been calling for the

muslims' right to self defense , a provision enshrined in the u.n.
charter.

i do not want to convince anyone. this is just usenet , not the real

ideas. i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything.

fine. now if your opinion is n't convincing anyone , and it 's getting
refuted regularly by the facts (which is the case) , is n't it likely that
your opinions need some revision \?

as i said , i do not want to convice anyone , so , why should my opinions
convince anyone \?
i do not believe that my opinions are refuted by facts.

then you have n't been paying attention to the arguments levelled against
them. they have been , over and over again. they will be again.

first , and i repeat it , i never said that the idea of jews having the
right to have a state is racist.
zionism , as a movement , is more than just that idea.

in a word utter and complete horse puckey. look the term up in the
dictionary.

maybe youy view of a dictionary is the problem here. one thing is the
accepted meaning of a word by a dictionary , and sometimes a completely
different thing is what that word came to mean after a long time.

hey , what do you think dictionaries are for \? you quite obviously need
one. a good dictionary gives both , and you well know it.

i think that zionism
in the way it defines who is a jew , for example , is racist like.

ok , now how would you define it. and by the way , you 're wrong again.
there is no uniformity of this definition among zionist movements.
you know this is the case , it 's been pointed out on the net directly to
you before , and yet you continue to maintain this delusion.

ok. tell me how many people in zionist movements define a jew in a
different way , and how many are who define jew based on a religious way.

i do n't think that data exist on this directly.

in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do
not support the bombing and killing of the ira , i believe that jews have
a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now.

comparing the actions of israel to that of the ira is like comparing
those of the us to those of chile under pinochet (for example) , with the
ira in the role of pinochet. you really need to get your history
straight. you also need a basic dictionary.

you need to start reading before answering.
my point was that because some movement claims to be nationalistic , it
does not mean that i consider it to be nationalistic. i did not comapre
israel to the ira. i think that you are starting to put words on my
mouth and that is wrong.

that is no problem. but once again you are defining zionism as one
movement. you are implying that it is monolithic. you know this is
not and has never been the case.

stuff deleted by pinkas. his statement , which i was responding to
with the below , asserted that zionism was uniform and monolithic

i never said that zionism is monolithic. if you are going to attribute
me things , present the quotes where i said that.

you do n't say it directly. you implied it , and i showed explicitly
where and how you implied it. now you 're trying to wriggle out of it.
wo n't wash , and you know it.

that is what makes the basis for zionist movements. however , i am not
considering just that , but the rest of it.

in a word i do n't believe you. your words tell a very different
story. especially since they are not based on fact , but innuendo and
misrepresentation.

that is your problem. i could certainly interpret this like you are
running out of arguments. first , you put words in my mouth , now , you
say you do ot believe me.

it 's you , not me , who is running out of arguments.

which makes an interesting point. people living in a jewish state have
shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are
not the same. so , the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown
us that there are some problems in a state where 80 of the people is secular
but judaism is define according to religious standards , or where marriage
is a religious stage , or where the law of return defines a jew according to
a religious standard.

no , it does n't ! nowhere does the law of return demand that one must be
religious or even believe in g d to become a citizen of israel
thereunder.

why do n't you try reading for a change \? did i say that the law of return
demand a person to be religious \? now , how does the law of return define
who is a jew and who is not \? i said that it uses a religious standard
if your mother is a jew , you are a jew , if your mother is not jewish ,
neither you are.
do not twist my words , please.

what you said is that judaism is defined according to religious
standards. now this can have several different meanings , and you know
it. one of the meanings that it can have is to say that only those who
are religious are defined as jews . another is to say that only those
who meet the religious definition of a jew is one. and there are
others. i'm not twisting your words. i'm trying to make you aware that
your words do n't mean what you think they do.

true , there are debates in israel and abroad about who is
a jew \? , but those debates are taken up by both religious and secular.
would you say that religious people should not have a say in that \?
would you deny them their right of free speech \?

i am not talking about the debate. i am talking about how things are right
now. when the debate is over , i 'll see what happens.
right now , things are like they are.
let me ask you one thing. i understand that israel differenciates between
citizenship and nationality. suppose m(ale) and f(emale) have a child in
israel. which nationality will the child 's id show , according to each one
of the following cases

actually , it does n't. and the citizens' rights are exactly the same in
both cases , anyway.

a) f and m are both jewish.

jewish

b) f is jewsh and m is not.

jewish

c) f is muslim and m is jewish.
d) f is christian and m is jewish.

it 'll depend on what religion is practiced in the house. the original
law of return would still admit such a person if they were jewish , if
memory serves.

e) f and m are both non jewish.

not jewish.


did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become
non jews \? why should they still define then a jew based on what is a
religious definition \?

it 's called history. how do you think jews stuck together through
pogroms for millenia in europe \? we had to know who was our own. i for
one do think that some change is in order and that patrilineal descent
is no less legit than is matrilineal (which is not the religious jew 's
point of view). there 's plenty of room for that in zionism as you
well know.

it called history. at some point it was ok. now , i believe , it is not.

that 's valid , as far as i can see.

according to webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary , merriam webster inc ,
publishers , springfield , massachusetts , u.s.a. , 1986 , page 593 ,

hy poc ri sy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not.

so , saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people
having the right to nationalism , but disregarding the right of the palestinian
people to do the same , according to this dictionary , is hypocrisy.

utter baloney. by the way , i do believe the palestinians have a right
to self determination , have stated so on this net , and i know you 've

seen it.


interesting. how do you know \? had i ever talked to you about this and
forgotten about that \?

more than once. as have others.

but that right to self determination cannot be at israel 's
expense. israel 's security comes first and that security must be
maintained. you 're also twisting words now beyond belief. if you think
that 's what that definition means in this context , you need a first grade
course in english.


which definition are you now talking here about \?

the very one you give above. it is absolutely inconsistent with the
twist you put on it.

i do not know why you are so touchy. i never said that you did not support
palestinian self determination. i just gave an example of hypocrisy.

no you did n't. you had to twist the definition of the word 180 degrees
in order to do so , and everyone else knows it. i'm not being touchy.

i never
said that someone in this net is guilty of it. it was just an example. nothing
more , nothing less than that. why did you have to clarify what you think \?

because what you gave was not an example. it was an example of how
the definition of a word can be twisted around 180 degrees.

if you did n't use different meanings of words than are in the
dictionary , you might be believable.

here you have several problems.
first , you should know that words have more meanings than those given in
the dictionary.

oh , so now what are dictionaries for \?

second , it may come to be a shock for you to know that there are more
words than those in the dictionary.

duh. as a scientist , whose technical terms are very often not found in
common dictionaries , i know this. but when a term is common , like
hypocrisy , a good dictionary can be regarded as an authoritative source.

third , we can exchange ideas if you want , but you come out with this nonsense
about being believable using the definitions given in a dictionary.

it 's not nonsense. when people read what you write , they have to try to
associate a meaning to those words. dictionaries give the meanings of
words , do n't they \? now , i assume that you 'd like to have the words you
use mean what you 'd like them to. but the fact is , you 're using very
different meanings than are in the dictionary , or you would like the
reader to assign them new meanings , which they never had.

it seems that you cannot answer to the ideas given by others without insulting
others. sad.

not at all. what i cannot abide is utter bombast when you 've been
proven completely wrong.

if your facts at all resembled
even the slightest bit of truth which they do not you might be
believable.

if you did not put words in my mouth , it might be that you might
start reading what i had actually said.

i never put even one syllable in your mouth. you have tried to prove
this and you failed.

so far , you come over and over
twisting what i said or presenting things i never said as if i had said
them.

poppycock.

in this way , you are answering to yourself. that is why you do not
find it believable. maybe , if you start reading what i had actually said ,
and not what you added , you might change your mind.

i like what mr. joseph biden had to say yesterday 5 11 93 in the senate.
condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans
and calling that moral rape .


it is easy for sen. biden to say that when there are no us troops in
zepa or srebinica or sarejevo...

this is true.

the existing un policy may certaining be wrong , but the us wants
to dictate policy , and make europe responsible for the consequences
of that policy..

this has merit but is not entirely true.

...bosnia is a big enough problem for the us to preach about what
other countries should be doing with their forces...but its forces
are safely tucked away at home in the us.

gerald

this last statement is not true. according to the cbo the united states
has a force of about 88 , 000 us army personel in europe , i do not know
if this includes a usmc division in norway. they have available
a little more than 500 usaf attack aircraft , including various models
of the f 111 , a 10 , f 19a b , and a few f 4s. there are about 1 , 000
more of these available , safely tucked away at home. at one time , the
us maintained 1500 mbts about half were m1a1 but some of these were
relocated to the persian gulf. i know the us has at least one
aircraft carrier battle group nearby and probably a marine assault
brigade. does anyone know if there are any b 52 b 1bs in england \?

the point is , although there are no us ground troops in bosnia ,
it is not true that that all the american forces are safely camped
outside of st. louis.

i also understand that the administration is planning to position
troops in macedonia. any reaction out there to this \?

question day before yesterday i heard that serbia montenegro
had imposed additional trade sanctions against the bosnian serb rebels.
this morning a npr reported at a bridge on the drina (sp \? ) verified
that only a bread truck was allowed to pass through to bosnia.
a serbian who happened to be muslim , stated that just a few months
ago no vehicle even slowed for the boarder station. now everyone
is stopped and searched , many are turned back. of course all i
heard was a translators version , i do not speak serbo croatian.

if this is a effort on the part of serbia montenegro for whatever reason
to push the boserbs into accepting the v o , is this not a good thing \?

peace ,

this is not a fresh case of

every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and
destruction. the holocaust was not a fresh case. it was another
chapter in a 900 year history of attacks on jews in europe. that did n't
make it acceptable. and balkan history does not make the genocide against
bosnian muslims acceptable.

i guess that it was not acceptable because germany also chose
a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
other countries in peril. i wonder whether us or other countries
would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and
hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (i am no student of history
and i am just asking questions.)

actually , the record of the allies activities , in the face of
incontrovertible evidence as to what the nazis (may they rot in hell)
were doing , clearly points to the conclusion that they would have done
nothing. the railways to the camps were not bombed , despite the ease
of doing so. the us , the place of refuge allowed in a bare pittance
of jews from europe , primarily for public relations , so that the
government could say it was doing something . many ships with
refugees were turned away from us shores some found refuge in cuba or
south america , many others sunk or had to return to europe (with
predictable consequences). the hope today is that we have
collectively learned a lesson , and are less complacent to ignore other
countries' internal affairs . the sad reality is that this does not
seem to be the case.

now you are actually claiming that 2 , 000 , 000 muslims have been killed
in b h \? \? \?

please substantiate this utterly ridiculous claim.

no , i'm not claiming 2 , 000 , 000 have been killed. we are in the middle of
the genocide process that mr. major has given yet another green light
to. mladic seems to have most of what he wants , but boban is just
getting his appetite whetted. because mladic refuses to allow
international observers to inspect mass grave sites and killing centers
in places like foca , brcko , and visegrad , it will be years before we have
an accurate account of the number killed.

in practical terms , it would be impossible to kill all 2 , 000 , 000. there
just is n't the kind of machinery of crematoria and gas chambers and
transportation lines that the nazis took 8 years to develop. and
remember , the nazis killed minorities in the countries they occupied. to
actually kill 42 of the population requires extreme genocidal
organization.

but i do claim that the goal of the genocide is the systematic
annihilation of bosnian muslim culture , by killing as many as is
feasible , by rape , by torture , by the demolition of mosques , libraries ,
and culture artificts , the burning and renaming of villages , the shelling
of civilians. so that there wo n't be any of the 2 , 000 , 000 or so muslims
whose lives have not been shattered by the genocide , though they still
may be alive.

and mr. major not only finds this acceptable , he helps it along by making
sure that the victims do n't have arms to defend themselves.

the problem is that the blue berets in bosnia are dead meat if
clinton starts bombing , but clinton does n't have the courage to
ask that the blue berets leave , because then he becomes primarily
responsible to the bosnian policy of the un and the allies.
clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel
free to use american military power for the sake of domestic
us politics and his domestic image , but he does n't want to assume
the primary international leadership role in the un and among
the allies , like bush , for all his faults , did in the gulf war...
because with leadership comes responsibility , and clinton seems
to want to retain the europeans as scapegoats.


this is one of the most ridiculous arguments i have heard from the
europeans. let 's let the serbs massacre , rape , and ethnically clean
100 , 000 bosnians because we do n't want our pretty blue berets there
to get scratched . well , i say , get them the hell out of there if you 're
worried for them , but do n't deny bosnians their basic right to self
defense ! lift the embargo against bosnia , and let them defend themselves.
what makes the un troops more valuable than the bosnian people \? they
are letting the civilians die so the soldiers could survive , when
if anything , it should be the other way around. idiots like owen
expect bosnians to swallow a forced plan , and just hope this problem
will go away. well they 're wrong. if they had got their butts in gear
(that is , if bosnia had oil) a year ago , much of this could be prevented.
now , however , the results of this tragedy will last for generations.
that 's like forcing the jews to make peace with hitler. yeah right.
this , as senator biden said , reeks of bigotry , and makes me and any
decent human being for that matter , quite sick. it should be the
europeans , not the americans , who take the inititiative and ask the
other for support. this is their backyard , not the americans.
today it 's bosnia , tomorrow it will be kosovo and macedonia , greece ,
and then turkey , and the damn thing will spread. not to mention
european muslims who were n't even practicing before will rally to
fundamentalism. good luck handling that , your majesty ! owen was
upset at the question which compared him to chamberlain , who hoped
to appease hitler. he said that chamberlain had been in munich 2 years
before any war , i have been here during a blazing war for the last
18 months. well , that makes him even worse , because chamberlain could
have at least argued i'm giving germany the benefit of the doubt ,
whereas owen ca n't even do that. what the west is doing is aiding the
serbs by tying the bosnians' hands , and making the stupid excuse of their
powerless troops on the ground , who ca n't even protect the bosnian foreign
minister in their own armored vehicle , and watch the killers just walk
away ! what kind of peace is this \? what kind of civilization is this \?

clinton wants to leave the europeans in charge and responsible ,
but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets
too hot , he wants to be able to cut and run...the american public may
be easily fooled...european leaders are n't.

european leaders are pathetic , and are helping a genocide which even they
will not be able to forget. yeah , they 'll go to africa and fight for some
damn dictator in their former colony , they 'll go to kuwait and fight for
oil , but in bosnia not only they wo n't fight aggression , they 'll even
tie the hands of the victim. now you tell me who is fooling whom.

i 've read most of the history books dealing with this period ,
good and bad , and while it is possible that i missed one or two ,
none of those i 've read documents any razing of mosques. so i
think that this remarkable claim requires specific documentation.

for the forgetful newcomers , here are the references.

the reference i based my posting on originally is the book the west
bank story , by rafik halabi (new york harcourt brace jovanovich
1982. original title die westbank story).

quoting from the west bank story , pages 35 36
on the night of june 10 , an israeli officer marched from door to door
through the moghrabi quarter of east jerusalem giving the residents
three hours' notice to evacuate their homes.

... the participants in a
july 24 , 1967 meeting of a group of arab relgious and political
figures protested the immodest dress of israelis visiting the mosques
and the destruction of two mosques in the moghrabi quarter adjacent to
the western wall.

this issue has been going on for a while and your presentation here of
just one reference probably wo n't resolve this issue to those that
oppose your insistence that mosques were destroyed. even in your
location of this one reference , you spend most of your quote dealing
with an incidence that , while abhorrant , has nothing to do with the
issue at hand here. then , at the end of the quote , there is an almost
off hand comment that two mosques were destroyed.

tim , you 're missing the big sleight of hand here. i can accept every
word quoted from halabi and still have zero evidence of any mosques
being razed. note that what halabi refers to is not that mosques
were razed but that people protested alleged razing. too well we
know that this is a common demagogic tactic (or has anyone forgotten
the temple mount riots , when the moslem crowd was led to believe
that the israeli guards were there to cover for the tmf instead of
stop them \? )

to all muslim netters this is the same guy who gave a fatwah that
saudi arabia can be used by the united ststes to attack iraq .

they were attacking the iraqis to drive them out of kuwait ,
a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties
to saudi citizens. and me thinks if the us had not helped out
the iraqis would have swallowed saudi arabia , too (or at
least the eastern oilfields). and no muslim country was doing
much of anything to help liberate kuwait and protect saudi
arabia indeed , in some masses of citizens were demonstrating
in favor of that butcher saddam (who killed lotsa muslims) ,
just because he was killing , raping , and looting relatively
rich muslims and also thumbing his nose at the west.

the whole saddam is going to invade saudi arabia was nothing but us state
department propeganda. saddam (and iraq in general) never recognised the
british created kuwait. they were trying to recover land they believed
was theirs , much like the argentines in the faulklands. the kuwaitis pushed
just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he 'd settle
the dispute the old fashioned way...
everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited iraq
together and concentrated on taking out saddam. a strong , united iraq with
an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of
the feudal dictatorships in the gulf.
but of course a weak divided arab people better suits us foriegn policy...

the us had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill equipted iraqi soldiers ,
including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions
from the air in defense of kuwaiti oil , but it has yet to lift a finger against
bosnian serbs while they slaughter bosnian muslims....

i personally think that a peace process is needed , since only through

unfortunately not all think like this , we have cases like
anas omran , hamza saleh , jle , mohammed reza , mehmed abu abed ,
anwar mohammed and others who think that jihad is the only solution.

i wish that people (including myself) would have more objective views like tim ,
basil and shai for example and put the rhetoric aside and start discussing
substance .

my view is that israel has made more gestures towards its arab foes than the
opposite. what have the sysrians given to us or proposed \? what have the
palestinians proposed \? if the palestinians would just revoke or rewrite their
charter , or just condemn acts of palestinian violence that would be a good
start.
the palestinians have all to gain from these negotiations. its seems though
that they are not strong enough to make decisions on their own and are
plagued by internal strife , that is why we are not getting anywhere.
fundamentalism is slowly taking over in the territories , then it will be
too late to discuss issues with the palestinians since they will only
vow for the destruction of israel.
arabs must take example on egypt. egypt came to the bargaining table ,
got what it wanted from israel and there is now peace and cooperation
between the two countries.

2. people tended to think arabs are a united people in fighting isrealis.
after gulf war , seeing some arab nations beated up iraqis in order to

if you examine these i am
sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power
base that his jewish counterpart had.

right , arabs have been voting in israel for how long \? and in all that time
not one arab ever gained enough of a personal following to get his fellow
party members to put in a ministry \? this is about as likely as sprouting
wings and flying to rio. what basis do you have for explaining this odd
failure \? you seem very confident that you are right , exactly how do you
know , why are you sure \?

it has nothing to do with how long they have been voting , as much as how
they have been voting. pick up a list of the labor parties proposals
for mk prior to the election and pay attention to the order. correlate this
with the number of arab party members eligible to vote in party elections.
further correlate this with the voting results from arab areas.

lo and behold , you will discover that israeli arab labor party members
did not band together unanimously or en large for a select group of
arab candidates. this problem is further exacerbated by the rifts
between israeli arabs. some claim membership to right wing parties
while others vote for parties that do not pass the minimum cutoff.

i worked within the labor party during the late 70 's elections (not this
last one) as a volunteer and was privy to the voting results that
were returned from the local delegates elected. at the time , the system
was structured differently but it did not cease to amaze me that there
was no massive effort to lobby for arab reps. by their own delegates.

exactly what basis do you have for saying this when the labour party
has never put an arab into a cabinet post and insists its coalition
members do the same \? why and on what basis are you reassuring me in
the face of 50 years of discriminatory practise \?

quite simply , if all eligible arab voters became members of the labor
party and voted , they would be able to command more than 15 of
the delegates. this is a power base that can not be ignored !
especially when they are not ranked high in the party (once again
due to lack of political power). i have seen how the labor party
works from the inside and my experience has been that , as in most
political situations , the mks act out of their own self interest.

and to answer your question , i broke with labor because i felt
that they were heeding too much to the right wing and ultra orthodox
coalition members.

which represents the people of israel. we are not speaking here of
political discrimination which would be bad enough in itself but
of racial discrimination. the proof one of the compromises proposed
was that mk mahamid an arab yigal should be replaced by tamar
gojanski a jew yigal from the same party. it was not the member 's
party which was considered unfit , but his race...

fair enough. my take on the matter , and i will admit to the possibility
that this might be seen differently is that this was a dummy argument.
if he was sitting on the committee , then someone else obviously would not
be. in drumming up support for his seat , mk \? would not be averse to
using this argument , or it could be used on his behalf.

as to the proof presented in this article , i would find it very
interesting to know who proposed the compromise along with a followup
describing how the matter stands was resolved.

let me just take this opportunity to say that i deplore such actions
and groundless justifications.

a test of self confidence

by gid'on levi , ha'aretz , july 26 , 1992

but not to worry even now the jewish mind is contriving devices. the
new committee chair , roni milo , has already announced that he will set up
subcommittees aplenty for his committee. thus he will decide where it
is permissible for mahamid to participate and where not. a solution
such as this could , by the way , also have been adopted for the rest of
the committees , thereby completely eliminating the fear of state secrets
being leaked to the enemy and removing the stain of discrimination from
the knesset.

for the record , roni milo , is a brash mk (self described) from the likud
(note not labor). quite frankly , i do n't think anything he would say could
surprise me. annoy and aggravate , yes , surprise no.

do you accept that as documentation \?

yes i do and thank you for providing it. i would be most interested
in knowing how things turned out. anyone...... \?

there were a great many germans , poles and others who did not
sympathize with the victims of the holocaust but instead participated
with enthusiasm in the killing.

the holocaust was n't a massacre , it was n't even killing for sport it
was an entire industry of death. german engineers , architects
technicians and bureaucrats proudly put their best efforts into as
efficient and methodical a killing machine as they could devise and
operate. and it certainly was something extraordinary.

please do n't bleat to us about how the nazis suffered from the
holocaust.

i was n't implying that anyone suffered
more than the actual victims.

but what you did do , when waldo wrote

was correct him with
all humans suffered ...

so what were you implying \?

neither was i implying any

why is it that when someone writes something simple like all jews

biden spoke well. then there was john major , the architect of the
betrayal of bosnian muslims to genocide.

he basically has given yet another green light to hvo ustashe and
mladic chetnik serial killers , rapists , and plunderers to continue their
genocide against bosnian muslims.

but major met with mr. rushdie and said it was unacceptable that iran
should have a death decree on him. while i disagree personally with
fetwas against hack writers like rushdie (it only helps them sell more
books) , i find it interesting that mr. major finds the genocide of two
million muslims in bosnia acceptable , but a threat against one single
popular british writer unacceptable.

oh really ! let 's see. it costs the us armed forces roughly 25k in

actually , this strife in yugoslavia goes back a long way. bosinan muslims ,
in collaboration with the nazis , did to serbians after the first world
war what serbs are doing to muslims now. this is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred , destruction , ... not taking sides in this
perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry. it could just
be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does
not even know the meaning of the word.


what a lie.. ! ! \? \?

ask the victims of the nazis.
do n't take the bosnian muslims' word for it.
ask the holoucost survivors who helped them , you will hear that
the bosnian muslims (among others) helped them.

i also do object to the term ethnic cleansing , since what is happening
in bosnia is not ethnic cleansing , they all have the same ethnicity ,
what is different is religion. they are orthodox christians , catholic
christians , and muslims.

it 's religious cleansing.

also watching people being rounded up and slaughtered by the slitting of
the throat , raped collectively and systematically , driven out of their
homes by the millions ( ! ! ! ! ) , tortured in concentration camps , maimed

nothing in the history justifies what 's happening.

by robert i. friedman
the village voice , may 11 , 1993 , vol. xxxviii no. 19

how the anti defamation league turned the notion
of human rights on its head , spying on progress
ives and funneling information to law enforcement


roy bullock wanted to be a spy since he was a teenager in indiana and
read i led three lives , herbert philbrick 's cold war saga of
penetrating the communist party for the fbi. philbrick had become an
american folk hero in the 1950s for building dossiers on unsuspecting
colleagues. it was a time when hollywood produced more than 30 films
portraying the informer as the quintessential american patriot. in
boston , where philbrick led three lives as an fbi informant , communist
party member , and private citizen , the mayor even proclaimed a herbert
philbrick day and presented the spy with a plaque.

for bullock , a shy young man who was coming to terms with his
homosexuality in the straight arrow '50s , the life of a double agent
was the perfect way to hide his lifestyle while fighting the communist
menace.

i was fascinated with herbert philbrick , bullock recently told
federal investigators , and so i thought i would try to infiltrate the
communist part. in 1957 , i went to the sixth world youth and student
festival in moscow with the american delegation. i gave them the fbi
a full report on it when i returned , along with some photos i took of
some soviet military vehicles.

bullock was hooked. for the next two years , he worked as an unpaid
informant for the fbi. but he found his true calling when he became a
paid spy for the anti defamation league in 1960. now his activities
are at the center of the biggest domestic spy scandal in recent
american history a scandal that may end with the adl 's criminal
indictment in san francisco.

over a 30 year period , he compiled computer files for the adl on 9876
individuals and more than 950 groups of all political stripes ,
including the naacp , the rainbow coalition , aclu , the american indian
movement , the center for investigative reporting , pacifica , act up ,
palestinian and arab groups , sandinista solidarity groups , americans
for peace now , and anti apartheid organizations. bullock , who even
spied on the recently slain south african nationalist chris hani when
he visited the bay area in april 1991 , sold many of his adl files on
anti apartheid activists to south african intelligence. meanwhile ,
between 1985 and 1993 , the adl paid him nearly 170 , 000 , using a
prominent beverly hills attorney as a conduit in order to conceal its
financial relationship with bullock.

last month , police raided adl offices in los angeles and san
francisco , as well as bullock 's home , confiscating computer files and
boxes of documents. according to court records , bullock 's files
contained the driver 's license and vehicle registration information ,
in addition to criminal histories on individuals much of which was
allegedly stolen from the fbi and police computers. bullock , 58 , told
the fbi that copies of virtually everything in his computer data base
had been given to the san francisco adl office. based on the
evidence , says inspector ron roth , in a police affidavit , i believe
that roy bullock and adl had numerous peace officers supplying them
with confidential criminal and dmv information.

what 's more , the san francisco d.a. is investigating bullock for
tapping phones , accessing answering machines , and assuming false
identities to infiltrate organizations. documents seized from
bullock 's home also contained evidence of his forays into bay area
trash cans he had the names and phone numbers of employees at the
christic institute in san francisco , as well as telephone message
slips to staff members (including names and phone numbers of callers) ,
office correspondence listing the names and return addresses of the
senders , and inter office memos. he also had receipts from christic
institute 's bank accounts at wells fargo and eureka federal savings ,
as well as itemized canceled checks with the names of the payees , the
dates , and amounts. bullock even knew the balance in the christic
institute 's checking account.

investigations by the fbi and police in san francisco have revealed
that the adl has shared at least some of its spy gathering material
with israeli government officials. what 's more , israel apparently used
tips from the adl to detain palestinian americans who travelled there.



the adl was established in new york city in 1913 to defend jews , and
later other minority groups , from discrimination. it led the fight
against racist and fascist groups like the ku klux klan and the
american nazi party , and in the 1960s championed the civil rights
movement.

but there was also a darker side. in the late 1940s , the adl spied on
leftists and communists , and shared investigative files with the house
committee on un american activities and the fbi. the adl swung
sharply to the right during the reagan administration , becoming a
bastion of neoconservatism. to irwin suall , a repentant trotskyite
who heads the adl 's powerful fact finding department , the real danger
to jews is posed not by the right but by a coalition of leftists ,
blacks , and arabs , who in his view threaten the fabric of democracy in
america , as well as the state of israel. in the tradition of his
ideological soulmate william casey , suall directed the adl 's vast
network of informants , who were given code names like scumbag ,
ironside , and for a spy reportedly posing as a priest in atlanta
flipper.

for years , journalists and liberal members of the jewish community
knew the adl spied on right wing hate groups. as long as the targets
were anti semitic organizations like the liberty lobby and lyndon
larouche , no one seemed to be particularly troubled. but the bullock
case reveals that the adl also spied on groups that have a nonviolent ,
and progressive orientation. this apparent massive violation of civil
liberties may end with the adl 's criminal indictment in san francisco ,
where the investigation began. the human rights group faces possible
criminal prosecution on as many as 48 felony counts , including an
indictment for gaining illegal access to police computers. says one
source close to the west coast investigation , it is 99 per cent
certain that the adl will be indicted.

in the wake of the san francisco investigation , police probes of adl
spying are spreading to other parts of the country. we have received
numerous complaints about adl spying , says sam adams , a
spokesperson for the mayor 's office in portland , oregon.

on april 16 , the harlem based black united fund of new york , and
african american self help group that bullock allegedly spied on ,
wrote district attorney robert morgenthau , requesting an immediate
investigation of the adl. the adl 's actions cause great concern , as
it is a direct and flagrant violation at minimum of our civil
rights....we call upon you to join with the district attorney of san
francisco to...bring and end to this latest form of mccarthyism.

gerald mckelvey , a spokesperson for morgenthau 's office , says , we
have no evidence before us that warrants any sort of investigation.
mckelvey adds that morgenthau offered to assist the fbi and the san
francisco d.a. 's office on their pending investigation. they have
not , so far , asked for our assistance.

the adl acknowledges sharing information on violence prone groups with
law enforcement officials. it also admits to maintaining extensive
files on a wide variety of organizations , but says , in a two page
press release , the vast majority of adl 's files are composed of news
clips , magazine articles , books , journals , and other documents....

adl has made it clear that it does not and will not countenance
violations of the law on the part of anyone connected with the agency ,
and the process by which the league gathers information is presently
under review to insure that no laws are being violated.

that 's what the adl says for public consumption. but morale is so low
that its employees complain of sleepless nights and crying fits. and
even as other jewish groups circle the wagons around the adl in a show
of solidarity , many do so holding their noses. more than a few jewish
officials privately say the adl has to decide whether it is a human
rights group or a secret police agency.

the adl is regarded both inside the jewish community and outside the
jewish community as the definitive source of information on anti
semitism and extremist groups , says daniel levitas , the former
executive director of the center for democratic renewal , an atlanta
based group that monitors anti semitism , racism , and hate groups.
one of the things this scandal has done is that it has completely
tainted the adl 's credibility and reputation with regard to its
objectivity. this scandal is going to be a devastating blow to the
jewish community at large because people regard the adl as synonymous
with american jewry.



bullock 's talents as a snoop and his extreme conservatism meshed well
with the adl 's cold war worldview. in 1960 , he moved to southern
california where he became an adl spy for 75.00 a week. bullock
almost always used his real name when snooping , although he once
called himself elmer fink when corresponding with supporters of
alabama governor george wallace. bullock provided the adl 's office in
los angeles with written reports , which were transmitted to fact
finding department head irwin suall , according to court records.
under suall 's stewardship , fact finding department had become the
adl 's heart and soul. located at adl national headquarters across
from the united nations , the department had assembled a vast library
on hate groups , culling material from publications , speeches , and
informants reports.

bullock was more than adept at leading a double life. not long after
moving to california , he ingratiated himself with a woman in the john
birch society who helped him gain access to the group 's boston office.
there , he found a file the right wingers were keeping on the adl. the
discovery gave rise to speculation in the adl new york office that
they had somehow been penetrated by the birchers.

bullock focused almost exclusively on right wing extremist groups
until the early 1970s when adl l.a. head milton sinn was replaced by
harvey schechter , who encouraged him to target the left as well. a
few years later , bullock moved to the castro district in san francisco
where he posed as an art dealer. and adl fact finder who had
infiltrated the local arab community had just been exposed. when the
ensuing scandal died down , bullock was ordered by the adl to penetrate
the arabs.

the adl was especially concerned about the american arab anti
discrimination committee , founded by the former south dakota senator
james abourezk to combat arab bashing. in a page out of the cia 's
dirty tricks handbook on penetration and destabilization , bullock
joined the adc , and then recruited nazis into the group , apparently
trying to discredit it , according to published reports.

in 1987 , the adl sent bullock to attend the national association of
arab americans annual congress in washington. according to court
documents , bullock was told to find the source of the group 's funds.
bullock was unable to follow the money. but he did such a good job
at ingratiating himself that he was appointed to head a naaa
delegation that visited congress member nancy pelosi.

it 's not surprising that the adl penetrated arab organizations. but
only acute paranoia explains their interest in groups like act up. as
far as bullock was concerned , gay groups in san francisco were heavily
infiltrated by what he called gay left revolutionaries , prompting
him to write about their activities for the adl.

bullock soon expanded his horizons , moving into the shadowy realm of
foreign espionage after richard hirschhaut , the head of adl 's san
francisco office , introduced him to thomas gerard in 1986. gerard was
then a detective with the san francisco police department 's
intelligence unit. gerard had worked as a demolitions expert for the
cia in el salvador in the early 1980s , where he apparently had more
than a passing interest in right wing death squads. (police searching
gerard 's briefcase found extensive cia literature about torture and
interrogation , photos of blindfolded and chained men , as well as
passports made out to gerard in 10 different names , including thomas
clouseau. from a remote jungle island redoubt in the philippines
where he fled last november , gerard told the los angeles times that he
will blow the lid off the cia 's involvement with latin american death
squads if he is indicted in the adl spy case.)

after their very first encounter in the adl office , gerard and bullock
had lunch at mcdonald 's , i liked tom right off , bullock later told a
san francisco police investigator whose report of the interrogation
was obtained by the voice . tom is a very charming , roguish
character , with a great deal of integrity. let me say here , i
consider tom gerard one of the finest policemen i 've ever worked
with , absolutely. honest , capable , intelligent and 100 percent
american.

before long , bullock was providing gerard with confidential adl
reports on various groups and individuals. in turn , gerard gave
bullock classified police intelligence files on local arab americans ,
skinheads , and others. bullock told the fbi that gerard 's material
ended up in his adl reports. i would say 99 percent of the data that
i got was name , address , and sometimes physical description. criminal
history , very rarely , bullock told investigators. gerard also gave
bullock a chart that outlined a vast network of bay area arab american
businessmen and organizations that allegedly has ties to middle east
terror groups , as well as surveillance photos of arab americans
receiving weapons training overseas. bullock claims that u.s. customs
in new york gave gerard the photos. it was understood that bullock
would be very careful with what he did with the information gerard
gave him , and that bullock would not release it except to the adl or
other law enforcement officers , says an fbi report.

there was nothing unusual about bullock 's cozy relationship with law
enforcement. by the mid 1980s , the adl was swapping files with
hundreds of official friends , the organization 's euphemism for u.s.
law enforcement and intelligence sources. the adl 's relationship with
the fbi 's counterterrorism office was so close that adl 's reports on
arab american group 's covert ties to middle east terrorists were must
reading.

it 's no accident that police found a 1986 classified fbi report
entitled popular front for the liberation of palestine (pflp) new
york area while searching the adl 's san francisco office. in 1987 ,
adl spooks investigated seven palestinians and a kenyan studying in
california universities on student visas. when the adl discovered
they were disseminating pflp literature , it informed the fbi , which in
turn took the case to the immigration and naturalization service.
after the ins ordered the students deported as subversives , adl
regional director david lehrer gloated in the los angeles times
about his office 's cooperation with law enforcement , although he 's
backpedaling now. the los angeles 8 deportation is still under
appeal.



while the adl worked quietly with america 's top cops , it enjoyed
similar ties with israel 's spy agencies a charge that adl leaders
vehemently deny. but as early as july 7 , 1961 , adl director benjamin
epstein wrote to b'nai b'rith executive secretary saul joftes ,
requesting 25 , 000 for his investigators. our information , he
boasted to joftes , in addition to being essential for our own
operations , has been of great value and service to both the united
states department and the israeli government. all data have been made
available to both countries with full knowledge to each that we are
the source.

in 1987 , the adl came under fbi scrutiny in the wake of the pollard
spy scandal. while assigned to the navy 's anti terrorist alert
center , where he had access to the most closely guarded u.s. secrets ,
jonathan pollard stole thousands of pages of classified documents for
israel , which , according to federal prosecutors , could fill a room
the size of a large closet...ten feet by six feet by six feet.
pollard 's handler was avi sella , an israeli air force colonel whose
wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer. pollard later wrote to
friends that a prominent adl leader was deeply involved in the israeli
spy operation.

while there is no proof that anyone connected with the adl was
involved with pollard , there is evidence that the adl freely passes
information to israeli intelligence. in march 1993 , the fbi
interrogated david gurvitz , an adl fact finder in los angeles until
1992 when he was fired by suall for illegally obtaining police
information to use against a rival at the simon wiesenthal center.
the fbi pointedly asked gurvitz if he had ever transmitted information
to israel. gurvitz admitted that in 1992 he had learned from a law
enforcement contact that michael elias , allegedly a member of a
radical plo faction , was scheduled to travel from san francisco
international airport en route to haifa. gurvitz phoned the deputy
israeli consul general in l.a. with the information. later the same
day , according to a 15 page fbi interview of gurvitz obtained by the
voice , gurvitz was called back by another man , who said he was from
the israeli consulate , and who asked gurvitz to repeat the information
about elias. gurvitz did not get this man 's name , but their
conversation was in hebrew so gurvitz felt confident the man was
actually an israeli consulate official.

among the 12 , 000 names of private citizens that police found in adl
files in san francisco was mohammed jarad , a 36 year old chicago
resident who was arrested in israel on january 25 , for allegedly
distributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to hamas , the large
islamic fundamentalist movement in the occupied territories. the
chicago adl office runs at least three undercover informants who work
with official friends in local law enforcement , according to
documents released by the san francisco d.a. and sources close to the
adl. given these facts , arab american groups surmise that the adl has
passed information on jarad to israeli intelligence.

one technique used by the adl to monitor the large arab american
community in the midwest was to scan the local arab press for funeral
notices. according to sources familiar with the practice , adl
investigators in unmarked vans videotaped the palestinian funerals ,
which sometimes turned into plo rallies. palestinians have been
detained at ben gurion airport simply on the basis of having been
filmed attending a funeral in chicago , according to suhail miari , the
executive director of the united holy land fund , whose cousin was an
arab member of israel 's knesset.

shortly after jarad was arrested , the israeli government announced
that hamas was being run from america with money and operational
instructions relayed by courier or fax. israel 's charges were played
up on the front page of the new york times . according to well
placed sources , yehudit barsky , an adl fact finder in new york , worked
closely with israeli officials on this campaign of vilification ,
introducing friendly reporters to official friends in chicago law
enforcement.

barsky , who is fluent in arabic , prepared an adl report about how
hamas is funded in america. she identified the dallas based islamic
association for palestine in north america as the front organization
for hamas in the u.s.a. its infrastructure functions as an
interlocking network of organizations , small businesses , and
individual activists , says the february 1993 adl report , which
outlines the organization 's development , its activities on u.s.
college campuses , and its metamorphosis during the gulf war. it
also traces hamas fundraising through a plethora of alleged front
groups from plainfield , indiana , to culver city , california. it is
doubtful that barsky could have compiled such sophisticated data
without the help of official friends and adl spies.

barsky refused to comment. but she used to talk to greg slabodkin as
many as three times a week when he was an opposition researcher for
aipac , whose spy operation was disclosed last summer in the voice .
the level of cooperation was very close , slabodkin said during a
recent phone conservation from israel where he is in graduate school.
if we felt our files were lacking , we contacted the adl.

when sha'wan jabarin , a 30 year old palestinian human rights worker in
the occupied territories won a 25 , 000 reebok human rights award in
1990 , slabodkin recalls that barsky faxed aipac the man 's entire
police file , which she had obtained from the israeli embassy. jabarin
had been arrested numerous times in israel , and once confessed to
being a member of the plo after having been severely tortured.
jabarin , who received a short jail term , became an amnesty
international prisoner of conscience. of course , to aipac and the
adl , jabarin was a terrorist. slabodkin , who was ordered to keep tabs
on him when he was in the u.s. to receive his award , called a
representative of al haq , the palestinian human rights group that
employed jabarin , to obtain his itinerary. aipac even opened a file
on musician jackson browne , who presented jabarin with the reebok
award.

while the adl may be able to rationalize its close monitoring of
arabs , and even left wing gay revolutionaries , it has a far harder
time explaining its obsession with spying on anti apartheid activists.
david gurvitz told the fbi that when he started working as a fact
finder for the adl in l.a. in march 1989 , adl files already bulged
with information about the israel south african connection and anti
apartheid groups. gurvitz confirmed that the adl did routinely
collect information on persons engaged in anti apartheid activities in
the united states , says the fbi report. while gurvitz said there
were files in the l.a. adl office dating to the 1930s , he estimated
the oldest material on anti apartheid activities dates back to the
late 1970s , paralleling begin 's rise to power in israel and a
deepening of ties between the jewish state and south africa. in
about august , 1992 , says the report of the fbi 's march 3 , 1993 ,
interview with gurvitz , an anti apartheid demonstration was held at
the south african consulate in los angeles. participating in the
demonstration were the los angeles student coalition and the socialist
workers party. gurvitz went to two demonstration planning sessions ,
and a subsequent demonstration. he wrote a report for the adl on each
of the planning sessions and on the demonstration. copies of the
reports were disseminated to bullock , among others , in care of the san
francisco adl office.

in 1986 bullock learned that the consul general of the south african
consulate in los angeles would be speaking in las vegas at a meeting
organized by willis carto , the head of the anti semitic liberty lobby.
suspecting that the consul general did not know who willis carto is ,
says the fbi report , bullock suggested to gerard that they might want
to warn the south africans. gerard agreed and informed the consul
general , who canceled his appearance.

a few months later , gerard phoned bullock and told him a south african
intelligence officer wanted to meet them. during a rendezvous in a
hotel near fisherman 's wharf , the south african said he was interested
in acquiring information on american anti apartheid activists. the
south african , who called himself mr. humphries , also asked for
information about groups that were advocating divestments. gerard ,
who was present throughout the meeting , says the fbi report , told
humphries that he gerard had been employed by the cia....humphries
offered to pay bullock 150.00 per month in exchange for information.
bullock noted that much of the information humphries said he wanted
was already in the possession of bullock and the adl.

between 1987 and 1991 , bullock sold information to south african
intelligence , receiving steady raises , which he split evenly with
gerard. bullock said it was his impression , though gerard never
explicitly told him so , (and bullock never asked) that gerard may have
been telling the cia about his and bullock 's contacts with the south
africans , says the fbi report. gerard had said he knew the cia
'resident agent' in san francisco....once , after gerard dropped
bullock off at bullock 's residence following a meeting with louie who
replaced humphries as their handler , gerard said he was going to go
to the san francisco cia office.

al the while , gerard may have been tasking bullock for the cia.
bullock recalled that once , after he had met gerard , bullock went to
chicago , illinois to conduct an investigation on behalf of the adl ,
says the fbi report. the target of the investigation was a group
called the palestine human rights campaign. bullock learned that a
woman name deleted was transporting money between the plo or the
pflp , and the united states. bullock told this to gerard. gerard
later told bullock that gerard 's 'guy at the cia' would like to know
more. gerard asked bullock if bullock would go back to chicago to
gather more information on the palestine human rights campaign.
bullock , however , never did go back.

gerard also seems to have had a close relationship with mossad , which
may have started in 1991 when he went on an adl junket to israel. the
adl frequently sponsors trips for american law enforcement officials
to israel , where they are wined and dined and meet their counterparts
in various intelligence agencies. according to an affidavit by san
francisco police inspector roth , the all expense paid trip to
israel was more or less a thank you gift and a liaison gesture by the
adl to continue the close relationships it has with specific law
enforcement officers from the united states.

gerard may have liked what he saw in israel. a short time after
travelling there , he went to addis ababa where he helped with mossad 's
rescue of ethiopian jews.

as gerard 's relationship with south africa deepened , he talked more
openly about his exploits in the cia. bullock recalled gerard
mentioning that he had been in algeria on cia business , and that
gerard discussed the plo and 'safehouses , ' says the fbi report , to
this louie once responded that israeli intelligence had determined
that the plo and the african national congress were cooperating.
gerard also spoke of having travelled with the cia to afghanistan....
louie also told gerard and bullock about his adventures inside south
africa as an intelligence officer. both gerard and louie traded 'war
stories' and regaled each other and bullock with tales of 'narrow
scrapes.'

although there is still much mystery about what triggered law
enforcement 's investigation of the adl , it was probably the theft of
a classified fbi report on the nation of islam from the fbi 's san
francisco office. police armed with search warrants recovered the
report in the adl san francisco office. gurvitz says he had sent a
copy of it to mira boland , the director of the adl 's fact finding
division in washington , d.c. boland was preparing an op ed piece for
the washington times , in which she argued that the nation of islam
should not receive federal funds for the reconstruction of l.a.
because the group is anti semitic and violence prone. (boland , who
had arranged the adl police junket to israel attended by gerard ,
testified in a 1990 criminal trial in roanoke , virginia , that she had
worked for the cia for 14 months and later was a subcontractor for the
defense department before joining the adl. during the trial , boland
admitted to sharing information with a cia official at an invitation
only adl conference.)

after he was questioned by the fbi last fall , gerard fled to the
philippines , which has no extradition treaty with america. gerard is
believed to have supplied information from police computers not only
to the adl , but to israel and south africa as well. the san
francisco examiner reported that gerard may be charged with violating
federal espionage laws.

although bullock worked for the adl for 30 years , and irwin suall
praised him in a july 1992 memo as our number one investigator , the
adl now argues that he was a rogue agent. in its own defense , the adl
also asserts that its fact finders operate no differently than
journalists. after all , ask adl officials , do n't journalists keep
files \?

but the difference between the practice of journalism and the adl 's
method of gathering information could n't be more striking.
journalists place information in the public domain where they are held
accountable for falsehoods , distortions , and libel. and for the most
part , journalists do n't share their investigative files with foreign
and domestic police agencies. the adl has no such inhibition.
because many of its files are not open to public scrutiny , false
information collected by ideologically biased researchers cannot be
corrected. once a proud human rights group , the adl has become the
jewish thought police.

the adl says it 's a human rights group not just for jews but for
everyone , says chip berlet , a highly respected researcher at the
massachusetts based political research associates , which monitors
right wing extremist groups. that 's fine but it ca n't do that and
spy on palestinians. it 's blatantly unethical and frankly immoral.

my argument to people is that the adl wears four hats. each of the
hats independently is appropriate. it is a broad based human rights
group that looks at the broad issues of prejudice and discrimination.
it is a group that defends jews against defamation. entirely noble.
nothing wrong with that hat. it is a group , whose leaders , at least ,
consistently defend the actions of israel against its critics , which
again is entirely appropriate. and it is a group that maintains an
information sharing arrangement with law enforcement. again , there is
nothing wrong for a group to do that.

but you ca n't do all four. it is impossible to do all four and not
violate the bounds of ethics. there 's a built in conflict of interest
if you wear all four hats.

adl national director abraham foxman apparently sees no such conflict.
in a september 1 , 1992 , letter to the voice , foxman complained adl
has a proud 80 year record of fighting bigotry and promoting civil
rights and constitutional freedoms. any imputation of an effort or
motive on our part to smear or stifle the free speech of anyone is
false and baseless

throughout his pieces on aipac 's spying , friedman describes the
dissemination of information as if it were slander , and the existence
of files as a token of mccarthyite inclination. the depiction is
misleading in several ways. virtually every journalist , academic ,
politician and organization keeps files on subjects they deem
relevant tracing the logic of friedman 's reckless charges , the
library of congress is tantamount to the kgb. moreover , disseminating
the public record of a public figure is neither defamation nor
mccarthyism.

but many believe the adl is increasingly in the defamation business.
ask jesse jackson , james abourezk , or the leaders of the new jewish
agenda all past targets of adl smears. (at the same time , the adl
exonerated the fascist world anti communist league , which assisted
ronald reagan 's covert war against nicaragua , a policy endorsed by adl
leaders.)

in the early 1980s , researchers russ bellant and berlet asked to meet
fact finding head irwin suall , to discuss their work on anti semite
lyndon larouche. our view then of irwin suall was that he was this
really terrific investigator , says berlet. so we introduce
ourselves , say what we are up to and suall leans back in his chair and
basically runs down a dossier on each of us about what our political
activities are , who we work with , what organizations we belong to.
obviously , he was just trying to blow us away and he succeeds
admirably. we were just sitting there with our mouths open feeling
very uncomfortable.

and then he leans forward and says , 'the right wing is n't the
problem. the left wing is the problem. the soviet union is the
biggest problem in the world for jews. it 's the american left that is
the biggest threat to american jews. you 're on the wrong track.
you 're part of the problem.' we were stunned. i was virtually in
tears. this is not how i perceived myself. we basically stumbled out
of there in a daze.



letters (response to friedman 's article)

the village voice , may 18 , 1993 , vol. xxxviii no. 20

a league of his own

robert i. friedman 's assault on the anti defamation league the anti
defamation league is spying on you. may 11 demonstrates that he has
an axe to grind and his own prejudiced and biased agenda to promote.
it also demonstrates that concern for accurate reporting is far down
on his list. the story is replete with inaccuracies , innuendos , and
outright falsehoods , and conveys a picture of adl so divorced from
reality as to be farcical. friedman is even wrong on such basic ,
easily determined facts as where adl was founded (chicago , not new
york) and the building in which adl's san francisco office is located
(not the jewish community federation building pictured).

adl has done the work of fighting haters for 80 years , without
spying on organizations or individuals and with profound respect for
the law. our mission is to monitor and expose those who are anti
jewish , racist , anti democratic , and violence prone , and we monitor
them primarily by reading publications and attending public meetings.
through the years , we have published scores of reports on anti
semitism emanating from both the left and the right. in fact ,
although friedman 's bias leads him to assume the contrary , adl 's
primary concern is still the far right.

because extremist organizations are highly secretive , sometimes adl
can learn of their activities only by using undercover sources.
friedman 's hyperbole notwithstanding , these sources function in a
manner directly analogous to investigative journalists. some have
performed great service to the american people for example , by
uncovering the existence of right wing extremist paramilitary training
camps with no recognition and at considerable personal risk. the
information adl obtains is placed in the public domain , and through
the years adl has established a reputation for accurate reporting.

friedman 's article , by contrast , contains so much misinformation that
it would take an article equally as long to set the record straight.
a few examples he states that an adl leader was deeply involved in
the jonathan pollard israeli spy operation , and that pollard 's
handler 's wife worked for the new york adl as a lawyer. not true.
friedman also states adl investigators in unmarked vans videotaped
palestinian funerals. not true. elsewhere , he asserts that adl was
obsessed with spying on anti apartheid activists. again , not true.
we could go on and on and , of course , friedman does not reveal
his sources.

the distortion games friedman plays when he mentions numbers further
reveal his lack of objectivity. when it comes to how much adl paid
roy bullock a week as an independent contractor , not an employee
(an important distinction friedman also fails to make) he includes
the zeros ( 75.00 , 150.00) , inviting the reader to see a large
number. by contrast , when he observes that adl paid bullock nearly
170 , 000 between 1985 and 1993 , he chooses not to point out that
amounts to little more than 20 , 000 a year hardly an excessive sum.

what is accurate about friedman 's story is chip berlet 's description
of adl 's four hats. yes , adl looks at broad issues of prejudice and
discrimination. yes , adl defends israel against critics. and yes ,
adl maintains an information sharing relationship with law enforcement
regarding extremist activities and hate crimes. we see no conflict in
these four activities , and we believe most voice readers wo n't
either.

robert i. friedman replies

for the adl to compare itself to investigative journalists is absurd.
journalists do n't spy on arabs and anti apartheid activists and then
freely pass their files to south african and israeli intelligence.
but according to police the confessions of two paid adl investigators ,
buttressed by 700 pages of court documents and interviews , the adl
does. indeed , the adl spies on groups that are neither anti semitic
nor violent. police confiscated adl files on hundreds of mainstream
groups ranging from act up to peace now. respected intellectuals and
middle east scholars who disagree with the adl 's political views have
ended up on adl blacklists , their reputations smeared. private
organizations have no business paying operatives inside police
departments or having spies , says an april 17 editorial in the st.
louis post dispatch , condemning adl spying. on april 10 , police
armed with search warrants raided adl offices in san francisco and
l.a. after concluding that adl employees were apparently less than
truthful in voluntarily turning over documents during an earlier
search , according to san francisco police inspector ron roth 's sworn
affidavit. roth also asserts that bullock was a paid employee for
the adl. if so , by failing to pay taxes on 170 , 000 of income paid
to bullock , the adl could face a total of 48 felony counts , according
to court papers. the adl may also face felony charges for illegally
obtaining confidential information from police computers. as for
errors the adl was founded in chicago , and moved to new york in
1947. but it was an original tenant in the san francisco building
shown in the voice photo , moving out a few months ago. i never
wrote that an adl leader was deeply involved in the pollard
israeli spy operation. i reported that pollard himself made the
charge. and in court papers , pollard 's own lawyer said that the wife
of pollard 's handler worked for the adl. if i have a bias , it is on
the side of the first and fourth amendments.

it seems that terrorism against their own co nationals has been a prominent

organized to fight the turks , these chieftains have been more successful
in their fight against their armenian opponents in turkey , and the caucasus ,
very often defenseless and innocent.

p. 38.

the fact remains , however , that the leaders of the turkish armenian section
of the dashnagtzoutune did not carry out their promise of loyalty to the
turkish cause when the turks entered the war...and a call was sent for
armenian volunteers to fight the turks on the caucasian front.

thousands of armenians from all over the world , flocked to the standards of

during the first world war and the ensuing years 1914 1920 ,
the armenian dictatorship through a premeditated and systematic
genocide , tried to complete its centuries old policy of
annihilation against the turks and kurds by savagely murdering
2.5 million muslims and deporting the rest from their 1 , 000 year
homeland.

the attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of genocide in the 20th century acted upon an entire people.
this event is incontrovertibly proven by historians , government
and international political leaders , such as u.s. ambassador mark

the new vice premier plans to intensify the work on the attraction of
western investments

baku (may 19) turan yesterday , rasul guliyev , the recently appointed
vice premier of the republic , received the us ambassador in azerbaijan ,
richard miles. as azerbaijan newspaper informs , the issue of attraction
of western investments in azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. in
particular , gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in
the most profitable spheres of manufacture. he also noticed , that the number

the proposal to summon special session of the supreme soviet is rejected again

baku (may 19) turan yesterday , in the sitting of the milli mejlis ,
the chairman , isa gambar , rejected the proposal of the deputy arif
rahimzade to summon a special session of the supreme soviet of azerbaijan.
this written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. but
the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal could n't
be submitted for discussion.
earlier , the leadership of the milli mejlis called the proposal to summon
a special session of the supreme soviet a coup attempt. but the deputy for
the parliament , rahimzade , does n't consider that the deputates have the
objective of removing milli mejlis and its chairman from the power. it concerns the
serious analysis of the social , economic and foreign policy activity of the
republic 's authority. rahimzade said that the deputates for the parliament ,
ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion
on these questions.
the supreme soviet of azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago ,
when it attempted to bring ayaz mutalibov back to the power.
the functions of s.s. were handed over to milli mejlis , consisting of 50
deputates (25 democrats and 25 partocrates ). at that time democrats and
partocrates came to an agreement that milli mejlis would n't exist for a long
time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. at the same time ,
the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon
a session of the supreme soviet any time and went in for political activity out
of the parliament. 0


the prospects of trade economic cooperation between azerbaijan and estonia

baku (may 19) turan the prospects of signing trade economic agreement
between azerbaijan and estonia were discussed in the meeting of the foreign
minister tofig gasimov with the group of experts of the ministry of economics ,
minister of foreign affairs and estonian bank administration on may 18.
the group of experts is headed by tikht reiman , the chief of the ministry of
economics of estonia.
the mia of azerbaijan informed turan agency , that in their stay in baku ,
the delegation will also visit ministry of economics and national bank of the
republic. 0


azerbaijan does not intend to join the cis common economic zone

baku (may 19) turan deputy prime ministers of the republic , vahid
ahmedov and abbas abbasov declared that azerbaijan would n't join the cis
common economic zone.
vahid ahmedov considers that the cis economic zone proposal to create a
common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic.
according to abbas abbasov , the pact of cooperation proposals , submitted for
the discussion of the leaders of cis states in moscow on may 14 , has a number
of unfavorable points for azerbaijan.
such announcements of two deputy prime ministers sound sensational on the
background of the fact that the president of azerbaijan and the chairman of
the parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the cis economic
zone. 0


the questions of granting credit to azerbaijan will be discussed in moscow

baku (may 19) turan today , azerbaijani delegation headed by the director
of the foreign relation department of the ministry of finance of the republic
along with the representatives of the national bank will leave for moscow to
hold consultation with russian government on granting credit to azerbaijan.
according to the preliminary information , the credit will be 50 billion rubles.
as press centre of ministry of finance informed turan 's correspondent ,
precise amount of the credit , conditions of its repay and a number of other
questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in
moscow. it is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling
of industrial enterprises of azerbaijan and russia.
when the sides reach the agreement , it is proposed for signing by the end
of may. 0


azerbaijan will reply to the second variant of trilateral initiative by 26 of
may

baku (may 19) turan on the measures for peace presented by russia ,
turkey and the usa to azerbaijan and armenia , the representative of the
president of azerbaijan in the talks on nagorno karabakh , asim gasimov noted
that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.
just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by
insistence of the armenian side. we do not intend to come back to the analysis
of the schedule , because we have given a positive answer to it on may 6 , said
gasimov.
the representative of the president of azerbaijan informed that they just
began to work on the examination of the commentary , and their answer would be
given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by may 26.

armenia , which put forward a number of pre conditions for its acceptance. 0


the announcement of the prosecutor of the republic of azerbaijan

baku (may 20) turan the azerbaijani prosecutor 's office has announced
that the russian mass media 's attempt to portray the 6 russian soldiers
condemned by the military board of the azerbaijani supreme court , as innocent
people is unjustified.
accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves ,
prove that their crimes were committed together with the armenian military units
and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the russian army unit , where they
served.
the announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers
as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the russian army are also
unfounded. for there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the
list of one of the military unit 's of russian commandos in yerevan.
certain russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of
the russian army in the undeclared war of armenia against azerbaijan from the
russian community. azerbaijan 's prosecutor 's announcement follows , that this
type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated. 0


azerbaijan's parliament intends to appeal to russian parliament regarding the
six accused soldiers

baku (may 20) turan as turan agency was informed , parliament of azerbaijan
is considering the question of appealing to russian parliament about the six
accused soldiers' fortune. in particular , the offer to send the representatives
of the commission on military affairs of the armed forces of russian federation
to baku for the detailed study of the results of six russian soldiers' case will
be directed to russian parliament.
according to one of the supporters of this offer , such initiative will give
russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the
investigation. there will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have
given rise to the present situation that is the russian troops participation
in the war against azerbaijan.


armenians are preparing more karabakhs on the north caucasus

baku (may 20) turan the national liberation front founded by group of
armenians living on the north caucasus appealed to establish armenian autonomies
on the territories of rostov , stavropol and krasnodar regions , reported the
newspaper russky vestnik on march 9 , 1993 published in geneva.
the north caucasus is regarded as an integral part of armenia in the
documents of this organization. admitting the non realizability of reunion of
the north caucasus and armenia proper at present , the front is appealing to
the un , presidents of russia , armenia and the united states to consider the
need to establish armenian autonomies on the caucasus.
to attain these goals , the armenian organization considers it necessary to
carry out on the north caucasus the forms and methods of activity identical to
those in nagorno karabakh . besides the decision to fund cells of armenian
national liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of
armenian terrorist groups in greece and iran to sent to the north caucasus
instructors for training of armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.
thus according to the newspaper russky vestnik , new karabakhs are
being planning on the north caucasus. o


state assistance for national minority development

baku (may 20) turan the meeting headed by the state secretary of
azerbaijan , ali kerimov , with the participation of the national cultural
centers was held in baku. the first results of the realization of the president
elchibey 's decree on state assistance for the development of language and
culture of national minorities adopted on september 16 , 1992 were considered.
the state secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a
legal democratic state. he confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership
of azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all
nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.
the state counsellor of the president of azerbaijan on the national policy ,
hidayat orujev , announced that in spite of the difficulties of the undeclared
war against the republic , the leaders of the state managed to solve many
problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic
groups.
for today , all 33 national cultural centers registered by the ministry of
justice in the capital of azerbaijan are provided with accommodation , furniture
and means of communication. all the accommodations are rent free ( 8 foreign
diplomatic missions in baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of
free accommodations including the representation of the un general secretary).
as it was noted , a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted
to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. on the north of
azerbaijan where lezghins live , a national lezghin theater was opened ,
radiocast is transmitted in lezghin. the work over the creation of the
educational literature for talyshs , tats , lezghins and kurds and national
teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the academy of sciences

memorandum of cooperation on extracting oil gas fields of azerbaijan was signed

baku (may 20) turan as turan agency was informed in the state
concern azerineft , the memorandum of understanding with the companies
amoco caspian sea petroleum , bi pi exploration operating , pennzoil
caspian , unocal khazar ltd. , mcdermott and turkish oil corporation on
mutual extracting of fields azeri , chirag and gyuneshli was signed.
according to the memorandum , the general group on preparing of a common
program of activity was created.
according to the president of azerineft , sabit bagirov , cooperation
will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently.
during the project , the main principles will be the effective use of
oil gas resources , the rational sharing of investments , the reducing of
exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of azerbaijan from the
exploitation of these fields.
the memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical
and political economical interests of azerbaijan under optimum use of oil gas
fields. o


armenia taking advantage of the prosecution of six russian soldiers

baku (may 21) turan after azerbaijani court passed sentence on
six russian soldiers fighting on the armenian side in karabakh ,
armenian propaganda has become actively involved.
the armenians living in russia appealed to the president yeltsin
with a request to display firmness in asserting the rights of russian
soldiers . at the same time , armenian mass media call legal proceedings
on the case in baku as a farce aimed at getting more arms from russia .
the karabakh armenians have issued a threat recently. if one could
believe the yerevan agency snark , the armenians in karabakh presented
an ultimatum to authorities in azerbaijan. the essence of this ultimatum
is that if russian soldiers are not shown mercy , three azeri prisoners in
karabakh will be shot dead.
it is simple to explain such touching attitude of armenians to
the six russian soldiers' fate. if by chance the sentence is executed
it will cause not anti azeri but anti armenian reaction , as the accused
russian soldiers were recruited in yerevan by the former defence minister
of armenia and then transferred to karabakh.
if the soldiers get mercy , armenian side will think highly of its
saving of lives of innocent russians . o


new provocations of armed forces of armenia

baku (may 21) turan according to the defence ministry of
azerbaijan on may 20 21 , the firing on the territories of azerbaijan
from the military bases on the territory of armenia was in progress.

nyachaflar of zangelan district of azerbaijan were under fire from
kafan district of armenia. two inhabitants were wounded , there were
destructions in the villages.
on may 20 , the firing on the villages of bashkend , mutudere ,
shynykh , novosaratovka and novoivanovka of kedabek district of
azerbaijan from the positions of armenian armed forces was in
progress.
at the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of
armenia (50 60 men) violated the frontier of azerbaijan , penetrated
into the territory of kedabek district of azerbaijan , killed two
shepherds at the village of aili dara and made an attempt to take a
flock across the frontier. azeri frontier guards stopped the enemy. o


unocal company will build 50 houses for refugees in azerbaijan

baku (may 21) turan as turan agency was informed by the
representation of unocal american oil company , the leaders of this
company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of
50 houses for refugees.
at present , the american side suggested a village project for
consideration by appropriate departments of azerbaijan. the project
is a farm village where each house has a personal lot , subsidiary
accommodations and so on.
according to the program the construction and putting into
operation of the village will be this year. o


manat is beginning to fall in value

baku (may 21) turan lately , at the black market of baku , the
national currency manat , fell in price compared with the russian
ruble. thus one gives 1100 rubles or 120 manats for one us dollar.
taking into account the official exchange value of the manat with
respect to ruble which is 1 10 , the national currency fell in value
10 percent. meanwhile the exchange value of the manat to the ruble is
the same at banks , state establishments and in trade.
according to the representatives of the business circles and
experts , the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles
are bought by the local businessmen. they need rubles for financial
operations in russia. as the remittance of payments from the republics
of the former ussr to russia is a great problem now , many businessmen
arrange deals in cash. taking into consideration the volume of business
with russia , counted by billions , it is not hard to imagine how much
rubles in cash the businessmen need. o

baku (may 22) turan according to the president 's decree , the
expert group , including representatives of the parliament and
presidential apparatus , are working out new wording of the constitution

isa gambar suggests that azeri russian parliament commission for
clarifying the circumstances of the criminal case be created

baku (may 22) turan the chairman of the milly mejlis of the
azerbaijan republic , isa gambar , sent the return letter to the chairman
of the russian supreme soviet ruslan khasbulatov in connection with
the conviction of the russian servicemen lieutenant v.semion , sergeant
k. tukish , m.lisov and a.filipov by the military college of the
supreme court of azerbaijan.
in his letter , isa gambar suggested that the commission of azerbaijan
milly mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the russian supreme
soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal
case. in his view , the conclusion of the commission could help in the
objective solving of this problem , as well as such kind of problems
in the future. but the main thing is , it could help to promote the
knowledge about involvement of the russian servicemen in crime .
in its turn , in connection with the russian parliament message ,
milly mejlis adopted a resolution on may 19 , according to which the
permanent commissions on government building and legal policy , human
rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of
this problem. 0


will the trilateral initiative be ruined \?

baku (may 22) turan as turan agency was informed , russian representative
to the talks on karabakh , vladimir kazimirov , doubted in realization of the
trilateral initiative. he expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with
the representatives of azerbaijan. at the same talk he declared , that in case
the peace process deadlocked , russia would pursue yeltsin 's initiative itself.
such statement from the russian diplomat , who is one of the authors
of the trilateral initiative , suggests that the russian leadership is
paving the way for complete exclusion of the usa and probably turkey from
the peacemaking process. this statement can also mean , that russia and
us having achieved understanding on bosnian problem , have agreed on partial
us departure from transcaucasia. 0


fate of 645 million tons of oil will be decided this summer

baku (may 22) turan the president of azerbaijan state oil company ,

ramco have an interest on development of these three richest caspian
fields.
according to the plan , socar and bp statoil are to sign a complete
treaty on development of chirag field on june 16. later amoco and
pennzoil will sign treaties.
specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645
million ton. 310 million of them fall on azeri field , 180 mln.ton
on geneshli and 150 mln.ton on chirag.
the exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to
bring in azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. in addition to the net
economic profit , baku calculates upon the political support of the west in

1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for azerbaijan and its
independence and we have to stand these tests . 0

baku (may 22) turan as the press service of the president of azerbaijan
informs , today , the appeal of the institute of the government and law of the
russian academy of sciences to president elchibey was received.
the appeal contains the call to display mercy , humanism and clemency
on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the russian armed
forces .

participation of the russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people ,
do n't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence , denounce
the mercenary according to the un principals , and they are sorry about the
russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.
at the end of their letter , scientists , mentioning the soldiers'
mothers' tears and grief , their praying day and night of safety , ask the
president of azerbaijan to save those guys .
it should be noticed , that unlike lawyers , soldiers' mothers ,
taking part in the inquiry , called the cause of their grief only
russian policy. according to their words , the leaders , that lay down
lives of russian men to achieve their political aims , must be made
answerable.

azeri prime minister is leaving for great britain

baku ( may 22 ) turan the minister of foreign economic relations ,
rauf garayev , in his interview to turan agency said , that
great britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of azerbaijan
after iran . the business cooperation between the two countries
develops in such spheres as oil industry , the manufacture of oil
extraction equipment , communication and agriculture.
according to the minister 's words , the forthcoming visit of
azerbaijani prime minister , panah huseynov , to great britain on may
23 24 , is very important. it is expected , that the visit will
help , to solve the problems of opening in azerbaijan the branch
offices of some british banks , insurance firms to conclude
contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment on
building in azerbaijan off shore oil platforms , and reconstruction of the
entire communication system of azerbaijan.
in garayev 's view , the expansion of the cooperation with great britain
will have a great political meaning for azerbaijan.
according to politicians and reviewers in baku , at present , great
britain as an european state is close to azerbaijan. the continuation of
the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. o

pp. 108 109

unlike the plo 's almost exclusive focus on civilian targets , the
100 troups from the irgun and stern group that struck at deir yassin
on april 10 , 1948 , targeted the village for its military importance.
deir yassin was on the road to jerusalem , which the arabs had
blockaded , and it housed iraqi troups and palestinian irregulars.
snipers based in deir yassin were a constant threat to jewish citizens
in jerusalem.

arab civilians were killed at deir yassin , but that attack does
not conform to the propaganda picture that the arabs have tried to
paint. the number of arabs killed was generally reported to be about
250. in 1983 , however , eric silver of the guardian (britain)
interviewed a survivor , mophammed sammour , who testified that 116 out
of a population of 800 1000 were killed. 'about three days after the
massacre , ' sammour explained , 'representatives of each of the five
clans in deir yassin met at the moslem offices in jerusalem and made a
list of the people who had not been found (alive). we went through the
names. nothing has happend since 1948 to make me think this figure
was wrong.'

unlike the plo 's deliberate attacks on civilians , the killing of
civilians at deir yassin was not premeditated. the attackers left open
an escape corridor from the village and more than 200 residents left
unharmed.



why does this remind me of bosnia and ethnic cleansing \? \? \? \? \? \?



tippu



after the remaining arabs feigned surrender and then fired
on the jewish troops , some of the attackers killed arab soldiers and
civilians indiscriminately. independent observers told the guardian
that among the bodies they found arab men disguised as women.

themselves to the german war effort. derounian says that

dashnag armenians from france bore the mark 'legion

that nazi armenians like dro 'the butcher' and nezhdeh sided
with the germans probably had an impact on the decision of
armenians who overwhelmingly opted for armed service.

may 1942 and may 1943. altogether twelve armenian battalions served the
nazi army , if battalion ii 73 , which was not employed at any time , is to be

while having collaborated with the nazis against stalin during the
second world war , nazi armenians changed their policy after hitler 's
defeat. they now backed stalin 's claims on eastern turkish provinces ,
hoping that these would be annexed to soviet armenia and their muslim
population would be exterminated. stalin played on armenian national

for his imperial ambitions. 1 stalin 's ultimatum to the turkish

well everybody ,

after reading tons of notes by serdar , i have come to the following conclusion.
turkey is perfect , and no turk has ever made a mistake. he has proved to me at
least that the land occupied by turkey today , was always lived in peacefully by
turks. (including istanbul aka constantinople) they treat their minorities
like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked
them. somehow , despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder
their population has exploded to almost 60 million in turkey alone. (note ,
armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total) i want to go
to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made serdar possible , that
has persevered , and has become a mecca for human rights lovers. (amnesty
international must have bad sources , turkey would never torture its citizens ,
treat minorities badly , or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone , who
incidentally are still missing) , what i am trying to say is i want to be a
turk ! ! ! !

now back to reality. i have once again been astounded by serdars ability to
ignore all truth , all truly difficult questions , and go on to his encyclopedia
of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note by the page ! anybody at
all who has believed anything he has said , please step forward. let him know
he has n't been wasting his time , that somebody out there can be convinced by
the volume of e mail you can produce , not the quality of the content. well i am
off now. i will go dream some more about that perfect place , that nirvana ,
that utopia , that xanadu , that turkey !

oguocha


you 've asked a crucial question that underlies much of the genocide.
bosnian muslims are slavic in ethnicity. they speak serbo croatian. but
there is a christo slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are christian
and anyone who converted to islam thereby must have changed ethnicity by
changing religion. see the poems of ngegos or the novels of ivo andric
who brilliantly displays these attitudes on the part of what he calls
the people (i.e. christian slavs). for this reason , the war criminals
call all the bosnian muslims turks even though they are not ethnically
turk and do not speak turkish as their first language. for this reason ,
what is actually a genocide labeled against those who are ethnically
identical but religiously other is called , paradoxically , ethnic
cleansing rather than religious cleansing.

you are somewhat close to truth. but you should n't forget that
nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. in the
days of the ottoman empire , the religion was the main point of
difference between social classes. the ottomans did n't recognize
turks , arabs , greeks , serbs... just christians , muslims , jews...
so , for all the interested parties in the ottoman society the
bosnian muslims were turks . after all , there are n't many real
(ethnic) turks living even in turkey today. even in europe , it 's
the culture that defines the ethnicity and religion is part of
one 's culture.

thus , while a war rages between serbs and croats as a continuation of
wwii , and older agenda , the annihilation of islam and muslims from
bosnian , is being carried out under the cover of the serbo croat war.

can you support this \?

bye ,

our headquarters for a considerable time , and therefore went
to some trouble to make it habitable. we had a most peculiar
little locomotive , originally built in america for the russian
government , adapted to burn either wood or oil one covered
truck as men 's quarters one similar , which i fitted up for my
self and a railway officer and also a truck to carry wood , three
cars being the utmost our small engine could pull. with this
small outfit we started , rumours of all kinds reaching us before
our departure indicating that the whole situation was rapidly
coming to a head , it being evident that the turks were becoming
more and more restive in the face of the inexplicable delay of
the allies in reaching any definite decision with regard to the
future.

travelling on this little war time railway was indeed an
experience , and it was necessary to carry a gauge , and to
test the rails with it frequently , for in many places , owing to
the sinking of the embankments and the washing away of the
ballast , the rails required rectification before we were able to
get our train over , even at a foot pace each bridge also re
quired elaborate examination before adventuring the train upon
it , and eventually we were obliged to carry large baulks of tim
ber to temporarily shore up many of the bridges and culverts
whilst we passed over them.

under these circumstances it may be imagined that our prog
ress was by no means rapid , and as we had frequently to halt
also to replenish our supply of wood fuel , we considered we
had achieved wonders when , on the evening of the second day ,
60 hours and 70 miles out from erzeroum , we finally entered the
gorge of the mountains where we understood our worst troubles
to lie. this is the same gorge into which the road from
erzeroum to kars descends from the foot hills to cross the
frontier the railway , however , follows the main aras river val
ley till the frontier gorge enters it , whilst the road cuts off the
corner and joins the rail again at the frontier post of zivin ,
some 15 miles from the main valley.

soon after entering the gorge , we were confronted by the
first serious fall of rock about 2 , 000 tons having fallen from
the cliff face and entirely obliterated the railway track. here ,
therefore , we halted , and , sending our engine back , prepared to

the whole saddam is going to invade saudi arabia was nothing but us state
department propeganda. saddam (and iraq in general) never recognised the
british created kuwait.

this is complete garbage. it is kuwait faq number 1 (maintained , but
not compiled , by me to rebut the leftist drivel frequently posted wrt
kuwait)



first is a note on the bogus arguments that the british
drew the maps to deprive iraq of oil. then follows a
chronology of events in kuwait 's history. following
the chronology is a speech by the kuwaiti ambassador
to the u.n.. following this is an article on the origins
of kuwait. following this is a series of articles
which attest to the fact that kuwait was independent of both
(non existent) iraq and the ottoman empire.



the iraqi regime claims that kuwait was cut from iraq by the british
in order to deprive iraq of its oil. the 1913 and 1932 border treaties
between kuwait and iraq represent clear testimonies against such an
allegation since oil was discovered in kuwait in 1938 !

from kuwait , facts and figures , 1986.

shedding some light

on september 29 1990 , the national council on us arab relations
invited the kuwaiti ambassador to the united states , saud nasser
al sabah. the following are quotes of his speech

``kuwait itself was an entity identified as kuwait even before
iraq was identified as iraq in the ottoman empire. kuwait was in
existence since 1752. we continued to be in existence until the
conflict between the ottoman empire and the british and others in the
area. thereafter , we signed with the british in 1899 a protective
agreement whereby the british guaranteed the sovereignty and security
of kuwait.''

``in 1913 , the british and the ottoman signed an agreement defining
without any doubt the borders of kuwait as they stand today. such an
agreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the kuwaiti government
and the iraqi government at that time. that is when iraq became a state ,
after kuwait itself.''

``in 1961 , when we declared our independence iraq seized the
opportunity to claim kuwait as part of iraq. there were threats. the
british came in , and arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of kuwait. in 1963 , kuwait and iraq again
signed border agreement , thereby defining our territory and iraq 's
recognition to the sovereignty and territory of kuwait.''

origins of kuwait

the establishment of kuwait is attributed to barrak b. ghurair of the
bani khalid who used kuwait as a summer residence. the beginning of
kuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go
further up to 1611. kuwait 's name is derived from al kut which means
fortress. kuwait is also called qurain , which is the diminutive of qarn , a
horn or hill. kuwait town flourished and grew since its
establishment.

the 'utub , al sabah family is a branch of 'utub , settled in kuwait
during the early 18th century. they lived under the protection
of bani khalid until 1752. after that , they became independent and
sabah bin jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'utub.

carsten niebuhr (1733 1815) a dutch explorer was among the first who
wrote about the arabia. he was the mathematician in the scientific
expedition sent in 1760 by the king of denmark to arabia. he
documented details of arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the gulf
and in the case of kuwait , he was the first writer to give the two
names by which the town was known , kuwait and qurain. niebuhr 's chart
of the persian gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that
century , see the map from abu hakima , history of eastern arabia
1750 1800. pub.1965.

al sabah ('utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern
arabia. according to ahmed abu hakima 's conclusions in his well
documented study about the history of eastern arabia between 1750 1800 ,
there was no ottoman rule on the region. ``in the second half of
the 18th century , there was no ottoman ruler in eastern arabia.
in fact , ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. their
attempts to restore their lost position in al hasa through the
campaign of thuwayni in 1786 , and ali pasha 's expedition against the
wahhabis in 1798 , were unsuccessful. at kuwait , the nearest point of
the utbi domains to the ottoman mutasallimiyya of basra , the shaikh
was under no form of ottoman control. the aim of 'utbi external policy
was to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the
gulf.'' (p. 182 183) abu hakima continued in his conclusions that ``kuwait
was not a dependency of basra , the persian occupation of basra
(1775 79) did not affect kuwait.'' (p.183)

kuwait had its own identity through the ottoman domination on the arab
world. this identity was clear to the british and the french who
tried to win the support of kuwait 's sheikh between 1793 95 when the
british wanted his support in their conflict with the french in the
gulf area.



independent kuwait

this is the first of a series of articles that testify to the
independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the
ottomans.

the following text is related to an expedition carried out by the
ottomans in 1871 against the wahhabis in eastern arabia (where the oil fields
in saudi arabia now). kuwait and its ruler at that time , sheikh
abdulla ibn sabah ibn jabir , allied themselves with the turks

abdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. he joined the
expedition as a commander of the large kuwaiti fleet and was the first
to use its guns against the besieged town of al qatif. had it not been
for this bombardment by the kuwaiti fleet , al qatif obviously would
not have surrendered in a mere three hours.

in relation to this , a question arises as to why the ottoman warships
refrained from participating in the bombardment. the answer lies in
reports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of
the progress of the expedition. because the ottomans were unwilling to
jeopardize the maritime peace imposed by britain in the area , the
sultan and the pasha promised their warships would not be used in the
war against su'ud or any sheikh in the war zone. kuwait , which was not
a party to the above mentioned treaty of 1861 , was under no such
obligation especially since the expedition was not directed against
those who had signed it.


from the above text , we can see that kuwait was not part of the
ottomans or the british colonies. for more details about the mentioned
expedition , please check out the source of the above text

independent kuwait 2

this is another article of a series of articles that testify to the
independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the
ottomans.

the following text discusses a dispute on an estate called sufiyya in zubair ,
iraq , between the sheikh of kuwait and al zuhair tribe in zubair.

in 1866 , trouble developed over the possession by sheikh sabah of the
estate which was purchased by his father , sheikh jabir , in 1836. this
property was sequestered by a turkish qa'immaqam representative on
the basis of a claim by the al zuhair that the vendor had been the
owner of a share and not of the n 100e sufiyya. at the same time ,
sheikh sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at
the island of fao some cultivators who had immigrated from persian
territory.

it should be recalled that the turkish officials from the start
showed strong prejudice in favor of the zuhair claimants. abdulla ibn
sabah , the eldest son of the ruler of kuwait who went to basra as his
father 's agent in the case , narrowly escaped being thrown into jail
upon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven
years produce which the ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were
entitled to receive.

eventually , the dispute was settled by the wali governor of baghdad
in favor of the sheikh of kuwait. the decision of the governor of
basra in favor of the sheikh was apparently made for various reasons.
some writers think that the governor wanted to win abdulla over to the
turkish side , and suggest that the governor , namiq pasha , even offered
him the title of qa'immaqam , which he declined. nevertheless , the
proceedings of the turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants
of kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with zubair. it seems
that they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the
british agent at basra , the people of kuwait were prepared to a man to
abandon their town rather than submit to turkish rule. lorimer suggests
that the final order of namiq pasha , upholding the kuwait sheikh 's
title to sufiyya , was perhaps due to a report that sheikh sabah ,
``with the object of attacking zubair if the decision should go
against him , had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support
from the wahhabi amir.''

in addition to this legal matter with zubair , kuwait had had other
problems with basra whose courts tried to jail abdulla ibn sabah , as
explained above. however , kuwait 's relations with the ottoman
mutasallims of basra had at times been amicable and in several
instances , those mutasallims even sought refuge at kuwait when
pressured by the pashas of baghdad who exercised control over them.

independent kuwait 3

this is another article that testifies to the
independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the
ottomans.


when pelly colonel pelly , the british resident in the gulf visited kuwait
for the first time on march 3 , 1863 , he was
met at jahra by sheikh mubarak , the second son of the ruler , sheikh
sabah. just before he reached kuwait town on march 4 , he was met by
sheikh abdulla , the eldest son and heir apparent , who accompanied him
to the town gate on their way to ``a very good home , '' which had been
prepared for pelly and his companions. ``scarcely had we entered it , ''
says pelly , ``when sheikh sabah himself came.''
this description of pelly 's reception indicates that to a certain
degree it was run according to protocol.

the government system of kuwait and administration of justice were the
subject of comments made by pelly. ``the government is patriarchal , ''
says pelly , ``the sheikh managing the political , and the cazee qadi
the judicial departments. the sheikh himself would submit to the
cazee 's decision.'' punishment was rarely inflicted. ``indeed , there
seems little government interference anywhere , and little need of an
army.'' pelly in admiration of how the sheikh ran the affairs of the
country , retold the following remark which the sheikh had made to him

when my father was nearly 120 years old , he called me and said , ``i
shall soon die. i have made no fortune , and can leave you no money ,
but i have made many and true friends , grapple them. while other
states around the gulf have fallen off from injustice or
ill government , mine has gone on flourishing . hold to my policy , and
though you are surrounded by desert , and pressed by a once hostile
and still wandering set of tribes , you will prosper.''

independent kuwait 4

this is another article that testifies to the
independence of kuwait throughout its history from both iraq and the
ottomans.


the british had always regarded sheikh jabir as a ``good friend , '' but
in october 1839 , an event took place at kuwait which could have
weakened those good relations. on october 30 , lieutenant edmunds , the
assistant resident at abu shahr in iran , arrived in kuwait on a
special mission from the resident , captain hennell. his mission was to
find out if kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a
british line of post across the desert from kuwait to the
mediterranean. the british war vessel fired the usual salute in honor
of the sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of kuwait bay. the
salute was not acknowledged and edmunds waited in the vessel for three
days before he was able to communicate with the sheikh.

after edmunds' return to abu shahr , both he and captain hennell
explained this unusual behavior of the sheikh , to have been due not
to ill will , but principally to a desire to mislead the egyptian agent
at kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the british.
therefore , they considered that jabir 's conduct did not indicate any
change in his friendly policies towards the british.

if the british tolerated the attitude of jabir towards edmunds , so
also did the egyptians. earlier in the same year , some of the most
wanted men in the wahhabi camp , such as 'umar ibn 'ufaisan , the
wahhabi general in al hasa , and wahhabi tribes like al duwaish ,
sought refuge in kuwait.

protection of refugees seeking political
asylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by
sheikh abdulla ibn sabah. this can , therefore , be looked upon as an
indication of self confidence an outcome of kuwait 's independence
from foreign powers. it corroborates the fact that kuwait , if
necessary , was prepared to defend itself against more powerful
neighbors.

this defense depended not only on the walls of the city , but also on
bedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with
the necessary guns comparable to other arab fleets of the time.

as to kuwait 's position between 1815 and 1839 , one can safely state
that it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the
struggling wahhabis and egyptians. relations with the british and
even with the pasha of baghdad continued on good terms.

they were trying to recover land they believed
was theirs , much like the argentines in the faulklands. the kuwaitis pushed
just a little too far by taking iraqi oil and saddam thought he 'd settle
the dispute the old fashioned way...

are you really this cartoonish \? or do you seriously believe this \? if
so , please post your proof.

everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited iraq
together and concentrated on taking out saddam. a strong , united iraq with
an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of
the feudal dictatorships in the gulf.

it seems that , to keep the peace talks going , israel has to keep
making goodwill gesture after goodwill gesture , while palestinian
arabs continue to go around hunting jews.

if the peace talks are going to have any realistic chance of success ,
the arabs are going to have to start reciprocating , especially since
they are the ones who will be getting tangible concessions in return
for giving up only intangibles. if they keep trying to change the
already agreed upon rules , which seems to be one of their favorite
games , the israelis are not likely to be very confident that the
intangibles they will receive at the bargaining table will be worth
the parchment they 're written on.

it takes two to negotiate a peace. it 's time for the arabs to start
doing their share.

i think some of you guys think that the volume of your
responses and their harshness somehow increases their factual
accuracy. i especially deplore the attempts to call me a racist
(as many of you have done). you guys think just because
there are more unreasonable israelis on this pcnews channel
than all other denominations combined (including reasonable
israelis) that somehow makes you right. well you 're wrong.
i just started reading this stuff last sunday and
thought i might butt in since there were severe information
problem on the part of some people. i thought that through
somewhat intelligent conversation we might enlighten each
other.

that would be nice , but considering professional diplomats between israel and
athe arabs have been unable to do so for 45 years , i ca n't see us starting.
but hey as soon as anyone wants to discuss things reasonably and in a
scholarly manner , count me in.

anyway the responses were mostly negative and i 've been
called a racist and an anti semite so many times that it seems
assumed about me in people 's postings. when i shared this with
some of my friends it appears that they have had similar
experiences. the overall harsh language coupled with the
occasional death threats and attempts to get them disconnected
have convinced many to look elsewhere for true discussions and
unsubscribe to the newsgroup.

people have very strong opinions and you need to be careful regarding what
you say if you say , make it factual and be able to back it up.

i do n't know if you 're paid israeli lobbyists or just
concerned , but it seems that toning down the harsh rhetoric
might be more helpful to your cause than name calling ,
attempting to disconnect and death threats. just a tip about
how things work in the civilized world.

thanks for teaching us about the civilized world , andi. i guess we all just
came out either the desert or the ghetto , right \? and no , we are not paid
israeli lobbyists nor are we conspirators of the zog we are just people who
believe in our cause and find offense when people imply some sort dirty dealing
or disloyalty due to our love of israel (disguised as paid israeli lobbyists
what kind of image is that \? )

p.s. i understand that not all of you are involved in all this
but many of you are contributing to the atmosphere.
p.p.s. just to clear up something , i do n't think than the jews
are necessarily any worse than other people as a whole if such a
distinction between cultures shall be made(i do n't personally
believe in judging people by their religion , culture or race.)

oh ! thank you ! i needed your approval of my heritage. i guess i can go home
and feel good now and sleep comfartably knowing that jews really are n't
worse people than anyone else , contrary to what we all know is true.

washington of the bilateral peace talks , following a recess which
lasted over four months. according to the report , israel is
expected to offer the palestinians new proposals regarding the
authority of the palestinian executive council , general elections ,
control over land and human rights issues in the territories.
israel will express its readiness to give the palestinians control
of more land than previously offered. according to the radio
report , one estimate is that israel will give the palestinians
control over as much as two thirds of the administered lands , as
well as broad authority on water issues. israel will seek to
promote its offer to hold elections in the territories in hopes of
strengthening the position of the palestinian delegation to the
peace negotiations. according to israel radio , the israeli
delegation to the bilateral talks with the palestinians will offer
greater responsibilities to the palestinian executive council
allowing it certain legislative capabilities , without making it a
symbol for palestinian sovereignty. u.s. secretary of state warren
christopher invited all the heads of delegations to a gathering
tonight. it will be the first such event since the madrid
conference. head of the american team at the bilateral peace talks ,
edward djerejian , said that tonight 's gathering is meant to
demonstrate the u.s.' active role in the peace process.

if the haitian people 's will is that their current govt. get thrown out ,
they 'll find a way to do it. getting the us un to short cut the process will
only hasten it , but sets a bad precedent can the us interfere everywhere \?
why not right at our doorstep cuba \?

precisely , why not cuba \? \? why not \? \? \? the hatians are being ruled by thugs
and their elected leader has asked support to reestablish the peoples will.

well , let 's delve one level deeper. why is democracy better than tribalism or
other means of govt. \? the president of georgia was elected with a thumping
majority and booted out later , w no objections from the un. similarly , the
people of algeria elected an islamic fundemantalist party into power but the
junta declared it illegal. in both cases , i personally have no problems with
the outcome , but if the voice of the people is that hallowed thing that the
world community claims to revere so , why is n't it interfering there \?

the u.s. or any other democracy wishes to , they are in the perfect right to
help them without any whining from thir parties. after all if it turns out to
be colonialism and the poeple do n't like it , they' find a way to throw them out
.
exactly. my point is that it will inevitably turn out that way , and we can save
ourselves a lot of pain and trouble by simply letting people sort out their
problems on their own. colonial interventions , even in haiti , have n't worked
in the past. they had a 102 coups from 1845 1915. the us invaded in 1915. and left
in 1933 , almost 17 years after they had intended to. was it a success \? well ,
look at haiti today and of the past 40 years and decide for yourself. it was
a success so long as the us was in , from what i remember. but it did n't last
long , obviously.

there is an implicit assumption here that we as outsiders have a right to sit
in judgement of another people , and to then act on it. to me , it is in there
that the roots of old colonial attitudes lie. today , the motives are noble.
tomorrow , they may not be.

who ever said people who commit genocide have the right to commit genocide \? \?

nobody did. people should have a right to self defense. if the un wants to arm
the bosnians or haitian revolutionaries or whoever , i have no problems with
that. i do when they cross that line and attempt to re arrange boundaries , govts.
etc. , the vance owen plan being one such piece of insanity.

i want a world where criminals agains humanity have no place to hide , while you
want special sovereignties designed to protect them. nobody has the right to
commit crimes against humanity , and if they do they loose all right to self
determination. if this is classical colonialism , then so be it.

we finally have a clearly stated point of difference. colonialism can
have its good side , which is as you stated above removing thugs from being
able to lord it over powerless people. i am worried that the bad side is what
will assert itself , and i am prepared to let natural forces take their course
if that will mean we can avoid the bad side of colonialism.

washington government troops in sudan are involved in massacres ,
kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into libya , according
to a state department document declassified wednesday.

the report compiled by the u.s. embassy in khartoum said government
forces , particularly arab militias organized as the popular defense

some women and girls are kept as wives , the others are shipped
north where they perform forces labor on kordofan (central sudan)
farms or are exproted , notably to libya , it said.

while the people here may be claim to be muslim , the actions reported here ,

erginel) asked

ee no , no flaming here. just a simple question.

...with a simple answer !

ee as far as i know most of the armenians belong to the gregorian orthodox
ee faith and such was the case in nineteenth century ottoman empire. it is
ee also known that some armenian communities were converted into catholicism
ee and protestantism by the western european missionaries in this period.

the vast majority of armenians in eastern anatolia were gregorian or armenian
apostolic. there was , however , a higher percentage of non gregorian armenians
in cilicia , closer to the mediterranean , in adana , marash , aintab , etc.

ee another known fact is that almost half of the armenians living in anatolia
ee did not speak any armenian , but used turkish in their everyday lives.

this is not true. while it was forbidden for armenians to speak armenian in
certain areas of cilician armenia , most all armenians spoke armenian. in fact ,
turks who interacted with armenians also spoke armenian ! for sure , most all
armenians , especially men , also knew turkish in order to function in larger
society.

ee my question is , given so many separations in the armenian community , what
ee was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian
ee nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century \? as i stated , religion
ee was not uniform (unlike the greeks) and many armenians could n't even speak
ee armenian. i would like to know what factors brought the armenians in the
ee ottoman empire together and led to the formation of an armenian
ee consciousness.

the armenians in turkey were persecuted because they were armenian , regardless
of the specific branch of christianity they professed. the resultant armenian
nationalism was in direct reaction to this persecution. even at the later
stages of wwi , and after the genocide , many armenians who were converted to
islam were also exterminated because they continued as armenian moslems. this
practice continued well into the 1920s by ataturk in parallel with the policy
of clearing out pockets of steadfast islamic fundamentalism. many of these
converted armenians , ironically , in order to stay alive , were staunch moslems.

ee any information will be appreciated.

you answered your own question ! the common thread throughout your inquiry
was the word armenian !

bull shit. there is no reason in the world why we ca n't say that

it is we do not allow theft , or murder , or rape. why should we allow
hateful sppech whose only purpose is to stir anger and violence.
harry.

i think the answer to mr. mayamsky 's question can be found in the
(mr. mamaysky 's)
first amendment to the us constitution.

amendment i (1791)

congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or
abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press or the
right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition
the government for a redress of grievances.

steve

i do not say that freedom of speech should be banned. far from it.
i am merely suggesting that there are certain things which can be
universally agreed to be morally incorrect. there are not many such
things. but there are some. as an example

(1) murder is morally incorrect

(2) the idea that one group of people is somehow racially inferior to
another is morally incorrect

etc.

the point is that any action which serves to promote a morally
incorrect action should be forbidden. this implies that no one has the
right to say that an innocent person should be murdered. regardless of
freedom of speech , i may not stand on a street corner and advocate the
murder of innocent people. the reason for this is that murder is a
morally incorrect action.

in the same way , since bigotry is morally incorrect in the narrow
definition which we have given it , (2) , i , nor any one else , has the
right to stand on a street corner and promote bigotry. such an
enforcement does in no way deny any one their rights as guaranteed by
the first amendment. it merely ensures that no person may be the
target of an attempt to deny him a fundamental moral right , such as
the right to not be murdered , and the right not to be discriminated
against.

i believe , mr. berson , that to blindly accept the constitution is a
terrific mistake. we must cinstantly question the constitution and
interpret it in a way befitting the society in which we live. anything
short of such an effort would render us little more than trained
monkeys , who are able to merely repeat what they have heard without
paying the slightest bit of attention to the intent of the document in
question.

would you disagree , mr.berson \?

as years , while the germans kicked our economic collective ass. the
as money that goes to israel is miniscule compared to what goes to
as germany.

what an evasive comparison ! u.s. troops stationed in germany or
anywhere else is the world is not foreign aid , numbnuts ! are you
sure you 're not a closet holocaust revisionist , adam \? \? \? i have a
suggestion for you write to your congressman or senator and ask him
or her for the official definition of foreign aid and just who are
the recipients of such. israel is definitely on the top of the heap ,
no matter how you try to twist the truth.

why do n't you pull your head out of your ass and into reality \? first off , what

ha ha. what a developed sense of humor you have , i'm surprised they let you
out of the cage. why do n't we not talk about the official definition of
foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent. more money is spent
stationing troops in germany (ie paying the troops , maintaining bases and equip ,
etc) than in israel. plus , israel does not ask the us to send troops to fight
her battles. if you look at the amount of money spent defending korean
shipping lanes , norway , and other trouble spots in the world , you will see that
aid to israel from a practical standpoint is not that much. and so what
so what if israel gets the most (assuming i buy your feeble argument) \? what
is your point \? do you not want to subsidize israel \? well , you have two options
1) start your own campaign , get elected as president , and then force congress
to cut all aid to israel or 2) get the fuck out ! if you do n't like how this
country operates and ca n't change it then move to iran or something.

in undermining schemes against their rulers. they committed
genocide against the muslim populations of eastern anatolia
and x soviet armenia before and during world war i and fully
participated in the extermination of the european jewry
during world war ii. belligerence , genocide , back stabbing ,
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the
armenian history. to obliterate these episodes the armenians
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. in this zeal
they tried to cover up the cold blooded genocide of 2.5 million
turks and kurds before and during world war i.

and the justice is long overdue.

not exactly the same , but reminiscent of the assassination of count
bernadotte , who was the un negotiator during the 1948 israeli war of
independence. he was killed by the israelis. seems he was being too
successful in negotiating a cease fire , which would have worked
territorially against the nascent israel , compared to continued war.

that operation was done by a small jewish fraction before the state even
existed and , as far as i remember , was disaproved by most of the jews.

saying that he was killed by the israelis is plain wrong because there was n't
israel at the time.

look up the facts first , post second. bernadotte was assassinated
in september 1948 by lehi under the orders of its three commanders
(one of whom was yitzhak shamir). there is no hard evidence of
complicity of the israeli government despite some effort by the un
and other organizations (us intelligence , swedish government) to
find it. however a great fuss was made over the apparent lack of
zeal of the israeli government to track down the killers. the lehi
man who actually pulled the trigger later became a personal friend
of david ben gurion. the best published account in english is a. ilan ,
bernadotte in palestine , 1948 (macmillan , 1989).

for arab armies to attack israel on yom kippur \? i suppose it

armenians have been doing just that for a long , long time.

source hagop hagopian said to have been part of 1972 terror attack at
munich olympic games , the armenian reporter , february 7 , 1985 , p. 1.

le matin , the influential paris daily , based on unidentified sources ,
claimed last week that hagop hagopian , the founder and leader of one
faction of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia (asala) ,
was among the arab terrorists who staged an attack on the living quarters
of israeli athletes at the 1972 olympic games...

le matin added that up to 1982 , hagopian operated out of beirut , lebanon ,
but escaped from the country when israeli forces entered the city. it was
about this time that a statement issued by asala claimed that mr. hagopian
was dead of wounds suffered during a bombing by the israeli air force ,
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in damascus , syria , and
athens , greece. the paper also noted that the socialist government of
prime minister andreas papandreou and his p.a.s.o.k. party accepted the
armenian underground leader with open arms and still providing him
with assistance simply because of greece 's traditional enmity with turkey.

le matin further adds that asala derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy armenians who support the cause , with the rest
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
drug trafficking.

there are arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what

first of all , the arab standing in any party , or as any party , is solely
dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively.

it is not a question of an individuals standing. when a party puts up
an arab for a cabinet post and that arab is rejected but the position
is given to a jew from the same party we are not talking about power
but racism.

not necessarily. as shai points out , political appointments are
based on power. they are also based on favors owed , coalition
building , and deal making. while this may have a racist element to
it , i think that its much more fair to attribute it to the old boy
nature of politics. now , i 'll freely admit that the old boy system
has racist and sexist effects , but i do n't think that those are its
purpose , whether in the us , israel , or elsewhere.

in the past , they have not been effective at garnering votes and forming
a single bloc in the knesset. on the few occasions when this was done ,
some of the parties took stands that were extremist , and ineffect precluded
themselves from forming a coalition and participating in the cabinet.

not their party them as individuals . even when they belong to nice
peaceful zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. it
sure looks like racism to me.

here again , you miss out on the old boy nature of politics ,
and the existance of back room deals. as individuals , these arabs may
not be as well connected as the jew who gets the job. i do n't like
this aspect of politics , but i understand it exists.

the international convention on the elimination of all forms of

violation.

the general assembly endorsed in 1975 a resolution defining
zionism as a form of racism and racial discrimination. the
important , correct and legitimate resolution is incomplete since
it does not include operative statements designed to end israeli
racial discrimination. meanwhile the united states , on behalf of
israel , are exerting heavy pressure on member states of the united
nations to repeal this resolution and give israeli racial
practices zionism moral legitimacy.

if you are , in principle , advocating un intervention via operative
statements in this case , it must therefore hold that they can be
applied to any other case where the council perceives some form
of racial discrimination as previously exhibited.

scarey thought.

the very definition of israel as a state belonging to the jews of
the world (but not to its inhabitants) , alienates all native
non jews born in that country.

actually , i know quite a few native non jews born in israel that are not
alienated by this law. if you had said some , you would probably be
correct , however your tendency to exagerate and slant facts becomes
apparent. this slant permeates the text.

practically all non jews who are living in or originate from areas
under israeli control , identify themselves as palestinians. most
of them are muslim , many are christian. a few jews , including the
author of these lines , also identify themselves as palestinians.

the above statement is not true. practically all discounting
beduins , circassians , druze , and some other fringe groups.
your own identification is a matter that has no bearing upon the
issue. you could equally identify yourself as a insert group .

zionism took off in europe at the end of last century. it 's aim
was to create a jewish state in palestine in spite of the adamant
opposition of palestinian arabs (95 of the population).

if i recall correctly , at the time zionism took off , there
was no adamant opposition in palestine. i am open to any
factual contradictory evidence .

but the
zionists were more powerful , militarily , economically and
technologically , and succeeded in 1948 in conquering 70 of the
area of mandatory palestine. after driving into exile most native
arabs from the conquered areas , approximately 750 , 000 people , and
razing most of their villages to the ground , the zionists could
finally establish a predominantly jewish state. only 150 , 000
non jews remained on israeli territory.

do you therefore contend that the 400 villages you mention further on most
of their villages \?

once the jewish state was established , it began enacting laws to
help the confiscation of land from native non jews , their
political repression and their destitution.

there is no doubt that laws passed provided a framework which was later
used for these purposes. however , you seem to imply that this was the
intention a priori , which implies a policy and agenda. my knowledge was
that this was not the case.

you also neglect to mention the circumstances that surrounded
this. as you do again , below.

in 1967 the state of israel invaded egypt and syria and occupied
the rest of palestine (the west bank and the gaza strip). thus
another 1.5 million palestinians fell under its juridiction. its
occupation of palestinian and other arab territories is considered
illegal by the international community , as reflected in security
council resolutions. israel has rejected all u.n. resolutions and
began without delay to entrench its occupation and rule over these
territories with the aim of annexing them at the appropriate time.

not quite accurate. israel has not rejected all the resolutions ,
though it has conflicting understanding with regards to some of them.
israel never annexed the sinai , west bank , or gaza. the other
annexations were brought about partly due to the un resolutions.

part of these territores , east jerusalem and the golan heights ,
have already been forcefully annexed by israel , in defiance of
international law and un resolutions.

out of curiousity , provided that the annexees are granted citizenship ,
what int'l law do you claim prohibits annexation of territories
captured in war \? has this ever been applied to any other country
previously (other than iraq) \?

it must be emphasized that , although these people live under
different regimes , they are united in their self perception as
palestinians , that is as people identifying with palestine , a
territorial entity (not an ethnic or religious entity).

incorrect ! palestinians themselves claim to be discriminated against
on an ethnic or racial basis. therefore your above statement is
incorrect.

i also note that given the previous definition of racial discrimination ,
the only means that you could argue for that is nationalistically.
however , no such nation has existed. it definitely did not exist
at the time of the creation of israel , in which case you can not
argue racial discrimination during that period !

furthermore palestinians generally consider the plo both as a
symbol of national identity and as the unchallenged authority that
represents them in world affairs.

once again , some do , some do n't.

the non jewish population living in the palestinian and other arab
territories occupied by israel in 1967 suffers not only blatant
discrimination but is subject to brutal military occupation.

another generalization , but then again , you do n't seem to care
about anyone other than the palestinian people , whose cause you
espouse.

licence , to start a business and to buy industrial equipment , the
right to educate children , all of these basic rights are subject
to arbitrary rulings by military authorities and cannot be
challenged in court.

incorrect once again. they have the ability to appeal.
furthermore , although you may not agree with them , not all
of the military rulings are senseless or arbitrary. some
are , but this is not due to the whims of the military as
much as the sizeof the task organization.

only jewish inhabitants of the occupied
territories are permitted to carry firearms.

incorrect once again. i know two arab policemen who lived in
daheisha and there were more. of course , with the outbreak of
the intifada they were forced by the locals to resign , bitterly.

jewish settlers have
right to 6 7 more water per person than non jews. jewish residents
of these territories number now about 100 , 000 people. it is israel
governmentus policy to increase this number substantially , in
total defiance of international law , un resolutions and the will
of the population. the state of israel systematically confiscates
land from non jewish inhabitants of these territories for jewish
settlement.

that is no longer true , and i ca n't help but wonder what your
purpose is was in posting this.

some 800 , 000 people in israel proper , are not jews. most of them
consider themselves palestinians with israeli citizenship. for
many years after the establishment of israel they were subjected
to harsh military control. much of their land was confiscated by
the state and handed to jewish organisations for exclusive jewish
settlement. they have been subject to massacres , destitution and
humiliation. while they enjoy , with jewish israelis , the right to
vote , they are discriminated against both through law and in
practice.

once again , to hell with the other minorities that do n't fit in ,
right \? their are many villages who did not suffer in the way
you seem to indicate , abu gosh comes to mind. yes , some did but
as a result of what actions \?

approximately 92 of the surface of the state of israel within the
rgreen lines is for all purposes closed to palestinians who are
second class citizens in israel. they may neither legally live on
such land , nor rent or cultivate it. a direct effect of these
policies is that native non jewish citizens of israel are denied
residence and membership rights in most rural communities in
israel , including the collective settlements , kibbutzim. non jews
are discriminated against in many other ways the government
starves local authorities of palestinian villages and townships of
funds jewish city councils force palestinians to live in ghettos
jewish families receive higher child allocations than their
non jewish neighbors , palestinian schools suffer underfunding and
understaffing (as compared to jewish schools) palestinian
children are denied the right to learn their history and
literature israelis who struggle for equal rights and for the end
of racial discrimination , suffer continuous harassment by the
authorities.

1. there are some kibbutzim with arab non jewish members.
it is up to the members of the kibbutz. there is no
legislation against it , nor against a purely non jewish
collective.

2. funds are the result of political lobbying. bearing in mind
that non jews compose 20 of the voting population , it has
never failed to amaze me that they fail to form one large
bloc , and increase their power. the recent elections are a case
in point.

3. please provide factual evidence supporting your allegation
with regard to educational material. you have obviously
never seen the curriculum of a school in the west bank.
it is based upon jordan 's school system.

4. with regard to your last statement , it is simply another
gross generalization.

the state of israel refuses to acknowledge itself as the state of
all its inhabitants. although the israeli cabinet has never
openly endorsed the 'transfer' idea (the forced removal from the
country of its native palestinian population , that is , its
ultimate judaization) , israeli government policies towards
non jews bear the mark of this 'final solution'. no attempt is
made by the zionist authorities to integrate palestinian arabs
into israeli public life. thus , although comprising approximately
17 of the population of israeli citizens , no palestinian citizen
of israel has ever served as cabinet member , as director of
ministry or of a national institution , as judge of the supreme
court , as ambassador of israel , or in any leading position in
israeli economic or financial life. even the director of the
ministry for arab affairs yes , such a thing exists ! is a jew.

another generalization , but lets not stop here.
the transfer idea was espoused by one party in the last gov't ,
moledet. it was intended to be a solution to the problem in the
territories , not the country itself. with regard to other items ,
i recall at least one arab ambassador , and the rest was covered
previously.

although sexual
relations between and cohabitation of jews and non jews are legal ,
they are considered by israeli zionist society somewhat a betrayal
of the jewish and zionist ethics. the israeli educational system
nurtures this attitude in a systematic way.

when was the last time you were in israel \? that is simply not true ,
nor has it been for quite some time. the question of religious
intervention is best answered by the proportional representation and
the lack of any arab party bloc to counter the orthodox one.

zionism rejects the idea of a modern secular state , based on
equality of all citizens. this is one main reason why israel has
not produced any written constitution.

simply incorrect.
the answer is political. once again , your failure to understand the
dynamics and movements inside israeli gov't , relegates your
contentions to the sidelines.

zionism predicates a state
where jews have privileged rights. thus , according to israeli law ,
a jew born in london , who has never visited israel , does not speak
hebrew and professes atheism , is granted automatic israeli
citizenship , while native palestinian inhabitants who happen to be
christian or muslim , are treated almost as aliens. racial
discrimination , as defined in international law , is thus not only
reflected in israeli laws and policies , but is grounded in the
very nature of israel as a jewish state.

but the discrimination is not based upon race.
oops , sorry , nasty habit i have of countering malicious false truths.

any proposal for israeli arab and israeli palestinian peace that
does not address the issue of racial discrimination by israel
that is the zionist nature of the state of israel is thus doomed
to fail.

real world intrusion any proposal that does is doomed to fail.
of course , i would n't expect you to understand , wrapped up as
you are in your view of things. let 's not let anything penetrate
shall we ! \? ! i may be a bit too sarcastic but there is a limit to the
amount of patience i have for rubbish at 02 00.

muslims already have , they accepted the vance owen plan that gives

of the territory. they gave some totally muslim villages and areas
to croatia and serbia , they in effect gave the serbs the land they grabbed
while slaughtering the muslims anbd raping their women and expelling
the survivors.

still the serbs (not bosnian serbs because the real bosnian serbs are
fighting with muslims to defend bosnia from serbs , those so called
bosnian serbs refused to be part of bosnia and wanted a greater serbia) ,
still those serbs refused , they have the necessary weapons to kill
more muslims and grab more territory.

there was something in the nyt and other sources about this for a few

out the uae people it was briefly reported (this was many moons ago).
i do n't recall reading of any public us comment if it were a strong

those islands would be abu musa , and the greater and lesser tunbs , i presume.
i do n't know about a fourth. the latter two islands belong to iran and so

according to the ny times , the 4 islands belong to the united arab
emirates.

could not be taken over . the major row is over abu musa which has been
jointly administered by iran and uae. the dispute goes back to the early
1970 's when britain evacuated the island and iran under the shah reclaimed
the island which had historical ties to iran. no british objection was
raised at that time.

it is my understanding that uae residents of abu musa are currently free to
travel to and from the island and that iran is desiring diplomatic resolution
of the dispute.

why is it , then , that when the british , iranians and uae refer to
occupied territory , they mean territory in dispute in israel but not

what hamas and islamic jihad believe in , as far as i can get from the arab

is an islamic state that protects the rights of all its inhabitants under
koranic
law. this would be a reversal of the 1948 situation in which the jews in
palestine took control of the land and its (mostly muslim) inhabitants.

the borders of the jewish state as drawn by the u.n. included the areas which
contained mostly jews , that 's what the surveys and the numerous commitees
where after when they visited here.

however , whoever committed crimes against humanity (torture , blowing up their
homes , murders , ...) must be treated and tried as a war criminal. the political
thought of these movements shows that a freedom of choice will be given to the
jews in living under the new law or leaving to the destintion of their choice.

i never touched an arab during my army service and never voted for anyone more
right than the green party. will i be spared by these humanist standards \?
(or will anyone stop to consider this before sloughtering me \? )

first of all , harry , i am not so uninformed about irgun 's
terrorist activities. i 'll give you a few quotes from a book
by charles d. smith in his palestine and the arab israeli
conflict 1988 , 1992

ah palestine and the arab israeli conflict. sounds interesting.

begin directed the irgun to bomb only civilian that 's right ,
civilian installations linked to the mandatory authority , not
military sites.

this is misleading. i supposed charles d. smith characterizes the bombing
of the king david hotel as a civilian installation too. any installation
attacked by etzel was linked to some sort of official function of the
mandatory government.

and of course , there is the lehi splinter group , which included
such notable israelis as yitzak shamir... the lehi fighters
for the freedom of israel resumed its assassinations of
british officials , civilian , and military .

what kind of civilians \? i assume charles d. smith means completely innocent
people who were intentionally targeted , right \? please provide examples.

and there is of course , dair yassin , where 250 men , woman and
children were killed , ... perhaps i'm sure for strategic
reasons , yet what ever happened to the non aggression pact with
the hagana \? i have references for that if you 'd like. it
seems to me like blatant scare tactics that begin himself
admits to having been very useful in scaring off the
palestinian arabs. i do have references ! ... the revolt(los
angeles 1972)

nice strawman. in the revolt begin does state that the myth of a massacre
at deir yassin may have had the effect of scaring some arabs into fleeing.
however , nowhere does he claim that this was the result of any specific policy
of the etzel. thus , if it did happen , it was not so intended. i think arab
calls for palestinians to leave and fear of a war started by arab hands had
a greater effecton arab migration than deir yassin.

in fact these jewish terrorist groups managed
all in all to scare off 300 , 000 arabs by may 15 1948.

really. nice use of caps. i like it. very effective. actually , according to
many sources , including american diplomatic officials , the greatest encouragment
for arabs to leave their villages came from arab leaders.

this certainly might be all a matter of semantics however. you
might say that the hagana did this for war... but like i said
before , how do we not know that the palestinian conflict is n't
equatable with a war \? if israel never got her state , the
hagana 's activities would be lost in history , categorized as
tewrrorism for sure because it could not be identified with the
cause of a state. i do take this seriously harry... i
sincerely think the palestinians are being discriminated
against in this case because , perhaps , everyone thinks their
cause is bogus.

anyway... just some stuff to ponder over.

bigotry

actually , this strife in yugoslavia goes back a long way. bosinan
muslims ,
in collaboration with the nazis , did to serbians after the first world
war what serbs are doing to muslims now.

this kind of racialist generalization is utterly inappropriate. some
bosnian muslims cooperated with the nazis in world war 2. other bosnian
muslims risked their lifes to hide jews from the nazis and ustashe , and
those jews who survived the war remember that. in fact the jewish leader
in sarajevo has remained there saying he wants to repay the debt to the
bosnian muslims that saved so many jewish lives in ww2.

similarly , some serbs are doing to muslims now. this is a group of
serial killers , rapists , and thieves who have control of the vast
yugoslav army arsenal. many other serbs oppose these atrocities. as one
of serbian heritage who condemns emphatically the genocide being carried
out against muslims by both hvo and mladic forces , i condemn your
generalization about bosnian muslims and about serbs.


this is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred , destruction , ...

every place on earth is the scene of a saga of mutual hatred and
destruction. the holocaust was not a fresh case. it was another
chapter in a 900 year history of attacks on jews in europe. that did n't
make it acceptable. and balkan history does not make the genocide against
bosnian muslims acceptable.

not taking sides in this
perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry.

standing by and allowing well armed criminals to slaughter bosnian muslim
civilians , while enforcing an arms embargo against the bosnian muslims is
not only religious bigotry it is direct complicity in mass murder.


it could just

how many of you readers know anything about jews living in the

countries \? how many of you know what the circumstances of arabic
jews leaving their homelands were \? just curious.

the last arab country was syria. but not all of them
migrated due to the jewish state economical and
securital dilemma !

i have no idea what this guy means but the syrian jews are not allowed
to leave syria because assad welshed on his promise and is not letting
them go. israel has nothing to do with it.

as for the other arab countries there are still small communities left
in some arab countries. morocco has the largest group i think comprising
perhaps just over a thousand (but i have lost the exact figure. maybe
someone will be so kind as to post it). there are communities left in
yemen (which went to the polls yesterday in what might appear to be a
free ish election) , algeria (this is a tiny group , a couple of leftist
intellectuals i think) , of course syria and lebannon.

the circumstances of the departure of the jews from various arab countries
is controversial in some cases like iraq and i do not want to get into
a dispute about it. egypt expelled most of its community outright. most of
the french north african jews left rather than face independence. i think
that moroccans might have been encouraged by some antisemitic acts but i
am not sure. someone else around here will know for sure. there are claims
that israeli intellegence officers spread rumours around algeria that the
jews would not be welcome but this is probably just propaganda. it would
take a very stupid person not to realise the benefits of a move to france
(as most did) or to israel. yemeni jews were airlifted to israel. those
left were rumoured to have another airlift last year but i heard nothing

allegations of jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture , and
rumors of church and host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel.

about 2 years ago , there was a lot of noise about a church in the old
city of jerusalem being taken over by a jewish group. in fact , the
building in question was a dormitory that belonged to a church and was
not physically connected to any church. it had been leased to a
palestinean arab for 99 years and a jewish group sub leased it from
him. the church that owned the building disapproved and legal action
was started to revoke the sub lease. the media , however , made it look
like jewish vigilantes were stealing church property in jerusalem by
force.

the stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.

the damage has already been done by the press in the above case. it
is not surprising by now , of course , that many decent people regard
the press with utmost suspicion .

if such a claim is cross posted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before , such as s.c.j , a reference should be
given the first time it appears. now that the claim has been
documented , i regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful. especially so because the official who failed to
provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted jordanians
was probably jewish , and as a jew i know that he should have
known better.

you appear to be referring to moshe dayan. how do you know that the
evicted jordanians were not provided with something else \? in fact ,
this thread indicates that they were squatters on land that they did
not own but received compensation for their loss , anyways ! woe to
jews when they feel that recovering land that has been taken from them
by force (with ethnic cleansing of any remaining jews) is
disgusting and shameful .

now i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism
during the 1930 's and 1940 's. the hirgun , and other branch
off militant groups , did fight the british do get them out of
palestine. yet i fail to see how this israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
arabs.

there is a difference between guerrilla warfare and terrorism.
the former primarily targets enemy soldiers. the latter primarily
targets civilians , and not necessarily enemy civilans , at that.

these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british
soldiers ,

innocent british soldiers \? like innocent iraqi soldiers \?
the british were executing jewish fighters in what was soon to become
the recognized jewish homeland. the british to their eternal shame
and damnation were sending shiploads of jewish refugees , civilians ,
back to europe to be taken care of by hitler.

by comparison , palestinean fighters primarily target tourists ,
schoolchildren , babies , worshippers , shoppers , movie goers and other
such threatening people. early zionist fighters did no such things.

your comparison is ignorant and odious.

i mention this not because i'm anti semitic i'm part
jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the
israelites pisses me off so.

does it bug you that the israelites (they used to be
israelophiles...) happen to be right \?

i'm not as critical of the
palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
jews.

are you kidding \? palestinean arabs who comprise a tiny proportion
of the world 's refugee population , who have almost no justifiable
claim to the territory that they desire , who have acted as criminals
in the international community for decades are being treated like
the most aggrieved and deserving minority in existence , even after
their ignominious support for saddam in desert storm. how many other
world leaders have addressed the un with a machine gun in hand ,
receiving a standing ovation \?

it 's a damn shame that the palestinians had to pay for
german and european anti semitism.

you are now parrotting some of the weakest arguments of the
terrorists' apologists. congratulations.

pissed off at immature ,
closeminded , self righteous
semites

gee , that 's a nice name. can i call you pissed \?

i suspect it might have to do with pan turkism blinding certain people.

you do n't get it do you \? during the years of world war i , the x soviet
armenian government has planned and perpetrated the 'genocide' of the
muslim people , which not only took the lives of 2.5 million muslim people ,
but was also the method used to empty the turkish homeland of its inhabitants.
to this day , turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x soviet armenia.
in order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic turkish
homeland , which is the crux of turkish political demands , fascist x soviet
armenia continues its anti turkish policy in the following ways

1. x soviet armenia denies the historical fact of the turkish genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x soviet armenia , employing asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism
triangle , attempts to call into question the veracity of the turkish
genocide.

3. x soviet armenia has also implemented state sponsored terrorism through
the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle in an attempt to
silence the turkish people 's vehement demands and protests.

4. using all its human , financial , and governmental resources , x soviet
armenia and its tools in the united states attempt to silence through
terrorism , bribery and other subversive methods , non turkish supporters
of the turkish cause , be they political , governmental and humanitarian.

using all the aforementioned methods , the x soviet armenian government
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the turkish case a contemporary issue.

yet despite the efforts of the x soviet armenian government and its
terrorist and revisionist organizations , in the last decades , thanks
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically
exterminated by the armenians , the international wall of silence on
this issue has begun to collapse , and consequently a number of
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition
of the turkish genocide.

with the full knowledge that the struggle for the turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages , the turkish and kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle , therefore the victims
of the turkish genocide demand

1. that the x soviet armenian government , as the heirs of the armenian
dictatorship , recognize the turkish genocide

2. that x soviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and
kurdish people

3. that the x soviet armenian government make material reparations for
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide

4. that all world governments , and especially the united states , officially
recognize the turkish genocide and turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all armenian political pressure

5. that the u.s. government free itself from the friendly position it
has adopted towards its unreliable ally , x soviet armenia , and officially
recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide as well as be
supportive of the pursuit of turkish territorial demands

6. that the x soviet republics officially recognize the historical fact
of the turkish genocide and include the cold blooded extermination of
2.5 million muslim people in their history books.

while the dashnaks x soviet armenian government were in power they
did everything in the world to keep the pot boiling by attacking kurds ,
turks and tartars by committing outrages against the moslems by
massacring the moslems and robbing and destroying their homes. during
the last two years the armenians in russian caucasus have shown no
ability to govern themselves and especially no ability to govern or
handle other races under their power.

source general bronsart wrote as follows in an article in the july 24 ,
1921 issue of the newspaper deutsche allgemeine zeitung

since all the moslems capable of bearing arms were in the turkish army ,
it was easy to organize a terrible massacre by the armenians against
defenseless people , because the armenians were not only attacking the
sides and rear of the eastern army paralyzed at the front by the
russians , but were attacking the moslem folk in the region as well.

source john dewey , the turkish tragedy , the new republic , volume 40 ,
november 12 , 1928 , pp. 268 269.

they armenians boasted of having raised an army of one hundred
and fifty thousand men to fight a civil war , and that they burned at
least a hundred turkish villages and exterminated their population.


armenia was not a soviet republic in 1920 ! ! ! so sorry to burst your little
bubble.

what a clown...let us ask armenian scholars shall we \?

university of california press (berkeley and los angeles) , 1967 , p. 13.

the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the
area of transcaucasia to over 130 , 000 square miles. the estimated population
of the entire region in 1886 was 4 , 700 , 000 , of whom 940 , 000 (20 percent) were
armenian , 1 , 200 , 000 (25 percent) georgian , and 2 , 220 , 000 (45 percent) moslem.
of the latter group , 1 , 140 , 000 were tatars. paradoxically , barely one third
of transcaucasia 's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia , where the
christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan
uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44 , 000 armenians
as compared to 68 , 000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897 ,
however , the armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the
guberniia it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670 , 000 of the 1 , 120 , 000
inhabitants. this impressive change in the province 's ethnic character
notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the armenian
republic , a solid block of 370 , 000 tartars who continued to dominate the
southern districts , from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia.
(see also map 1. historic armenia and map 4. administrative subdivisions of
transcaucasia).

in 1920 , '0' percent turk.

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work
of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village.
little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts
into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets
completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they
found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole
length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to
akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain

foreword

for example , we were camped one night in a half ruined tartar mosque ,
the most habitable building of a destroyed village , near the border
of persia and russian armenia. during the course of evening i asked
ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and
the cause of its destruction. in his matter of fact way he replied , yes ,
i assisted in its sack and destruction , and witnessed the slaying of
those whose bones you saw to day scattered among its ruins.

scattered bones of the dead.

p. 15 (second paragraph).

the tartars were , for the most part , poor. some of them lived in villages
and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of
their nomadic forefathers. they drove their flocks and herds from valley
to valley , from plain to mountain , and from mountain to plain , following
the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. they ranged from the salt
desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains.
even the village tartars are a primitive people , only semicivilized.

i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars , and , while
holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country , regarded and
treated them as inferiors. the fact that the russians looked down upon all
armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars , far from proving
a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors , intensified
an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.

p. 20 (second paragraph).

our men armed themselves , gathered together and advanced on the tartar
section of the village. there were no lights in the houses and the doors
were barred , for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great
fear. our men hammered on the doors , but got no response whereupon they
smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last
tartar was slain. throughout the hideous night , i cowered at home in terror ,
unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and
the loud shouts of our men. by morning the work was finished.

p. 109 (second paragraph).

as things were , the members of the dashnack party were without administrative
experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself
incompetent to rule by legitimate means.

the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and
outside the law. when they became a legally instituted , recognized governing
body with the destiny of armenia in their hands , they proved incompetent to
do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their
fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days.

the outstanding feature of their rule , now that they were in power , was ,
as in the old days , trial and execution without hearing. a man evoking
the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and
condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. the method
of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the
condemned man in his home or on the street , place a pistol to the back
of his head and blow out his brains. this simple way of getting rid of
those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became
a common way of paying debts.

p. 203 (first paragraph).

a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar. i saw the
point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...another soldier seized a rock
and pounded the tartar 's head with it... the armenian who had bayoneted him
sprang to his feet , wrested the weapon from the tartar 's body , and , raising
it to his lips , licked it clean of blood , exclaiming in russian , 'slodkey !
slodkey ! ' (sweet.)

p. 203 (second paragraph).

one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village. among the
ruins a fire was burning. i went to the fire and saw seated about
it a group of soldiers. among them were two tartar girls , mere children.
the girls were crouched on the ground , crying softly with suppressed
sobs. lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and
other furnishings of tartar peasant homes. there were also bodies of the
dead.

p. 204 (first paragraph).

i was soon asleep. in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of
a child. i arose and went to investigate. a full moon enabled me to make
my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
that had been enacted. guided by the child 's crying , i entered the yard of
a house , which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
turkish family. there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead. her
throat had been cut. lying on her breast was a small child , a girl about a
year old.

p. 118.

slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow , the cart
jolting and the loads swaying. boys ran along the line of oxen , encouraging
them with shrill tartar cries , and belaboring the beasts with sticks. in the
carts , the women , veiled as is the tartar way , held children in their arms.
wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they
sought protection from the wind and cold. a few old men plodded along on foot.

across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. the leading
oxteam reached this barrier and halted. the gunmen and other ruffians
concealed among the rocks opened fire. women and children leaped and
scrambled from the carts , screamed , ran and sought vainly for safety.

this massacre was not complete. the armenian soldiers in the near by
barracks , hearing the firing and the turmoil , hurried to the scene....
that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted
and completely destroyed.

p. 192.

great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding places on the
retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced.... they entered
into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores
that had been left by the turks.

p. 193.

terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars , kurds and turks. their villages
were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.

p. 195.

the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order
of diminishing intensity tartars , kurds and russians.

p. 218. (first and second paragraphs)

russian troops did terrible things in the turkish villages...we armenians
did not spare the tartars....if persisted in , the slaughtering of prisoners ,
the looting , and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace
actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.

i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground ,
in numbers , like the fallen leaves in a forest. they had been as helpless
and as defenseless as sheep. they had not died as soldiers die in the
heat of battle , fired with ardor and courage , with weapons in their hands ,
and exchanging blow for blow. they had died as the helpless must , with
their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.

p. 133 (first paragraph)

in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who
had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians
abandoned the struggle. during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of
these poor devils were cruelly put to death. i was sickened by the
brutality displayed , but could not make any effective protest. some ,
mercifully , were shot. many of them were burned to death. the method
employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut , and then after
crowding the hut with turks , set fire to the straw.

p. 19 (first paragraph)

the tartar section of the town no longer existed , except as a pile of
ruins. it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. the same
fate befell the tartar section of khankandi.

p. 22 (second paragraph)

many of our men had served in the russian army , and were trained soldiers.
we armenians were rich and possessed arms. tartars had never received
military training. they were poor , and possessed few arms beyond knives.
...shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village , the revolution
in russia was suppressed.

p. 97 (third paragraph)

within a few years , following the beginning of the movement , an invisible
government of armenians by armenians had been established in turkish
armenia in armed opposition to the turkish government. this secret
government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called
'mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees.

p. 98 (first paragraph)

the dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the turkish
government.

p. 98 (third paragraph)

...the dashnacks engineered a general revolt of armenians in turkish
armenia under the mistaken belief that european nations would intervene
and secure independence for turkish armenia.

p. 99 (second paragraph)

the dashnacks were fanatics.

p. 99 (third paragraph)

the dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their
revolutionary activities into the russian province. they instituted
a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing
contributions to the party funds from rich armenians. a wealthy
man would be assessed a stipulated sum. refusal to pay brought upon
him a sentence of death.

every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without
question. if a man were to be assassinated , lots might be drawn to
select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the
'mauserists' of the party.

p. 130 (first paragraph)

...in moments of victory against turks and kurds or tartars , they
armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance.

p. 130 (third paragraph)

the city was a scene of confusion and terror. during the early days of
the war , when the russian troops invaded turkey , large numbers of the
turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the russian
advance.

p. 159 (second paragraph)

i made a cannon , a huge gun to lift which required four men. i made balls
for it. with my cannon the armenians could knock down any of the tartar
houses and so they were able to drive the tartars out.

p. 181 (first paragraph)

the tartar villages were in ruins.

p. 189 (third paragraph)

the dead tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood , his
beard still setaceous and now crimsoned.

i think we have a problem in this newsgroup every time somebody puts

the arab countries \? ...

most of the arab countries governments are ruling their people with iron
fist policy and dark ages democracy (if exists). ironically , these are
the countries that the west would like to deal with and would wage
massive wars to protect them and their resources.

for israel the situation is different , israel claims it is a
democracy i would call it selective democracy , that abides by western
democratic standards. if israel is saying that then
it has to be compared to western standards. if this comparison is the
advertized propaganda from israel , then we have to look at seriously at
question that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing
this standard.

if you want to continue this think tank charade of yours , your
fixation on israel must stop. you might have to start asking the
same sort of questions of arab countries as well. you realize it
would not work , as the arab countries' treatment of jews over the
last several decades is so bad that your fixation on israel would

that is very incorrect , i see you have been brain washed well , i would

nationality is a recent invention of the western europe. in the
days of the ottoman empire , the religion was the main point of
difference between social classes. the ottomans did n't recognize
turks , arabs , greeks , serbs... just christians , muslims , jews...

pardon me \? your ignorance cramps my conversation. although the administrative
mechanism was a strictly centralized one , the ottoman empire 'was a classical
example of a pluralist social order.' the 'millet system' was the mechanism
which shaped the social order of the multi national ottoman empire and stood
behind its continuity. as a matter of fact , because islamic principles
were in force in the ottoman empire , it was natural to use religious
criteria to differentiate among the various communities which constituted
the empire. the 'millet' system began to be based on ethnicity in the
19th century under the influence of nationalism. sousa writes of the
existence of thirteen communities in the ottoman empire in addition to
the muslim 'millet' in 1914. these were (1) greeks attached to the
orthodox patriarchate in istanbul (2) catholics or latins who were
remnants of genoese and venetian merchants (3) gregorian armenians
attached to a patriarchate in istanbul (4) catholic armenians (5) syrian
catholics attached to a patriarchate in mardin (6) chaldean catholics
attached to a patriarchate in mosul (7) syrian jacobites attached to a
patriarchate in mardin (8) protestants (9) melchites attached to a
patriarchate in damascus (10) hebrews of two rites (11) bulgarian
catholics attached to the bulgarian exarch (12) maronites and (13)
nestorians. 1 scholars who studied the pluralistic social structure

armies in 1914 , history of the ottoman empire and modern turkey (volume
ii reform , revolution republic the rise of modern turkey , 1808 1975).
(london , cambridge university press 1977). pp. 315 316.

in april 1915 dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city
of van , whose 33 , 789 armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population ,
closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire...leaving erivan
on april 28 , 1915 , armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized
and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during
the next two days.

knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions ,
armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first
world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
to serve their state , the ottoman empire , and to assist instead other
invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian
success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of
ottoman territories. armenian political leaders , army officers , and common
soldiers began deserting in droves.

with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
world war i , the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman 's enemy
increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks ,
armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations , who in turn
massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of
expected arrival of the invading russian armies.

...meanwhile , czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final
plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans , with the
president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response

'from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the
glorious russian army , with their blood to serve the victory of russian
arms...let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the
bosporus. let , with your will , great majesty , the peoples remaining
under the turkish yoke receive freedom. let the armenian people of turkey
who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new
free life under the protection of russia.' 155

armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. preparations were made
to strike the ottomans from the rear , and the czar returned to st. petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach istanbul.

an armenian state was organized at van under russian protection , and it
appeared that with the muslim natives dead or driven away , it might be
able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient armenian
civilization. an armenian legion was organized 'to expel the turks from
the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
russian drive into the bitlis vilayet.' 162 thousands of armenians from
mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new
armenian state...by mid july there were as many as 250 , 000 armenians
crowded into the van area , which before the crisis had housed and fed
no more than 50 , 000 people , muslim and non muslim alike. 163

as you point out above , the original quote used the term ``tartars , ''
as distinct from ``turks , '' but you perhaps feel free to make these
minor adjustments in the name of truth.

i went through this just a few weeks ago here it comes again. the
entire turkish population of armenia (which armenians called tartars)
constituted at least about 40 of the total population of armenia
was deliberately exterminated. (for the population statistics , please
look to the book of richard hovannessian , armenia on the road to
independence. ) i listed three books earlier of such a monstrous crime
by the writings of one armenian , one american , and one british. they
are men are like that by leonard r. hartill adventures in the near
east by a. rawlinson world alive , a personal story by robert dunn.
also , i personally have copies of documents of this crime by the writings
of two armenians and also one american. the official british report about
this massacre mentioned in one of these documents (lord curzon aharonin
interview) is the report of the british high commissioner to caucasia ,
sir oliver wardrop.


an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of
the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at
least 30 40 percent of the population of that republic. the
memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and
eye witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in
1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound.

the idea of a given right to the land of israel , the idea of keeping
kosher , the idea of opposing intermarriage , the idea of having a
torah that was inspired by god , etc.
by being an atheist , i cannot support the idea of the jewish nation
as defined by a religious principle or based on a religious identity.
for me , religion is just another piece in what constitutes the cultural
identity of the jewish people. i believe that as a people with a
cultural identity they constitute a nation and have the same right as
any other people in the world to have their own state. the same right
as the armenians have , as the palestinians have , as the french have ,

morgues fill as azeris head for all out war


thomas goltz , the first to report the massacre by armenian soldiers in
the worst violence since the breakup of the soviet union , reports from
agdam


khojaly used to be a barren town , with empty shops and treeless dirt
roads. yet it was still home to thousands of people who , in happier
times , tended fields and flocks of geese. last week it was wiped off
the map.

.......

as sickening reports trickled in to the azerbaijani border town of
agdam , and the bodies piled up in the morgues , there was little doubt
that khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been
the site of the most terrible massacre since the soviet union broke
apart.
.......

i was the last westerner to visit khojaly. that was in january and
people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. zumrut ezoya ,
a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the
town , called her community sitting ducks , ready to get shot . she and
her family were among the victims of the massacre on february 26.
.......

the armenians have taken all the outlying villages , one by one , and
the government does nothing. balakisi sakikov , 55 , a father of five ,
said. next they will drive us out or kill us all , said dilbar , his
wife. the couple , their three sons and three daughters were killed in
the assault , as were many other people i had spoken to.
......

it was close to the armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.
there was a road , and the first units of the column ran across then
all hell broke loose. bullets were raining down from all sides. we had
just entered their trap.

the azeri defenders picked off one by one. survivors say that armenian
forces then began a pitiless slaughter , firing at anything moved in
the gullies. a video taken by an azeri cameraman , wailing and crying
as he filmed body after body , showed a grizzly trail of death leading
towards higher , forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge
from the armenians.

the armenians just shot and shot and shot , said omar veyselov , lying
in hospital in agdam with sharapnel wounds. i saw my wife and
daughter fall right by me.

people wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the
loved ones. some vented their fury on foreigners where is my
daughter , where is my son \? wailed a mother. raped. butchered. lost.

azerbaijan has said as many as 1 , 000 refugees were killed as they
tried to flee. the armenians have denied this , saying the civilians
were caught in crossfire .
.......

extermination of jews he said...

the armenians you refer to have chosen to come to the united states lawfully

americans to either flee or become armenians , it will not succeed. similarly ,
the armenians of karabakh are being forced by azerbaijan to either become
azeris or leave , and it also will not succeed , as has been demonstrated.

karabakh , irrespective of its geographic position situated technically within
the stalin prepared borders of azerbaijan , has been long oppressed and
eventually was invaded in 1991 by azeri omon and soviet forces , resulting in
the northern third of this armenian area being depopulated of armenians. the
armenians have been fighting back ever since.

clearly , you feel it rather ridiculous for armenians , of let 's say glendale ,
california , to engage in an independence movement for a free and independent
glendale. similarly , the azerbaijanis are engaging in a losing attempt at
claiming sovereignty over the land and people of karabakh , who have lived
continuously in karabakh a thousand years before the first central asian
invaders ever stepped foot in the caucasus.

ic should they get it \?
ic and should the un enforce their will \?
ic and is it a simple , beautiful concept , indeed \?

your analogy has broken down because you have switched positions of the victim

bosnian muslims are slavic in ethnicity. they speak serbo croatian. but
there is a christo slavic ideology whereby all true slavs are christian

changing religion.


muslim in ex yugoslavia was a nation not a religion. in fact , not
all muslims in b h are followers of islam. therefore , there do (did \? )
exist in ex yugoslavia christian muslims. tito defined the muslim
nation constitutionally , adding muslims to serbs , croats , and slovenes ,
the three founding nations which entered into a voluntary union at the
end of wwi. in addition , tito added two other nations constitutionally
montenegrins , and makedonijans.

nations had the right of secession , but republics did not. so , muslim
is much more a political term than a religious term (for those who
differentiate between religion and politics , that is) in b h. it was not
a christo slavic ideology that made a muslim nation in yugoslavia , it
was the atheist communist ideology of tito. before tito , there was
no muslim nation in yugoslavia.

the war is not a religious war , and it is not an ethnic war. it is a
civil war in which the terms of secession are being negotiated with guns
instead of pens. the croat , muslim , and serb political leaders all
chose to fight over the terms of secession instead of compromising and

there are treaties signed between greece and turkey which speak about a
moslem minority in thraki and not of a turkish minority in thraki.
the reason they talk about moslems and not about turks is that the majority
of these people are not ethnik turks. they are pomaks and gypsies.

oboy , this is exciting. first you discuss your non existent literature
tastes , then your fantasies , and now your choices of historical revisionism.
are you related to 'arromdians' of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and
revisionism triangle \?

the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term 'turks , '
which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference
to 'muslims.' the fact that the greek governments also mention the
existence of a few thousand non turkish muslims does not change the
essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger
turkish minority. the 'pomaks' are also a muslim people , whom all the
three nations (bulgarians , turks , and greeks) consider as part of
themselves. do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized
according to the agreements \?

it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece
and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world.
the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish
minority. they pursue the same denial in connection with
the macedonians of greece. talk about oppression. in addition ,
in 1980 the 'democratic' greek parliament passed law no. 1091 ,
virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and
other charitable trusts. they have ceased to be self supporting
religious and cultural entities. talk about fascism. the greek
governments are attempting to appoint the muftus , irrespective
of the will of the turkish minority , as state official. although
the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in
greece , the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing
its religious leaders. talk about democracy.

the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic
convention in komotini. such destruction , which reflects an
attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage , is a
violation of the lausanne convention as well as the 'so called'
greek constitution , which is supposed to guarantee the protection
of historical monuments.

the government of greece , on the other hand , is building new
churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward
hellenizing the region.

the longstanding use of the adjective 'turkish' in titles
and on signboards is prohibited. the greek courts have
ordered the closure of the turkish teachers' association ,
the komotini turkish youth association and the ksanti
turkish association on grounds that there are no turks
in western thrace. such community associations had been
active until 1984. but they were first told to remove
the word 'turkish' on their buildings and on their official
papers and then eventually close down. this is also the
final verdict (november 4 , 1987) of the greek high court.

helsinki watch , a well known human rights group , had been investigating
the plight of the turkish minority in greece. in august 1990 , their
findings were published in a report titled

'destroying ethnic identity turks of greece.'

the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the
turkish minority by the greek authorities. it says for instance ,
the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in
komotini. such destruction , which reflects an attitude against
the muslim turkish cultural heritage , is a violation of the
lausanne convention.

helsinki watch problems of turks in western thrace continue

ankara (a.a) in a 15 page report of the helsinki watch it is
stated that the turkish minority in western thrace is still faced
with problems and stipulated that the discriminatory policy being
implemented by the greek government be brought to an end.

the report on western thrace emphasized that the greek government
should grant social and political rights to all the members of
minorities that are equal to those enjoyed by greek citizens and
in addition they must recognize the existence of the turkish
minority in western thrace and grant them the right to identify
themselves as 'turks'.

greece isolates west thrace turks

the xanthi independent mp ahmet faikoglu said that the greek
state is trying to cut all contacts and relations of the turkish
minority with turkey.

pointing out that while the greek minority living in istanbul is
called greek by ethnic definition , only the religion of the
minority in western thrace is considered. in an interview with
the greek newspaper ethnos he said i am a greek citizen of
turkish origin. the individuals of the minority living in western
trace are also turkish.

emphasizing the education problem for the turkish minority in
western thrace faikoglu said that according to an agreement
signed in 1951 greece must distribute textbooks printed in turkey
in turkish minority schools in western thrace.

recalling his activities and those of komotini independent mp dr.
sadik ahmet to defend the rights of the turkish minority ,
faikoglu said. in fact we helped greece. because we prevented
greece , the cradle of democracy , from losing face before european
countries by forcing the greek government to recognize our legal
rights.

on turco greek relations , he pointed out that both countries are
predestined to live in peace for geographical and historical
reasons and said that turkey and greece must resist the foreign
powers who are trying to create a rift between them by
cooperating , adding that in turkey he observed that there was
will to improve relations with greece.

macedonian human rights activists to face trial in greece.

two ethnic macedonian human rights activists will face trial in
athens for alleged crimes against the greek state , according to a
court summons (no. 5445) obtained by mils.

hristos sideropoulos and tashko bulev (or anastasios bulis)
have been charged under greek criminal law for making comments in
an athenian magazine.

sideropoulos and bulev gave an interview to the greek weekly
magazine ena on march 11 , 1992 , and said that they as
macedonians were denied basic human rights in greece and would
field an ethnic macedonian candidate for the up coming greek
general election.

bulev said in the interview i am not greek , i am macedonian.
sideropoulos said in the article that greece should recognise
macedonia. the allegations regarding territorial aspirations
against greece are tales... we are in a panic to secure the
border , at a time when the borders and barriers within the eec
are falling.

the main charge against the two , according to the court
summons , was that they have spread...intentionally false
information which might create unrest and fear among the
citizens , and might affect the public security or harm the
international interests of the country (greece).

the greek state does not recognise the existence of a
macedonian ethnicity. there are believed to be between 350 , 000 to
1 , 000 , 000 ethnic macedonians living within greece , largely
concentrated in the north. it is a crime against the greek state
if anyone declares themselves macedonian.

in 1913 greece , serbia yugoslavia and bulgaria partioned
macedonia into three pieces. in 1919 albania took 50 macedonian
villages. the part under serbo yugoslav occupation broke away in
1991 as the independent republic of macedonia. there are 1.5
million macedonians in the republic 500 , 000 in bulgaria 150 , 000
in albania and 300 , 000 in serbia proper.

sideropoulos has been a long time campaigner for macedonian
human rights in greece , and lost his job as a forestry worker a
few years ago. he was even exiled to an obscure greek island in
the mediteranean. only pressure from amnesty international forced
the greek government to allow him to return to his home town of
florina (lerin) in northern greece (aegean macedonia) , where the
majority of ethnic macedonians live.

balkan watchers see the sideropoulos affair as a show trial in
which greece is desperate to clamp down on internal dissent ,
especially when it comes to the issue of recognition for its
northern neighbour , the republic of macedonia.

last year the state department of the united states condemned
greece for its bad treatment of ethnic macedonians and turks (who
largely live in western thrace). but it remains to be seen if the
us government will do anything until the presidential elections
are over.

now that all the parties are back to the negotiating table , the stakes
as i see is are indeed high and the future stability of the region and
perhaps the world is in the balance.

while israel continues to refuse to talk to the plo , labelling
it a terrorist organisation , the window of opportunity for peace is
narrowing by the day. if the present talks are allowed to deadlock
without agreement for a long term and lasting peace that taken into
account the interest of all involved , the chances of peace will indeed
receed. the plo , by its decision to rejoin the talks , has staked its
reputation on the success of the talks. the longer the talks continue ,
and they started 1 and half years ago , without any tangible progress ,
the further will the plo support in the territories erode.

if a land for peace agreement can be reached , and real soon , the chances
of a comprehensive peace treaty is good. the arabs , once and for all ,
recognise israel 's right to exist inside secure borders , and isreal
would in turn recognise the legitimate right of the palestinians to self
deternimation and statehood. with peace guarantee by air tight
treaties , the region can then hope to dwell on the economic and social
well being of its population , rather than prepare for the next war.

ram vikash tiwary

as we see right now , the position of influence enjoyed by parties favoring
the negotiation process is tenuous at best. the local elections in hebron
that the plo was expected to win (perhaps adding a bit to its flagging
position of legitimacy in the eyes of palestinians and the middle east)
have been disrupted by hamas actions overtly directed towards
undermining those (and all west bank) elections. the present ruling israeli
labor coalition seems to be one rather thin political ice. the palestinian
delegation has been reduced from 14 to three to protest israel lack of
seriousness in the talks and refusal to reverse all the deportations
immediately.

hopefully , however , each of the parties will begin to learn that just
the fact that negotiations are taking place does not mean they are giving
anything away to the other side (which was is the favorite argument of
the rejectionists ). let 's hope that discusion and inevitable disagreement
on major issues leads at the same time to some agreement on smaller
interim ( phase , whatever term we prefer) steps to be taken.

my words. if he behaves as mutlu , he would carry
the similar treatment (especially as his oversized
articles are 90 scanned from propagandist leaflets
or from other stuff easily available in any
decent library).

typical 'virvir' drivel. people will think you 're just some
looney howling in the wires. if you think that this 'clears
things up' for me or anyone else , you must also believe that
aliens from outer space come to earth regularly and abduct
'arromdians' of asala sdpa arf for medical experiments. there
is stronger evidence for that you know.

'propagandist leaflets' \? this is an american officer on the
genocide of 2.5 million muslim people by the armenians between
1914 and 1920 , not a crook idiot like yourself.


source world alive , a personal story by robert dunn. crown publishers ,
inc. , new york (1952).
(memoirs of an american officer who witnessed the armenian genocide of 2.5
million muslim people)

p. 361 (seventh paragraph) and p. 362 (first paragraph).

'the most are inside houses. come you and look.'
'no , dammit ! my stomach is n't '
'one is a turkish officer in uniform. him you must see.'
we were under those trees by the mosque , in an open space....
'i do n't believe you , i said , but followed to a nail studded door. the
man pushed it ajar , then spurred away , leaving me to check on the corpse.
i thought i should , this charge was so constant , so gritted my teeth and
went inside.

the place was cool but reeked of sodden ashes , and was dark at first , for
its stone walls had only window slits. rags strewed the mud floor around an
iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black
with soot. all looked bare and empty , but in an inner room flies buzzed. as
the door swung shut behind me i saw they came from a man 's body lying face
up , naked but for its grimy turban. he was about fifty years old by what
was left of his face a rifle butt had bashed an eye. the one left slanted ,
as with tartars rather than with turks. any uniform once on him was gone , so
i 'd no proof which he was , and quickly went out , gagging at the mess of his
slashed genitals.

p. 363 (first paragraph).

'how many people lived there \? '
'oh , about eight hundred.' he yawned.
'did you see any turk officers \? '
'no , sir. i was in at dawn. all were tartar civilians in mufti.'

the lieutenant dozed off , then i , but in the small hours a voice woke me
dro 's. he stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. anyone keelhauled
so long and furiously i 'd never heard. then abruptly dro broke into
laughter , quick and simple as child 's. both were a cover for his sense
of guilt , i thought , or hoped. for somehow , despite my boast of irreligion ,
christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would
have been.

from daybreak on , armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....
the women plundered happily , chattering like ravens as they picked over
the carcass of djul. they hauled out every hovel 's chattels , the last
scrap of food or cloth , and staggered away , packing pots , saddlebags ,
looms , even spinning wheels.

'thank you for a lot , dro , ' i said to him back in camp. 'but now i must
leave.'...we shook hands , the captain said 'a bientot , mon camarade.' and
for hours the old molokan scout and i plodded north across parching plains.
like lot 's wife i looked back once to see smoke bathing all , doubtless in
a sack of other moslem villages up to the line of snow that was iran.'

p. 354.

at morning tea , dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole
high region called the karabakh. deep in tactics , they spoke russian ,
but i got their contempt for allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust
of promises made by tribal chiefs. a campaign shaped more raids on
moslem villages.

p. 358.

it will be three hours to take , dro told me. we 'd close in on three
sides.
the men on foot will not shoot , but use only the bayonets , merrimanov
said , jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.
that is for morale , dro put in. we must keep the moslems in terror.
soldiers or civilians \? i asked.
there is no difference , said dro. all are armed , in uniform or not.
but the women and children \?
will fly with the others as best they may.

p. 360.

the ridges circled a wide expanse , its floors still. hundreds of feet
down , the fog held , solid as cotton flock. 'djul lies under that , ' said
dro , pointing. 'our men also attack from the other sides.'

then , 'whee ee ! ' his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. bayonets
clicked upon carbines. over plunged archo , his black haunches rippling
then followed the staff , the horde nose to tail , bellies taking the
spur. armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war , even though
i heard our utica brass roar.

as i watched from the height , it took ages for djul to show clear. a tsing
of machine gun fire took over from the thumping batteries cattle lowed ,
dogs barked , invisible , while i ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow
puddle. mist at last folded upward as men shouted , at first heard faintly.
the came a shrill wailing.

now among the cloud streaks rose darker wisps smoke. red glimmered about
house walls of stone or wattle , into dry weeds on roofs. a mosque stood in
clump of trees , thick and green. through crooked alleys on fire , horsemen
were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.

'tartarski ! ' shouted the gunner by me. others pantomimed them in escape
over the rocks , while one twisted a bronze shell nose , loaded , and yanked
breech cord , firing again and again. shots wasted , i thought , when by
afternoon i looked in vain for fallen branch or body. but these shots and
the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women 's cries.

at length all shooting petered out. i got on my horse and rode down toward
djul. it burned still but little flame showed now. the way was steep and
tough , through dense scrub. finally on flatter ground i came out suddenly ,
through alders , on smoldering houses. across trampled wheat my brothers in
arms were leading off animals , several calves and a lamb.

p. 361 (fourth paragraph).

corpses came next , the first a pretty child with straight black hair ,
large eyes. she looked about twelve years old. she lay in some stubble
where meal lay scattered from the sack she 'd been toting. the bayonet
had gone through her back , i judged , for blood around was scant. between
the breasts one clot , too small for a bullet wound , crusted her homespun
dress.

the next was a boy of ten or less , in rawhide jacket and knee pants. he
lay face down in the path by several huts. one arm reached out to the
pewter bowl he 'd carried , now upset upon its dough. steel had jabbed
just below his neck , into the spine.

there were grownups , too , i saw as i led the sorrel around. djul was
empty of the living till i looked up to see beside me dro 's german speaking
colonel. he said all tartars who had not escaped were dead.

p. 358.

...more stories of armenian murdering turks when the czarist troops fled
north. my hosts told me of their duty here to keep tabs on brigands ,
turkish troop shifts , hidden arms , spies christian , red or tartar
coming in from transcaucasus. then they spoke of the hell that would
break loose if versailles were to put , as threatened , the six 'armenian'
vilayets of turkey under the control of erevan...

an armenia without armenians ! turks under christian rule \? his lips
smacked in irony under the droopy red moustache. that 's bloodshed just
smyrna over again on a bigger scale.

paris , april 16 (afp) an egyptian man held police at bay
for several hours outside the iranian embassy here , threatening
to blow up the building to protest against terrorism and
fundamentalism.

the man in his thirties , who was identified only as an
egyptian national , displayed a banner outside the embassy
gate and said he was in possession of several sticks of dynamite
he threatened to set off.

he later surrendeed quietly to police who had blocked off the
neighborhood , saying he wanted to attract media attention to
the dangers of islamic fundamentalism.

turkey may be more underdeveloped if you wish , but that was not the issue.

funny you should mention. that 's the whole point 'paliks' invariably miss.

1991 , (second edition).

in terms of 'annual output per person in dollars adjusted to
purchasing power parity , ' greece is in the same category with
turkiye.


indeed , greek governments have enormous problems to tackle. the
economy is in shambles , corruption is rampant , air pollution is
in outrageous dimensions , state sponsored terrorism is the name
of the game and infrastructure is decaying. another insightful
article in the new york times (sunday , april 7) exposes the dirty
linen of greece , and describes her as the pariah of the european
community. the article reports that ''...with un european antics ,
greece uses the community as a cash register. she squanders , and
at times even steals the european tax payers' money for political
featherbedding at home. the principal members of the community
admit that it was a mistake to accept greece to the european
community.'' this affirmation is testimony to the fact that
notwithstanding her geographic location , greece is un european
in mentality and attitude.

indeed , during the last 12 years , turkiye registered a great
success with regard to economic restructuring. a sound economy ,
ready to be integrated to the world economies , has emerged ,
succeeding to the faltering one , witnessed in the '70s.

just 12 years ago , greece used to export double as much as
turkiye did. now inversely , turkiye 's overall exports exceed
by far that of greece. as far as the tourism incomes are
concerned , we are witnessing the same phenomenon.

the governments in turkiye have put a particular emphasis on
the infrastructure investments (rather than investing in
world terrorist organizations) , thereby solving this issue
completely. indeed , in the '70s , it was out of the question
to conduct a telephone call from eastern anatolia to the west.
nowadays , this is not the case at all , and in a far remote
town , even in a village you may have , at any time , a long distance
call to any given country.

however , the same could not be applied to greece. in fact ,
it is not so easy in athens to have a trunk call to germany
round the clock. and if you happen to be in the greek islands ,
then your chance will be pretty slim. therefore , it would not
be an exaggeration to argue that turkiye is far ahead of
greece in regard to telecommunication facilities. greece ,
by virtue of its full membership , has enjoyed all advantages
of the ec , obtaining huge grants and extensive subsidies.
turkiye , having no access at all to similar financial supports ,
has nevertheless managed to create a better economy which
enabled it to produce consecutive current accounts surplus
over the last two years. as such , turkiye deserves to be the
only country in its region having permanent current accounts
surplus.

sb finally retaliated. nowhere do i see a war that israel started so that
sb the borders could be expanded.

i agree with all you write except that terrorist orgs. were not shelling
israel from the golan heights in 1982 , but rather from lebanon.


tsiel ,

i would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border ,
starting from the early 70 's. certainly the plo did shell northern
israel from the arqoub region , but israel did much more shelling
destroying several south lebanese villages. at the very least
we can say that both sides exchanged shelling , with occasional
aerial raids by israel on lebanese villages.
in any case steve 's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in
response to years of shelling from lebanon is false. israel had
many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
in lebanon favorable to israel , and it nearly achieved this aim
with the election of basheer el gemayel , and his brother , amin
el gemayel , but the internal situation in lebanon was too hard
to control and predict so israel had to withdraw , and amin el gemayel
had to abrogate the 17 th of may agreement.

government troops 'steal women , children'


washington government troops in sudan are involved in massacres ,
kidnapping and the transporting of forced labor into libya , according
to a state department document declassified wednesday.

the report compiled by the u.s. embassy in khartoum said government
forces , particularly arab militias organized as the popular defense
forces , routinely steal women and children in southern sudan.

some women and girls are kept as wives , the others are shipped
north where they perform forces labor on kordofan (central sudan)
farms or are exproted , notably to libya , it said.

it looks like ben baz 's mind and heart are also blind , not only his eyes.
i used to respect him , today i lost the minimal amount of respect that
i struggled to keep for him.
to all muslim netters this is the same guy who gave a fatwah that
saudi arabia can be used by the united ststes to attack iraq .

they were attacking the iraqis to drive them out of kuwait ,
a country whose citizens have close blood and business ties
to saudi citizens. and me thinks if the us had not helped out
the iraqis would have swallowed saudi arabia , too (or at
least the eastern oilfields). and no muslim country was doing
much of anything to help liberate kuwait and protect saudi
arabia indeed , in some masses of citizens were demonstrating
in favor of that butcher saddam (who killed lotsa muslims) ,
just because he was killing , raping , and looting relatively
rich muslims and also thumbing his nose at the west.

so how would have you defended saudi arabia and rolled
back the iraqi invasion , were you in charge of saudi arabia \? \? \?

fatwah is as legitimate as this one. with that kind of clergy , it might
be an islamic duty to separate religion and politics , if religion
means official clergy .

i think that it is a very good idea to not have governments have an
official religion (de facto or de jure) , because with human nature
like it is , the ambitious and not the pious will always be the
ones who rise to power. there are just too many people in this
world (or any country) for the citizens to really know if a
leader is really devout or if he is just a slick operator.


cairo , egypt (upi) the cairo based arab organization for human
rights (aohr) thursday welcomed the establishement last week of the
committee for defense of legal rights in saudi arabia and said it was
necessary to have such groups operating in all arab countries.

you make it sound like these guys are angels , ilyess. (in your
clarinet posting you edited out some stuff was it the following \? \? \? )
friday 's new york times reported that this group definitely is
more conservative than even sheikh baz and his followers (who
think that the house of saud does not rule the country conservatively
enough). the nyt reported that , besides complaining that the
government was not conservative enough , they have

asserted that the (approx. 500 , 000) shiites in the kingdom
are apostates , a charge that under saudi (and islamic) law
brings the death penalty.

diplomatic guy (sheikh bin jibrin) , is n't he ilyess \?

called for severe punishment of the 40 or so women who
drove in public a while back to protest the ban on
women driving. the guy from the group who said this ,
abdelhamoud al toweijri , said that these women should
be fired from their jobs , jailed , and branded as
prostitutes.

is this what you want to see happen , ilyess \? i 've
heard many muslims say that the ban on women driving
has no basis in the qur'an , the ahadith , etc.
yet these folks not only like the ban , they want
these women falsely called prostitutes \?

if i were you , i 'd choose my heroes wisely ,
ilyess , not just reflexively rally behind
anyone who hates anyone you hate.

say that women should not be allowed to work.

say that tv and radio are too immoral in the kingdom.

now , the house of saud is neither my least nor my most favorite government
on earth i think they restrict religious and political reedom a lot , among
other things. i just think that the most likely replacements
for them are going to be a lot worse for the citizens of the country.
but i think the house of saud is feeling the heat lately. in the
last six months or so i 've read there have been stepped up harassing
by the muttawain (religious police not government) of western women
not fully veiled (something stupid for women to do , imo , because it
sends the wrong signals about your morality). and i 've read that
they 've cracked down on the few , home based expartiate religious
gatherings , and even posted rewards in (government owned) newspapers
offering money for anyone who turns in a group of expartiates who
dare worship in their homes or any other secret place. so the
government has grown even more intolerant to try to take some of
the wind out of the sails of the more conservative opposition.
as unislamic as some of these things are , they 're just a small
taste of what would happen if these guys overthrow the house of
saud , like they 're trying to in the long run.

is this really what you (and rached and others in the general
west is evil zionists rule hate west or you are a puppet crowd)
want , ilyess \?

...
for your information on israel. since i read both american media
and israeli media , i can say with absolute certainty that anybody
who reliesx exclusively on the american press for knowledge about
israel does not have a true picture of what is going on.

of course you never read arab media ,

i read arab , israeli (jer. post , and this network is more than enough)

the jerusalem post is only a small part of the israeli media ( one
that caters to outsiders for the most part , anyways).

if you never read ha'aretz , maariv , or other hebrew langauge papers
, or at least seen some of their articles translated , you are not
really getting the israeli media.





and western (american , french , and british) reports and i can say
that if we give israel 10 and arabs 10 on the bias scale (of course
you can switch the polarities) israeli newspapers will get either
a 9 or 10 , american leading newspapers and tv news range from 6

inlcuding some of the left leaning ones \?


to 10 (yes there are some that are more israelis than israelis)

a 6 to a 10 \? is that why stations such as pbs have run shows which
do not depict the israeli standpoint at all \?

is that why the intifada got more coverage in 1987 and 1988 than did
saddamn gassing kurds by the thousands \?




the montreal suburban (a local free newspaper) probably is closer
to kahane 's views than some israeli right wing newspapers , british

i am from montreal. i read the suburban. did they ever advocate the
kahane stupidity of expelling the arabs \? are they racist \?

the suburban has some columnists that explain the israeli standpoint.

they are nothing like kahane. in any case , the suburban is a paper
with a minor local distribution and no influence.



range from 0 (neutral) to 10 , french (that iknow of , of course) range
from 2 (afro french magazines) to 10 , arab official media range from
0 to 5 (egyptian) to 9 in sa. why no 10 \? because they do not want to
overdo it and stir people against israel and therefore against them since
they are doing nothing.


as to the claim that israeli papers are biased , of course they
are. some may lean to the right or the left , just like the media
here in america. but they still report events about which people
here know nothing. i choose to form my opinions about israel and
the mideast based on more knowledge than does an average american
who relies exclusively on an american media which does not report
on events in the mideast with any consistency or accuracy.

the average bias of what you read would be probably around 9 ,
while that of the average american would be the same if they do
not read or read the new york times and similar news makers , and
8 if they read some other relatively less biased newspapers.

so you are not better off.


so what source is the closest thing to a zero \?

condemening the european lack of action and lack of support to us plans

he went on to say that the reason for that is out right religious bigotry

parts of sen. biden 's statement were quoted by the washington post today

let me put it plainly , mr. secretary. you are required to speak
diplomatically i am not. i cannot even begin to express to you
my contempt for a european policy that is now asking us to
participate in what amounts to a codification of the serbian victory.
...
what you have encountered is a discouraging mosaic of indifference ,
timidity , self delusion and hypocrisy.
...
after they held our coats on kuwait and somalia , they are asking us
to put in a few thousand troops on the ground in order to have the
right to speak and in order to implement their new idea of 'safe
havens' for the bosnians...
let 's not mince words. european policy is based on cultural and
religious indifference , if not bigotry. and i think it 's fair to say
that this would be an entirely different situation if the muslims
were doing what the serbs have done , if this was muslim aggression
instead of serbian aggression.

too bad the washington post did not include his next sentence , which
pointed out that a consequence of such policy is a rising anger
within the islamic world , the consequences of which we cannot begin
to predict. later , biden told a reporter why he spoke out

i think someone has to respond to europe to make it clear
this is a big deal... so they will understand.

and it is a big deal. by refusing the fundamental human right of
self defense to bosnia herzegovina , europe and the world have
aided the serbian aggression. moreover , the arms embargo has
forced a situation in which bosnian serbs have 10 times more heavy
weaponry than bosnian croats and muslims combined. under such
conditions , it is very easy for serbs to play a divide and conquer
game , and to get the muslims and croats (who have strong common
interests and who were allied against the serbian aggression)
to start fighting each other , which leads to their mutual catastrophe.

one final quote u.s. secretary of state , warren christopher , has
said in rome last week that in practice , the embargo had the opposite
effect intended. it made aggression certain.

all diplomats who deluded themselves that they could negotiate peace
while enforcing a 10 1 imbalance of power on the ground have contributed
to this tragedy.


sincerely ,
josip

civilized countries neither want to get intervene militarily themselves

(remember what happened almost one year ago when the so called un discovered

in this matter they are siding with serbs by keeping this embargo on only

i believe that zionism , as it is , is a form of racism. by as it is i mean
not the fact that is nacionalism , but the specific ideas it supports , the
form it defines what a jew is and the way it wants to accomplish its goals.
it has nothing to do with hypocrisy.

it has everything to do with hypocrisy. we 've dealt with with your
arguments about history before on this net suffice it to say you
have n't succeeded in convincing anyone probably because of their lack
of basis.

i do not want to convince anyone. this is just usenet , not the real
world. i just read the opinions others have about a subject , and sometimes
i present my opinion. i think that this net is only useful to exchange
ideas. i never wanted nor i want now to convince anyone of anything.


now if you want to deal with what certain people say , that
is fine. but by condemning the movement which is nothing more than
jewish nationalism and never has been anything more than that you are
saying quite literally that it is racist to think that jews your
own people , it should be added have the right to a state in their
homeland , the same right every other nation has. if you do n't agree
with that , i suggest you read a dictionary. because your interpretation
is just plain inconsistent with that dictionary definition as well as
modern history.

first , and i repeat it , i never said that the idea of jews having the
right to have a state is racist.
zionism , as a movement , is more than just that idea. i think that zionism
in the way it defines who is a jew , for example , is racist like.
in the same way i believe that irish have a right to nationalism but i do
not support the bombing and killing of the ira , i believe that jews have
a right to nationalism but i do not support zionism as it is right now.



here 's where you 're wrong. here 's also where you should know you 're
wrong. zionism is in no way monolithic. never has been. approaches to
zionism are as widespread as the ideologies of hashomer hatzair and meir
kahane. some of those approaches are racist kahane , for one. but
every approach to zionism defines those goals differently and also
defines a different approach to those goals. the single commonality is
the belief that jews , like every other nation on earth , deserve their
own homeland. period.

that is what makes the basis for zionist movements. however , i am not
considering just that , but the rest of it.


as long as zionism considers , for
example , who is a jew in a jewish state based on religion , i will consider
zionism a form of racism.

as you well know , over 80 of israeli jews are secular in other words
they are in no way religious , and most probably do n't even believe in g d.

which makes an interesting point. people living in a jewish state have
shown that jewish culture includes in it jewish religion but they are
not the same. so , the jewish people living in the jewish state have shown
us that there are some problems in a state where 80 of the people is secular
but judaism is define according to religious standards , or where marriage
is a religious stage , or where the law of return defines a jew according to
a religious standard.
did those israelis who do not believe in god and will never do become
non jews \? why should they still define then a jew based on what is a
religious definition \?



maybe , i would consider hypocrisy to support zionism and disregard the
right to self determination of the palestinian people and their struggle to
reach it.

if you 'd wanted to say that in the first place , you should have said it
then. i took you at your word. in other words , i took your words to
have their normal , dictionary definition. it is now quite obvious that
you use a different dictionary than the rest of the english speaking
world , and that you base your analysis on misconceptions.


according to webster 's ninth new collegiate dictionary , merriam webster inc ,
publishers , springfield , massachusetts , u.s.a. , 1986 , page 593 ,

hy poc ri sy a feigning to be what one is nnot or to believe one does not.

so , saying that one believes in zionism as a simple matter of people
having the right to nationalism , but disregarding the right of the palestinian
people to do the same , according to this dictionary , is hypocrisy.


if you are really interested on what i think , instead of directly coming with
labels , like hypocrat , send me a mail to aap@wam.umd.edu , and we can
exchange ideas.

how about learning what your words mean for once \? i stand by what i 've
said.

i know what my words mean. i do stand by what i said i believe zionism is
a form of racism. of course , i tend to talk about things as they are and
not as they are defined in a broad sense.

a few things about the university.

why \? there is no need to go into this.......

it is more fun than some may
admit. partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked
one of playboy 's top party schools.

especially this rivetting piece of information.

but we do study and more
importantly learn a lot. the overall uva drug use is actually
lower than the average college in the u.s.
there is no hate law on the books even though they (the
forces of pc) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar
law at the university of wisconsin \? was found unconstitutional
last year).

as i remember , someone did ask if uv had a speach code. but , really ,
there is no need for this brief survey course.

there is a law against relationship of professors with their students
or advisees that just passed.

thomas jefferson was the sole author of the virginia
statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten
amendments) , though he is not given full credit for righting
the bill of rights. so someone who picked on me for that is
right.
by the way , we 're the man in everything. sports
academics and partying.

how wonderful for you.

i'm sure a lot of other schools are

and , if you are jewish , you are a self hating jew. there can
be no doubt of this.

there are doubts about it. why do n't you define what self hating jew means \?
i found the idea itself of being a self hating jew to be one of those
i hope you can come up with a definition in itself...

try coming up with your own definition of any or all self hating peoples.
to me , any who reject their culture to the point where they only see the
absolute negatives of that culture (generally , or regarding a particular
event) and accept only those views purely opposing aspects of that culture
(thus , selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring
of context results) hate their culture.

i believe that things are getting mixed here.
critizicing israel and or being anti zionist is not seeing the absolute
negatives of that culture . maybe , because a person can see the positives
of that culture is that that person opposes zionism and the actions of the
state of israel.
i , for one , consider the actions of the state of israel with respect to
the human rights of the palestinian people as an example of an action thaty
opposes what jewish culture was suppose to uphold as an example of
respect and what the jewish people learned about oppresion , segregation and
years in the diaspora.


that certainly describes elias ,
since he has no intention of recognizing that , alongside the palestinian
experience and perspective , there exists also that of israelis.

he might not want to recognize that. it does not make him a self hating
jew , as far as i see it. at most , he is a person who is not telling
the truth.



who is a jew \? a person whose integrity decays when unmoved
by the knowledge of wrong done to other people.
a. j. heschel

that is why i get moved when i see the israeli army killing people in
the occupied territories as much as i get moved when i see a plestinian
stabing people in israel.

aap

and , this is precisely why israeli society has been tremendously harmed
by the actions it (its government) has felt it had to take in response
to an other perceived as a threat. just as with you , there has long
been a strident and emotional debate about the pain israelis feel when
forced to balance desires for survival and moral beliefs. the trauma
of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither
can be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political
debate) for the sake of the other , only reshaped.


but , so far , it seems that the blame is always put on the other .
if you read this newsgroup , for example , israel is never guilty by
herself. she is always responding to the actions of the other , and
it goes as if the actions of isreal do not also affect the response
of the other' in a cycle that never ends. also , there is blindness to
try to understand what the other feels and why.
there is always and excuse. there is always a rationale to explain why
things happen as they do.
and , what is the worst part for me , there seems to be all the time an
intention to try to de humanize the other , as if the other did not
care about their future , children , peace , etc , etc.

necessary to have such groups operating in all arab countries.
the london based and saudi owned al sharq al awsat daily newspaper

in a statement issued in the saudi capital , the council , saudi
arabia 's highest religious authority , said it ``unanimously proclaims
illegitimate the creation of this committee and the inadmissibility of
endorsing it because the kingdom of saudi arabia is guided by god 's

grievances to those courts or to other concerned authorities and that
``the authors of the bulletin (announcing the founding of the committee)
are well aware of this.''

another thing i find interesting when turks whine about armenians
taking control of their land is that turkey is still occupying n.
cyrus. how can you have the gall to even open your mouths about
karabakh , until turkish troops are completely out of the independent
island of cyprus.

no wonder you 'wieneramus' are in such a mess. following the greek
cypriot attempt to annex the island to greece with the aid of the greek
army , turkiye intervened by using her legal right given by two international
agreements. turkiye did it for the frequently and conveniently forgotten
people of the island , turkish cypriots. for those turkish cypriots whose
grandparents have been living on the island since 1571. and the next is
'karabag'.

the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek
cypriots will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will
remain eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece , someday , whatever
the cost to the parties involved. the history speaks for itself. greece
was the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent
its troops on july 15 , 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate
government of archibishop makarios.

the release of nikos sampson , a member of eoka national organization
of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist , shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in greece. one should not
forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks
in cyprus , committed murder to achieve this goal , and tried to
destroy the island 's independence by annexing it to greece. of
course , the greek governments will have to bear the consequences
for this irresponsible conduct.

the museum of barbarism

2 irfan bey street , kumsal area , nicosia , cyprus

it is the house of dr. nihat ilhan , a major who was serving at
the cyprus turkish army contingent. during the attacks launched
against the turks by the greeks , on 20th december 1963 , dr. nihat
ilhan 's wife and three children were ruthlessly and brutally
killed in the bathroom , where they had tried to hide , by savage
greeks. dr. nihat ilhan happened to be on duty that night , the
24th december 1963. pictures reflecting greek atrocities
committed during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which
has been converted into a museum.

an eye witness account of how a turkish family was butchered by
greek terrorists

the date is the 24th of december , 1963... the onslaught of the
greeks against the turks , which started three days ago , has been
going on with all its ferocity and defenseless women , old men
and children are being brutally killed by greeks. and now kumsal
area of nicosia witnesses the worst example of the greeks savage
bloodshed...

the wife and the three infant children of dr. nihat ilhan , a
major on duty at the camp of the cyprus turkish army contingent ,
are mercilessly and dastardly shot dead while hiding in the
bathroom of their house , by maddened greeks who broke into their
home. a glaring example of greek barbarism.

let us now listen to the relating of the said incident told by
mr. hasan yusuf gudum , an eye witness , who himself was wounded
during the same terrible event.

on the night of the 24th of december , 1963 my wife feride hasan
and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr. nihat ilhan.
our neighbours mrs. ayshe of mora , her daughter ishin and mrs.
ayshe 's sister novber were also with us. we were all sitting
having supper. all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river
direction started to riddle the house , sounding like heavy rain.
thinking that the dining room where we were sitting was
dangerous , we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought
would be safer. altogether we were nine persons. we all hid in
the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet. we
waited in fear. mrs. ilhan the wife of major doctor , was standing
in the bath with her three children murat , kutsi and hakan in her
arms. suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open.
greeks had come in and were combing , every corner of the house
with their machine gun bullets. during these moments i heard
voices saying , in greek , you want taksim eh ! and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom. mrs. ilhan and her three children
fell into the bath. they were shot. at this moment the greeks ,
who broke into the bathroom , emptied their guns on us again. i
heard one of the major 's children moan , then i fainted.

when i came to myself 2 or 3 hours later , i saw mrs. ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the bath. i and the rest of the
neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded. but what
had happened to my wife \? then i remembered and immediately ran to
the toilet , where , in the doorway , i saw her body. she was
brutally murdered.

in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying
help , help. is there no one to save us \? i became terrified. i
thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not
dead they would kill me. so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself
under the double bed.

an our passed by. in the distance i could still hear shots. my
mouth was dry , so i came out from under the bed and drank some
water. then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the
bathroom , which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago. there i
offered sweets to mrs. ayshe , her daughter and mrs. novber who
were all wounded.

we waited in the bathroom until 5 o'clock in the morning. i
thought morning would never come. we were all wounded and needed
to be taken to hospital. finally , as we could walk , mrs. novber
and i , went out into the street hoping to find help , and walked
as far as koshklu chiftlik.

there , we met some people who took us to hospital where we were
operated on. when i regained my consciousness i said that there
were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs.
ayshe and her daughter.

after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to
ankara for further treatment. there i have had four months
treatment but still i cannot use my arm. on my return to cyprus ,
greeks arrested me at the airport.

all i have related to you above i told the greeks during my
detention. they then released me.

on foot into cyprus's devastated turkish quarter

we went tonight into the sealed off turkish quarter of nicosia in
which 200 to 300 people have been slaughtered in the last five
days.

we were the first western reporters there , and we saw some
terrible sights.

in the kumsal quarter at no. 2 , irfan bey sokagi , we made our way
into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass. a
child 's bicycle lay in a corner.

in the bathroom , looking like a group of waxworks , were three
children piled on top of their murdered mother.

in a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the
head.

this , we were told , was the home of a turkish army major whose
family had been killed by the mob in the first violence.

today was five days later , and still they lay there.

children murdered because their father was a turkish officer...

horrible crime of genocide. blame must be apportioned to the armenians
and their supporters for the murder of muslims. the turkish historic
homeland , emptied of its native population until today , remains occupied
by the x soviet armenian government. today , x soviet armenia covers up
the genocide perpetrated by its predecessors and is therefore an accessory

reparations to the turks and kurds.

genocide perpetrated by the x soviet armenian government against 2.5
million muslim people between 1914 and 1920. still denying the obvious \?

ii reform , revolution republic the rise of modern turkey , 1808 1975).
(london , cambridge university press 1977). pp. 315 316.

in april 1915 dashnaks from russian armenia organized a revolt in the city
of van , whose 33 , 789 armenians comprised 42.3 percent of the population ,
closest to an armenian majority of any city in the empire...leaving erivan
on april 28 , 1915 , armenian volunteers reached van on may 14 and organized
and carried out a general slaughter of the local muslim population during
the next two days.

knowing their numbers would never justify their territorial ambitions ,
armenians looked to russia and europe for the fulfillment of their aims.
armenian treachery in this regard culminated at the beginning of the first
world war with the decision of the revolutionary organizations to refuse
to serve their state , the ottoman empire , and to assist instead other
invading russian armies. their hope was their participation in the russian
success would be rewarded with an independent armenian state carved out of
ottoman territories. armenian political leaders , army officers , and common
soldiers began deserting in droves.

with the russian invasion of eastern anatolia in 1914 at the beginning of
world war i , the degree of armenian collaboration with the ottoman 's enemy
increased drastically. ottoman supply lines were cut by guerilla attacks ,
armenian revolutionaries armed armenian civil populations , who in turn
massacred the muslim population of the province of van in anticipation of
expected arrival of the invading russian armies.

...meanwhile , czar nicholas ii himself came to the caucasus to make final
plans for cooperation with the armenians against the ottomans , with the
president of the armenian national bureau in tiflis declaring in response

'from all countries armenians are hurrying to enter the ranks of the
glorious russian army , with their blood to serve the victory of russian
arms...let the russian flag wave freely over the dardanelles and the
bosporus. let , with your will , great majesty , the peoples remaining
under the turkish yoke receive freedom. let the armenian people of turkey
who have suffered for the faith of christ receive resurrection for a new
free life under the protection of russia.' 155

armenians again flooded into the czarist armies. preparations were made
to strike the ottomans from the rear , and the czar returned to st. petersburg
confident that the day finally had come for him to reach istanbul.

ottoman morale and military position in the east were seriously hurt , and
the way was prepared for a new russian push into eastern anatolia , to be
accompanied by an open armenian revolt against the sultan. 156

an armenian state was organized at van under russian protection , and it
appeared that with the muslim natives dead or driven away , it might be
able to maintain itself at one of the oldest centers of ancient armenian
civilization. an armenian legion was organized 'to expel the turks from
the entire southern shore of the lake in preparation for a concerted
russian drive into the bitlis vilayet.' 162 thousands of armenians from
mus and other major centers in the east began to flood into the new
armenian state...by mid july there were as many as 250 , 000 armenians
crowded into the van area , which before the crisis had housed and fed
no more than 50 , 000 people , muslim and non muslim alike. 163

the addition of the kars and batum oblasts to the empire increased the
area of transcaucasia to over 130 , 000 square miles. the estimated population
of the entire region in 1886 was 4 , 700 , 000 , of whom 940 , 000 (20 percent) were
armenian , 1 , 200 , 000 (25 percent) georgian , and 2 , 220 , 000 (45 percent) moslem.
of the latter group , 1 , 140 , 000 were tatars. paradoxically , barely one third
of transcaucasia 's armenians lived in the erevan guberniia , where the
christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. erevan
uezd , the administrative center of the province , had only 44 , 000 armenians
as compared to 68 , 000 moslems. by the time of the russian census of 1897 ,
however , the armenians had established a scant majority , 53 percent , in the
guberniia it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent , or 670 , 000 of the 1 , 120 , 000
inhabitants. this impressive change in the province 's ethnic character
notwithstanding , there was , on the eve of the creation of the armenian
republic , a solid block of 370 , 000 tartars who continued to dominate the
southern districts , from the outskirts of ereven to the border of persia.
(see also map 1. historic armenia and map 4. administrative subdivisions of
transcaucasia).

in 1920 , '0' percent turk.

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work
of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village.
little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts
into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets
completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they
found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole
length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to
akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain
plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
tartar villages. they are quiet now , those villages , except for
howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the
scattered bones of the dead.

serdar ,

the above explained propaganda which certainly has nothing to do with
the true facts is also today the main source of asala sdpa arf terrorists'
illegal activities that still try to make money out of the bodies of
the innocent victims of the turkish genocide.

the criminal acts of the x soviet armenian government come directly
under the scope of the convention on genocide adopted by the general
assembly of the united nations on december 8 , 1948 , containing the
following provisions

the contracting parties , having considered the declaration made
by the general assembly of the united nations in its resolution
95 (1) dated december 11 , 1946 , that genocide is a crime under
international law , contrary to the spirit and aims of the united
nations and condemned by the civilized world

recognizing that in all periods of history genocide has inflicted
great losses on humanity and

being convinced that , in order to liberate mankind from such odious
scourge , international cooperation is required

members agree as hereinafter provided

article 1. the contracting parties confirm that genocide , whether
committed in time of peace or in time of war , is a crime under
international law which they undertake to prevent and to punish.

article 2. in the present convention genocide means any of the
following acts committed with intent to destroy , in whole or
in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as
such

a) killing member of the group
b) causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group
c) deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life
calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole
or in part
d) imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group
e) forcibly transferring children of the group to another group

article 3. the following acts shall be punishable

a) genocide
b) conspiracy to commit genocide
c) direct and public incitement to commit genocide
d) attempt to commit genocide.

article 4. persons committing genocide or any of the other acts
enumerated in article 3 shall be punished , whether they are
constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private
individuals.

had the convention on genocide existed before the armenian
massacres of the turks and kurds , it would probably have been
difficult for the x soviet armenian government and its responsibles
to start murdering of civilian , defenseless , faithful ottoman
citizens , children and women , (genocide and attempt to genocide) ,
to make plans to exterminate , as they have done also to urartus
and jews , faithful ottoman citizens (conspiracy to commit genocide) ,
to incite armenians to armed revolt against the legal authority
and to commit genocide , (direct and public incitement to commit
genocide).

actually , this strife in yugoslavia goes back a long way. bosinan muslims ,

i dont think you 're correct here. there have been no reports of the bosnians
muslims supporting the nazis in their genocide against the serbians. the fact is
that the croat govt. using their secret police (called the ustache , i think)
were the prime agents of the nazis in yugoslavia against the serbs.

i think senator biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.
europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this

because they get rid of their minorities long long time

foreword

for example , we were camped one night in a half ruined tartar mosque ,
the most habitable building of a destroyed village , near the border
of persia and russian armenia. during the course of evening i asked
ohanus if he could tell me anything of the history of the village and
the cause of its destruction. in his matter of fact way he replied , yes ,
i assisted in its sack and destruction , and witnessed the slaying of
those whose bones you saw to day scattered among its ruins.

p. 202 (first and second paragraphs).

we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as
ways of escape for the tartars and then proceeded in the work
of extermination. our troops surrounded village after village.
little resistance was offered. our artillery knocked the huts
into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable
and inhabitants fled from them into fields , bullets and bayonets
completed the work. some of the tartars escaped of course. they
found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border
into turkey. the rest were killed. and so it is that the whole
length of the borderland of russian armenia from nakhitchevan to
akhalkalaki from the hot plains of ararat to the cold mountain
plateau of the north were dotted with mute mournful ruins of
tartar villages. they are quiet now , those villages , except for
howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the
scattered bones of the dead.

p. 15 (second paragraph).

the tartars were , for the most part , poor. some of them lived in villages
and cultivated small farms many of them continued in the way of life of
their nomadic forefathers. they drove their flocks and herds from valley
to valley , from plain to mountain , and from mountain to plain , following
the pasturage as it changed with the seasons. they ranged from the salt
desert shores of the caspian sea far into the mighty caucasus mountains.
even the village tartars are a primitive people , only semicivilized.

i can see now that we armenians frankly despised the tartars , and , while
holding a disproportionate share of the wealth of the country , regarded and
treated them as inferiors. the fact that the russians looked down upon all
armenians in much the same way as armenians regarded tartars , far from proving
a bond between ourselves and our racially different neighbors , intensified
an attitude and conduct on our part that served only to exacerbate hostility.

p. 20 (second paragraph).

our men armed themselves , gathered together and advanced on the tartar
section of the village. there were no lights in the houses and the doors
were barred , for the tartars suspected what as to happen and were in great
fear. our men hammered on the doors , but got no response whereupon they
smashed in the doors and began a carnage that continued until the last
tartar was slain. throughout the hideous night , i cowered at home in terror ,
unable to shut my ears to the piercing screams of the helpless victims and
the loud shouts of our men. by morning the work was finished.

p. 109 (second paragraph).

as things were , the members of the dashnack party were without administrative
experience consequently the government they instituted quickly proved itself
incompetent to rule by legitimate means.

the members of the government had been revolutionists working in secret and
outside the law. when they became a legally instituted , recognized governing
body with the destiny of armenia in their hands , they proved incompetent to
do better than resume the terrorist tactics that had characterized their
fight against the russian and turkish governments in their outlaw days.

the outstanding feature of their rule , now that they were in power , was ,
as in the old days , trial and execution without hearing. a man evoking
the displeasure of the government or of some official would be tried and
condemned without arrest or preference of charges against him. the method
of execution was for a government 'mauserist' to walk up behind the
condemned man in his home or on the street , place a pistol to the back
of his head and blow out his brains. this simple way of getting rid of
those who were undesirable in the view of the government and soon became
a common way of paying debts.

p. 203 (first paragraph).

a soldier succeeded in driving his bayonet through the tartar. i saw the
point of the weapon emerge through his back. ...another soldier seized a rock
and pounded the tartar 's head with it... the armenian who had bayoneted him
sprang to his feet , wrested the weapon from the tartar 's body , and , raising
it to his lips , licked it clean of blood , exclaiming in russian , 'slodkey !
slodkey ! ' (sweet.)

p. 203 (second paragraph).

one evening i passed through what had been a tartar village. among the
ruins a fire was burning. i went to the fire and saw seated about
it a group of soldiers. among them were two tartar girls , mere children.
the girls were crouched on the ground , crying softly with suppressed
sobs. lying scattered over the ground were broken household utensils and
other furnishings of tartar peasant homes. there were also bodies of the
dead.

p. 204 (first paragraph).

i was soon asleep. in the night i was awakened by the persistent crying of
a child. i arose and went to investigate. a full moon enabled me to make
my way about and revealed to me all the wreck and litter of the tragedy
that had been enacted. guided by the child 's crying , i entered the yard of
a house , which i judged from its appearance must have been the home of a
turkish family. there in a corner of the yard i found a women dead. her
throat had been cut. lying on her breast was a small child , a girl about a
year old.

p. 118.

slowly the train of oxcarts lumbered along through the snow , the cart
jolting and the loads swaying. boys ran along the line of oxen , encouraging
them with shrill tartar cries , and belaboring the beasts with sticks. in the
carts , the women , veiled as is the tartar way , held children in their arms.
wrapped in blankets and huddled among the goods that burdened the carts they
sought protection from the wind and cold. a few old men plodded along on foot.

across the road through the ravine a barrier had been thrown. the leading
oxteam reached this barrier and halted. the gunmen and other ruffians
concealed among the rocks opened fire. women and children leaped and
scrambled from the carts , screamed , ran and sought vainly for safety.

this massacre was not complete. the armenian soldiers in the near by
barracks , hearing the firing and the turmoil , hurried to the scene....
that same day the abandoned tartar quarter of alexandropol was looted
and completely destroyed.

p. 192.

great swarms of peasants who had come out of their hiding places on the
retreat of the turks followed our army as it advanced.... they entered
into the city with the army and immediately began plundering the stores
that had been left by the turks.

p. 193.

terrible vengeance was taken upon tartars , kurds and turks. their villages
were destroyed and they themselves were slain or driven out of the country.

p. 195.

the fanatical dashnacks hated the turks above all others and then in order
of diminishing intensity tartars , kurds and russians.

p. 218. (first and second paragraphs)

russian troops did terrible things in the turkish villages...we armenians
did not spare the tartars....if persisted in , the slaughtering of prisoners ,
the looting , and the rape and massacre of the helpless become commonplace
actions expected and accepted as a matter of course.

i have been on the scenes of massacres where the dead lay on the ground ,
in numbers , like the fallen leaves in a forest. they had been as helpless
and as defenseless as sheep. they had not died as soldiers die in the
heat of battle , fired with ardor and courage , with weapons in their hands ,
and exchanging blow for blow. they had died as the helpless must , with
their hearts and brains bursting with horror worse than death itself.

p. 133 (first paragraph)

in this movement we took with us three thousand turkish soldiers who
had been captured by the russians and left on our hands when the russians
abandoned the struggle. during our retreat to karaklis two thousand of
these poor devils were cruelly put to death. i was sickened by the
brutality displayed , but could not make any effective protest. some ,
mercifully , were shot. many of them were burned to death. the method
employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut , and then after
crowding the hut with turks , set fire to the straw.

p. 19 (first paragraph)

the tartar section of the town no longer existed , except as a pile of
ruins. it had been destroyed and its inhabitants slaughtered. the same
fate befell the tartar section of khankandi.

p. 22 (second paragraph)

many of our men had served in the russian army , and were trained soldiers.
we armenians were rich and possessed arms. tartars had never received
military training. they were poor , and possessed few arms beyond knives.
...shortly after the killing of the tartars in our village , the revolution
in russia was suppressed.

p. 97 (third paragraph)

within a few years , following the beginning of the movement , an invisible
government of armenians by armenians had been established in turkish
armenia in armed opposition to the turkish government. this secret
government had its own courts and laws and an army of assassins called
'mauserists' (professional killers) to enforce its decrees.

p. 98 (first paragraph)

the dashnacks were in continual open rebellion against the turkish
government.

p. 98 (third paragraph)

...the dashnacks engineered a general revolt of armenians in turkish
armenia under the mistaken belief that european nations would intervene
and secure independence for turkish armenia.

p. 99 (second paragraph)

the dashnacks were fanatics.

p. 99 (third paragraph)

the dashnacks took advantage of this situation and extended their
revolutionary activities into the russian province. they instituted
a campaign of terrorism and employed threats and force in securing
contributions to the party funds from rich armenians. a wealthy
man would be assessed a stipulated sum. refusal to pay brought upon
him a sentence of death.

every member of the party was pledged to carry out orders without
question. if a man were to be assassinated , lots might be drawn to
select an executioner or the job might be assigned to one of the
'mauserists' of the party.

p. 130 (first paragraph)

...in moments of victory against turks and kurds or tartars , they
armenians have been remorseless in seeking vengeance.

p. 130 (third paragraph)

the city was a scene of confusion and terror. during the early days of
the war , when the russian troops invaded turkey , large numbers of the
turkish population abandoned their homes and fled before the russian
advance.

p. 159 (second paragraph)

i made a cannon , a huge gun to lift which required four men. i made balls
for it. with my cannon the armenians could knock down any of the tartar
houses and so they were able to drive the tartars out.

p. 181 (first paragraph)

the tartar villages were in ruins.

p. 189 (third paragraph)

the dead tartar lay with his head in a pool of mud and blood , his
beard still setaceous and now crimsoned.

my question is , given so many separations in the armenian community , what
was the common denominator of the armenian people that allowed armenian
nationalism to emerge in the nineteenth century \? as i stated , religion

there are various contradictory views on the origin of the armenians.
the name is to be found in the darian inscriptions in the form 'armina'
or 'aramaniya' is to be found in the inscription on the bistun monument.
the following references to the armenians are to be found in the bistun
cuneiform inscription of dara vishdasb (510 b.c.).

1. the monarch dara said i sent my servant to arminam 'armeniya'.

6. on reaching arminam 'armeniya'.

7. to the country town of zozo , to armaniya 'armeniya'.

according to karakashian

as for 'armenia' , the equivalent of the 'armin' or 'arminik' of the persians ,
this is more recent than the word 'ararat' , and is to be found used in
the dara inscriptions for 'haiastan'.

saint martin

the name 'armenie' has been given since very early times by almost all
the various eastern peoples to the territory referred to by the armenians
as 'haiastan'. it was known to the syrians as armenia and to the arabs
as ermeniyye.

others believe that urartu was known in the time of the medes as 'harminap'
which was later modified by the persians to 'arminia'. 'ar' refers to a
place , as in ararat , archish , aruyr , archar , arshav , arazen and aror ,
while 'men' is used to refer to spirit , thought or human being , and
therefore 'armen' would appear to signify 'the people of that place'.

g. alishan believes that 'according to our national vocabulary haik
is the diminutive form of hai , and that hai is the name of our
nation. our nation is in no way connected with the word armen that
foreigners apply to our people.'

it would thus appear that 'armenia' is a place name , that 'armen' is
the name of the people who lived there , and that these are in no way
connected with the word 'hai'.

haik and haiastan

armenian historians believe haik to have been a great hero from whom
the armenian people took the name 'hai'. but the mere resemblance
between the words 'haik' and 'hai' constitutes no real proof , and ,
in any case , no such theory appears before the time of moses of
khoren.

haiasa

the following studies show quite clearly that 'hai' and 'haiasa' were
no more than general names used by the hittites to refer to the
region known as armenia.

professor hachadurian 'haiasa was the general name used in hittite
inscriptions for upper armenia.'

yensen , in his 'hittites and armenians' tries to prove that 'hai' is
identical with the hittite 'hatio' , in other words that 'hai' is a
hittite word. research , however , has proved this erroneous , and shown
that 'hai' was derived from 'hatio'.

mortman 's attempt to read the urartu inscriptions as armenian met with
no success. as for greek , there is no point in even mentioning it.

the resemblance between the words 'haiasa' and 'haiastan' is so obvious
that we may well accept 'haiasa' as the oldest form of 'haiastan'.

let us now cast a brief glance on how the words 'hai' , 'haikazan' and
'haiastan' entered our older works.

according to karakashian

'the word haik is never to be found employed with reference to a
leader of the armenian people prior to moses of khoren , nor is it
ever found employed in the forms haika or haykazn .

agahangelos and puzant use the word as a title or a place name (he
improved and developed haiastan , etc.). if the word had referred
to a nation and had been derived from hai or haik they could
also have used the words haikak and haykazn in a number of
places.'

according to professor sayce , who deciphered a number of hittite
inscriptions

'in the hittite language the suffix ha is used to specify quality
or species. the words haddanas , haddina were used by the
assyrians to refer to the hittites. with the transformation of the
d between the two a letters to y hadinasdani was in this
way transformed to haiastan '.

professor grechmer fully agrees with this point of view , but regards
the significance and explanation so far accorded to the terms 'hai'
and 'haistan' as quite unsatisfactory. he finds , however , that a
solution to this problem is brought nearer by the name 'haiasa'
which is so frequently found in bogazkoy from 1400 b.c. onwards.
forrer takes 'haiasa' as referring to upper armenia. in that case
it seems likely that 'haiasa' was actually a part of armenia. the
suffix dan is of anatolian origin. the real root is 'hayasa' , which
refers to the country of the 'hayasas'.

e. chantre writes as follows on the subject of the ethnological
and anthropological characteristics of the armenian people.

the armenians in russia may be characterized as follows almost
all of them are brachycephalic or leptocephalic , very dark ,
above average height , an aissores asian group with close ties
with certain kurdish tribes and azerbaijan peoples.

according to j. deniker

from the philological point of view , the armenian and kurds may be
regarded as belonging to the iranian group...the armenians are
descended from various elements and from a very mixed race. their
average height varies between 1.63 and 1.69 according to the region.
they are almost always short headed , with skull measurements of
85 87. as a race they belong to the indo afghan assyrian turkic
family.

professor rene vernont writes as follows

the armenians are a mixture of semites , turk , kurds and mongols ,
but some of them display armenian features , e.g. , height a little
above average , fair complexion , dark hair , dark eyes , very often
a hooked nose and a rather wide mouth.

investigations carried out by n. kossovitch on the links between
armenian blood groups and their anthropological characteristics
led him to the conclusion that the armenians did not form a
distinct race.

have troops on the ground in the former yugoslavia too...now let
me bomb so i can make it look like i am doing something in the

the problem is that the blue berets in bosnia are dead meat if
clinton starts bombing , but clinton does n't have the courage to
ask that the blue berets leave , because then he becomes primarily
responsible to the bosnian policy of the un and the allies.
clinton wants to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to feel
free to use american military power for the sake of domestic
us politics and his domestic image , but he does n't want to assume
the primary international leadership role in the un and among
the allies , like bush , for all his faults , did in the gulf war...
because with leadership comes responsibility , and clinton seems
to want to retain the europeans as scapegoats.

clinton wants to leave the europeans in charge and responsible ,
but wants to freelance on the side...and if his freelancing gets
too hot , he wants to be able to cut and run...the american public may
be easily fooled...european leaders are n't.

i got some e mail on this topic and decided to do some more reading. i
thought it would be nice to share my response with everyone

how about the following scholarly source \?

source pierre oberling , the road to bellapais the turkish cypriot
exodus to northern cyprus , social science monographs , boulder ,
1982 , isbn 88033 000 7.

well , according to a book by c.m.woodhouse i 've read it looks like the
situation was much more complicated than either of us suggest. needless
to say nationalism on both the greek and turkish side was strong and
began in april of '74 with confrontations over the agean (as usual)
between the government in turkey and the ioannidis junta.
in july 15 an assasination attempt against makarios (then president of
cyprus) plotted by ioannidis , ruling dictator in greece , fails and
makarios flees to england. the journalist nicos sampson takes over in a
coup led by the greek officers in the cyprus national guard. turkish
forces which had been mobilized in anticipation begin landing on the
north shore of the island on 20th of july. this caused the welcomed
collapse of the dictatorship the 24th with mr. karamanlis returning from

well , i am forced to disagree with you. the greeks started massacring
the turkish population on cyprus in 1974. in 1974 , turkiye stepped into
cyprus to preserve the lives of the turkish population there. this is
nothing but a simple historical fact. unfortunately , the intervention
was too late at least for some of the victims. mass graves containing
numerous bodies of women and children already showed what fate had been
planned for a peaceful minority.

the people of turkiye know quite well that greece and the greek cypriots
will never abandon the idea of hellenizing cyprus and will remain
eternally hopeful of uniting it with greece , someday , whatever the
cost to the parties involved. the history speaks for itself. greece was
the sole perpetrator of invasion on that island when it sent its troops
on july 15 , 1974 in an attempt to topple the legitimate government of
archibishop makarios.

the release of nikos sampson , a member of eoka national organization
of cypriot fighters and a convicted terrorist , shows that the
'enosis' mentality continues to survive in greece. one should not
forget that sampson dedicated his life to annihilating the turks
in cyprus , committed murder to achieve this goal , and tried to
destroy the island 's independence by annexing it to greece. of
course , the greek governments will have to bear the consequences
for this irresponsible conduct.

turkish cypriots are simply seeking guarantees that will preclude a
repeat performance by the fanatical cadres of the greeks' eoka. if
such assurances are not perfectly implemented , there is every reason
to expect that the local greeks will be misguided enough to perpetrate
their past mistakes. on such an occasion , the turkish side may not find
it satisfactory to act with reluctance to go any further than before ,
for it is unacceptable to remain always defensive against cyclical
vicious attacks. therefore it would be better to have a true federation
of two separate sections living in obligatory peace , rather than another
armed confrontation that would be started by the greeks and obligatorily
but decisively terminated by the turks.

the present greek government is trying to tyrannize the turkish population
in western thrace by forbidding it its ethnic and religious rights , which
were established through international treaties. one might be better
advised to remember that misadventures against turkiye do not serve
greece well.

an offer of membership in the european common market as bait for concessions
that may doom the turks in cyprus to extinction is not a viable course for
greece or her friends. neither turkish lives nor turkish honor has been
placed on the bidding block to be sold for commercial gain.

source walker , christopher armenia the survival of a nation.
new york (st. martin 's press) , 1980.

this generally pro armenian work contains the following information
of direct relevance to the nazi holocaust

a) dro (the butcher) , the former dictator of x soviet armenia and the
architect of the genocide of 2.5 million muslims , the most respected
of nazi armenian leaders , established an armenian provisional republic
in berlin during world war ii

b) this 'provisional government' fully endorsed and espoused the social
theories of the nazis , declared themselves and all armenians to be members
of the aryan 'super race '

c) they published an anti semitic , racist journal , thereby aligning themselves
with the nazis and their efforts to exterminate the jews and ,

d) they mobilized an armenian army of up to 30 , 000 members which fought side
by side with the wehrmacht.


in fact , by 1942 , nazi armenians in europe had established a vast
network of pro german collaborators , that extended over two continents.
thousands of armenians were serving the german army and waffen ss in
russia and western europe. armenians were involved in espionage and
fifth column activities for hitler in the balkans and arabian peninsula.
they were promised an 'independent' state under german 'protection' in
an agreement signed by the 'armenian national council.' (a copy of
this agreement can be found in the 'congressional record , ' november 1 ,
1945 see document 1.) on this side of the atlantic , nazi armenians
were aware of their brethrens alliance. they had often expressed
pro nazi sentiments until america entered the war.


in 1941 , while the jews were being assembled for their doom in the nazi
concentration camps , the nazi armenians in germany formed the first
armenian battalion to fight alongside the nazis. in 1943 , this battalion
had grown into eight battalions of 30 , 000 strong under the command of dro
(the butcher) , who was the former dictator of x soviet armenia and the
architect of the cold blooded genocide of 2.5 million turks and kurds
between 1914 1920. an armenian national council was formed by the notorious
dashnak party leaders in berlin , which was recognized by the nazis. encouraged
by this , the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed
and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the
members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler 's policy of
extermination of the jews.

this armenian nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore
performance staged by the armenians during wwi , when they back stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million muslims by colluding with the invading russian army.

ancestors committed , nor do i direct hatred toward the descendants
of those who committed evil acts against my ancestors.

will all of this discussion rebuild a single mosque \? will it rebuild
the temple \? somehow i doubt that it will.

a post in another group , on the bosnian war , asked us all to love
each other , that love would conquer hate. sadly , i remember a tv
interview with a young woman in sarajevo (sp \? ) who was as i remember ,
a former olympic calibre contestant in the rifle shoot. she was now
trying to pick off serbian snipers. during the communist years she
had married a serb , who was now fighting against her people. so it
seems that hate will conquer love.

is there an odd chance that we might all forget past wrongs and try
and see how we might all live together \? it 's a damn small planet ,
which we have come very close to turning into a radioactive ball ,
glowing softly in space. we seem to have been spared that prospect ,
shall we now bathe it in each other 's blood \?

shalom , salam , and peace

actually , this strife in yugoslavia goes back a long way. bosinan muslims ,
in collaboration with the nazis , did to serbians after the first world
war what serbs are doing to muslims now. this is not a fresh case of
ethnic cleansing but just another chapter in the continuing saga
of intense mutual hatred , destruction , ... not taking sides in this
perpetual war does not amount to religious bigotry. it could just
be helplessness with regards to bringing peace to a region that does

sedar , you seem to have your nationalities mixed up. when did you become
a spokesman for kurds \?

since your criminal grandparents ruthlessly exterminated more than
600 , 000 kurds between 1914 and 1916 in eastern anatolia. referring to
notes from the personal diary of russian general l. odishe liyetze on
the turkish front , he wrote ,

on the nights 11 12 march , 1918 alone armenian butchers
bayoneted and axed to death 3000 muslims in areas surrounding
erzincan. these barbars threw their victims into pits , most
likely dug according to their sinister plans to extinguish
muslims , in groups of 80. my adjutant counted and unearthed
200 such pits. this is an act against our world of civilization.

on march 12 , 1918 lieut colonel griyaznof wrote (from an official
russian account of the turkish genocide) ,

roads leading to villages were littered with bayoneted torsos ,
dismembered joints and carved out organs of muslim peasants...
alas ! mainly of women and children.

(acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander
of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war ,
lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov)

the things i have heard and seen during the two months , until the
liberation of erzurum by the turks , have surpassed all the
allegations concerning the vicious , degenerate characteristic of
the armenians. during the russian occupation of erzurum , no armenian
was permitted to approach the city and its environs.

while the commander of the first army corps , general kaltiyin remained
in power , troops including armenian enlisted men , were not sent to the
area. when the security measures were lifted , the armenians began to
attack erzurum and its surroundings. following the attacks came the
plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder
of the owners of these houses...plundering was widely committed by
the soldiers. this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers
who had remained in the rear during the war.

one day , while passing through the streets on horseback , a group of
soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of
seventy years in a certain direction. the roads were covered with mud ,
and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud
and dirt...

it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and
traps. the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds
and withdrew. the reason was that most of the turks who were on night
patrol did not return , and no one knew what had happened to them. the
turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear
also. finally , the court martial which had been established for the
trials of murderers and plunderers , began to liquidate itself for
fear that they themselves would be punished. the incidents of murder
and rape , which had decreased , began to occur more frequently.

sometime in january and february , a leading turkish citizen haci bekir
efendi from erzurum , was killed one night at his home. the commander
in chief (odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.
the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals
that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its
highest point , that they had insulted and robbed the people and half
of the turks sent outside the city had not returned.

...we learnt the details this incident from the commander in chief ,
odishelidge. they were as follows

the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers , and the
act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades...
more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been
killed in erzincan. large holes were dug and the defenceless
turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. later , the
murdered turks were thrown into the holes. the armenian who stood
near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses
'seventy dead bodies , well , this hole can take ten more.' thus ten
more turks would be cut into pieces , thrown into the hole , and when
the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.

the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently
fill a house with eighty turks , and cut their heads off one by one.
following the erzincan massacre , the armenians began to withdraw
towards erzurum... the armenian renegades among those who withdrew
to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road , and
destroyed the entire population , together with the villages.

during the transportation of the cannons , ammunition and the carriages
that were outside the war area , certain people were hired among the
kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. while the travellers
were passing through erzurum , the armenians took advantage of the time
when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill
the kurds they had hired. when the russian soldiers heard the cries
of the dying kurds , they attempted to help them. however , the
armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would
have the same fate if they intervened , and thus prevented them from
acting. all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with
hatred and loathing.

lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that
he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot a kurd. the
kurd fell down but did not die. the armenian attempted to force the
stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd. however , since
the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony , the armenian failed
in his attempt. having seen this , the armenian ripped open the abdomen
of the kurd , disembowelled him , and finally killed him by stamping
him with the iron heel of his boot.

odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape
from the village of ilica were killed. their heads had been cut off
by axes. he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered
children. lieutenant colonel gryaznov , who passed through the village
of ilica , three weeks after the massacre told us the following

there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces , on the roads.
every armenian who happened to pass through these roads , cursed and
spat on the corpses. in the courtyard of a mosque which was about
25x30 meter square , dead bodies were piled to a height of 140
centimeters. among these corpses were men and women of every age ,
children and old people. the women 's bodies had obvious marks of
rape. the genitals of many girls were filled with gun powder.

a few educated armenian girls , who worked as telephone operators
for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov
to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be
proud of what the armenians had done. to the lieutenant colonel 's
disgusted amazement , the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle ,
instead of being horrified. the lieutenant colonel had severely
reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. when he told
the girls that the armenians , including women , were generally more
licentious than even the wildest animals , and that their indecent
and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity
and barbarity , before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers ,
the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and
claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.

an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command
narrated the following incident which took place on february 20

the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall. they had cut
out the women 's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.
the great massacre in erzurum began on february 7... the enlisted men
of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. then they
took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people
among this group were able to save their lives as the result of
my decisive attempts. the others , the armenians claimed , were
released when they learnt that i understood what was going on.
among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the
armenian officers , karagodaviev. today , some turks were murdered
on the streets.

on february 12 , some armenians have shot more than ten innocent
moslems. the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were
threatened with death. meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for
murdering an innocent turk.

when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would
be hanged for his crime , the killer shouted furiously 'how dare
you hang an armenian for killing a turk \? ' in erzurum , the
armenians burned down the turkish market. on february 17 , i heard
that the entire population of tepekoy village , situated within
the artillery area , had been totally annihilated. on the same
day when antranik entered erzurum , i reported the massacre to
him , and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible
act. however no result was achieved.

in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred , there was a
natural silence. on the night of 26 27 february , the armenians deceived
the russians , perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the
turkish soldiers. later , it was understood that this massacre had
been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular.
the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed
one by one. the number of murders committed on that night reached
three thousand. it was the armenians who bragged to about the details
of the massacre. the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers
were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even
withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred
people and two cannons , for one night , and ran away. the leading
armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.
however , the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with
the renegades in this massacre , just as in all the others. the lower
classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders
of the leading armenian figures and commanders.

i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals
were accessories to these murders. no , for there were people who
opposed the armenians for such actions , since they understood that
it would yield no result. however , such people were only a minority.
furthermore , such people were considered as traitors to the armenian
cause. some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have
supported the massacres secretly. some , on the other hand , preferred
to remain silent. there were certain others , who , when accused by
the russians of infamy , would say the following 'you are russians.
you can never understand the armenian cause.' the armenians had a
conscience. they would commit massacres and then would flee in fear
of the turkish soldiers.

the incidents that occurred only recently clearly manifest the real
nature of the armenian ideology. nothing which is already done can
be undone.

ok , his involvement is alleged by the fbi , which does n't seem

this does not mean that all arab americans were involved , nor

diaspora 'a cancer'
by julian kossoff and lindsay schusman in
jewish chronicle , london , 22. dec. 1989

leading israeli author and cultural commentator , a.b. yehoshua ,
launched a ferocious attack on diaspora jewry at a zionist youth
council meeting in north london , last week.

the diaspora , he claimed , was the cancer connected to the main
tissue of the jewish people . he was scathing about its failure to
act before the holocaust.


deleted for bravity


jewish values in israel embraced every aspect of daily life ,
unlike in the diaspora , where jews had no responsibility for the
country they lived in , he said.

he warned that modern hebrew , a unifying force for the jewish
people , would have to struggle for its future , especially in
literary circles. it faced fierce competition from the english
language.

a perfect example is the outcry over the temporary removal of

treatment of jews in arab countries during the past 50 years.

never mind the fact that these people were denied the right to a fair trial.
and israel was supposed to uphold western values , eh \?

i doubt if the non jewish world is even capable of having any
compassion towards jews as anti semitism is so ancient and so
basic to both christianity and islam.

check your facts before bashing islam again. while there may be muslim
anti semites , this is no way a tenet of the religion. saying anti semitism is
basic to islam is implicating the entire muslim world , based on a selective
sampling of a few people , and it flies in the face of what islam teaches.

you gave a good reference (please , who was the author of plymouth

radiating from someone who is incapable of providing a single scholarly
source on his 'genocide apology program' , it is rather amusing. again ,
where is your non existent list of scholars and scholarly sources \?
here is mine

an appropriate analogy with the jewish holocaust might be the
systematic extermination of the entire muslim population of
the independent republic of armenia which consisted of at
least 30 40 percent of the population of that republic. the
memoirs of an armenian army officer who participated in and
eye witnessed these atrocities was published in the u.s. in
1926 with the title 'men are like that.' other references abound.
(rachel a. bortnick the jewish times june 21 , 1990)


in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul.
it is in our power to tear away the veil of illusion that some of us
create for ourselves. it certainly is possible to severe the artificial
life support system of an imagined 'ethnic purity' that some of us
falsely trust as the only structure that can support their heart beats
in this alien land.
(sahak melkonian 1920 preserving the armenian purity )


the crime of systematic cleansing by mass killing and extermination
of the muslim population in soviet republic of armenia , karabag ,
bosnia and herzegovina is an 'islamic holocaust' comparable to the
extermination of 2.5 million muslims by the armenian government
during the wwi and of over 6 million european jews during the wwii.
(tovfik kasimov azeri leader september 25 , 1992)


today 's ethnic cleansing policies by the serbian dictatorship against
croatians and muslims of yugoslavia , as well as the soviet republic
of armenia 's against the muslim population of neighboring azerbaijan ,
are really no different in their aspirations than the genocide
perpetrated by the armenian government 78 years ago against the
turkish and kurdish muslims and sephardic jews living in these
lands. (cebbar leygara kurdish leader october 13 , 1992)

this is such bullshit. deir yassin was an unprovoked attack on
the part of the jews , and a massacre defines it best in my
opinion. the village of deir yassin had had a pact with the
jews , a peace pact , but the irgun purposely broke this
agreement in order to scare off the palestinians. i might
grant that this village housed armed arabs i doubt it but
nothing in the archives and available literature indicates that
this was a motivating force amongst the irgun. the deir yassin
massacre was part of an over all strategy to intimidate the
palestinians to flee the jewish homeland. , ...and contrary to
your belief , many civilians were killed. deir yassin was later
advertized by the very jews who perpetrated it because it was
useful in getting many palestinians to leave. the palestinians
were rightfully scared off , because they did not want another
deir yassin.
i'm not necessarily condemning the israelites here
atrocities were aslo committed on the part of the arabs.
israelophiles should just be careful in thinking that they are
and were the good guys in the middle east. both arab and jew
suck equally.

rj3s , you say that there is no evidence that what motivated the irgun
to attack dir yassin was its strategic importance. in fact , begin ,
who was in charge of the irgun , wrote that dir yassin was attacked for
its military significance.

dir yassin was merely a battle in the war of liberation. people died.
but the thing was never intended to be a masacre. that this hapenned
is a tragedy of war not a crime of the irgun.

...bosnia is a big enough problem for the us to preach about what

are safely tucked away at home in the us.

look nobody asked those countries about their un forces
to be on the ground. they can take their forces which are

well bosnia and the us did...the un cannot impose blue berets on
a country , and the us has voted for the current policy and mandate
in the security council...and could have said no if it wanted to...
it has a veto.

clinton has not demanded the removal of the un forces...because he want
to have his cake and eat it too...he wants to dictate policy but
not be responsible for the policy he wants to dictate. if clinton
asks for the blue berets to leave , then he bill clinton becomes
responsible for what happens...him and sen. biden and their friends
who want to fight the war from 10 , 000 ft...as long as the blue berets
are there clinton can use europe as a scapegoat for american
indecisiveness.

i fully admit that the current un policy approved by all the major
powers including the us may be wrong or inappropriate...but these
back seat drivers in the us like clinton and biden are just a bunch
of hypocrites looking for an gimmick to look like they are doing
something to assuage their own consciences and those who are
demanding action or leadership...and most european leaders are
smart enough to know the difference between american hot air and
american leadership.

i think senator biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.
europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this
world. like biden said , they are the bigots when it comes to
cultural difference and minorty closer to their home.

well , if biden is so outraged...why the hell does n't he do something
about it...where is his resolution in the us senate for a declaration

there are arabs in cabinet but look how long it took and to what
insignificant positions they are assigned ! and this is based solely
on race not political belief or security as jewish members of the
same party have always been welcome just not their fellow arabs.

first of all , the arab standing in any party , or as any party , is solely
dependent upon the amount of political power they can wield effectively.

it is not a question of an individuals standing. when a party puts up an
arab for a cabinet post and that arab is rejected but the position is given
to a jew from the same party we are not talking about power but racism.
would you care to deny this has happened on several occasions with labour
coalitions \?

please cite specific examples where an arab party member was rejected
while a jewish party member was accepted. if you examine these i am
sure you will discover that the arab party member did not have the power
base that his jewish counterpart had. the party structure in israel
has changed quite a bit insofar as knesset member elections go. knesset
members for most parties are now elected via primaries. the top standing
members end up with cabinet posts. this is purely a political power
issue. check the ranking of arab labor party members , as opposed
to jewsih members and let me know which posts are held by jews that
ranked lower in the party than their arab fellow electees.

once again , if for arguments sake , all the arab israelis were to vote
for labor at the next election , you can rest assured that the number of
arab mks and cabinet members would increase proportionately to the
power shift.

not their party them as individuals . even when they belong to nice
peaceful zionist mainstream parties they are not welcome. arabs are
excluded on ficitious security grounds which are just an excuse. it
sure looks like racism to me.

you are overlooking the fact that they wield political power
as individuals based upon a wider collective power base.

arabs are excluded from cabinet , even when they do the things you
suggest , because they are arabs. unless of course you have a better
reason \? i am happy to listen to any good reason why a leftist jew
is less of a security risk than a leftist arab from the same party.
look at the present cabinet.

the reasoning i see at work is purely political. as far as security
goes i think that some serious gaffs were made by right wing jews
as well e.g. sharon.

the above claim that you do not hate anybody may not be quite
true. the falsity of this statement is easily visible in the
intellectual corruption that dominates everything you post in
this group. your complete lack of objectivity toward israel ,
and jewish identity in general , reveal biases that indicate a
great steaming heap of hatred !

you certainly have shown a genuine hatred for honesty and for
objectivity. you repeatedly post items or quotes removed from
their original context so that they can be used to further an
agenda of rabid opposition to the very existence of israel.

you have used this dishonest technique to paint a false image
of several israeli leaders. i ca n't say if you actually hate
these leaders , but the lies and misrepresentations of them do
suggest that you have a visceral prejudice against them.

so , while you claim that you do not hate anybody , there is an
ample body of evidence to suggest that this claim of yours is
false. it is obvious that you hate israel , and it is evident
that you hate the jewish people.

and , if you are jewish , you are a self hating jew. there can
be no doubt of this. although you will call upon your jewish
background in an effort to claim the high moral ground , there
is no doubt that you would like to see the jewish people fade
away completely , as a people. your advocacy of intermarriage
for the purpose of dissolving the jewish people is proof that
you hate the jewish people.

and by your effort to superimpose the meaninglessness of your
own jewishness on all jews , you 've clearly demonstrated to me
that you hate yourself.

is a religion and it is practised in many parts of the world. but it is not

the way the western press use the word 'muslim' in this bosnian debacle has

it is indeed different usage of the word muslim . in bosnia , it is more or
less used as an ethnic term not as religious one . there are people in bosnia
who refer to themselves as christian bosnian muslims if you can make sense
of that . bosnian serbs and bosnian muslims have the same language.

instigate the morea rebellion that resulted in the massacres of

in 1865 , immediately after enactment of the new organic statute for the
jewish community , and just as jewish capital from europe was beginning
to have an effect in istanbul , local armenians and greeks started a pogrom
against jews immediately across the sea of marmara at haydarpasa , terminus
of the anatolia railroad , with three hundred jews massacred and many more
beaten and raped before the disturbance was stopped after the sultan sent
his personal guard across the bay to protect the jews 39 .

in later years , ritual murder attacks against jews , carried out mostly
by native greeks , armenians , and , in arab provinces , by maronites and
other arab christians , often with the assistance of the local european
consuls , took place throughout the empire. there were literally thousands
of incidents continuously until world war i , in southeastern europe as far
west and north as monastir and kavalla , in istanbul , at gallipoli and
the dardanelles , at salonica , and in all the arab provinces as far south
as damascus and beirut and in egypt at cairo and alexandria. these
invariably resulted from accusations spread among ottoman christians
by word of mouth , or published in their newspapers , often by christian
financiers and merchants anxious to get their jewish competitors out of
the way or to divert onto the jews muslim anger at reports of christian
massacres of muslims in southeastern europe or central asia , resulting
in individual and mob attacks on jews , and the burning of their shops
and homes.

individual experiences were horrible. jews constantly went in fear of
armenian or greek attacks in the streets of ottoman cities. in egypt
and syria , it was usually the greeks who led the way , in many cases
with the assistance of local armenians and syrian christians , whose
greek , arabic and french language newspapers often printed all the
rumors they could find regarding jews , evidently with the desire of
instigating violence. the syrian arab christians in particular spread
their long standing anti semitic hatreds from syria to egypt , where
their monopoly of the local press and their espousal of popular causes
such as egyptian nationalism and opposition to the british rule , enabled
them to spread their anti jewish message among the muslim masses with
little question or opposition.

on 20 june 1890 , thus , sir evelyn baring (later lord cromer) , british
high commissioner in egypt , received the following report from david
and nissim ades , in cairo

''sir ,

i beg sir to draw to your attention to the violent articles which
has (sic) appeared in an arabic paper called el mahroussa which
contained nothing but lies and false accusations against the jews ,
especially those (the issues) of the 14th , 17th and 19th instant.
now , sir , are we to have here an anti semitic party amidst fanaticism ,
greeks , armenians , etc. , or is he to be allowed to continue to poison
the people 's minds with exaggeration and painted words \? in an article ,
he asserted that the jews use christian blood for passover , of course
this has caused a deal of excitement.'' 40

whenever greek and other orthodox religious authorities or prominent
greek business leaders or consuls were asked to help to stem the violence
or reduce tension , they invariably indicated their cooperation and then
failed to do anything to prevent attacks or punish those who stimulated
or led them. 41

the arab association for human rights (hra) was
formed in 1988 to address discriminatory practices and
human rights abuses by israel against its palestinian
citizens.

it is a unique association concerned with the civil ,
political , economic , social and cultural rights of the
palestinian national minority in israel. among the issues
of concern are land confiscation , education , prison
conditions , unemployment , torture and the unequal
allocation of israel 's resources.

today there are around 800 , 000 palestinian arabs living
within the green line (the pre 1967 borders of israel) ,
constituting 18 of israel 's citizens. for them it is an
empty citizenship in a system geared exclusively for the
needs of the jewish population. legally and practically ,
israel has proclaimed itself a jewish state and early
promises of equality for non jewish citizens have not
been fulfilled. this is apparent in many areas strongly
affecting the palestinian national minority.

most arab agricultural land has been confiscated since
1948. the arab sector is vastly underfunded and does
not receive a fair share of state resources. on a day to
day level , palestinians face discrimination in many
different forms and find it is a struggle to get permission
to build a house , start a business , find a job or educate
their children.

activities

monitoring civil , economic , cultural and human rights
abuses of palestinians within the green line.
taking carefully selected test cases to court.
providing legal advice and assistance to lawyers in the
occupied territories.
educating the palestinian public as to their rights and
methods of mobilization.
conducting public campaigns on local and international

do you have a problem with the language \? i said
everyone suffered emotionally because they sympathyzed with the

source ahmet cosar said to have been part of 1992 terror attack at
macdonalds in munich , the fuckersville reporter , february 7 , 1993 , p. 1.

le merde , the influential anatolia daily , based on unidentified sources ,
claimed last week that ahmet cosar , the founder and leader of one
faction of the big mac funny army for the liberation of flies from the
spider webs (bmfalfsw) , was among the argic led terrorists who staged an
attack on the toilets at macdonalds fast food restaurant in munich...

le merde added that up to 1992 , cosar operated out of tygra.michigan.com ,
but escaped from the country when bullshit bikers entered the city. it was
about this time that a statement issued by bmfalfsw claimed that mr. cosar
was dead of wounds suffered during a mailbombing by bdb@becker.gts.org ,
although it is generally believed that the mysterious leader is alive and
well and presently is residing alternately in fuckersville , bullshitia , and
zuma , stupidia. the paper also noted that the communist government of
sexual maniac hasan b. mutlu and his f.u.c.k.a.l.l party accepted the
zumabot 's underground leader with open arms and still providing him
with assistance in exchange for pornographic material.

le merde further adds that bmfalfsw derives only a small portion of its
expenditures from wealthy drug lords who support the cause , with the rest
coming either from other sources or from proceeds of an involvement in
child porn trafficking.

now i have a comment concerning israeli terrorism
during the 1930 's and 1940 's. the hirgun , and other branch
off militant groups , did fight the british do get them out of
palestine. yet i fail to see how this israeli form of
terrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the
arabs. these jewish terrorist groups killed innocent british
soldiers , but not only thta also killed many jews who were in
favor of a compromise with the palestinians.

the irgun killed soldiers , which is a legitimate way to drive an unwanted
fogriend regime from a country. they did n't kill blindly their families or
such (not as a policy , i agree that brits which were not soldiers also were
killed sometimes) nor they killed arabs just for being arabs.

in case i have to remind you the difference , the majority of the attacks of
the arab terrorist organizations was on civilians. they even tried to
justify their attacks by saying that all jews in the israel served in the army
at one point in time or another and therefore are legitimate targets.

in addition , they
massacred an entire palestinian village in 1948 , contributing
to the exodus of the frightened palestinians who feared their
very lives.

yes , these exceptions were tragic mistakes. i was n't there and do n't have
reffereces handy but from what i heard your description is a bit carried away ,
most of the vilagers fled with several dozens , most of them claimed to be
fighters being killed.

those massaceres are far from being the rule considering that dozens if not
hounders of arab vilages came under israeli rule during the same time period.

i mention this not because i'm anti semitic i'm part
jewish but because this self righteousness on the part of the
israelites pisses me off so. i'm not as critical of the
palestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the
jews. it 's a damn shame that the palestinians had to pay for
german and european anti semitism.

what do you mean screwed over by the jews \? they began the '47 war and
did n't accept the arrgenment planned by the u.n. , what did you expect the
jews to do \? \?

you also wrote

that would be false. if you read your history , you will learn that
right after the 1967 war , the victorious israelis decided to raze a
section of the newly captured east jerusalem , near the wailing wall.
it is in this section that mosques were razed.

so now you have to find some source that notes that more than 1 mosque
was razed. you then followed it with

this episode is an example of a good government running amok with

really \? do you still feel that israelis are comparable in the running

arab civilians did die at dir yassin. but there was no massacre. first
of all , the village housed many armed troops.

nobody ever produced the meagerest evidence for this. it does not
appear in several long published accounts by irgun participants.
even some irgun propagandists do not make this claim.

secondly , the irgun
and stern fighters had absolutely no intentions of killing civilians.

several members of the irgun attacking party , including the leader ,
deposited personal declarations in the irgun archives (jabotinsky
institute , tel aviv) which state that the lehi proposed to liquidate
the village after the conquest . it seems the begin overruled
this plan , however the willingness of many of the attackers to
seriously consider this possibility serves as instructive
character evidence.

the village was attacked only for its military significance.

the haganah tried to get the irgun to attack a village with
real military significance , but it was considered too hard.
the soft target of deir yassin was chosen instead.

in fact ,
a warning was given to the occupants of the village to leave before
the attack was to begin.

there was intention (probably originating with begin) to give such
a warning but the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch before
reaching the village. everyone knows that.

by all rational standards , dir yassin was not a massacre.

by all rational standards , you should be posting from b cpu.

the killing
was unintentional. the village housed arab snipers and arab troops.
thus it was attacked for its military significance. it was not
attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.

a lie repeated is still a lie.

to even compare dir yassin , in which some 120 or so arabs died , to the
holocaust is absurd. the irgun did not want to kill any civilians. the
village had almost 1000 inhabitants , most of whom survived.

this is really a strange target for martillo. malaysia has fully

economic success story. its success may not be as dramatic as japan
and singapore nevertheless it has fully vindicated itself. so ,
advocating anglo colonialism is ludicrous for malaysia. next , i

probably experiencing one the greatest sustained economic booms in
the history of mankind.

do you think present day england is in a position to set the stage for any
more colonization. they will be lucky if they can keep intact what they
have.

with us assistance and proper agreements , redeployment of the british
and french colonial empires would not be hard. primitive 3rd world
elites who resist and who incite resistance among their deluded ,
brainwashed and essentially enslaved populations would get the iraq
treatment.


dream on. they are having problems even with deploying ground troops
in bosnia. public opinion dictates that loss of lives (even in
miniscule quantities) , cannot be tolerated in the rich countries.
this is really wierd. if you come to think of it , the armed forces are
paid to basically to accept the risk of dying. if that danger is removed ,
it then has to be viewed as welfare on a grand scale. but , that is exactly
what the public is saying.

the iraqi operation lead to an extraordinary low level of casualties.
this is an anomaly. a combination of iraqi incompetence and desert terrain.
any future operation would lead to more casualties. for example the
bombing in beirut lead to more gi deaths than the whole of desert storm.

do you really think that scum like nehru ever asked themselves whether
the vast majority of indians would be better off under british or
local rule \? nehru was driven by a crude desire for power.
nationalism was just the vehicle whereby indian nationalists persuaded
a lot of poor deluded fools to die in order to give a small elite the
power to exploit other indians.

answer do n't ask. do n't even think about it. just put this line into your
global kill file

well , does it change the fact that during the period of 1914 to 1920 ,
the armenian government ordered , incited , assisted and participated
in the genocide of 2.5 million muslim people because of race , religion
and national origin \?

between 1914 and 1920 , 2.5 million turks perished of butchery at the
hands of armenians. the genocide involved not only the killing of
innocents but their forcible deportation from the russian armenia.
they were persecuted , banished , and slaughtered while much of ottoman
army was engaged in world war i. the genocide treaty defines genocide
as acting with a

'specific intent to destroy , in whole or in substantial part , a
national , ethnic , racial or religious group.'

history shows that the x soviet armenian government intended to eradicate
the muslim population. 2.5 million turks and kurds were exterminated by the
armenians. international diplomats in ottoman empire at the time including
u.s. ambassador bristol denounced the x soviet armenian government 's policy
as a massacre of the kurds , turks , and tartars. the blood thirsty leaders of
the x soviet armenian government at the time personally involved in the
extermination of the muslims. the turkish genocide museums in turkiye honor
those who died during the turkish massacres perpetrated by the armenians.

the eyewitness accounts and the historical documents established ,
beyond any doubt , that the massacres against the muslim people
during the war were planned and premeditated. the aim of the policy
was clearly the extermination of all turks in x soviet armenian
territories.

the muslims of van , bitlis , mus , erzurum and erzincan districts and
their wives and children have been taken to the mountains and killed.
the massacres in trabzon , tercan , yozgat and adana were organized and
perpetrated by the blood thirsty leaders of the x soviet armenian
government.

the principal organizers of the slaughter of innocent muslims were
dro , antranik , armen garo , hamarosp , daro pastirmadjian , keri ,
karakin , haig pajise liantz and silikian.

source bristol papers , general correspondence container 32 bristol
to bradley letter of september 14 , 1920.

i have it from absolute first hand information that the armenians in
the caucasus attacked tartar (turkish) villages that are utterly
defenseless and bombarded these villages with artillery and they murder
the inhabitants , pillage the village and often burn the village.

i think senator biden said it all what has to be said on this issue.
europe is a sad place to criticize human rights in anywhere in this

because they get rid of their minorities long long time

they were thinking the same yesterday.

infact on tuesday , the bosnian foreign minister asked formally the un to leave bosnia ,
just to show how much hypocracy is there in europe. these so called un is actually
helping serbs carry out their etnic clensing murders rapes. in zepa the un effectively
helped the serbs carry out their heinous crimes by spreading conflicting reports that
nothing was going on there. the cowards , or so called un peacemakers , only attempted to
go out there for a fact finding mission as if with all the ham radio operators were lying
and all the us war planes out there have no means of flying over there. this is the biggest
farce in the history of the world and the same act has been repeated over and over again in
different beseiged bosnian towns....

yes ! i heard today that the president of bosnia under pressure from the civilized nations
has appealed to the un to stay there in bosnia. he should know better..

these hypocrates (sadly ! it includes clinton administration too) all came out and said
that the call for a referendum from bosnian serbian perliment (or a bunch of
rapists criminals) is a farce and yet they have to wait for the result of this referendum
to act....

for those of you who are against us to commit ground troops , fine just lift the arms embargo on both
sides (since we know that serbs always got the heavy weapons form federal army).

wake up west ! ! and admit that you are the most uncivilized , the most hypocratic and the most violent

yea , i think not also. israel 's 1 issue is security so any outcomes
of negotiation certainly need to address isreal's perception of this
issue.

the problem is is defining (by outsiders , by israel , and by the arabs
themselves) what is the 1 issue to the arab side. is it palestinian
statehood , is it that israel as a state should not and must not be
allowed to exist , is it that the existence of a self governing non
muslim state in the islamic world is intolerable...what \? just as
the dividing line between israel fighting for security and israel fighting
to expand is often hard to discern by outsiders (especially to the arab
world) , so the rationale behind the arab struggle to undermine israel in
any way could either be based on visceral rejectionism or a sense of being
wronged that still values peace , who knows which.

anyway , in these talks , what gestures would you think would be seen
by israel as substantial \?

renders the armenian claims preposterous , even lunatic. no one in his or

could have plagued the azeris. one cannot even imagine the reverse case
to occur , for the armenians either would have slaughtered the azerbaijanis ,
or put them to forced exile to maintain their own majority. where was she \?


an appeal to mankind

during the last three years azerbaijan and its multinational
population are vainly fighting for justice within the limits of
the soviet union. all humanitarian , constitutional human rights
guaranteed by the un charter , universal declaration of human
rights , helsinki agreements , human problems international forums ,
documents signed by the soviet union all of them are violated.

the ussr 's president , government bodies do not defend azerbaijan
though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to
guarantee life and peace.

the 140 , 000 strong army of armenian terrorists with moscow 's
tacit consent wages an undeclared war of annihilation against
azerbaijan. as a result , a part of azerbaijan has been occupied
and annexed , hundreds of people killed , thousands wounded.

some 200 , 000 azerbaijanis have been brutally and inhumanly
deported from the armenian ssr , their historical homeland.
together with them 64 , 000 russians and 22 , 000 kurds have also
been driven out , a part of them now settled in azerbaijan.
some 40 , 000 turkish meskhetians , lezghins and representatives
of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central
asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations.

one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
armenian extremists' destruction of the karabakh scientific
experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection
of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr.

we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance ,
for the honour and dignity of 7 million azerbaijanis are
violated , its territory , culture and history are trampled ,
its people are shot. there is persistent negative image of
azerbaijanians abroad , and this defamation is spread over
the whole world by soviet mass media , armenian lobby in the
ussr and the united states.

one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent
events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on
azerbaijan.

it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the
issue of karabakh. hundreds and thousands armenians placidly
and calmly lived and worked in azerbaijan land , had their
representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan
ssr.

we are for a united , indivisible , sovereign azerbaijan , we
are for a common caucasian home proclaimed in 1918 by one
of the founding fathers of the azerbaijan democratic
republic muhammed emin rasulzade.

but all these goals and expectations are trampled upon the
soviet leadership in favour of the armenian expansionists
encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new '1 , 000
year reich' the 'great armenia' by annexing the
neighboring lands.

the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales ,
suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent.

but what about the lives of seven million human beings \?
if these people are muslims , does it mean that they are
less valuable \? can people be discriminated by their
colour of skin or religion , by their residence or other
attributes \?

all people are brothers , and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding. this is not the first appeal
of azerbaijan to the world public opinion. our previous
appeals were unheard. however , we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins.

painful search ..

the gruesome extent of february 's killings of azeris by armenians
in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about
600 men , women and children dead in the worst outrage of the
four year war over nagorny karabakh.

the figure is drawn from azeri investigators , hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the baku press. diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.

the 25 february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of
the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control
of nagorny karabakh , the subject of a new round of negotiations
in rome on monday. the bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and a massacre , but investigators say that most of the
dead were civilians. the awful number of people killed was first
suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku.
later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken
azerbaijan 's wild and contradictory allegations of up to 2 , 000
dead.

the state prosecuter , aydin rasulov , the cheif investigator of a
15 man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali
disaster , said his figure of 600 people dead was a minimum on
preliminary findings. a similar estimate was given by elman
memmedov , the mayor of hojali. an even higher one was printed in
the baku newspaper ordu in may 479 dead people named and more
than 200 bodies reported unidentified. this figure of nearly 700
dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova , the new spokeswoman
of the azeri ministry of defence.

francois zen ruffinen , head of delegation of the international
red cross in baku , said the muslim imam of the nearby city of
agdam had reported a figure of 580 bodies received at his mosque
from hojali , most of them civilians. we did not count the
bodies. but the figure seems reasonable. it is no fantasy , mr
zen ruffinen said. we have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead.

mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the
number of dead in the massacre. do n't get worked up. it will
take several months to get a final figure , the 43 year old
lawyer said at his small office.

mr rasulov knows about these things. it took him two years to
reach a firm conclusion that 131 people were killed and 714
wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist
uprising in baku in january 1990.

those nationalists , the popular front , finally came to power
three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly
what happened when hojali , an azeri town which lies about 70
miles from the border with armenia , fell to the armenians.

officially , 184 people have so far been certified as dead , being
the number of people that could be medically examined by the
republic 's forensic department. this is just a small percentage
of the dead , said rafiq youssifov , the republic 's chief forensic
scientist. they were the only bodies brought to us. remember the
chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within 24 hours.

of these 184 people , 51 were women , and 13 were children under 14
years old. gunshots killed 151 people , shrapnel killed 20 and
axes or blunt instruments killed 10. exposure in the highland
snows killed the last three. thirty three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation , including ears , noses , breasts or penises
cut off and eyes gouged out , according to professor youssifov 's
report. those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed , mr rasulov said.

files from mr rasulov 's investigative commission are still
disorganised lists of 44 azeri militiamen are dead here , six
policemen there , and in handwriting of a mosque attendant , the
names of 111 corpses brought to be washed in just one day. the
most heartbreaking account from 850 witnesses interviewed so far
comes from towfiq manafov , an azeri investigator who took a
helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on 27
february.

there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly 470 500 in hojali , 650 700 people by the stream
and the road and 85 100 visible around nakhchivanik village , mr
manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter
pilot.

people waved up to us for help. we saw three dead children and
one two year old alive by one dead woman. the live one was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up. we tried to land but
armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to
return.

there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in
circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few
months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali
at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by armenian forces.

heroes who fought on amid the bodies

aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe bar on the
caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in
his trousers , torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of
hojali just over three months ago , writes hugh pope.

i'm still wearing the same clothes , i do n't have any others ,
the 51 year old carpenter said , beginning his account of the
hojali disaster. i was wounded in five places , but i am lucky to
be alive.

mr sadikov and his wife were short of food , without electricity
for more than a month , and cut off from helicopter flights for 12
days. they sensed the armenian noose was tightening around the
2 , 000 to 3 , 000 people left in the straggling azeri town on the
edge of karabakh.

at about 11pm a bombardment started such as we had never heard
before , eight or nine kinds of weapons , artillery , heavy
machine guns , the lot , mr sadikov said.

soon neighbours were pouring down the street from the direction
of the attack. some huddled in shelters but others started
fleeing the town , down a hill , through a stream and through the
snow into a forest on the other side.

to escape , the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam
about 15 miles away. they thought they were going to make it ,
until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two
armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak.

none of my group was hurt up to then ... then we were spotted by
a car on the road , and the armenian outposts started opening
fire , mr sadikov said.

azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward
to force open a corridor for the civilians , but their efforts
were mostly in vain. mr sadikov said only 10 people from his
group of 80 made it through , including his wife and militiaman
son. seven of his immediate relations died , including his
67 year old elder brother.

i only had time to reach down and cover his face with his hat ,
he said , pulling his own big flat turkish cap over his eyes. we
have never got any of the bodies back.

the first groups were lucky to have the benefit of covering fire.
one hero of the evacuation , alif hajief , was shot dead as he
struggled to change a magazine while covering the third group 's
crossing , mr sadikov said.

another hero , elman memmedov , the mayor of hojali , said he and
several others spent the whole day of 26 february in the bushy
hillside , surrounded by dead bodies as they tried to keep three
armenian armoured personnel carriers at bay.

as the survivors staggered the last mile into agdam , there was
little comfort in a town from which most of the population was
soon to flee.

the night after we reached the town there was a big armenian
rocket attack. some people just kept going , mr sadikov said. i
had to get to the hospital for treatment. i was in a bad way.
they even found a bullet in my sock.

victims of war an azeri woman mourns her son , killed in the
hojali massacre in february (left). nurses struggle in primitive
conditions (centre) to save a wounded man in a makeshift
operating theatre set up in a train carriage. grief stricken
relatives in the town of agdam (right) weep over the coffin of
another of the massacre victims. calculating the final death toll
has been complicated because muslims bury their dead within 24
hours.

i guess that it was not acceptable because germany also chose
a path of aggression simultaneously that put the interests of
other countries in peril. i wonder whether us or other countries
would have risked themselves if only jews were persecuted and
hitler had no imperialist ambitions. (i am no student of history
and i am just asking questions.)

i do n't think they would have. after all the u.s. was one of the
countries that turned away jewish refugees when there was still time
to get them out. (considered and rejected at the cabinet level then..)

...
under what conditions should us interfere in foregin countries ,
is an abstraction one must clarify before resorting to acrimonious
accusations of religious bigotry and such.

as i understand it , international law provides the right of any
country to intervene to prevent genocide. i think once the world
court has ruled that genocide is being committed...

if a human rights czar is appointed at the u.n. , we could have
international monitors recording events and responses of local
officials and develop an objective basis. this could be backed by
adjudication at the international court of justice and enforcement
through a rapid deployment force under the u.n. secretary general 's
command. i would like to see the u.n. directly impose icj rulings
whenever feasible (without the possibility of vetos at the un security
council.. much as the president ca n't veto a u.s. supreme court
ruling).

the u.s. is now supporting the effort to appoint the hr czar the
third world opposition is led by three countries , china , iran and
pakistan (what company is pakistan keeping ! ).

the u.s. is also reconsidering its opposition to the u.n. force
initially envisaged in the charter (although under the control of the
security council). the un sc is quite a flawed body. rogue
governments like the prc have even threatened their veto in the last
few months to block the move to place u.n. troops in bosnia under
chapter 7 instead of 11 (if i have the numbers straight) where they
could have moved from being a monitoring to an enforcement force
without requiring further sc action. (the prc even continues to
threaten using its veto on u.n. action despite the icj ruling. the
current set up requires the sc to enforce icj rulings..).

peace ,

which was my point. by converting to another religion i do not loose
my cultural identity , i just loose my religious identification.
i consider that defining the belonging to a nation that claims the
right to have a state based on religious belief is a form of racism.


to be a part or not of the jeish nation is defined by my culture and not
by my religion. actually , if i am an atheist , which is in fact like
converting into a non jewish in terms of religion , i am still considered as
part of the jewish nation.
i can be proud of my jewish culture while not giving any importance to the
jewish religion. or , even more , i can be proud of my jewish culture while
still be convinced that the real god is another one.
i do not know anyone who lost his memebership to the american nation
because he changed of god.

alberto , you 've repeatedly misunderstood my postings. you are now making the exact point
that i 've made several times but with a different definition of religion. you do n't not
have to believe in the religious aspects of judaism to be a jew (this would confine
judaism to be just a religion in the sense of a christianity.). so , by converting out of
judaism , i do n't mean just not believing in the god of judaism. i mean voluntarily
removing yourself from the jewish nation. i am an agnostic but still consider myself
jewish because of my cultural heritage. (i admit that many religious jews would argue
that i am not completely jewish because of my lack of faith , but judaism is a religion of
dissent and debate is n't it \? ). the fact that one can opt to become jewish simply by
converting to judaism makes the nation of the jewish people the least racist and most
open nation. we have no quotas !

so i will once again make my point. defining a member of the jewish nation by religion
(not , as you say , religious belief) is not racism. you come to your incorrect conclusion
because you use a different definition for religion when you define the law of return and
when you define judaism.

it is never wise to confuse freedom of speech with freedom
of racism and violent deragatory.

it is unfortunate that many fail to understand this crucial
distinction.

in fact , if a speach was not offensive to some , its
protection under freedom of speach laws would be useless. it is
speach that some find questionable that must be protected , be
it religiously blasphemous or inherently racist. it is only
through civilized discourse and not scare tactics that one can
enlighten those that one perceives to be ignorant. that is the
idea behind freedom of expression.
what you find offensive might be perceived as truth by
some and what they might find offensive might be your belief.
it is only through free exchange of ideas (and insults as the
case seems to be with this channel) that one can change
another 's erring ways.that is why jefferson said that here
we are not afraid to tolerate error so long as reason is left to
combat it .

does this mean that you are volunteering to wade through the

tired of being dragged into content free pissing contests
with reflexive bigots. we intensely dislike being stuck between
letting this crap pass without comment as though it were
unremarkable and replying to it and getting sucked in again.

let 's keep some perspective here.

imho , the josh 's policy of forwarding the garbage in question ,
without comment , to the relevant sysadmin strikes a good
balance. the stuff was , after all , published on a public
forum from that very site , yet. hardly a matter of

here is a press release from the white house.

to national desk
contact white house press office , 202 456 2100

washington , may 14 following is a letter
president clinton wrote to congress on iranian assets

to the congress of the united states

i hereby report to the congress on developments since the
last presidential report on november 10 , 1992 , concerning the
national emergency with respect to iran that was declared in
executive order no. 12170 of november 14 , 1979 , and matters
relating to executive order no. 12613 of october 29 , 1987.
this report is submitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the
international emergency economic powers act , 50 u.s.c. 1703(c) ,
and section 505(c) of the international security and development
cooperation act of 1985 , 22 u.s.c. 2349aa 9(c). this report
covers events through march 31 , 1993. the last report , dated
november 10 , 1992 , covered events through october 15 , 1992.

1. there have been no amendments to the iranian
transactions regulations ( itrs ) , 31 cfr part 560 , or to the
iranian assets control regulations ( iacrs ) , 31 cfr part 535 ,
since the last report.

2. the office of foreign assets control ( fac ) of the
department of the treasury continues to process applications
for import licenses under the itrs. however , as previously
reported , recent amendments to the itrs have resulted in a
substantial decrease in the number of applications received
relating to the importation of nonfungible iranian origin goods.

during the reporting period , the customs service has
continued to effect numerous seizures of iranian origin
merchandise , primarily carpets , for violation of the import
prohibitions of the itrs. fac and customs service investi
gations of these violations have resulted in forfeiture actions
and the imposition of civil monetary penalties. additional
forfeiture and civil penalty actions are under review.

3. the iran united states claims tribunal (the
tribunal ) , established at the hague pursuant to the algiers
accords , continues to make progress in arbitrating the claims
before it. since the last report , the tribunal has rendered
12 awards , for a total of 545 awards. of that total , 367 have
been awards in favor of american claimants 222 of these were
awards on agreed terms , authorizing and approving payment of
settlements negotiated by the parties , and 145 were decisions
adjudicated on the merits. the tribunal has issued 36 decisions
dismissing claims on the merits and 83 decisions dismissing
claims for jurisdictional reasons. of the 59 remaining awards ,
3 approved the withdrawal of cases , and 56 were in favor of
iranian claimants. as of march 31 , 1993 , awards to successful
american claimants from the security account held by the
nv settlement bank stood at 2 , 340 , 072 , 357.77.

as of march 31 , 1993 , the security account has fallen
below the required balance of 500 million 36 times. iran has
periodically replenished the account , as required by the algiers
accords , by transferring funds from the separate account held by
the nv settlement bank in which interest on the security account
is deposited. iran has also replenished the account with the
proceeds from the sale of iranian origin oil imported into the
united states , pursuant to transactions licensed on a case by
case basis by fac. iran has not , however , replenished the
account since the last oil sale deposit on october 8 , 1992.
the aggregate amount that has been transferred from the interest
account to the security account is 874 , 472 , 986.47. as of
march 31 , 1993 , the total amount in the security account was
216 , 244 , 986.03 , and the total amount in the interest account
was 8 , 638 , 133.15.

4. the tribunal continues to make progress in the
arbitration of claims of u.s. nationals for 250 , 000.00 or more.
since the last report , nine large claims have been decided.
more than 85 percent of the nonbank claims have now been
disposed of through adjudication , settlement , or voluntary
withdrawal , leaving 76 such claims on the docket. the larger
claims , the resolution of which has been slowed by their
complexity , are finally being resolved , sometimes with sizable
awards to the u.s. claimants. for example , two claimants were
awarded more than 130 million each by the tribunal in october
1992.

5. as anticipated by the may 13 , 1990 , agreement settling
the claims of u.s. nationals for less than 250 , 000.00 , the
foreign claims settlement commission ( fcsc ) has continued its
review of 3 , 112 claims. the fcsc has issued decisions in
1 , 201 claims , for total awards of more than 22 million. the
fcsc expects to complete its adjudication of the remaining
claims in early 1994.

6. in coordination with concerned government agencies ,
the department of state continues to present united states
government claims against iran , as well as responses by the
united states government to claims brought against it by iran.
in november 1992 , the united states filed 25 volumes of
supporting information in case b 1 (claims 2 3) , iran 's claim
against the united states for damages relating to its foreign
military sales program. in february of this year , the united
states participated in a daylong prehearing conference in
several other cases involving military equipment. iran also
filed a new interpretative dispute alleging that the failure
of u.s. courts to enforce an award against a u.s. corporation
violated the algiers accords.

7. as reported in november , jose maria ruda , president of
the tribunal , tendered his resignation on october 2 , 1992. no
successor has yet been named. judge ruda 's resignation will
take effect as soon as a successor becomes available to take up
his duties.

8. the situation reviewed above continues to involve
important diplomatic , financial , and legal interests of the
united states and its nationals. iran 's policy behavior
presents challenges to the national security and foreign
policy of the united states. the iacrs issued pursuant to
executive order no. 12170 continue to play an important role
in structuring our relationship with iran and in enabling
the united states to implement properly the algiers accords.
similarly , the itrs issued pursuant to executive order no. 12613
continue to advance important objectives in combatting inter
national terrorism. i shall exercise the powers at my disposal
to deal with these problems and will report periodically to the
congress on significant developments.

corpses litter hills in karabakh

anatol lieven comes under fire while flying with azerbaijani forces
to investigate the mass killings of refugees by armenian troops...

as we swooped low over the snow covered hills of nagorno karabagh we saw
the scattered corpses. apparently , the refugees had been shot down as
they ran. an azerbaijani film of the places we flew over , shown to
journalists afterwards , showed dozens of corpses lying in various parts
of the hills.

the azerbaijanis claim that as many as 1000 have died in a mass killing
of azerbaijanis fleeing from the town of khodjaly , seized by armenians
last week. a further 4 , 000 are believed to be wounded , frozen to death
or missing...

seven of us squatted in the cabin of an azerbaijani m24 attack helicopter
as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. suddenly there
was a thump against the underside of the aircraft , a red flash of tracer
ripped past the starboard wing , and the helicopter rocked sharply. we
swung round , and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon
under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.

we had been fired on from an armenian anti aircraft post. we swung round
again , tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a
valley. the brown earth swooped around our heads , the helicopter swung
round again and followed the contours of the ground. our cannon fired
repeated blasts.

later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting
had landed successfully at nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed
enclave of nagorno karabakh , to pick up some of the dead. we had , in
fact , been attacked both by ground fire and by an armenian helicopter.
i had seen the armenian helicopter intermittently through the window ,
its cannons firing , but had thought mistakenly that it was on
our side . our group of western journalists had embarked on a
search and rescue flight that had become a combat mission.

our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two
m24 soviet attack helicopters in the azerbaijani service , nicknamed
flying crocodiles for their armour. our party was in the second
crocodile. the civilian helicopter 's job was to land in the mountains
and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. the attack helicopters
were there to give covering fire if necessary.

the operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet
armed forces because our pilot was a russian officer. an azerbaijani
official told us that there were now five former soviet military
helicopters and their pilots fighting for azerbaijan. they have
signed contracts to fly for us , he said. the helicopter we engaged
in combat was most probably flown by a brother officer of our russian
pilot , but fighting for the armenians.

we had taken off just before 5pm on saturday from agdam airfield , an
heated for the armenian controlled mountains of karabakh , a sheer
white wall in the distance. the civilian helicopter picked up four
corpses , and it was during this and a previous mission that an
azerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies
on the hillsides. we then took off again in a hurry and speed back
towards azerbaijani lines. azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before
the plain and safety gazed up at us as we passed.

back at the airfield in agdam , we took a look the bodies the
civilian helicopter had picked up. two old men a small girl were
covered with blood , their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor
mortis. they had been shot.

what did our russian pilot think of the tragedy , our close shave ,
and the war in nagorno karabakh \? he gave us cheerful grin , politely
declined to answer ques tions , and marched off to his dinner.

. . . they beat up the husband , dragged the wife outside ,
and stood her naked next to our burning things her
husband was lying at her feet on the ground. the crowd
shouted , look at the naked armenian ! they were going to
throw the poor woman into the fire...mamma would n't allow
it but i went to the window and saw her standing there ,
and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire
and stuck them into her body.

zinaida on march 20 we arrived in yerevan , and the next day they registered
us at the train station and took us to the boarding house. the conditions were
wonderful , thanks to our armenians , who received us. but it 's not relaxing all
the same. i do n't know how everyone else feels about it , but for me it 's
torture. we do n't have a place to call our own. i had a two bedroom apartment
in sumgait , my children went to school and we lived well , in friendship. it 's
painful that in our times , in 1988 , in the soviet period , people can break
into our apartment and try to kill me and my children , in whom i 've put all my
efforts and my whole youth. everything was going well for us my older
daughter was studying at the institute , the middle one was preparing to enter
medical school and was interning as an orderly , and my youngest had been sick
for a long time , but had returned to health. i have been though a lot in my
life it 's been seven years since i lost my husband , i raised my children by
myself. lots of women have similar fates , but there 's nothing to be done about
it. but i ca n't control myself when i remember what happened in sumgait on
february 27 , 28 , and 29 , it was just a horror , it 's indescribable.

on february 27 our relative , ira , came to visit us. she 's better friends with
my oldest daughter , and so right away she asked , where 's vika \? i say ,
vika 's off in pirkuli on a trip for three days , she 's supposed to come back
tomorrow. my middle daughter , gaya , had baked a cake and we sat there talking
and laughing , drinking tea. then gaya and diana went to walk ira home.

they left and a few minutes went by suddenly i hear noise. i raced out to
the balcony our balcony is right across from the bus station , we live at the
corner of mir and druzhba streets i look and see that there are hoards of
people near the bus station and they 're all shouting something. what they 're
shouting i ca n't understand. our neighbor is standing on his balcony , too. i
ask , nufar , what 's happened \? he says , i do n't know , i ca n't figure it out
either. i got scared the kids had gone outside , and i wanted to run after
them , but then there was a knock at the door. i open the door and it 's the
kids. mamma , says gayane , you 'll never believe what 's going on out there !
it 's awful ! ira says , aunt zina , they 're shouting , 'karabagh ! karabagh !
karabagh is ours ! ' we did n't know what was going on. they 're threatening to
drive out the armenians and slaughter them.

i called my brother , and his wife answered the phone. i said , aunt tamara ,
do n't worry , ira is staying here with us , and we 'll see her home later. i
could n't shut my eyes all night long , even until morning. i was worried about
vika. my god , what was going on , what had happened \? !

gayane that day , on the 27th , we stood on the balcony and observed what was
happening , although mamma would n't allow us to watch all of it. there were n't
50 yards between our building and the bus station. we could see and hear
everything perfectly. they were stopping buses , dragging people out , leading
all the passengers out , looking for armenians. if they found an armenian on
the bus , then it started . . .i do n't know what to call it . . .

zinaida it 's called slaughter.

gayane the mob would descend on people and beat them. i do n't know if they
were killing them or not , but when they left them , they lay still , not moving ,
as though nothing was left of them. one person was lying there and they
started dragging him. the police were standing right there , to the side , not
doing anything , they did n't take any steps to calm that mob.

it was awful to stand there and watch it all from the balcony. and you
could n't go anywhere , somehow . . . you wanted to be able to see everything
so as to tell of it later. we wanted to leave sumgait that day. what kept us
was the idea that we live in the soviet union , and that something would be
done about it. where in the world was our government \? !

zinaida we could n't leave town , of course , because our older daughter was n't
home. and at the same time i was terrified for gaya and diana. on sunday
morning when i went to see ira home , our neighbor said , zin' , you know they
went into valodya 's house and smashed everything he had. they murdered his
father and two sons. valodya is our neighbor , he 's an armenian , he lives on
the first floor. i think , my god , what is happening \? ! and in broad daylight !

i saw ira home and when on the way back i came across a mob shouting slay the
armenians ! karabagh is ours ! this was at 12 o'clock in the afternoon. on the
way i stopped into a bread store and the saleswoman says , they beat our store
manager , they thought he was an armenian and they beat him , but he was an
azerbaijani. and i asked , did they kill him \? she says , no , he 's in serious
condition. i left there and started to walk home on that same street , but the
mob started moving in my direction. i turned off the street and went down the
little way that goes toward the sputnik store. there i met another crowd , but
these were n't bandits , these were our people from sumgait. i was so frightened
that i walked without knowing where was going , i could n't feel my legs or the
ground under my feet. i was walking and there was a boy standing before my
eyes. this was on the 27th , around evening time. he ran under our balcony , and
the mob surged toward him shouting , he 's an armenian , get him ! he wore a
black coat. they grabbed him , that boy , near the bus stop , i saw it. they
grabbed him by the legs and struck his head on the asphalt.

i made it home but i just could n't calm down. my oldest daughter was in my
thoughts. i was thinking , my daughter 's coming home now , they 'll stop her bus
and she 'll be gone. there 's no police , no protection , nothing. it 's like they
had all died , there 's no one , nothing , no authorities whatsoever. i ca n't even
find the words for it ! i look and see an ikarus arriving. before going to the
bus station they stop near our place , across from the kosmos movie theater. so
this ikarus stops there and the gang is yelling , the azerbaijanis are running
toward it yelling , armenians out ! and i see them take the armenians and beat
them , killing them. i ca n't watch it any more. it was a nightmare. i just
could n't watch it. but gaya was standing there watching it , and i scolded her.
she says , mamma , i have to see it , i have to know what 's happening , i have to
see it with my own eyes so i can tell our people of it later. so our children
will know.

gayane we saw a great deal on the 27th. they caught no less than 20 people
before my eyes. i ca n't say for sure if they killed them or not . . .

zinaida there were too many people there , the mob was too big. you could n't
make anything out. but i saw that boy in the black coat with my own eyes. he
was 18 or 19 years old.

gayane i think he was older , probably , about 22. a tall fellow , a big guy ,
in a coat. he was walking quickly , but when they shouted that he was an
armenian , he tore off running. and the mob went after him. they caught him
right under our balcony. i do n't know. i do n't think there could have been
much left of him after that. you can imagine what happens when a crowd attacks
one person. it was a mob , big , angry , and featureless. you know , there was a
similarity in the way they were dressed , mostly they were wearing long black
coats. you could n't even tell them apart , they were all wearing black and they
all looked alike.

zinaida when they picked up that boy and struck him against the asphalt and
he cried mamma ! i ran into the room. i could n't watch any longer. an awful
lot was going on right then , in various places , it was n't only that boy ,
several people were being beaten up. you could n't see all of it at once , but
when that boy cried mamma ! i immediately started watching only him.

gayane on that first day it went on from about six in the morning until
twelve at night. at midnight they dispersed and the police took their place.
they were scattered about in all districts. but how can you explain the fact
that by morning , when it had already started getting light , around seven
o'clock , our police were gone \? the police disappeared and yielded their
positions to the bandits. in the morning they started gathering at our inter
section again , at the bus station and at the entrance to downtown. from
morning on all the roads and mass transit stops were covered , and by nine
o'clock you could n't even see the ground. there were thousands of people in
the crowd. again they began stopping vehicles and checking for armenians.

zinaida they had signals. i realized that when i noticed that they made a
cross with their arms , they crossed their arms over their heads. the cross ,
evidently , meant that the vehicle had armenians in it. they let the
azerbaijani cars through , and they stopped the armenian ones and started
their pogrom.

gayane they stopped a white zhiguli and asked the driver what his
nationality was. he got out and said they were from baku. but what is your
nationality \? he says armenian. they immediately start shouting , ermeni ,
ermeni ! and he says , what 's going on \? i'm coming from baku. i do n't live
in sumgait. does n't matter , who cares if you 're from baku or sumgait.
anyway the crowd pounced on him and started beating him , and they dragged a
woman his wife , probably out of the car. at this point the police came and
took the two and led them away. then the mob started smashing the car , and
then burned it. the flames blazed . . . it was a horrible fire ! then everyone
ran away , they thought the car was going to explode. about 20 minutes later
another car comes along , a green moskvich. they ran up shouting ermeni !
ermeni ! but this time they did n't pull the people out of the car , they did n't
beat them. maybe they burned them along with the car , because no one emerged
from the flames. the neighbor boy vakhit was standing on the balcony too ,
acquaintances of his walked by below , and he asked them and they said , yes ,
they burned them along with the car. about two hours later a whole wedding
procession came by , and there was a doll on the first car. we thought they
were armenians , but the cars started to honk loudly. they were azerbaijanis ,
and they were immediately allowed through.

zinaida the driver waved his hand as if to say 'get out of the way.' the
whole crowd parted and the procession passed through freely.

gayane by the way , at the marriage hall , which is right in the courtyard
of our building , there was a wedding that day. the azerbaijanis were cele
brating and dancing. on the streets there was grief and death , people were
being killed , and people were celebrating the whole time.

zinaida before the apartment itself was attacked i asked gaya to call and
find out when the tourist bus was supposed to arrive. she went to her
girlfriend 's in the building , she lives in the first entryway , on the third
floor. gaya came back and said , mamma , the bus is supposed to come around
eight , after eight. you can imagine what i was feeling , how hard it was
vika knew nothing about what was happening and was coming to meet her death.
then i heard shouting. i raced to the window and see that the belongings of
our neighbors from the second entryway are being thrown outdoors. they were
thrashing about with the pillows and the feathers were lying like snow. i
started to cry. i am walking around the room , crying , wailing vika 's not
here , what will come of her . . . gaya , of course , was consoling me mamma ,
nothing will happen to her , do n't worry , calm down , she 's in good company ,
they 'll look out for her.

diana i saw the green car burn. the car was burning when we went out onto the
balcony. gaya pushed me away , telling me to get off the balcony. i left. then
they came up to the balcony and asked if there were any armenians here.

zinaida you 're right , i forgot about that , that was on the 27th.

diana there 's a small , grassy area in front of our balcony there are trees
planted there. the mob asked if there were any armenians in the building.
all the neighbors said , no , there are no armenians here. there were n't a lot
of armenians in our building , but there were n't just a few armenian families ,
either.

gayane they fell upon the apartments on the 28th. there were terribly many
of them. our courtyard is huge , and it was completely filled with them.

zinaida katusev had made an appearance on television earlier. he said that
two people , azerbaijanis , had been killed in karabagh. and when he said that
. . . you know how bees sound , have you heard how they buzz \? it was like the
buzzing of millions of bees . . . and with this buzzing they flew into our
courtyard , howling and shouting. i do n't know how to describe it. by this
point we were afraid to watch from the balcony , but when i looked out of the
bedroom window the znaniye bookstore is down there , and armenians live on the
second and fourth floors i saw their things being thrown out the windows. i
realized that they would be upon us any minute. i shouted to gayane , gaya ,
hide the gold. that 's honestly what i told my child. i grabbed diana. i
did n't know what to do ! vika still was n't home , and it was already getting
dark. i was afraid to look at the time because i was already horrified as it
was.

gayane just in case , we changed the television channel from the moscow
station to the azerbaijani one.

zinaida and turned it up loud.

gayane we never listened to azerbaijani music. it just did n't do much for
us. in all those years we almost never listened to it. but sometimes we would
watch some entertainment show or film on azerbaijani television. and that was
it. and here we had it turned up full blast. so they would think we were
azerbaijanis.

zinaida well you can imagine , they 're slaughtering armenians , robbing them ,
and we 're listening to this concert music from baku. our azerbaijani neighbors
suggested we do it , they knocked on the door and told gaya to turn on
azerbaijani music. but we already had it on anyway. turn on the lights , they
told us , so they will think you 're not armenians. they 're saying the armenians
are afraid to turn on their lights , they 're hiding.

gayane apparently there was some kind of arrangement , because we noticed
that the lights were off only in armenian apartments , that is , the
azerbaijanis were warned , and every last one of them had their lights on.
when we turned the lights off two of our neighbors came immediately , and
later , another one. turn on the lights , they told us , please. nothing will
happen. be calm. nothing will happen.

zinaida we wo n't allow them to come into your apartment.

gayane we believed those people. we had never done anything bad to them.

zinaida after the whole nightmare , about march 15 , before we left for
armenia , when i was coming into the building they were all crying. the
azerbaijanis were crying , saying , can it be there is no god \? how could
they raise their hands against your family \? you never did anyone any harm ,
you never refused anyone anything , not in hard times , or in time of fortune ,
or in time of mourning. how could they give you away \? how could they sell you
down the river \? they really had given us away. some of them protected us , but
others gave us away. they sold us down the river.

gayane i was wearing slacks that day , and when it all began i became
cautious for some reason and i changed my clothes. azerbaijani women do n't
wear pants. young armenian and russian girls in sumgait wore pants , but the
azerbaijanis found that very strange. and i thought i better put on a skirt ,
otherwise they wo n't believe me if i told them we were azerbaijanis. there was
nothing else we could do. no other way out. i was forced to turn myself into
god knows who. i let my hair down , tousled it , and threw a scarf over my head.

zinaida and she told me , mamma , you hide. take diana and go into the other
room. you two look more like armenians. they 'll figure out that we 're
armenians right away. but how could i go away and leave her there \? !

gayane i went out onto the balcony. it worked out better that way. we were
the only armenian family in the fourth entryway. this gave us hope we were
the only ones , the neighbors would n't let them in. they , the azerbaijanis ,
would fear for themselves and for their children. i looked and saw someone
crawling up on the balcony from below , it was easy to get up onto our balcony.
when we would lose the keys the neighbors would let up into their places and
we would crawl across onto our balcony and get in that way. so i turned around
and saw a guy with a knife on our balcony. he looks at me and shouts , what
nationality are you here \?

zinaida at the same time they were knocking on the door.

gayane what nationality are you \? he 's shouting. well at first i was
frightened , but then i got control of myself and answered in perfect
azerbaijani , you should be ashamed of yourself , asking a question like that.
ca n't you see i'm an azerbaijani \? if i were an armenian would i come out to
meet you face to face and look you in the eyes \? he looks at me and tells the
people with him , yes , azerbaijanis live here. from below they tell him ,
check it out , it ca n't be , they have to be armenians. and he asks me again ,
what nationality are you \? i say , ca n't you see \? i started fuming. i could
not say anything else. you 're blind , that 's for sure ! you can yell all you
want , but that wo n't make us armenians. i hear them breaking down our
door , and mamma went toward the door. i say , i do n't have time to deal
with you , they 're breaking down our door. 1 go to the door and ask , who is
it \? they answer , open up ! i say , wait , why are you breaking the door \?
what 's going on \? i'm opening up. we never locked the lower lock , it was
broken , but now they had locked it out of fear , and i could n't get it open. i
say wait , i'm looking for the key. i opened the door it was almost broken
down already. i opened the door and they burst in. i say , what 's going on \?
why are you breaking down our door \?

zinaida then they started climbing in from the balcony. they 're shouting ,
why do n't you open the door \? and i say , well you 've already come in the
balcony. then diana sees their knives , runs into the bathroom , and closes the
door. gaya cries out , mamma , diana ran into the bathroom ! i ran to the door
and forgot that we were pretending to be azerbaijanis , and said in armenian
diana , open the door ! gaya tried to calm them down , and i'm shouting with
tears in my eyes for diana to open the door.

diana i was sitting on the couch with my doll , little red riding hood. that
guy climbed in from the balcony with a big knife with a yellow handle. they
put it up to mamma 's stomach. i ran to the bathroom , opened the door , and
slammed it behind me. i was frightened , and started to cry. i shouted , mamma ,
they want to kill you ! and then . . . then they started shouting , give us
your passports. and gaya says , what do you need passports for , we 're
azerbaijanis.

gayane i tried to convince them that we were azerbaijanis , i was trying
everything i could , i could get on my knees and plead. i could humble myself ,
because at that moment i was worried about other lives than just my own. to be
honest i did n't care about anything else , as long as my little sister would
survive , her life and health had cost us so dearly ! i tell them , what , do n't
you understand anything \? they started shouting , they were tremendously
excited , shouting with terribly loud voices , saying that in stepanakert their
girls were being killed , raped , and tossed around with pitchforks. why
should n't they do the same to us \? i said , who 's doing all that \? who is doing
it \? some armenians ! what does that have to do with us \? give me the knife , i 'll
cut my own face. now you calm down , they tell me.

zinaida i told them , why did n't you deal with them there ! there , in
karabakh \? nothing has happened here , no one has been fighting here , not we
with the armenians , nor they with us. why did n't you give it right back to
them there \? what 've we got to do with this \? i got confused. i had been
saying that we were azerbaijanis , but suddenly i started speaking as though
i were an armenian , but they did n't notice. one of them was next to me ,
with a knife at my breast. and he says to the others , what pretty girls. he
meant gaya and my 10 year old diana. i was terrified. gaya started assuring
them that we were azerbaijanis. one guy stood in the doorway and gave us bad
looks.

gayane he demanded the passports. i said , young man , i do n't have my
passport here. he says , let 's have the passport , we wo n't believe you
without your passport. and one of them started hurriedly searching for
documents. they turned the wardrobe in the other room upside down , took the
picture off the wall , and started pulling the clothes off their hooks , yelling
and shouting , passport ! passport ! they all started yelling , there was so
much noise in the apartment. they were all shouting. my hair stood on end.
suddenly i said , listen , my papa died , 40 days have n't passed yet , we have a
muslim household , we 're in mourning , you should be ashamed of yourselves ,
you 've disgraced your honor. and then mamma started to cry.

zinaida i started crying my husband died , 40 days have n't yet passed ,
are n't you ashamed of yourselves ! in fact my husband had died seven years
earlier , in 1981. we 're in mourning , and you burst in here demanding docu
ments. the documents are at the housing office , i'm filing for my pension.
well it seemed like they believed us. then one guy said , they 're lezgins.
ca n't you see , there are no men here , only women. leave. another fellow in
the group agreed with him , he also said that we were lezgins. but a third
said , no , they 're armenians. well the other two convinced him , i don t know
how , and all the rest of them listened to them too. there were about 50 of
them , if not more , all in our three room apartment , even the entryway was
filled. they started leaving. yes , we 're lezgins , we 're lezgins. they started
leaving , and one of them took our tape recorder with him. and the one who had
first called us lezgins says , leave that , what are you doing \? they seemed to
obey that guy.

gayane he was tall , wearing baggy jeans and a coat.

zinaida with a little moustache , i think.

gayane no , he did n't have a moustache , he was tall with brown hair , he
was n't a bad looking sort. he did n't have anything in his hands.

zinaida he stood at the threshold.

gayane yes , he did n't look like a bad guy , and you know , his face seemed
familiar to me. i had seen him somewhere. and more than once. but i ca n't
remember where. when he came in i was stupefied , i had a premonition that he
would n't be able to remain indifferent. when he said that we were lezgins and
that they should leave , such gladness started to glow inside of me. hope. they
continued to argue on their way out. some said , they 're armenians all the
same. and that fellow answered , even if they are armenians , it 's shameful ,
the father died , they 're mourning , there 's nothing but women in the house ,
there 's no men. we should stay out of the apartment. what do you mean , stay
out \? we can go in there ! and he said , no , we should stay out , they 're
lezgins , we 're leaving here. the three of them protected us.

zinaida no , the two of them. the one in the short coat and the one in the
grey suit , who stood at the threshold , about 19 or 20 years old. well they
were all young really. the two of them defended us.

diana three , three !

zinaida do you remember the third one , diana \?

diana yes , he was wearing dark clothes.

gayane the third one was the one who came back. he wore a long brown coat.

diana he wore a long , darkish brown coat , and his hair was dark too. when
they left , they told him downstairs that those women were armenians , and ran
back and said that they were going to kill us.

zinaida they had all left , and we had started to calm down a little , and i
closed the door. and then there is a knock. i told gaya , take diana and go
into the other room. my daughters went into the dining room , and i opened the
door. there was a guy there who said , run , hide ! they 're coming to kill you
now ! we ran up to the third floor. we had some good neighbors up there ,
azerbaijanis. i sent the kids and stood there alone , not knowing what to do.
i was so far gone . . . out of a whole room i could n't even think of anything
to take. i even forgot to take my work documents at the time i had been
preparing a report to send to baku , and the documents were at home. i could n't
see anything . . . i could only see vika , my older daughter. i sent gaya and
diana upstairs , and stood there asking that fellow , should i close the door
and leave everything like this \? he says , what do you mean , door \? get out of
here , they 're coming to kill you ! what are you standing there for \? and i ran
after the children.

gayane we barely had time to get up to the third floor when they burst into
our apartment and started shouting , where are the armenians \? we were already
at the neighbors'. they had an infant at the time , and the neighbor said ,
do n't you worry , i'm not letting anyone in this apartment no matter what.

zinaida on the third floor there i started asking the folks , our neighbors ,
to go meet vika. the bus was due to arrive at eight o'clock. i dissolved in
tears , gaya was soothing me , diana was next to us , she was crying too , and i'm
already thinking that i 've lost my older daughter , but deep in my heart i
still believe she 's alive . . . and my tears choked me. i was going out of my
mind. but no one could leave the building , the courtyard was packed with
people , swarming with them. from the balcony the neighbor in whose apartment
we were hiding asked the bandits , where are those armenians , the ones who
were at home \? where did they make off to \? they told him they did n't know.
they asked him where he lived. he answered , ca n't you see , on the third
floor. he asked them specially to divert attention from his own apartment. we
heard them taking free reign of our apartment , and they threw our color
television off the balcony and it exploded.

gayane mamma was crying the whole time. she fell into a faint and we brought
her around and held her back , because the whole time she kept making for the
door to go outside , alternately raving and sobbing , shouting , and calling
vika. she did n't notice us , probably because we were next to her. her thoughts
were only on vika. the neighbors who were hiding us were calming her too ,
offering tea.

zinaida we are very grateful to them. thanks to them my children and i are
alive , well , and unharmed. when they were throwing our belongings out and
burning them the beds , the pillows , and the chairs our neighbor came to us
and said , how lucky you are that it 's not you standing there naked , but some
other woman instead. you 're from our part of the building you lost your
husband , you have children , thank god you 're not in her position , we would n't
have been able to take it. i do n't know what i would do. he of course
would n't have done anything , he was just trying to calm us down. in the yard
they were torturing our neighbors , fellow armenians they lived on the fifth
floor , in the third entryway. a married couple , vanya and nina , and their
three children. their last name is v. they hid their two daughters , and stayed
with their son to defend themselves , they even got boiling water ready , and an
axe , and held them off for a long time , but the . . . they beat up the
husband , dragged the wife outside , and stood her naked next to our burning
things her husband was lying at her feet on the ground. the crowd shouted ,
look at the naked armenian ! they were going to throw the poor woman into the
fire. the neighbors came out , an azerbaijani woman threw her a scarf , and she
covered herself with it , and the neighbors led her off to their apartment.
all the neighbors saw and heard it . . .

gayane mamma would n't allow it but i went to the window and saw her standing
there , and they took skewers that had been heated in the fire and stuck them
into her body. our neighbor , who lived in the same entryway as nina she
lives with us in the same boarding house now saw what they had done , nina
showed her , from her knees up , almost up to her neck , her whole body was
covered , riddled , with wounds.

zinaida in the morning , during the night of the 29th , rather , after one
o'clock , two buses approached the station. i wanted to run out. by then i
did n't care any more if i lived or died , but gayane would n't let me go , and
the neighbors said that i would bring disaster to them and they would be
slain along with their children. gaya was crying and said that i forgot about
them , my other children , but i could only think of vika. i imagined her torn
to pieces , i'm a mother , and they 're just children , they do n't understand i
would have jumped off the balcony and run to the soldiers for help. i was
going to do it but gayane would n't let me mamma , please ! mamma , i beg of
you ! the neighbors were sleeping and gayane woke them with her cries. so we
held on that way till morning.

on the morning of the 29th i told our neighbor i was going to go downstairs to
our apartment , maybe vika was lying there , murdered. he told me he would go
himself. he was gone for about five minutes , but it seemed like an eternity to
me. he returned and said there was no one there , nothing. i went down too ,
stole down like a mouse , and slipped in everything was thrown all about. i
did n't go to the soldiers because the armored personnel carriers were far
away , farther than the bus station. i began looking for the briefcase with my
work in it. i was miserable because of my daughter , and at the same time
because of my work. my documents were there , my travel papers i worked in the
transport division and my trip sheets.

gayane mamma is a very responsible person , she was always ready to work
around the clock to do her job.

zinaida i look around and i ca n't find the briefcase. i did n't care about
the fact that everything had been stolen out of all three of my rooms , that
everything was smashed , and the furniture was broken , i worried about that
later , but at first i was concerned about the lost documents. i went into the
kitchen. my daughter had hidden some valuables in the gas stove my ring and
my earrings. it was all there. five minutes passed and gayane ran in and said ,
mamma , hurry. and diana came downstairs too. gayane found her coat among
the debris , and diana found her track shoes , her coat , and some of her
dresses.

diana immediately after we got back up to the neighbors they started
throwing things around in the apartment under us. they threw a television onto
the asphalt , it exploded so violently it sounded like a thunderclap. then ,
when vika was n't there , i would n't eat , and they forced me , but i could n't
eat. because i loved vika terribly and she and i had always gone to the movies
and gone for walks in the park. when we went into our apartment the next day
and everything was broken , right away i started looking for my dolls and my
books , but i did n't see anything. when we went back upstairs i managed to take
two cups from my tea service , and gaya took vika 's suit and one of her own
dresses. my italian boots were gone , my brown coat , it was beautiful , there
was n't a one of my beautiful dolls , and my giant lion was gone too , the one
that had been on top of the television. he was very large and very handsome.
i had two satchels , one for first grade and the other for second grade , one
was yellow green with a boy and a girl on it , they 're playing a drum and a
violin , and there is a dog sitting there closing its ears , and on the other
one were the letters a , b , c , d , e and the numbers 4 5 , two girls and a boy
with their mouths open like they are singing. they were beautiful satchels.
they were gone too. i had many books , i collected them , they were in the
bedside tables. and a boy had given me a little apron and a headband for my
birthday , they were n't around either. and i had some big books , fat ones , and
they disappeared , only one was left , the malachite box. the adventures of
karlson , pippi longstockings , and fairy tales of the world were left. all the
other books were gone.

zinaida i continued searching for my briefcase , and then my supervisor
arrived. he had waited for me until nine o'clock , but i did n't appear , and he
thought something must have happened , so he came. he 's a russian , aleksei
semyonovich lomakin. alik aliyev , the mechanic , came with him. when they saw
my wrecked apartment they were just petrified , they could not say a thing.
when i saw them i started crying. my azerbaijani neighbors came in. some of
them were crying , others were helping me pick up. i go on looking for my
documents and at the same time put things into the wardrobe. now that i
remember it it 's both funny and painful how could i have thought that i had
returned to my apartment and that everything had gone back to normal \?
incidentally , later , when i went back to the apartment again those things were
gone too. and the door was gone. after my supervisor left , in the afternoon ,
the neighbor said that we should leave , find another refuge. i'm afraid , he
said , that someone saw you come to my apartment , and that they could kill you
and us too. my god , where could i go it was daytime and those . . . i do n't
even know what to call them , the bandits , those marauders , those jackals , i
do n't know what to call them , i ca n't find the words , they were everywhere.
where should i go with two girls \? when i opened the door i had tears in my
eyes , and i was terrified . . . and he said , go to alik 's , he 's an
azerbaijani , too. and i say , you should have said that earlier , when my
supervisor was here with the car , he could have taken us with him. everyone
feared for their own lives. what could i do \? i went out into the entryway and
stood. and he says , any other time i would keep you here a year , or two. but
right now , i'm sorry . . . then another door opened , also on the third
floor. i ask the neighbor , tayara , can we hide at your place \? she 's an
azerbaijani too. she says , what kind of question is that \? come in ! she hid
us. there were many people in the courtyard , and gaya and i hid in the
wardrobe , and they put diana under a mattress , leaving a small opening so the
child could breathe. tayara said that when the bandits left she would let us
out , and when they came back she would hide us again.

we sat in the wardrobe for about a half hour. gaya became ill , and i allowed
her to get out. my legs fell asleep and felt like cannons. we had n't eaten or
drunk anything for so long , since the 27th , when we saw that horror and all
of it just snapped in me. tayara 's husband went outside , even though i begged
him to stay , saying there should be a man in the house. he said that he 'd be
in the courtyard , and if anything happened his wife would signal him. she put
her passport and all of their documents on the table so if they suddenly came
in she could show them that they were an azerbaijani family. my girls went to
the window and what was going on out there ! i feared for my children , that
someone would recognize them from the street. gaya let her hair down and put
on a scarf so she would resemble an azerbaijani , but directly across there was
a 9 story building , their windows were right across from us , and i shouted
that someone would see her and give us away on the spot. but she kept on
looking.

diana i watched too.

zinaida downstairs the bandits were fighting with the soldiers. the soldiers
did n't shoot , they did n't have orders to. i saw them throwing rocks at
the soldiers , they were young boys , 18 and 19 year olds , and they defended
themselves . . . i'm a mother after all , and they were no different from my
children. when one of the soldiers fell and his head started bleeding i had to
stop looking , l could n't watch anymore . . . i imagined my children in their
shoes . . .

gayane the troops had assumed their defense that morning and had cordoned
off the buildings , and some of the soldiers surrounded the bus station , block
36 , and our microdistrict 3. but they only cordoned them off from the outside.
the mob fell upon the soldiers , who started to protect themselves , and the mob
surged into the courtyard with the soldiers after it. they caught several
azerbaijanis and started beating them with their clubs. one fell down and they
cracked open another 's head . . .

zinaida they show lebanon on television , and the war in afghanistan that 's just
what it was like. like in america , how they attack demonstrations with shields
and clubs that 's just how it was in our courtyard.

gayane do n't compare it with america , those were peaceful demonstrations ,
but these \? !

zinaida but how could it happen here and not off somewhere in america ! they
attacked the soldiers , hurled stones at them . . . then i thought , where 's the
tear gas that the americans use to disperse demonstrators \? if they had used
gas on those jackals they all would have scattered.

gayane they would not have scattered. the soldiers had been there since
morning , they did n't bring in fresh troops. they had n't eaten , they were fine
standing there for about three hours , but then they got tired. they were n't
even allowed to sit down . . . at noon they , the soldiers , attacked them , and
then the tables were turned. the mob went after the soldiers , the guys were
bunched into a group in the center street and covered themselves with their
shields , and the azerbaijanis surrounded them and threw paving stones at them.
and those guys sat there covering themselves with their shields. and meanwhile
tanks with machine guns were cruising the streets . . . they always say , our
children have never seen war. i never even dreamed about it , there was no
need to. but then i thought about those people who had lived through a war. it
was truly horrible . . . the guys were tired , exhausted , some had had their
clubs taken away , others , their shields , they had been beaten , they were
covered in blood . . . so many died ! they beat the soldiers with their own
clubs and shields. and those guys stood there and could n't defend themselves ,
they could n't open fire. they could n't even defend themselves , let alone us.
it 's comical . . .

zinaida what are you saying \? how can it be funny \?

gayane no , i did n't mean that how could something like that happen during
our soviet period \? it 's painfully embarrassing ! and they burned the armored
personnel carriers , too. someone shouted , get away , it 's going to blow !
everyone scattered away , and the armored personnel carrier exploded. the
soldiers lost their senses. and when they drove the personnel carrier and the
bus at the mob out of rage and fury , they drove right up on the sidewalk.

zinaida the bus that had brought the troops. only the driver was in it. the
bus ran over three people straight off , i saw it. and two armored personnel
carriers ran over four more. all in one or two minutes. the bus ran over
three , one of the carriers ran over two , and the second , two more. right on
our street there 's a dry cleaners and appliance and watch repair places one
of the armored personnel carriers went that way , and they say it ran over
several over there , too. but they ran over seven before our eyes. then the bus
ploughed into a book kiosk.

gayane no , that was a flower place. it was a new booth. he drove straight
into it.

zinaida the driver jumped out and they dragged the vehicle out to the
middle of the road and set it on fire.

gayane and i also saw the troops put a bunch of azerbaijanis in a bus and
take them in a convoy to baku. there were many arrests.

zinaida our neighbor , the one who hid us , could n't take it , and he told his
wife that we should leave. they were running around in the courtyard looking
for the armenians. they knew that they were hiding with azerbaijanis , and they
were saying that they were going to check the azerbaijani families. poor
tayara got scared too , and started to cry i pleaded with her , i said that i
would remember forever how she saved my children and me , but where could we
go \?

gayane she did n't make us leave , she said that she would do anything , but
she was afraid.

zinaida i told tayara that we would just stay a little longer and that at
night we would return to our apartment. then her husband came back and said
that a curfew had been imposed. he says , zina , you owe us a drink. gorbachev
announced a curfew. and bagirov first secretary of the communist party of
azerbaijan ssr was on television , he said that two people had been killed in
karabagh , but nothing was wrong , automobile windows had been broken , but there
had n't been any killings. he kept making statements , and there were
azerbaijani songs and dances. tayara turned the tv all the way up. when we
learned of the curfew we calmed down , but then a crowd ran into the courtyard
again , a large one. our neighbor told them that there had been only one
armenian family here , but they had already killed them all , there was no one
left. we hid in the wardrobe again. and they stuck diana back under the bed.

gayane tayara went down to our apartment to see what was happened there , and
found two bandits. they asked her , what are you doing here tayara answered ,
i came to take something for myself. take all you want , they 're gone now.

zinaida yes , she had wanted to get something for us , at least some bedding.
she said , what are you going to do , empty handed , naked , with three children ,
nothing remains of your entire apartment. in short , we calmed down , and the
crowd raced off to the other building , the one across from us. i do n't know
what went on there.

gayane the curfew had its effect on the gangs , many started to disperse
they were warned that they would open fire on them. the soldiers did n't know
the city , they could n't get oriented , they drove up and down the main streets ,
but did n't go into the courtyards. when we were at the city party committee
they asked people from sumgait to go with them and show them the way.

zinaida the tanks entered the city on the night of the 29th.

gayane no , mamma , the tanks had been there earlier , but were near the city
party committee , where the armenians were . . . after midnight , on march 1 ,
when i had finally gotten to sleep after two sleepless nights , mamma said ,
get your things together , they have sent buses for us. as it was we had been
dressed the entire time. mamma went to check it out . . .and came back for us.

zinaida when i came back for the children tayara said that vika was alive
and well , some guys had come and told her that they had hidden her in a safe
place. i both believed it and did n't believe it. we ran out to the tanks. the
gambarians were there , roman and sasha their father , shurik , the clarinetist ,
was killed , and their mother was there. sasha came over and asked about the
girls. i was surprised , how did he know my girls \? he said that he knew me and
the girls. our neighbor himself went for gaya and diana and it seemed like he
was taking forever so i went after him. another neighbor came out , anna
vasilyevna , a russian zinochka , my dear , goodbye and good luck. she kissed
diana. they put us in the bus and the captain gave the order for us to be
taken to the city party committee. the bus would n't start , so they put us on
another one. it was pouring rain.

diana when they imposed the curfew there were many soldiers on the streets ,
and they all had clubs and shields. and when the azerbaijanis attacked them ,
many of the soldiers died. they threw paving stones huge rocks at the
soldiers. i saw this myself. the soldiers ran over those azerbaijanis with the
tanks. the soldiers saw that the azerbaijanis were doing violence to people
and they ran over them out of rage. we got scared and they hid me under a
mattress and a blanket , and gaya and mamma crawled into the wardrobe. and they
were fighting right down there on the street . . . near the building they were
blowing up buses and tanks , and cars were burning , and there were many dead in
the courtyard. they drove without looking to see if it was a sidewalk or a
street , they just drove , and the ones who did n't manage to get out of the way
were run over by the tanks. and when we left it was evening , it was already
dark there were three buses , and one of them had soldiers in it. mamma ran up
and said , get your clothes on , let 's go. gaya was wearing slippers , and i
had on my blue dress , but it was an old one. i was wearing my old jacket , my
old dress , and slippers. and nothing else. gaya had on a skirt , her angora
sweater , and slippers. it was raining hard , and there were puddles on the
street. they gave mamma an old coat because she was wearing a short sleeved
dress she put it on and we ran out. we got onto the bus and i was hungry , one
of the soldiers from yerevan gave me rations and carried me from one bus to
the other in his arms. i gave him the little glass that remained from vika 's
trousseau , and he gave me his telephone number.

gayane in the bus there was a soldier with a shield sitting at every window.
we had to be ready for anything. they took us to the city party committee , let
us out , and then took us into the city party committee building under armed
guard. it was jammed with people and you could n't breathe. we asked , are
these all us \? armenians \? they answered yes. we were surprised that there were
so many armenians in sumgait. all those years we lived there and did n't know
there were so many armenians , 18 , 000. we were struck by that , we had never
noticed. going downstairs the next day i ran into the secretary of the
komsomol from vika 's plant , the khimprom. he said that vika was alive and
well. when i told mamma she of course calmed down some more. but you know ,
after all that it was hard to believe anything , our faith in everything was
just gone. she did n't believe it completely.

zinaida i did n't believe it because i had heard all kinds of things. when
we arrived at the city party committee we heard everything imaginable ! it
was the fear of god. i saw many of our acquaintances , they were kissing each
other and asking how their children and homes were. many people already knew
that there had been a pogrom of our apartment. they had seen the broken
windows. i cried , saying that i did n't know where vika was. one woman said
that they had taken two of her daughters and that she could n't find one of
them the other had been slashed all over. a second said that her husband and
her son had been murdered. that was nelli aramian. she lived in building 6 in
our microdistrict. they killed her husband , armo , and her son artur. i heard
so many things like that that i was already starting to lose touch my
patience had run dry waiting for my daughter. later an azerbaijani fellow came
to me and said , aunt zina , vika sent me , she 's alive and well and hidden in a
safe place if you want i 'll call her there and you can speak with her. we
went downstairs to the first floor and he called vika. i spoke with her , heard
the voice of my child. she had managed to survive in that hell. then i started
begging that azerbaijani to bring her to the city party committee. he tried to
talk me out of it i 'll bring her wherever you go , do n't worry , i 've looked
after her better than a brother does a sister. all the same i asked him to
get her. he brought her and i calmed down. on the second day there was a
meeting with demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the
communist party of the ussr , and people started shouting. one shouted , give
me my son back ! , another yelled , where is my daughter \? ! , a third wanted her
husband . . . bagirov was there too , and he stood there blinking , not saying
anything.

gayane when demichev asked where we wanted to go , everyone shouted , to
russia ! to be honest we were all frightened of armenia , there were such wild
rumors it was as though we were in a terrible dream , and no one wanted to go
to armenia. but he said that he could n't evacuate 18 , 000 people to russia and
that he would meet with everyone individually the next day and speak with
them. and he also said that today he was going to go look at all of our
apartments. on march 3 we went to the military barracks in the village of
nasosny. we were taken care of marvelously by the military. they sent special
flights of children right from there to minvody , yerevan , and moscow. one
woman left for moscow with a letter for gorbachev and gromyko.

zinaida the worst was truly behind us by then. everything had passed , but
the pain will remain for our whole lives. it cannot be forgotten. under no
circumstances should we , our children , or our grandchildren forget. who will
answer for those who died \? for our mothers , sisters , brother , sons and
daughters \? who will bear the responsibility \? who will wash away their blood \?
someone should be made to answer , and severely , so it has an effect on the
people that did with us as they pleased . . . it is n't over yet , now we live
here , in armenia , protected , but the issue is n't resolved. we would like
to stay in armenia , in our homeland , so that all the armenian people will be
united. then we will be invincible. armenians wo n't be scattered throughout
the soviet union , about the world , and if we 're all together this wo n't happen
again. as a mother of three children , as a woman , as a sister , i ask armenians
to be united so that what happened in sumgait will never happen again. our
homeland . . . the only request we have is that we be helped in obtaining an
apartment and getting jobs. so that our children can work for the good of
armenia. if we are n't able to , then let our children do it. and if it 's
possible , we 'll work for the good of armenia too. this is the land of our
forefathers. our grandfathers and great grandfathers lived here too , it was
only later that people dispersed all over. like a mother , the land here bore
and reared us. it is our wife , and will protect us , too. i want but one thing
that our people never see the hardship that our children saw , that your
children here , in armenia , never see anything like it.

upi , and the newspapers who are reporting this being all owned by saudis
i wonder how secure they are feeling by reporting all of these things ,
maybe saudi arabia is allowed to have all the human rights violations
it can have , nobody is including them in any list , .. those are designed
for independent states.

cairo , egypt (upi) the saudi government ordered the firing and

why is this reported from cairo \?

disbarment of six saudi human rights activists one week after they
formed the country 's first human rights group , which has been condemned
by the kingdom 's highest religious authorities , saudi media reported
friday.
two saudi owned , london based daily newspapers reported the dismissal
of five of the activists , who last week formed the committee for the
protection of legal rights in the kingdom to hear allegations of human
rights abuses.
the newspapers said orders were issued to dismiss abdallah al jabreen
from his job with the iftaa department , saudi arabia 's highest religious
advisory body hamad al seleifeh from the eduaction ministry , and
mohamed al muss'eri , abdallah al hamed and abdallah al tuwaijri from two
universities in riyadh , the saudi capital.
licenses to practice as law attorneys were also ordered revoked for
suleiman al marshoudi and al muss'eri and their law offices and any
national branches were ordered closed for the same reason.
.....
saudi interior minister prince nayef ben abdel aziz , a member of the
royal family , rejected criticism of human rights violations in the
kingdom.
in an interview broadcast friday , he said ``nations and organizations
... say they protect human rights or demand respect of human rights''
but at the same time refuse to intervene in bosnia herzegovina , where
people are ``being killed , raped and destroyed while even barred from
carrying arms.''
``where is the humanity and human rights of which those are talking \? ''
the prince said in the interview broadcast by the saudi owned , london
based middle east broadcasting center.

can somebody teach this man some logic \?
what is the relationship between a human rights league in saudia
and human rights in bosnia , i guess if we wanted to know what is
in italy , we should know what is in brasil (syrian joke)

prince nayef , who controls saudi police and prisons , said the
kingdom 's enforcement of islamic laws gives his country one of the

their claim of following islamic law is the biggest disservice
that they ever did to islam.

...
but hosni amin , executive director of the cairo based arab
organization for human rights , said his group has documented evidence of
human rights abuses in saudi arabia. he said the aohr supported the

but how about human rights in egypt mr amin \?

i guess i am fighting on too many fronts , i might retire very soon

pakistan definitely comes in ambit of the economic colonialism.
the utility rates (electricity , water and gas) are set by imf and

a few thousand ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

yup.

yes there are a few thousand left today after years of opression by
turkey.

i expect better from you , 'mau'. no , i take that back , i do n't. the
treaty on the exchange of the turkish and greek minorities (1923) left
no greek minority in turkiye , except a few thousand greeks in istanbul.
turkiye is no longer an obstacle for 'pan hellenism.' although the material
basis of greek policy is no longer visible , there is a residue , which
seems to unite the pelopenisians , the greeks who came from asia minor ,
the greeks who are originally from the islands of the marmara sea
or those who live in the numerous aegean islands. this residue is
also recognizable in the contemporary greek government.

as far a greek turkish wars are conserned i find it funny that a
so informed turk like you forgot to mention the balkan wars 1912 1923.

not a chance. greece lost in each and every war conducted solely

world war i , the british landed in 1919 a 200 , 000 greek army in

from a severe case of amnesia \? the tired and defeated turks rose up ,
formed a national force under the leadership of mustafa kemal , and
on august 30 , 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the greek army.

turkiye
is no longer an obstacle for 'pan hellenism.' besides , greece lost
in each and every war conducted solely between greece and turkiye in
the morea in 1821 , in thessaly in 1897 98 , and in anatolia in 1922.
especially the 1922 greek defeat , referred to as 'the tragedy of
anatolia' by the greeks , had momentous effects on greek mind and
behaviour.

i find it curious that a historian like you forgot the wars that
demolished the ottoman empire. 1912 1913.

i love people who do n't read and then spout myths as evidence. where
were greeks in 1912 and 1913 \? i guess , they were busy with...

greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica
culminated in 1912 and 1913

those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled
particularly to salonica , whose jewish population increased substantially
as a result , from 28 , 000 in 1876 to 90 , 000 in 1908 , more than half the
total population , though even there increased persecution by local greeks
led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire , particularly to
the great port of izmir.

despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike , the ritual
murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on. greek
efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in 1912
and 1913 , following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war ,
when many of its jews , were either killed or terrorized into leaving...

though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow
jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
practice their religions without hindrance , a law was issued in 1923
which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday , stimulating a new
jewish exodus as it was intended to do. between 1932 and 1934 there was a
series of anti semitic riots in salonica , with the cambel quarter , where
most of the remaining jews lived , being burned to the ground. this
was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting
hebrew and judea spanish in the jewish schools. a start was made also
on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica
for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out 47 . by
killing and driving out large numbers of jews , the greeks left a
substantial greek majority in the city for the first time , and starting
salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the
occupation of greece starting in 1941.

salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence.
istanbul , edirne , and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received
thousands more. nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by
the government of the sultan. thousands of muslims accompanied them in
flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained
independence or expanded. the russian conquest of the crimea and the
caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century , and particularly during
and after the crimean war , combined with the same independence movements
in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
its jews caused thousands of helpless , ill , and poverty stricken muslim
refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
ottoman empire , with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
to house and feed them as best it could. from 1850 to 1864 as many as
800 , 000 crimean tatars , circassians , and other muslims from north and
east of the black sea had entered anatolia alone , as many as 200 , 000 more
came during the next twenty years , while 474 , 389 refugees entered in 1876
1877 as a result of the ottoman wars with russia and the balkan states ,
with an equal number gaining refuge in the european portions of the
empire.

you make it sound as if the turks are as inocent as a teenaged virgin about
to get married. go and read about the atrocities commited by the turks
against the greeks during the period of time greece was occupied by the
turks. now you expect that turks living in greece should be treated like

so , the greek educational system is also in a shambles. history shows
that within the last 170 years , greeks played that game twice they
used istanbul patriarch grigorios in 1822 to instigate the morea
rebellion that resulted in the massacres of the muslim people. again ,
the orthodox patriarch constantine v invited the russian czar nicholas
ii to invade the ottoman empire 'in the name of jesus , ' and save his
flock from ottoman rule.

in the words of professor skiotis , with savage jubilance , the greeks
sang the words 'let no turk remain in the morea , nor in the whole world.'
the greeks were determined to achieve to 'romaiko' in the only way they
knew how through a war of religious extermination.

let me further improve this one for you. after the ottoman empire lost
world war i , the british landed in 1919 a 200 , 000 greek army in izmir
to exterminate the people of turkiye. are you suffering from a severe
case of amnesia \? the tired and defeated turks rose up , formed a national

annihilated the bulk of the greek army.

now wait , there is more.

the greek war of independence brought disaster to the jewish communities
in the peloponnesos , where the revolution erupted in 1821. the jews ,
because of their close association with the ottoman administration ,
were massacred along with the turks. the jewish communities of mistras ,
tripolis , and kalamata were decimated the few survivors moved north to
settle in chalkis and volos , still under ottoman rule. patras lost its
ancient jewish community , which was refounded only in 1905.

...the disintegration of the ottoman empire which had been going on
for a century was disastrous for ottoman jewry. this was the age of
nationalism among the christian subjects of the sultan , starting with
the greek revolution early in the nineteenth century , which , based on
the megali idea , or great idea , sought to add to greek kingdom istanbul
and large portions of anatolia , union of which with greece was felt to be
the 'dream and hope of all'. the success of the greek national movement ,
provided more in fact by the intervention of the great powers than by the
efforts of the greeks themselves , stimulated similar uprisings among the
other subjects in southeastern europe who had long been oppressed , not so
much by the ottomans but , rather , by the greek religious hierarchy which
dominated the orthodox millet , leading first to pressure for religious
independence , granted to the bulgarian orthodox exarchate in 1870 , to the
serbian church in 1879 , and to the rumanian church in 1885 , with subsequent
aspirations for , and achievement of , political independence following...

page 188

...they new nationalist leaders were greatly assisted in their
campaigns against the ottomans both by the diplomatic and consular
representatives of the major powers of europe and also by christian
missionaries , who emphasized feelings of christian superiority and
hatred for muslims and jews which fortified the religious as well as
ethnic bases of their pursuit of independence.

christian nationalism , based as much on religious as on ethnic identity ,
soon resurrected the medieval bigotries which had devastated both jews
and muslims and consequently had driven them together in the past.
vicious anti muslim and anti semitic movements developed , involving
large scale persecutions and massacres carried out by invading armies ,
by the independent states that resulted , also by christian subjects
who remained within the empire , particularly because of jewish and muslim
support for ottoman integrity in fear of their fate in the emergent
nationalist states of southeastern europe. the results were explosive
and damaging.

the invading armies of russia and austria as well as the revolting
nationalists and , later , successfully established independent christian
states , committed systematic genocide against jews and muslims throughout
the nineteenth century , despite great power admonitions to the contrary
in the treaties of paris (1858) and berlin (1878) , ...

page 188

...as the peoples of southeastern europe achieved their independence ,
their muslim and jewish minorities were systematically persecuted and
massacred , and those who survived were driven beyond the ever shrinking
boundaries of the retreating ottoman empire in a kind of slaughter which
had not been seen since the dispersal of the jews from palestine centuries
earlier.

this sort of genocide had begun as long before as the late sixteenth
century , with the rumanian principalities taking the lead , as united
rumania did subsequently during the later years of the nineteenth
century. in 1579 the ruler of moldavia , peter the lame , banished its
jews because of their competition with its christian merchants. when
prince micheal the brave revolted against the ottomans in the rumanian
principalities of wallachia and moldavia in 1593 , he ordered the massacre
of all the jews as well as turks in bucharest.

page 189

the slaughter continued well into the nineteenth century. when the
greeks revolted against ottoman rule many greek volunteers coming from
russia and the principalities to join in the effort slaughtered and
plundered the jewish communities along their paths as they went through
moldavia and wallachia toward greece.

page 190 (second paragraph)

when venice occupied the island of chios in 1694 , its jewish population
was either massacred or deported and all jewish communal and personal
property was stolen by the native greek population , leaving those jews
who returned in utter poverty and reduced to begging , no longer able to
compete with the greeks in trade or commerce.

page 190 (third paragraph)

jews living in greece and the rumanian principalities suffered terribly
because of their support for ottoman rule. when the greek nationalist
movement philike etairia started its uprising in wallachia and moldavia
during the spring of 1821 , hundreds of jews and muslims were killed by
the greeks who lived there as well as by native wallachs 14 . during
the height of the greek revolution , five thousand jews were massacred
in morea along with most of the muslim population , numbering about
twenty thousand in all 15 . in tripolizza alone 1 , 200 jews were
massacred along with uncounted turks 16 . reverend john hartley ,
after describing the carnage , concluded 'thus did jewish blood , mingled
with turkish , flow down the streets of captured city. the sons of isaac
and the sons of ishmael , on this as well as on every occasion during the
greek revolution , met with common fate. their corpses were cast out of the
city , and , like the ancient sovereign of judah , they received no burial
superior to that of an ass.' 17 jewish communities on the islands of
sparta , patras , corinthos , mistra , and argos were wiped out by bands of
greek rebels along with those of thebes , vrachori , attica and epirus 18 .
the surviving jews fled to the island of corfu , where jews who had fled
from italy , and the iberian peninsula had lived in peace and prosperity
under the venetian rule since the twelfth century , though divided into
rival greek and italian communities. it was not long , however , before
it too fell victim to the greek revolution , leading to savage repression
and massacres of jews , forcing the surviving members of the two communities
to come together for self defense for the first time. throughout the years
of greek revolution , greek nationalists went from town to town on the
mainland and from island to island in the agean , exterminating all the
jews and muslims they could find , many along the roads as they desperately
fled to safety in what was left of the ottoman empire. contemporary
accounts relate that the greeks left the murdered jews and muslims lying
exposed so their bodies could be torn apart by the buzzards 19 . most of
the jews who survived these massacres fled across the agean in small boats
to izmir , thus starting its rise as one of the leading centers of ottoman
jewish life during the nineteenth century. only in northern greece ,
particularly in the areas of janina and salonica , were the jews and the
turks able to successfully resist the greek assaults , thus saving their
populations from massacre as well 20 . during the remainder of the 19th
century , particularly during the greek turkish war in 1897 , those jews
who remained in greece in the areas of athens , chalkis , larissa , corfu
and crete suffered severe persecution and massacre , forcing thousands
more to emigrate into ottoman territory , particularly to salonica and
izmir 21 .

page 193 (last paragraph)

the inclusion in the treaty of berlin of stipulations providing
protection for the jewish and muslim minorities in southeastern europe
stimulated more popular anti semitic and anti muslim hysteria in all
the countries involved , with blood libel accusations once again being
used as pretexts for attacking and ravaging jewish quarters as well as
for new tactics for boycotting jewish shopkeepers , merchants and
professionals , a movement which was quickly adapted by the christian
millets in the major cities of the ottoman empire. because the bulgarians ,
rumanians and greeks correctly regarded the jews as supporters of the
turks , both jews and turks were expelled from these countries in equally
atrocious and brutal manners. their property was plundered and their
homes and shops taken over without compensation , while the survivors
fled in desperation to edirne and istanbul. while official statements
subsequently were issued granting equal rights to jews , little was done
in fact and they continued to be persecuted regularly well into the
twentieth century.

page 194 (last paragraph)

things were not much better elsewhere in southeastern europe or the
greek islands of the agean and the eastern mediterranean. in 1891 the
jews on corfu were subjected to severe persecution by local greeks due
to the revival of the old ritual murder accusations 26 . many of
those who survived found refuge in ottoman territory with the help of a
popular subscription drive carried out in istanbul under leadership of
the banque camondo. in 1881 and 1884 , and again in 1892 and 1903 ,
thousands of jews came to ottoman territory as a result of pogroms
in russia which went on between 1881 and 1921 with only slight periods
of respite. in 1899 jewish families arrived in istanbul in flight from
persecution in vidin , in independent bulgaria.

the conquest of ottoman thrace and macedonia by greek and bulgarian
forces during the balkan wars (1912 13) , including salonica , corlu ,
and edirne , was followed by general attacks on jews , their synagogues ,
homes and shops , in both countries 27 , resulting in a renewed exodus
toward istanbul and beyond. two reports from salonica graphically
described the situation caused by the invading armies

'all the self interested justifications of the newspapers of europe ,
all the lies which they have used to cover up the truth , can never
destroy the impression of the terrible anguish which has marked the
entry of the greeks in salonica. a week of terror and horror one can
never easily forget. the hellenes now cruelly feel today all the
damage that the explosion of hatred by the (greek) population has done
to their cause. the mob has shown itself odious and the government
weak...the incompetence of the greek administration and the horrors
inflicted by the soldiers has put them in a terrible situation. the
consuls guaranteed the absolute safety of the muslims , but sixty of
them were massacred in a single night....' 28

'it was n't only irregulars (comitacis) who massacred , pillaged and
burned. the soldiers of the army , the chief of police , and the high
civil officials took an active part in the events at serres. out of
6 , 000 houses , 4 , 000 were burned. almost 1 , 200 shops were consumed by
flames and destructive bombs. the (jewish) population lost all , and
without even anything to wear is in despair. everyone wants to
emigrate...' 29


page 196

as a result of these assaults , massacres , and forced deportations from
the independent countries of southeastern europe , the ottoman empire
received literally thousands of jewish refugees who joined the muslims
who survived the persecution , flooding into the empire...

muslims helping the nazis \? \? \? where on earth do you come up with such
accuusation \? \? do you have proofs \? \? if not , you should publically apologize
for such a statement. last time i heard , the nazis prided themselves in
needing no body to carry their politics and ideologies. and if your statment
were true , do n't you think israel would of used it to point to what a muslim
neighbor (palestine) could do to them if they allowed it to be \? the jewish
lobby and power is very strong , and if what you said is true , we would of
heard it from them before you could come up with it.
and you dare say that you are taking no sides ! !

my reference is a 4 page essay in our local star tribute newspaper
putting the whole conflict in perspective. i will readily admit
that i am no authority in this area however , other posteers
asserted that some muslims did join hands with croats and
nazis in persecuting serbs. in any case , past actions do not
in any way validate or legitimize what is happending there now.

i sincerely do apologize to the extent the author of the essay
was wrong in making the assertion he made.

maybe , some student of history may put this in perspective.
