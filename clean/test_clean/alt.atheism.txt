hi ,

i have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with
a theist acquaintance. he stated that thousands of bibles were discovered
at a certain point in time which were syllable perfect. this therefore
meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted
by my acquaintace was approximately 50 years after the death of jesus.

you can tell your friend from me that i was in a publisher 's
warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of the joy of
cooking and every one of them was syllable perfect.

i have since sold all i own and become a follower of the joy
of cooking. the incident i mentioned convinced me , once and
for all , that the joy of cooking is inspired by god and the
one true path to his glory.

which killings do you say are religously motivated \?

for example , i would claim that the recent assassination of four

at the time

motivated by religion is reaching.

what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n.i

i 'd say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge , and by
misguided patriotism. otherwise , i 'd have to wonder how come mainland
catholics are not killed by mainland protestants , and southern
catholics are not killed by southern protestants , and so on. take away
all plausible causes bar religion , and the violence diminishes markedly.
gee , why is that \?

now , it 's possible to argue that
religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in
the present , but i do n't know of any evidence that this is so and i'm
not enough of a historian to debate it.

given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland
into a country that has a particular church written into its
constitution , and which has restriction on civil rights dictated
by that church , i fail to see why the word past is appropriate.

the country also has a different official language written in its
constitution (and vice versa ) maybe they 're motivated by a love of
irish poetry. your argument is fallacious , jon.

for what it 's worth , i agree with all that you say about ireland above ,

however , the plant 's intended use was to aid the iraqi infrastructure.
it is not an example of selling a weapon. may sound nitpicking ,
but are we going to refuse to sell valuable parts that build the
infrastructure because of dual use technology \?

i am contending that in this case (and in the case of the sale
of pesticides by uk companies) that they knew full well that it was to
be used for the production of chemical weapons even if that was not its
officially stated purpose.

i personally do n't think that letting iran conquer iraq would have been a
good thing.

for that matter , neither do i (for the reasons you state). it is the
hypocrisy and claims the us did not help iraq that make me angry , plus the
fact that the usa seems to believe it has the right to interfere where
is sees fit (i.e. has an interest) rather than a duty to intervene where
it is required. this is demonstrated by the failure of the us to do anything
about east timor (and the region is becoming destabilised). the usa might
have done something approaching the right thing , given my reservations about
the uncessary number of civillian casualites , but for wholly the wrong reasons
and after having a hand in creating the situation.

that in no way would affect the us later military action against iraq.

i did not suggest it would and it would be ridiculous to assert
otherwise. i was simply indicating the usa has previously aided iraq.

intel on manufacturing techniques , or something of that nature \?

no , apparently data (orginally from satellites although i doubt
that iraq would have been given the raw data) concerning troop concentrations.

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes. irrational
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism.

correlation is not causation. and a belief that absolutes exist is not
the same thing as a belief in absolutes , any more than belief in a shortest
route from thurles to clonmel is the same thing as a knowledge of the
irish roadsystem.

correlation is not necessarily causation. however , as you might have noticed ,
the above allows to conclude that the correlation between religion and fanatism
is based on common features of religious belief.

(sorry for the long quotes , but i dont see where to cut)


huh \? are you barking mad \?


hardly.


(1) theism is not as strongly correlated with fanaticism as you say. plus
you could find stronger correlations if you were actually interested
in the truth instead of being as you seeming are , a bigot.


theism is correlated with fanaticism. i have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism. the point is ,
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic. one could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism (for example) , but i just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it.

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered. gullibility ,
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more
reliable indicators. and the really dangerous people the sources of
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical manipulators
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing. now , some
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism ,
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom. ever read animal farm \?

(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that
reason is always useful \?


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate. one point is that
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would
be irrational. which is it \?

the first part of the second statement contains no information , because
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it.

compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism \? to
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
i suspect you do not have.

the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. however , the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis.

i do n't understand this. can you formalise your argument \?

just for the record ( not that any kind of information would be
likely to affect your thinking ) i have an msee focus in
electromagnetics from penn.

a photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make.
what was observed is something we can measure that matches what
the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted.

much in the same way that we need both a particle model and a
wave model for light , the atomic model is a mathematical
representation of physical phenomena. a model that can and
probably will continue to change over time. that makes it
subjective (the model that is). however , the model gives us an
objective way to talk about the physical world.

to put it another way , the quantum mechanical model of the atom
allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and
unambiguous results , which is objective. however , as bohr and
einstein duked it out mid century , the interpretation of
those reapeatable , observable measurements is quite subjective.
bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was
inherent in the nature of the universe. einstein said particle
motion was deterministic , but it was our measurement shortcomings
that introduced the randomness. they were talking about the
exact same results , though.

andy

i do n't accept atoms or gravity as fact either. they are extremely useful
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make.
other posters have aptly explained the atomic model. gravity , too , is
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected , but we
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on
objects by this thing we call gravity. gravity , however , is not
a fact. it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects
behave in our physical environment. newton thought gravity was a
simple vector force einstein a wave. both are very useful models that
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith , unless of course you
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly
the way the theory now formulated talks about it. that takes a great
leap of faith , which , of course , is what religion takes. evolution
is no different.

welcome to alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.

this is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the
newsgroups.

many groups of a 'controversial' nature have noticed that new readers often
come up with the same questions , mis statements or misconceptions and post
them to the net. in addition , people often request information which has
been posted time and time again. in order to try and cut down on this , the
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following
titles

1. alt.atheism faq overview for new readers
2. alt.atheism faq introduction to atheism
3. alt.atheism faq frequently asked questions (faq)
4. alt.atheism faq constructing a logical argument
5. alt.atheism faq atheist resources

this is article number 1. please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting. the
others are entirely optional.

if you are new to usenet , you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers. the articles titled a primer on how to work with
the usenet community , answers to frequently asked questions about usenet
and hints on writing style for usenet are particularly relevant. questions
concerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.

if you are unable to find any of the articles listed above , see the finding

around the network.


finding stuff

all of the faq files should be somewhere on your news system. here are
some suggestions on what to do if you ca n't find them

1. check the newsgroup alt.atheism. look for subject lines starting with
alt.atheism faq .

2. check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.

if you do n't find anything in steps 1 or 2 , your news system is n't set up
correctly , and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the
problem.

3. if you have anonymous ftp access , connect to rtfm.mit.edu 18.70.0.226 .
go to the directory pub usenet alt.atheism , and you 'll find the latest
versions of the faq files there.

ftp is a a way of copying files between networked computers. if you
need help in using or getting started with ftp , send e mail to
mail server@rtfm.mit.edu with

send usenet news.answers ftp list faq

in the body.

4. there are other sites which also carry news.answers postings. the article
introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these
sites the article is posted regularly to news.answers.

5. if you do n't have ftp , send mail to mail server@rtfm.mit.edu
consisting of the following lines

send usenet news.answers finding sources
send usenet alt.atheism faq
send usenet alt.atheism introduction
send usenet alt.atheism logic
send usenet alt.atheism resources

5. (penultimate resort) send mail to mail server@mantis.co.uk consisting of
the following lines

send atheism faq faq.txt
send atheism faq logic.txt
send atheism faq intro.txt
send atheism faq resource.txt

and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.
there 's other stuff , too interesting commands to try are help and
send atheism index .

6. (last resort) mail mathew@mantis.co.uk , or post an article to the
newsgroup asking how you can get the faq files. you should only do this
if you 've tried the above methods and they 've failed it 's not nice to
clutter the newsgroup or people 's mailboxes with requests for files.
it 's better than posting without reading the faq , though ! for instance ,
people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who do n't have
ftp will probably need assistance obtaining the faq files.

i think you 're letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of

(webster myth a traditional or legendary story...

how does that qualify \?
indeed , it 's almost oxymoronic...a rather amusing instance.
i 've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as
accepted uncritically , especially the few that are legend.
many are trying to explain basic truths , as myths do , but
they do n't meet the other criterions.

andrew ,

the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have
created to make religion appear absurd. rather than approach religion
(including christainity) in a rational manner and debating its claims
as the are stated , atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then
hold the religious accountable for beliefs they do n't have. what is
more accurately oxymoric is the a term like , reasonable atheist.

bill

divine justice. according to the most fundamental doctrines of
christianity , when the first man sinned , he was at that time the

you accuse him of referencing mythology , then you procede to
launch your own xtian mythology. (this time meeting all the
requirements of myth.)

here 's a good example of of what i said above. read the post again , i
said , acoording to ... , which means i am referring to christian
doctrine (as i understand it) , if i am speaking for myself you 'll know
it. my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain
doctrines since it seemed germane.

bill

with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it
means. when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and
do n't know what he wants , they contradict the bible which clearly says
that everyone knows. the authority of the bible is its claim to be

...should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting
it across \? you may trust the bible , but your trusting it does n't
make it any more credible to me.
if the bible says that everyone knows , that 's clearly reason
to doubt the bible , because not everyone knows your alleged
god 's alleged existance.

again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this
point , your dispute is not with me ...

bill

refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified. those that
claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is
unknown , must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is
no excuse.

1) no , they do n't have to ignore the bible. the bible is far
from universally accepted. the bible is not a proof of god
it is only a proof that some people have thought that there
was a god. (or does it prove even that \? they might have been
writing it as series of fiction short stories. as in the
case of dionetics.) assuming the writers believed it , the
only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it.
and that 's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the
interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct.

2) there are people who have truly never heard of the bible.

3) again , read the faq.

1) here again you miss the point. the bible itself is not the point ,
it 's what it contains. it makes no difference who accpets the bible or
even who 's unaware of its existence , christians hold that it applies
universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate
and the same innate knowledge of god.

2) see above

3) if you read my post with same care as read the faq , we would n't be
having this conversation.

bill

freedom. you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to
ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known
in both cases. that an atheist ca n't accept the evidence means only

bzzt...wrong answer !
gravity is directly there. it does n't stop exerting a direct and
rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it. god , on the
other hand , does n't generally show up in the supermarket , except
on the tabloids. god does n't exert a rationally undeniable influence.
gravity is obvious gods are n't.

as i said , the evidence is there , you just do n't accept it , here at
least we agree.

bill

secondly , human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god , so
much so that it is , in itself , intrinsic to our nature. human reason
always comes back to the question of god , in every generation and in

no , human reason has n't always come back to the existance of
god it has usually come back to the existance of god .
in other words , it does n't generally come back to the xtian
god , it comes back to whether there is any god. and , in much
of oriental philosophic history , it generally does n't pop up as
the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces
are and which ones are out there. from a world wide view ,
human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to
be and or what force(s) are currently in control. a natural
tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful
thinking.

yes , human reason does always come back to the existence of god , we 're
having this discussion are we not \?

bill

i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently
reasonable , that divine justice is just and human nature is much
different than what atheists think it is. whether you agree or not

you certainly are not correct on human nature. you are , at
the least , basing your views on a completely eurocentric
approach. try looking at the outside world as well when
you attempt to sum up all of humanity.

well this is interesting , truth is to be determined by it politically
correct content. granted it 's extremely unhip to be a wasp male , and
anything european is contemptable , but i thought this kind of
dialogue , the purpose of a.a , was to get at the truth of things. but
then i remember the oxymoron , reasonalble atheist , and i understand.

reply to frank@d012s658.uucp (frank o'dwyer)

the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral
truths and the method by which they can be established. if we accept
that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to
what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved
by any facts about the nature of the world.

this can be avoided in at least two ways (1) by leaving the good
undefined , since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is
either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a
reply.

if the good is undefined (undefinable \? ) but you require of everyone that
they know innately what is right , you are back to subjectivism.

no , and begging the question. see below.

(2) by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms.

ditto here. an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the
part of the person making it.

again , incorrect , and question begging. see below.

at this point the objectivist may talk of 'self evident truths'

pretty perceptive , that prof. flew.

but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self evidence is in the
mind of the beholder \?

of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy.

please explain how this helps. i do n't see your argument.

i do n't see yours. it seems to rest on the assertion that everything
is either a subject or an object. there 's nothing compelling about that
dichotomy. i might just as well divide the world into subject , object ,
event. it even seems more sensible. causation , for example , is
an event , not a subject or an object.

furthermore , if subject object were true dichotomy , i.e.

everything is either a subject or an object

then , is that statement a self evident truth or not \? if so , then it 's
all in the mind of the beholder , according to the relativist , and hardly
compelling. add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved
in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or
solipsist argument , and that we have this perfectly good alternate
set of categories (subject , object , event) which can be reduced
to (subject , object , quality) without any logical difficulty and why
yes , i guess i am denying that self evident truths are all in the mind of
the beholder.

if not , what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true \?

all of it.

if nothing , then no moral judgements are true. this is a thing that
is commonly referred to as nihilism. it entails that science is of
no value , irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful. how
anyone arrives at relativism subjectivism from this argument beats me.

this makes no sense either. flew is arguing that this is where the
objectivist winds up , not the subjectivist. furthermore , the nihilists
believed in nothing except science , materialism , revolution , and the
people.

i'm referring to ethical nihilism

the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are
some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.
to hold a moral opinion is , he suggests , not to know something to be
true but to have preferences regarding human activity.

and if those preferences should include terrorism , that moral opinion
is not true. likewise , if the preferences should include noterrorism ,
that moral opinion is not true. why should one choose a set of
preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes
noterrorism \? oh , no reason. this is patently absurd....

and also not the position of the subjectivist , as has been pointed out
to you already by others. ditch the strawman , already , and see my reply
to mike cobb 's root message in the thread societal basis for morality.

i 've responded over there. btw i do n't intend this as a strawman , but
as something logically entailed by relativism (really any ethical system
where values are assumed to be unreal). it 's different to say relativists
say... than relativism implies... .

merely a question for the basis of morality

moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior .

i disagree with these. what society thinks should be irrelevant. what the
individual decides is all that is important.

this does n't seem right. if i want to kill you , i can because that is what i
decide \?

exactly. although this may be a dissapointing answer , there has to be an
interplay of the two. personal ethos and societal morality. a person 's
self generated learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely
mental verbal level , and do n't usually find expression in society except in an
impure (not in the sense of bad ) ) state. sometimes this has to be so.


1)who is society

i think this is fairly obvious

not really. if whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok , there are
always some in the society who disagree with the mandates , so which
societal mandates make the standard for morality \?

also , what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society , in a very
real sense \? to use the obvious example , there is a political society , and a
racial society , and a gender society , and sometimes they do not always agree on
every issue...


2)how do they define what is acceptable \?

generally by what they feel is right , which is the most idiotic policy i can
think of.

so what should be the basis \? unfortunately i have to admit to being tied at
least loosely to the feeling , in that i think we intuitively know some things
to be wrong. awfully hard to defend , though.


yes. perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it does n't hurt
others \? the problem with this is that it is merely saying what you can do it
is not a morality in that it does n't propound any specifically preferred
behaviours.


3)how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position \?

by thinking for ourselves.

i might agree here. just because certain actions are legal does not make them
moral .

i 'll add a hearty me two . however , one could just as well say just because
certain actions are moral does not make them legal one still does n't really
get an impression of which one is truly right .

let 's say that we drop a marble into the black hole. it races , ever faster ,

travel. integrating the curve gives a time to reach the event horizon of . .
infinity. so the math says that nothing can enter a black hole.

not true. only an observer at rest at infinite distance from the black hole
will see the particle take infinite time to reach the horizon. in the
particle 's own reference frame , it takes a very finite time to reach the

i agree , but this started at one particular point in time , and we
do n't know when this starting point of 'accurately copied scriptures'
actually happened.

this begs the question of whether it ever started perhaps because
accuracy was always an intention.

even worse , if the events in nt were not written by eye witness accounts (a
high probability looking at possible dates when the first gospels were
ready) then we have to take into account all the problems with information
forwarded with the 'telephone metaphor' , indeed.

it makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away
(reporters , if you will). as i said earlier , the telephone metaphor is
innately bad , because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the
aims of writing these sorts of texts. (also , i would point out that , by the
standards generally asserted in this group , the distinction between
eyewitnesses and others is hollow , since nobody can be shown to be an
eyewitness , or indeed , even shown to be the author of the text.)

there is no evidence that the original texts of either the ot or the nt
are largely lost over time in a sea of errors , corrections , additions and
deletions. in the case of the nt , the evidence is strongly in the other
direction the textus r. and the nestle aland text do not differ on more
than a low level of significance. it is reasonable to assume a similar
situation for the ot , based on the nt as a model.

it had to happen the old allegation of the deathbed conversion of the
noted unbeliever. i seem to recall similar claims being made about
voltaire , mencken , darwin , ingersoll , etc. indeed , the literary hoax
attributed to nietzsche , my sister and i , portrays him as trembling
in fear before divine judgment (and it was recently re issued by amok
books , with an introduction by a lutheran professor telling us why we
should take it seriously ! ). what all of these deathbed conversion
claims have in common is that they are utterly unsubstantiated , and
almost certainly untrue.

perhaps the least believable and most infurating alleged conversion
was that of tom paine , reported , like most , only by his devout
relatives.

asimov was very unlikely to convert to christianity on his deathbed.
return to judaism , perhaps , if he did revert to childhood training ,
but christianity \? the good doctor would more likely have converted to
hinduism.

isaac asimov read creationist books. he read the bible. he had ample
opportunity to kneel before his creator and savior. he refused. in
fact , he sent out a strong promotional letter urging support of the
american humanist association , shortly before he died.

excerpt from ken ham , asimov meets his creator , back to genesis
no. 42 , june 1992 , p. c (included in acts facts vol. 21 , no. 6 ,
june 1992 , from the institute for creation research). this is one
of the most offensive articles they 've ever published but at least
it argues against a deathbed conversion. there 's a part of the
article even worse than what i 've just quoted , in which an excerpt
from a reader 's letter says that if asimov is burning in hell now ,
then he certainly has had a 180 degree change in his former beliefs
about creation and the creator. (a post deathbed conversion.)

if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that \? what
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally
mandated morality \? pardon the extremism , but could n't i murder your
brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was
doing what felt good , did n't want anyone forcing their morality on me ,
or i do n't follow your morality \?

i believe that morality is subjective. each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes. mine are not a priori more correct than someone
elses. this does not mean however that i must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority.

why \? your last statement. why \? by which authority \?

most criminals do not see their behavior as moral. the may realize that
it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral
system but being immoral. for someone to lay claim to an alternative
moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be
internally consistent.

why \? your last statement. why are these things necessary \?

and believe me , a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly
consistent.

some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense and
thus may be incapable of behaving morally. while someone like hitler
may have believed that his actions were moral , we may judge him immoral
by our standards. holding that morality is subjective does not mean
that we must excuse the murderer.

trouble is , this would sound just fine coming from someone like hitler , too.
(i do not mean any comparison or offence , david.) try substituting
the social minority of your choice for 'sociopath' , 'hitler' , and
'murderer'. no logical difference. someone like you , vs. someone like
hitler. zero sum.

inconsistency and counterexample

this occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes
stand a , which is inconsistent with b. there are two variations in which b is
either a mutually agreed on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same
source. the second party fallaciously responds by saying see , the source
really does say b , it 's right here ! this reply does not refute the allegation
of inconsistency because it does not show that the source only says b.

example of the first type the koran says unbelievers should be treated in
these ways. we can both agree these are immoral. the koran clearly says in
this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way.

example of the second type there are two biblical creation stories. you 're
wrong , since the bible clearly describes the creation as description .

when a is contradictorily defined a does not point to an instance in

reply to frank@d012s658.uucp (frank o'dwyer)

the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral
truths and the method by which they can be established. if we accept
that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to
what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved
by any facts about the nature of the world.

this can be avoided in at least two ways (1) by leaving the good
undefined , since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is
either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a
reply.

if the good is undefined (undefinable \? ) but you require of everyone that
they know innately what is right , you are back to subjectivism.

(2) by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms.

ditto here. an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the
part of the person making it.

at this point the objectivist may talk of 'self evident truths'

pretty perceptive , that prof. flew.

but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self evidence is in the
mind of the beholder \?

of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy.

please explain how this helps. i do n't see your argument.

if not , what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true \?

if nothing , then no moral judgements are true. this is a thing that
is commonly referred to as nihilism. it entails that science is of
no value , irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful. how
anyone arrives at relativism subjectivism from this argument beats me.

this makes no sense either. flew is arguing that this is where the
objectivist winds up , not the subjectivist. furthermore , the nihilists
believed in nothing except science , materialism , revolution , and the
people.

the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are
some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.
to hold a moral opinion is , he suggests , not to know something to be
true but to have preferences regarding human activity.

and if those preferences should include terrorism , that moral opinion
is not true. likewise , if the preferences should include noterrorism ,
that moral opinion is not true. why should one choose a set of
preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes
noterrorism \? oh , no reason. this is patently absurd....

i do n't necessarily disagree with your assertion , but i disagree with
your reasoning. (faith bad. dogma bad. religion (faith dogma).
religion (bad bad). religion bad.) unfortunately , you never
state why faith and dogma are dangerous.

faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on
faith alone , which by its nature is without justification. that
is what i mean by the word ``faith'' belief without justification , or
belief with arbitrary justification , or with emotional (irrational)
justification.

for example , when someone says that god exists , that they do n't know
why they believe god exists , they can just feel it , that 's faith.

dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based
on new information , or increased mental faculty.

so christians are totally irrational \? irrational with respect to their
religion only \? what are you saying \? one 's belief in a christian god does
not make one totally irrational. i think i know what you were getting at ,
but i 'd rather hear you expand on the subject.

faith and dogma are irrational. the faith and dogma part of any religion
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals. i claim that
faith and dogma are the quintessential part of any religion. if that
makes (the much overused in this context) buddism a philosophy rather
than a religion , i can live with that. science is not a religion ,
because there is no faith nor dogma.

a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind ,
whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and dogma present
in any religion.

again , this statement is too general. a christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher , and absolutely capable of changing his her mind. faith in
god is a belief , and all beliefs may change. would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
god which , of course , may show unfair bias when studying , say , religion \?

have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists \? if a philosopher
is not an atheist , s he tends to be called a theologian.

a christian tends to consider christianity sacred. christianity is
a special set of beliefs , sanctioned by god himself , and therefore ,
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence
of that being who makes no mistakes. faith comes into play. dogma
comes into play. ``the lord works in mysterious ways'' is an example
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed.
sure , interpretations of what ``god said'' are changed to satisfy the
needs of society , but when god says something , that 's it. it was said ,
and that 's that. since god said it , it is unflawed , even if the
interpretations are flawed.

science , (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast , has a
built in defence against faith and dogma.
a scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time , and ,
and , and , a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way. the goal is to keep improving
the beliefs. the goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect
the best information currently available. that 's the only rational
thing to do. that 's good philosophy.

can you see the difference \? science views beliefs as being flawed ,
and new information can be obtained to improve them. (how many
scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding
of everything \? none it would put them out of a job ! ) religion
views its beliefs as being perfect , and the interpretations of
those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which
conflicts with them.

please explain how just because thinking kills people. (and please
state more in your answer than waco. )

it 's easier for someone to kill a person when s he does n't require
a good rational justification of the killing. i do n't consider
``he 's jewish'' , or ``he was born of jewish parents'' , or
``this document says he 's jewish'' to be good rational justification.

by the way , i was n't aware mass suicide
was a problem. waco and jonestown were isolated incidents.
mass suicides are far from common.

the same way that any theory is proven false. you examine the
predicitions
that the theory makes , and try to observe them. if you do n't , or
if you
observe things that the theory predicts would n't happen , then you
have some
evidence against the theory. if the theory ca n't be modified to
incorporate the new observations , then you say that it is false.

but how does one handle the nonrepeatability of the experiment \? in
many types of
experiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will
happen again
and be capable of being observed. for example , in chemistry someone
may predict
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that
reaction
repeatedly.

there are several problems here. first , you are discussing only
experimental procedures. observational procedures are also useful. the
main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make
prediction about as yet unmade observations. the observations could be
the result of an experiment , or they could be obsevations of activity
occuring spontaneossly in nature , or they could even be observations of
the lasting results of events long past. all that matters is that the
observations be new . this is what prediction is about in science
it is
not about predicting the future except in this very restricted
sense.

secondly , repeatability can also take many forms. it is really just
the
requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results.
the
observation of a fossil is 'repeatable' , since any qualified observer
may
look at it (this is why the specimens are reqtined in a museum). also ,
there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will
correspond
to the current one. new fossils are found often enough that this is
tested regularly. many times a new fossil actually falsifies some
conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils.

unfortunately for you , the models that were falsified have alway been
peripheral to the model of evolution we now have. (for instance , the
front legs of tyrannosaurus rex turned out to have tremendous muscles ,
rather than being weakly endowed as previously believed).

so , in fact , histoircal science findings are repeatable in the
necessary sense. just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the
original
event does not make it impossible to make valid observations.

this is not to say that biologists would not go coo coo if extra
terrestrial life were discovered that could make the determination
of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy .

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.

bogus. i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.
the point is that theism is a factor.


gullibility ,
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more
reliable indicators. and the really dangerous people the sources of
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical manipulators
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing.

that 's a claim you have to support. please note that especially in the
field of theism , the leaders believe what they say.


now , some
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism ,
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom. ever read animal farm \?


that 's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to
fanatism , and not all fanatism is caused by theism. the point is ,
there is a correlation , and it comes from innate features of theism.

gullibility , by the way , is one of them.


and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men. interesting that you have nothing better to offer.


(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that
reason is always useful \?


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate. one point is that
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would
be irrational. which is it \?


that 's bogus. self reference is not circular. and since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems , it is allowed.

your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular.


the first part of the second statement contains no information , because
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it.


i 've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here.

an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy. have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice. and further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived. i exist is derived , if you want
it that way.

further , one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.

what is it you are trying to say \?


compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism \? to
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
i suspect you do not have.


using the traditonal definition of gods. personal , supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world. usually connected to morals and or
the way the world works.


the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. however , the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis.

i do n't understand this. can you formalise your argument \?

person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice. that does not make
b true , it is at best a work hypothesis. however , the content of b is that
it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis. testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b (already believed)
says it is wrong a waste of time not possible. depending on the further
contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed , this can
have interesting effects.

answer the question what the absolute set of morals is people agree on like
they would agree on a football being a football.

let us go back , oh say 1000 years or so , whatever. pretend someone says to you
someday there will be men on the moon. (now remember , you still think the
world is flat). this is quite an extraordinary claim.

i think c.s. lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the
world is flat.

however , this argument goes both ways. pretend someone telling plato that
it is highly probable that people do not really have souls their minds
and their consciousness are just something their brains make up , and
their brains (their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in
voluntarly actions. i do n't think plato would have been happy with this ,
and neither would paul , although paul 's ideas were quite different.
however , if you would read what we discuss in this group , and not
just preach , you would see that there currently is much evidence in
favour of these statements.

the same applies to the theory of natural selection , or other sacred
cows of christianity on our origins and human nature. i do n't believe
in spirits , devils or immortal souls any more than in gods.

the fact is we can argue the existence of god until the end of time , there really is no
way to either prove or disprove it , but there will be a time when we all know the truth.
i hope and believe i'm right and i hope and pray that you find your way too.

ah , you said it. you believe what you want to. this is what i had assumed
all along.

ok maybe i should n't have said no way . i guess i really believe there is
a way. but all i can do is plant seeds. either they grow or they do n't.

you might be as well planting satan 's seeds , ever thought of this \?
besides , you have n't yet explained why we must believe so blindly ,
without any guiding light at all (at least i have n't noticed it).
i do n't think this is at all fair play on god 's part.

your argument sounds like a version of pascal 's wager. please read the
faq , this fallacy is discussed there.

but
they wo n't if they 're not planted. the holy spirit is the nurishment that
helps them grow and that comes from god.

and i failed to get help from the hs because i had a wrong attitude \?
sorry , dan , but i do not think this spirit exists. people who claim to have
access to it just look badly deluded , not gifted.

(god is) the one who created the night , the day , the sun and the moon.
each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion. (qur'an 33)

the positive aspect of this verse noted by dr. maurice bucaille is that
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time (and for
a long time afterwards) , there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse
(or anywhere in the qur'an).


well , that is certainly different , but it looks as if there is a translation
found for everything. by the way , i am most surprised to hear that night and
day move in an orbit.

and that the sun travels in an orbit without saying that earth does , too ,
sounds geocentric to me.

yes. the qur'an discusses this point in several ways , some of
them quite directly. for example , it says that if god were
to appear them there would be no need for faith and belief as
the evidence would be definitive.

ah ! excellent. so why does n't she appear to me \? i'm a little weak in the
blind faith department. (besides , she does n't even really need to appear
how about , oh say , a little tip something like put your all on 3 in the
7 30 at the dog races ... perhaps in a dream or vision.)

how do we know that
muhammed did n't just go out into the desert and smoke something \?

would a person who was high write so well and with such consistency \?

i'm afraid i do n't know arabic i have only read translations. i would n't
know it if it were well written. (consistent , though , is one thing the quran
is not.) and have you read it in arabic \? besides , some of my best
writing has been done under the influence of , shall we say , consciousness
altering substances.

and how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the quran to did n't screw up , or
put in their own little verses \?

they 'd have to be very good to do so without destroying the beauty
and literary quality of text arabic text.

yes , so \? how do we know they were n't very good \? (again , assuming that the
quran is beautfully written.)

and why can muhammed marry more than four women ,
when no other muslim is allowed to \?

muhammad did not exceed the number after the revelation regulating
the number of wives a man could marry , but before it.

ok , i retract this point. (although i might still say that once he knew , he
should have done something about it.)

(although i think the biggest
insult to islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say so of some holy guy. not to
mention murder the author.)

i agree. but is it really true that this is the case \?

i have n't interviewed all muslims about this i would really like it if this
were false. but i ca n't take it on your say so what are your sources \?

another case of judging principles on the basis of those who claim
to follow them.

what other basis do we have to judge a system \? especially when we ca n't get

books fiction

thomas m. disch

the santa claus compromise
short story. the ultimate proof that santa exists. all characters and
events are fictitious. any similarity to living or dead gods uh , well...

walter m. miller , jr

a canticle for leibowitz
one gem in this post atomic doomsday novel is the monks who spent their lives
copying blueprints from saint leibowitz , filling the sheets of paper with
ink and leaving white lines and letters.

edgar pangborn

davy
post atomic doomsday novel set in clerical states. the church , for example ,
forbids that anyone produce , describe or use any substance containing...
atoms .

philip k. dick

philip k. dick dick wrote many philosophical and thought provoking short
stories and novels. his stories are bizarre at times , but very approachable.
he wrote mainly sf , but he wrote about people , truth and religion rather than
technology. although he often believed that he had met some sort of god , he
remained sceptical. amongst his novels , the following are of some relevance

galactic pot healer
a fallible alien deity summons a group of earth craftsmen and women to a
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans. when the
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers , pot healer joe fernwright is
unable to comply. a polished , ironic and amusing novel.

a maze of death
noteworthy for its description of a technology based religion.

valis
the schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of gnostic
christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of
unknown but possibly divine origin. he is accompanied by his dogmatic and
dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.

the divine invasion
god invades earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from
another star system. unfortunately she is terminally ill , and must be
assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24 hour easy listening music.

margaret atwood

the handmaid 's tale
a story based on the premise that the us congress is mysteriously
assassinated , and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it
right again. the book is the diary of a woman 's life as she tries to live
under the new christian theocracy. women 's right to own property is revoked ,
and their bank accounts are closed sinful luxuries are outlawed , and the
radio is only used for readings from the bible. crimes are punished
retroactively doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are
hunted down and hanged. atwood 's writing style is difficult to get used to
at first , but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

various authors

the bible
this somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized. however , it
is probably worth reading , if only so that you 'll know what all the fuss is
about. it exists in many different versions , so make sure you get the one
true version.

philadelphia , usa.
a detailed and scholarly justification of atheism. contains an outstanding
appendix defining terminology and usage in this (necessarily) tendentious
area. argues both for negative atheism (i.e. the non belief in the
existence of god(s) ) and also for positive atheism ( the belief in the
non existence of god(s) ). includes great refutations of the most
challenging arguments for god particular attention is paid to refuting
contempory theists such as platinga and swinburne.
541 pages. isbn 0 87722 642 3 (hardcover paperback also available)

the case against christianity , temple university press
a comprehensive critique of christianity , in which he considers
the best contemporary defences of christianity and (ultimately)
demonstrates that they are unsupportable and or incoherent.

james turner

without god , without creed , the johns hopkins university press , baltimore ,
md , usa
subtitled the origins of unbelief in america . examines the way in which
unbelief (whether agnostic or atheistic) became a mainstream alternative
world view. focusses on the period 1770 1900 , and while considering france
and britain the emphasis is on american , and particularly new england
developments. neither a religious history of secularization or atheism ,
without god , without creed is , rather , the intellectual history of the fate
of a single idea , the belief that god exists.
316 pages. isbn (hardcover) 0 8018 2494 x (paper) 0 8018 3407 4

george seldes (editor)

the great thoughts , ballantine books , new york , usa
a dictionary of quotations of a different kind , concentrating on statements
and writings which , explicitly or implicitly , present the person 's philosophy
and world view. includes obscure (and often suppressed) opinions from many
people. for some popular observations , traces the way in which various
people expressed and twisted the idea over the centuries. quite a number of
the quotations are derived from cardiff 's what great men think of religion
and noyes' views of religion .
490 pages. isbn (paper) 0 345 29887 x.

richard swinburne

the existence of god (revised edition) , clarendon paperbacks , oxford
this book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with the coherence of
theism (1977) and was concluded with faith and reason (1981). in this
work , swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of god. his arguments , which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and
aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived , were
decisively rejected in mackie 's the miracle of theism . in the revised
edition of the existence of god , swinburne includes an appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie.

j. l. mackie

the miracle of theism , oxford
this (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of god. it ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of descartes , anselm , berkeley , hume et al , through
the moral arguments of newman , kant and sidgwick , to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne. it also addresses those
positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational ,
such as those of kierkegaard , kung and philips , as well as replacements for
god such as lelie 's axiarchism. the book is a delight to read less
formalistic and better written than martin 's works , and refreshingly direct
when compared with the hand waving of swinburne.

anyway , since i seem to be the only one following this particular line
of discussion , i wonder how many of the rest of the readership have
read this book \? what are your thoughts on it \?

i read it when it first came out , and the controversy broke. put my name
on the waiting list at the library (that way if the book was really
offensive , none of my money would find its way to the author or
publisher) , and read it , cover to cover (to use a phrase that seems
popular here right now).

and i liked it. the writing style was a little hard to get used to , but
it was well worth the effort. coming from a similar background (rushdie
grew up in bombay in a muslim family , and moved to england i grew up in
new delhi) , it made a strong impression on me. (and he used many of the
strange constructions of indian english the yaar at the end of a
sentence , butbutbut , the occasional hindi phrase , etc.)

at the time i still sorta kinda thought of myself as a muslim , and i
could n't see what the flap was all about. it seemed clear to me that this
was allegory. it was clear that he described some local prostitutes who
took on the names and personae of muhammed 's wives , and had not (as my
grandfather thundered) implied that muhammed 's wives were prostitutes in
short , every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to
have missed the point completely. (and i wo n't mention the fact that the
most militant of them had never even seen the book. oops , i just did ! )

perhaps in a deep sense , the book is insulting to islam , because it
exposes the silliness of revealed religion why does an omnipotent deity
need an agent \? she can come directly to me , ca n't she \? how do we know that
muhammed did n't just go out into the desert and smoke something \? and how
do we know that the scribes he dictated the quran to did n't screw up , or
put in their own little verses \? and why can muhammed marry more than four
women , when no other muslim is allowed to \? (although i think the biggest
insult to islam is that the majority of its followers would want to
suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say so of some holy guy. not to
mention murder the author.)

over the years , when i have made this point , various primarily muslim
posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as filth and lies , i would rank
rushdie 's book with hitler 's mein kempf or worse , and so on.

i had much the same response when i tried to talk about the book. a really
silly argument after all , how many of these same people have read mein
kampf \? it just made me wonder what are they afraid of \? why do n't they
just read the book and decide for themselves \?

maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book , and the absence of
protest from the liberal muslims to khomeini 's fatwa outrage , was the
final push i needed into atheism !

attitude seemed to be (i do n't know if it really was) that chemists
tend to ignore all kinds of effects

when they 're not important , yes. all scientists do. otherwise science would
never get anywhere.

your original posting stated that
when doing chemistry , it is common to ignore atomic interactions ,

hang about not atomic interactions in general. just specific ones which
are deemed unimportant. like gravitational interactions between ions , which
are so small they 're drowned out by electrostatic effects , and so on.

has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years \?

perhaps this revolution has yet to reach cambridge (my , now i 'll get

one of the roots of the word islam is submission islam

processes and all phenomena are manifestations of the mundane , i.e. ,
matter , energy , space and time. those who believe otherwise , albeit
some do not supplicate god , are not atheists.

manifestations of the mundane sounds rather transcendental to me. in fact
matter , energy , space and time are well measured but mysterious
concepts.

does an atheist really have to believe in your reductionism or be cast out as
not following the true faith \? !

rapture october 28 , 1992

what to do in case you miss the rapture

i. stay calm and do not panic

your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to
panic. but to do so is absolutely useless now. if you had wanted to get right
with god before the rapture , you could have , but you chose to wait. now your
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the
tribulation. but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be
saved. matthew 24 13

ii. realize you are now living during the great tribulation

the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of
the rapture until christ 's second coming. also know as the time of jacob 's
(israel 's) trouble (jere 30 7) and daniel 's seventieth week (dan 9) , this
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror.

iii. gather as many bibles as you can and hide them

soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community
(the revived roman empire) , bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will
be tantamount to treason. the bible , however , will be your most valuable
possession during the tribulation.

iv. read the bible like you have never read it before in your life

since all of your bibles may be confiscated , even if you are careful , it
is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can
quote them. it is especially important to read daniel , luke 21 , matthew 24 ,
revelation , and amos , for these books describe the events you can expect to
unfold before you.

v. pray like you have never prayed before in your life

pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you pray and pray
and pray. only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the
sake of christ.

vi. do not take the mark at any cost even in fit means you and your loved
ones die as martyrs

after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community , he
will institute a world economic system , designed so that you cannot buy , sell ,
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name. money will be
useless. and he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and
slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads , and that
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast ,
or the number of his name. here is wisdom. let him who has understanding
calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man his number
is 666 revelation 13 16 18.
the antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of
humanity. think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed
in the past , such as the holocaust.
or maybe the crusades \? m
you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrist 's
rule it will be much worse than anything in history (matt 24 21) ...i saw
under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and
for the testimony which they held. and a white robe was given to each of
them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer ,
until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren , who would be
killed as they were , was completed. revelation 6 9 , 11.
his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image
or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn ...and i saw the souls of
those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of
god , who had not worshiped the beast or his image , and had not received his mark
on their foreheads or on the hands. revelation 20 4. he will use every
form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ. nor
will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you , even your children ,
torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take
the mark.
if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image , however ,
you will be consigned to the second death , which is the lake of fire.
sung about so eloquently by johnny cash... m
you cannot be redeemed. it is better to endure torture for a short while and
gain eternal life then sic to endure eternal torment in the ring h h h h lake
of fire. ...if anyone worships the beast and his image , and receives his
mark on his forehead or on his hand , he himself shall also drink the wine of
the wrath of god , which is poured out full strength into the cup of his
indignation. an sic he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb. revelation
14 9 10

and probably in the presence of season ticket holders special hats given to
the first 5 , 000 at the stadium m

vii. set a plan in motion for survival

although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist 's government
until the end of the tribulation , all of the time you gain in hiding is
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening , since only those who are
extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake.
the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or
mountainous area , for the antichrist 's control will come last to the least
populated areas. take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation.
as you can see on the weather map , heavy currents of tribulation will sweep
into our area by daybreak. expect delays on i 95 outbound , and perhaps school
closings m
store water and food , because you will not be able to purchase anything without
the mark. water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood.
get a good water filter. m
bring different types of clothing for all seasons , as well as flashlights ,
batteries , generators , and first aid supplies. in short , learn how to
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did.

viii. trust no one

there will be secret agents everywhere , spying for the antichrist 's
government. be on the lookout.
perot supporters take note m

ix. watch for the antichrist

it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to ,
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it. we can infer from daniel
11 certain characteristics of this man. popular during the first three and a
half years of the tribulation , he will dominate the airwaves. he will be
physically appealing , highly intelligent , with christ like charisma and
personality. an international politician , military tactician and economic
expert , his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the jews , which
he will break after three and a half years. he will have such supernatural
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed. even the very elect will
be deceived. if you do not pray and read the bible , you too will be deceived.
dominate the airwaves \? perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh... m
the antichrist will have a companion , the false prohphet sic , who
will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak.
all who refuse to worhsip sic the image will be killed. the final three and
a half years will be absolutely insane , with demonized spirits everywhere.

x. do not give up hope !

the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of
christ. the antichrist will be defeated. be steadfast and endure , and you
will be rewarded greatly in heaven.
start reading the bible and praying fervently now. the salvation of
your sould depends upon it. determine that , come what may , you will not take
the mark or worship the antichrist. you still have a chance to be saved or
remain saved , but this time you will have to be faithful unto death.

may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious return !

the intent of my post (as i remember it) was to show that you cannot
argue against any religion (or ideology , for that matter) by the actions
of those who claim to be its followers. you have to look at the
teachings of the religion (or the principles of the ideology) itself .
there is no getting around this.

so to argue against islam , you have to go to the qur'an. bringing up
khomeini (or anyone else) is relevant to discussing khomeini , but not
necessarily relevant to discussing islam as a religion .

sorry , fred , but for the purposes under discussion here , i must
disagree. your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue
against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet empires , since
those did not represent true communism. in judging the practical
consequences of islam as a force to contend with in the world today ,
it is precisely the khomeini 's of the world , the rushdie fatwa
supporters , and perhaps more importantly , the reaction of the world
muslim community to those extremists , that we must look to. perhaps
unfortunately from your perspective , most people are not concerned
with whether islam is the right religion for them , or whether the
qur'an could be used as a guidebook for a hypothetical utopia , but how
islam affects the world around them , or what their lives might be like
if islam gains in influence. when i consider such possibilities , it
is with not inconsiderable fear.

important info it is humbly suggested by robert 's fans that you redirect all
followups into alt.fan.robert.mcelwaine , or at least consider doing so.



free energy technology
by robert e. mcelwaine , physicist

ninety to a hundred years ago , everybody knew that a
heavier than air machine could not possibly fly. it would
violate the laws of physics. all of the experts and
authorities said so.

for example , simon newcomb declared in 1901 the
demonstration that no possible combination of known
substances , known forms of machinery and known forms of
force , can be united in a practical machine by which man
shall fly long distances through the air , seems to the writer
as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any
physical fact to be.

fortunately , a few smart people such as the wright
brothers did not accept such pronouncements as the final
word. now we take airplanes for granted , (except when they
crash).

today , orthodox physicists and other scientists are
saying similar things against several kinds of 'free energy'
technologies , using negative terms such as pseudo science
and perpetual motion , and citing so called laws which
assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed ( 1st law
of thermodynamics ) and there is always a decrease in useful
energy ( 2nd law of thermodynamics ). the physicists do not
know how to do certain things , so they arrogantly declare
that those things cannot be done. such principles of
impotence are common in orthodox modern science and help to
cover up inconsistencies and contradictions in orthodox
modern theories.

free energy inventions are devices which can tap a
seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe , with
out burning any kind of fuel , making them the perfect
solution to the world wide energy crisis and its associated
pollution , degradation , and depletion of the environment.

most free energy devices probably do not create energy ,
but rather tap into existing natural energy sources by
various forms of induction. unlike solar or wind devices ,
they need little or no energy storage capacity , because they
can tap as much energy as needed when needed. solar energy
has the dis advantage that the sun is often blocked by
clouds , trees , buildings , or the earth itself , or is reduced
by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and
high latitudes. likewise , wind speed is widely variable and
often non existent. neither solar nor wind power are
suitable to directly power cars and airplanes. properly
designed free energy devices do not have such limitations.

for example , at least three u.s. patents ( 3 , 811 , 058 ,
3 , 879 , 622 , and 4 , 151 , 431) have so far been awarded for
motors that run exclusively on permanent magnets , seemingly
tapping into energy circulating through the earth 's magnetic
field. the first two require a feedback network in order to
be self running. the third one , as described in detail in
science mechanics magazine , spring 1980 , ( amazing
magnet powered motor , by jorma hyypia , pages 45 48 , 114 117 ,
and front cover) , requires critical sizes , shapes ,
orientations , and spacings of magnets , but no feedback. such
a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible
heatpump in one 's home , year round , for free. complete
descriptive copies of u.s. patents are 3.00 each from the
u.s. patent office , 2021 jefferson davis hwy. , arlington , va
22202 correct 7 digit patent number required. or try
getting copies of both the article and the patents via your
local public or university library 's inter library loan
dept..

a second type of free energy device , such as the 'gray
motor' (u.s. patent 3 , 890 , 548) , the 'tesla coil' , and the
motor of inventor joseph newman see science , 2 10 84 , pages
571 2. , taps electro magnetic energy by induction from
'earth resonance' (about 12 cycles per second plus
harmonics). they typically have a 'spark gap' in the circuit
which serves to synchronize the energy in the coils with the
energy being tapped. it is important that the total
'inductance' and 'capacitance' of the device combine to
'resonate' at the same frequency as 'earth resonance' in
order to maximize the power output. this output can also be
increased by centering the spark gap at the 'neutral center'
of a strong u shaped permanent magnet. in the case of a
tesla coil , slipping a 'toroid choke coil' around the
secondary coil will enhance output power. earth energy
fuelless propulsion power systems , by john bigelow , 1976 ,
health research , p.o. box 70 , mokelumne hill , ca 95245.

during the 1930 's , an austrian civil engineer named
viktor schauberger invented and partially developed an
'implosion turbine' (german name , 'zokwendle') , after
analyzing erosion , and lack of erosion , in differently shaped
waterways , and developing sophisticated mathematical
equations to explain it. as described in the book a
breakthrough to new free energy sources , by dan a. davidson ,
1977 , water is pumped by an impeller pump through a
logarithmic spiral shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a
critical velocity. the water then implodes , no longer
touching the inside walls of the tubing , and drives the pump ,
which then converts the pump 's motor into an electric
generator. the device seems to be tapping energy from that
of the earth 's rotation , via the 'coriolis effect' , like a
tornado. it can also neutralize gravity !

a fourth type of free energy device is the 'mcclintock
air motor' (u.s. patent 2 , 982 , 261) , which is a cross between
a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression
ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and
planetary gears). it burns no fuel , but becomes self running
by driving its own air compressor. this engine also
generates a lot of heat , which could be used to heat
buildings and its very high torque makes it ideal for large
trucks , preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.
david mcclintock is also the real original inventor of the
automatic transmission , differential , and 4 wheel drive.

crystals may someday be used to supply energy , as shown
in the star trek shows , perhaps by inserting each one between
metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of
particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a
common household smoke detector.

one other energy source should be mentioned here ,
despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of free
energy. a bulgarian born american physicist named joseph
maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic fusion
reactor which he calls 'migma' , which uses non radioactive
deuterium as a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantities
from sea water , does not produce radioactive waste , can be
converted directly into electricity (with out energy wasting
steam turbines) , and can be constructed small enough to power
a house or large enough to power a city. and unlike the
tokamaks and laser fusion monstrosities that we read about ,
migma works , already producing at least three watts of power
for every watt put in. new times (u.s. version) , 6 26 78 ,
pages 32 40.

and then there are the 'cold fusion' experiments that
have been in the news lately , originally conducted by
university of utah researchers b. stanley pons and martin
fleischmann. some u.s. navy researchers at the china lake
naval weapons center in california , under the direction of
chemist melvin miles , finally took the trouble to collect the
bubbles coming from such an apparatus , had them analyzed with
mass spectrometry techniques , and found helium 4 , which
proves that atomic fusion did indeed take place , and enough
of it to explain the excess heat generated.

there are good indications that the two so called laws
of thermodynamics are not so absolute . for example , the
late physicist dewey b. larson developed a comprehensive
general unified theory of the physical universe , which he
calls the 'reciprocal system' , (which he describes in detail
in several books such as nothing but motion (1979) and the
universe of motion (1984)) , in which the physical universe
has two distinct halves , the material half and an anti matter
half , with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing
between them , with out the heat death predicted by
thermodynamic laws . his theory explains the universe much
better than modern orthodox theories , including phenomena
that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching
their heads about , and is self consistent in every way. some
free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow ,
seemingly converting low quality energy into high quality
energy .

also , certain religious organizations such as 'sant mat'
and 'eckankar' teach their members that the physical universe
is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of
existence , like parallel universes , or analogous to tv
channels , as described in books like the path of the
masters , by dr. julian johnson , 1939 , and eckankar the key
to secret worlds , by sri paul twitchell , 1969. for example ,
the next level up from the physical universe is commonly
called the 'astral plane'. long time members of these groups
have learned to 'soul travel' into these higher worlds and
report on conditions there. it seems plausible that energy
could flow down from these higher levels into the physical
universe , or be created at the boundary between them , given
the right configuration of matter to channel it. this is
supported by many successful laboratory controlled
experiments in psycho kinesis throughout the world , such as
those described in the book psychic discoveries behind the
iron curtain .

in terms of economics , the market has failed. inventors
do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop
and mass produce free energy equipment , and the conventional
energy producer have no desire to do so because of their
ve ted intere t . the government is needed to intervene. if
the government does not intervene , then the total supply of
energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and
will soon run out , prices for energy will increase , and
pollution and its harmful effects (including the 'greenhouse
effect' , acid rain , smog , radioactive contamination , oil
spills , rape of the land by strip mining , etc.) will continue
to increase.

the government should subsidize research and development
of free energy by inventors and universities , subsidize
private production (until the producers can make it on their
own) , and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of
free energy hardware.

the long range effects of such government intervention
would be wide spread and profound. the quantity of energy
demanded from conventional energy producer (coal mining
companie , oil companie and countries , electric utilitie ,
etc.) would drop to near zero , forcing their employees to
seek work elsewhere. energy resources (coal , uranium , oil ,
and gas) would be left in the ground. prices for
conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero ,
while the price of free energy equipment would start out high
but drop as supply increases (as happened with vcr 's ,
personal computers , etc.). costs of producing products that
require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease ,
along with their prices to consumers. consumers would be
able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric
utility bills or buying home heating fuel. tourism would
benefit and increase because travelers would not have to
spend their money for gasoline for their cars. government
tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be
obtained in some other way. and energy could no longer be
used as a motive or excuse for making war.

many conventional energy producer would go out of
business , but society as a whole , and the earth 's environment
and ecosystems , would benefit greatly. it is the people ,
that government should serve , rather than the big
corporation and bank .

this was happening before the gulf war. why did n't we send in the bombers

nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet , east timor , or
some other places.

i do n't see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting
them to iraq.

tibetan people are rounded up , tortured , and executed. amnesty
international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china.

why are n't we stopping them \? in fact , why are we actively sucking up to
them by trading freely with them \?

tell me how we could stop them and i 'll support it. i , for one , do not
agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it.
i agree that it is deplorable.

fine. write to your congressman and to president clinton. china 's status as

the media is not totally monolithic. even though there is a prevailing
liberal bias , programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give
a balanced and fair reporting of the news. there are even conservative
sources out there if you know where to look. (hurrah for rush ! )

any idea how many kill files you just ended up in \?

i , an atheist , am arguing against killing innocent people.

you , a supposed christian , are arguing that it 's ok to kill innocent people
so long as you get some guilty ones as well.

hardly. i did n't say that it 's a good thing tm to kill innocent people
if the end is just. unfortunately , we do n't live in a perfect world and
there are no perfect solutions. if one is going to resist tyranny , then
innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die. i did n't say
it is ok it is unfortunate , but sometimes necessary.

the ends justify the means , eh \?

you , having criticised moral relativism in the past , are now arguing that i
am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the
war.

you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.

the same tired old misunderstanding. moral relativism means that there is no
objective standard of morality. it does n't mean you ca n't judge other
people 's morals. christ on a bike , how many times have we tried to hammer
that into your head \?

where 's your christian love \? where 's your absolute morality \? oh , how
quick you are to discard them when it suits you. as ivan stang would say ,
jesus would puke !

one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action
even this discourse in this forum. i understand the full ramifications of
that , and i am prepared to do so. i do n't believe that you can make the
same claim.

obviously not , as i am an atheist. i do n't think you 'd get on with jesus ,
though he was a long haired lunatic peace nik , was he not \?

and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was
because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being
so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
was n't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time. but in the gulf war ,
precision bombing was the norm. so the point was , why make a big
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted
in spite of precision bombing , when so many more civilians
(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing
in ww2 \?

right. unfortunately for you , it turned out that my opinions on the matter
were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too.

i think you 're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing
policy , too. you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets
and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door. as i
understand it , that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian
targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the
german people.

civilians suffer. but less civilians suffered in this war than
any other iany other in history !

oh , come on. with wars like the falklands fresh in people 's minds , that sort
of propaganda is n't going to fool anyone.

the stories
of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.
yes , bunk. the us lost 230 , 000 servicemen in ww2 over four years
and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting !

yes \? and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered \? it 's
hardly surprising the us did n't lose many men in ww2 , given that you turned
up late.

disagreement about its implications for issues far from essentials.

i 've already responded to the question of how a judgment might be made
between two people who in fact do disagree about islam , which does n't
presume anything about the qur'an other than its having sufficient
clarity for all important disputes about the basic principles of

disagreements about all issues relevant to islam.

this is the most unmitigated bilge i 've seen in a while. jim brown obviously
has possession of the right wing token.

diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective.

in december , former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski told a
senate committee that sanctions were costing iraq 100 million per day , and
that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world.
iraq , he suggested , was losing badly every day it defied the un demands ,
while the community of nations won every day with no taking of life or
loss of life. fcnl washington newsletter.

as i understand , that number is deceptive. the reason is that the money
cost was in non oil sales for the most part. iraq still is not allowed
to sell oil , or do many of the things under the initial sanctions , but
is still surviving.

and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was
because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being
so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
was n't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time. but in the gulf war ,
precision bombing was the norm.

bullshit ! ! ! in the gulf massacre , 7 of all ordnance used was smart. the
rest that 's 93 was just regular , dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. have
you forgotten that the pentagon definition of a successful patriot launch
was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage \? or that a
successful interception of a scud was defined as the patriot and scud
passed each other in the same area of the sky \?

of the 93 (i have heard figures closer to 80 , but i wo n't quibble your
figures) , most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by
enemy troops. a b 52 drops a lot of bombs in one sortie , and we used them
around the clock. not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb
munitions.

2. the patriot uses a proximity fuse. the adjusted figures for number
of patriot kills of ss 1 derivitives is 60 70 . that figure came
not from some fluke in the pentagon , but a someone working with such
stuff in another part of dod.

3. the statement precision bombing was the norm , is true around areas
where civilians were close to the target. we dropped by tonnage very
little bombs in populated regions , explaining the figures.

and of the 7 that was the smart stuff , 35 hit. again try to follow me
here that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed.

this figure , is far below all the other figures i have seen. if it
is indeed accurate , then how do you explain the discrepancy between
that figure , and other figures from international organizations \?
most figures i have seen place the hit ratio close to 70 , which is
still far higher than your 35 . or does your figure say a bomb
missed if the plane took off with it , and the bomb never hit the target ,
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped \? such methods
are used all the time to lie with statistics.

the stories
of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.

prove it. i have a source that says that to date , the civilian death count
(er , excuse me , i mean collateral damage ) is about 200 , 000.

i have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure. please
post the source so its reliability can be judged.

bbci was an example of an islamically owned and operated bank
what will someone bet me they were n't real islamic owners and
operators \? and yet it actually turned out to be a long running
and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often
quite naive depositors.

an islamic bank is something which operates in a different fashion to
your modern bank , as i have explained here (on another thread) before.
for example , islamic banks do n't pay fixed interests on deposits , but a
return on investments (which varies according to the market , and is not
fixed like interest is).

islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the islamic world.
there are no islamic banks in the west , including the usa , to my
knowledge. i doubt if the market for them exists there at least not
while islamic banks are at a relatively early stage of their
development as is the case now. bcci is most certainly not an islamic
bank did bcci ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits \? if the
answer to this question is yes , then bcci was not an islamic bank , as
islamic banks are specifically set up to not pay or charge interest.

whether some muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely
irrelevant.

occam 's razor is not a law of nature , it is way of analyzing an

it seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being
primitive , simple minded and unscientific , anti intellectual and
childish , and yet again condemned as being too complex (occam 's
razor) , the scientific explanation of things being much more
straightforeward and , apparently , simpler.

cute characterization bill however , there is no inconsistency between
the two statements. even if one believes that religion is primitive ,
simple minded and unscientific , anti intellectual and childish , one
can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of
complexity to the explanation. the ideas themselves do n't have to be
complex before being excised by occam 's razor , they only have to add
unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description.

adds no predictive capability to the system.

john e. king (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner

the modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be
treated as a matter of faith. francis hitching

i have a few points to make about the above posting.

1. science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either
real or alleged experts. critical reasoning , evidence and (if possible)
experimentation are necessary. creationists frequently display a massive
confusion about this by merely quoting both non experts and experts alike
(some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to
follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure. this strongly suggests
that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they
are aware of this fatal deficiency. of course , you may not actually be a
creationist and this may not be your real intent.

2. you have failed to identify hitching and the surrounding context of his
statement. why is that \? if hitching is a scientific illiterate then the
quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.
creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context
and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate
scientists. of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may
not be your real intent.

3. evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of
evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one
line quote from an unidentified nobody. it is also important to note that
disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate
claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck
proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid. creationists seem rather fond
of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy. of course , you may not
actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.

4. since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack
on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on
science. while the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (b ) the
fact of evolution will not ever go away. creationists lost the battle long
ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and
irrational to acknowledge the fact. of course , you may not actually be a
creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.


warren kurt vonroeschlaub (kv07@iastate.edu) asks

neither i , nor webster 's has ever heard of francis hitchings. who is he \?

i , like hitchings , am not to be found in webster 's b ). francis hitchings
is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the
part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ( the neck of
the giraffe ). in that publication he quotes a creationist (jean sloat morton)
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could
not have formed by chance. thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution
(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a non sequitur (i.e.
the conclusion does not follow ). pp 70 71 hitchings also misquotes richard
lewontin in an effort to support creationism. pp 84

hitchings book was reviewed by national park service ecologist david graber
in the los angeles times (and repeated in the oregonian). the article was
titled `giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far . excerpts include

francis hitchings is not a biologist. he goes after darwin like mark
antony after brutus. he flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and
pseudo science with the sinuosity of a snake oil salesman. he suggests
a mystical `organizing principle' of life , using the similarity of organs
in different creatures as evidence sic .

note that the last statement above is actually evidence for evolution not
against it. if john e. king is quoting from this reviewed book it would n't
surprise me much. it 's also interesting that king had nothing to add (i.e.
he only posted a quote).

imnsho , abortion is the womans choice. homosexual sex is the choice of

this leaves capital punishment. i oppose capital punishemnt because

as far as poplulation control , i think contraception and education are

i would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an

punishment , i'm sorry but the logic escapes me.

that 's because you are again making the assumption that all atheists

i agree that faith and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily
applied to god and religion. it takes both faith and dogma to
expect the sun to come up every morning , but there is overwhelming
reason every single day , day in and day out , for everyone to put
his faith and dogma there. not so with the christian religion.

a great many satanists do not believe in satan. some do , some
do n't. i 'd go so far as to assert that most orthodox satanists
do not worship satan (church of satan , etc.) but rather worship
self. to hear lavey say it , only idiots and fools believe in satan
and or allah. he knew that suckers are born every minute.

maximus 2.01wb

anton lavey 's interpretation of satanism has always puzzled me. i
read his satanic bible a few years ago for a social studies project ,
as well as a book by arthur lyons called the cult of devil worship
in america. the latter included a very interesting interview with
the black pope in which he did indeed say that satan was merely an
instrument for one to realize the self.

when i refer to satanism , i am referring to the mishmash of rural satanic
ritualism and witchcraft which existed before the church of satan. i
do n't consider lavey 's church to be at all orthodox , nor do i consider
its followers satanists. lavey combined the philosophies of nietzsche ,
crowley , and reich , slapped in some religious doctrine , added a little
touch of p.t. barnum , and christened his creation the church of satan.
no doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention...i
suppose he could have just as easily called it the church of free sex.

at any rate , it worked (for a while). in its heyday , the church had a
huge following , including such hollywood celebrities as sammy davis , jr.
and jayne mansfield. (i have a picture of lavey with sammy , by the
way.)

i find the idea of a satanist not believing in satan about as credible as
a christian not believing in christ. but if you include the church of
satan , then i suppose i need to alter my definition. webster 's dictionary
and the american heritage dictionary will have to do the same.

well , that is certainly different , but it looks as if there is a translation

i thought about this , too some translations refer to only the latter
two objects being in orbit , but bucaille 's translation seems to indicate
the night and the day travelling in orbit too. perhaps this can be
understood when one looks at it from the earth 's reference frame from
this reference frame , the day and the night would appear to orbit the
earth (travelling from east to west). (this is from the reference frame
when the earth is still.)


well , yes , but that belongs in the other group , there is a interpretation
found for everything. however , allowing any form of interpretation reduces
the information of the text so interprteted to zero.

by the way , i have checked the quote and i think the lines preceding those
quoted above are more interesting

21 32 where mountains are set on earth in order to immobilize the earth.
21 33 where the skies (heavens \? ) are referred to as well supported.

the lines given above are 21 34 after my edition.


maybe this is what is meant by the above.... \? it 's just a possibility.

and that the sun travels in an orbit without saying that earth does , too ,
sounds geocentric to me.

if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that \? what
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally
mandated morality \? pardon the extremism , but could n't i murder your
brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was
doing what felt good , did n't want anyone forcing their morality on me ,
or i do n't follow your morality \?

i believe that morality is subjective. each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes. mine are not a priori more correct than someone
elses. this does not mean however that i must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority.

why \? how \? might makes right \? how can they force their morality on me \? why
ca n't i do what i want \? who are they to decide \? what if i disagree \?


well i agree with you in the sense that they have no moral right to inflict
these rules , but there is one thing i might add at the very least , almost
everybody wants to avoid pain , and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a
herd morality , then so be it.


most criminals do not see their behavior as moral. the may realize that
it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral
system but being immoral.

good point , but it is being immoral in our opinion. we do n't let them choose ,
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.

right , and since they grew up and learned around us , they have some idea of our
right and wrong , which i think must , in part , be incorporated. very rarely do
you see criminal behaviour for philosophical reasons



for someone to lay claim to an alternative
moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be
internally consistent. some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense

i admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense , but have little basis
for it as of yet. how far can such a concept be extended \?


(stuff deleted)

do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but
not him. after all , he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
chose. on what basis do we condemn other societies besides , here 's the buzz
words , on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all
societies \?

holding that morality is subjective does not mean
that we must excuse the murderer.

why not \? do we have to be objective suddenly \?

1)who is society
2)how do they define what is acceptable \?
3)how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position \?
mac

wow ! you got me thinking now !

this is an interesting question in that recently there has been a
move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal
activities as ok. in the past it seems to me there were always two
coexisting methods of social control.

first (and most explicit) is legal control. that is the set of
actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set
of punishments.

secondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control. these are
the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered
by legal control , are scrictly controled by social censure. ideally (if
socialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed
since most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of
social censure.

the control manifests itself in day to day life as guilt and
morality . i 've heard it said (and fully believe) that if it were n't for
the vast majority of people policing themselves , legal control would be
absolutely impossible.

lately (last 50 , 100 years \? ) however there has been a move to
attempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ai n't
illegal , then do n't pick on me). i'm not saying this is wrong , merely
that it is a byproduct of a society which has

1) a high education level ,
2) a high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media ,
3) a high level of institutionalized individual rights , and
4) a me oriented culture.

i guess what i'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition ,
here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can
ca n't allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness , yet we
are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as
those freedoms do n't impinge on another 's.

imho society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here. while we
appreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old
territoriality and dominance instincts) , the removal of socialized ,
inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the
continued destabilization of society.

i got no quick fix. i have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this
mess. i know i would never consent to the roll back of personal freedoms
in order to stabilize society. yet i believe development of societies
follow a darwinian process which selects for stability. can we find a
social model which maximizes indiv. freed. 's yet is stable \? perhaps it is
possible to live with a non stable society \?

anybody see a way out \? comments \?

ps. therefore answer to question 3 we do n't. do we want to \?

i disagree with these. what society thinks should be irrelevant. what the
individual decides is all that is important.

this does n't seem right. if i want to kill you , i can because that is what i
decide \?

1)who is society

i think this is fairly obvious

not really. if whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok , there are
always some in the society who disagree with the mandates , so which
societal mandates make the standard for morality \?

2)how do they define what is acceptable \?

generally by what they feel is right , which is the most idiotic policy i can
think of.

so what should be the basis \? unfortunately i have to admit to being tied at
least loosely to the feeling , in that i think we intuitively know some things
to be wrong. awfully hard to defend , though.

3)how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position \?

by thinking for ourselves.

i might agree here. just because certain actions are legal does not make them
moral .

no wonder that we do n't see any detail for this claim. it is good to

mr. roseneau , i have little patience with people who tell me what i

agnostic.


i am extremely wary of the way you use words. like in this case , there
are broader definitions of gods used by persons who are considered by
themselves and others theists. i have pointed to that in my post. you
use one of them.

your use of definitions seems to rest on the assumption because my
moral is objective absolute or the other buzz words you are so fond
of , everybody will know it , and there is no need to define it more
exactly.

and as a user has shown recently , the easiest way to dispell you is
to ask you for definitions.


you are of course , free to speculate on my motives for objecting
to seeming irrational bigotry if you wish , but the flaws which i

obituary for the late atheist dr. albert sabin. in an old interview
rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time
a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.
he admitted to having cried out to god while critically ill and on a
respirator. as it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.
after his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. do n't say
it could n't happen to you , or that it has n't happened to others , even if
you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this.
people are different. i admire dr. sabin for admitting his human weakness
in that instance. i would not think less of asimov for similar weakness.

nevertheless i agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may
well be untrue. in any case they are not evidence for anything besides
the power of early indoctrination and human frailty.

alarming amounts of agreement deleted )

i made my statement about ockums razor from my experiences in physics.
thanks for info in baysian statistics very interesting and i did n't
know it before. i follow your proof , but i have one questions. we have
two hypotheses h and hg the latter is more complicated , which by
definition means p(h) p(hg).

that ( complicated ) is n't in fact where p(h) p(hg) comes from it 's more
the other way around. it 's from

p(h) p(hg) p(hg') where g' is the complement of g

and by axiom , p(anything) 0 , so p(hg') 0 , so p(h) p(hg).

in a sense , hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g ,
so i may be splitting hairs , but what i'm trying to say is that irrespective
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is , p(h) p(hg)
holds , with equality if and only if p(hg') 0.

as you point out , it 's a very simple matter to show p(x h) p(x hg)
p(h x) p(hg x) , and thus h is to be preferd to hg. now to say
that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say p(x h) p(x hg).
can you elaborate some on this.

well , p(x a) p(x b) means that x is as likely to be observed if a is
operative as it is if b is operative. this implies that observing x does not
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between
the respective possibilities that a and b are operative the difference
reduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior
probabilities p(a) and p(b)

p(x a) p(x b)

p(a x) k p(a) , and p(b x) k p(b)

where k p(x a) p(x) p(x b) p(x).

so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x
does n't give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative.

in the particular case where a h and b hg , however , we know that their
prior probabilities are ordered by p(h) p(hg) , although we do n't know
the actual values , and it 's this which allows us to deploy the razor to
throw out any such hg.

also , in the real world it is n't as clear cut and dry it seems
to me. we ca n't always determine whether the equality p(x h)
p(x hg) is true.

that 's certainly true , but the particular point here was whether or
not a `divine component' actually underlies the prevalence of religion
in addition to the memetic transmission component , which even the religious
implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word'.

now it seems to me , as i 've said , that the observed variance in religious
belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model , but rather
less well if one proposes a `divine component' in addition , since i would
expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual
exclusion among beliefs. thus my personal feeling is that p(x hg) is n't
even equal to p(x h) in this case , but is smaller (h is memetic transmission ,
g is `divine component' , x is the variance among beliefs). but i happily
acknowledge that this is a subjective impression.

btw , my beef with your baysian argument was not a mathematical one
i checked most of your work and did n't find an error and you seem very
careful so there probably is n't a math mistake . i think the mistake
is philosophical. but just to make sure i understand you , can please
rephrase it in non technical terms \? i think this is a reasonable
request i always try to look for ways of explaining physics to
non physicist. i'm not a baysian statistician (nor any type of
statistician) , so this would be very helpful.

not that i'm a statistician as such either , but

the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of
the (read `my') observations to date. however , theism (of the type with
which i am concerned) also suggests that , for instance , prayer may be
answered , people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable
to statistical verification) and that god s may generally intervene in
measurable ways.

this means that these regions of the space of possible observations ,
which i loosely termed appearances of god s , have some nonzero
probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.

since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to
scatter around over the observation space , the probability which theism
expends on making appearances of god s possible must come from somewhere
else (i.e. other possible observations).

all else being equal , this means that an observation which is n't an
appearance of god s must have a slightly higher probability under
atheism than under theism. the bayesian stuff implies that such
observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of
the atheistic hypothesis to increase , with a corresponding decrease
in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.

sorry if that 's still a bit jargonesque , but it 's rather difficult to
put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on the properties
of conditional probability densities , and particularly that the total
area under them is always unity.

an analogy may (or may not ) be helpful. say that hypothesis a is the
coin is fair , and that b is the coin is unfair (two headed) . (i 've
used a and b to avoid confusion with h heads and t tails .)

then

p(h a) 0.5 total 1
p(t a) 0.5

p(h b) 1 total 1
p(t b) 0

the observations are a string of heads , with no tails. this is compatible
with both a fair coin (a) and a two headed coin (b). however , the probability
expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they
do n't actually appear) must come from somewhere else , since the total must
be unity , and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance
of heads.

say our running estimates at time n 1 are e n 1 (a) and e n 1 (b). the
observation x n at time n is another head , x n h. the estimates are
modified according to

p(h a)
e n (a) e n 1 (a) e n 1 (a) m
p(h)

and

p(h b)
e n (b) e n 1 (b) e n 1 (b) 2m
p(h)

now we do n't know p(h) , the actual prior probability of a head , but
the multiplier for e(a) is half that for e(b). this is true every time
the coin is tossed and a head is observed.

thus whatever the initial values of the estimates , after n heads , we have

n
e n (a) m e 0 (a)

and
n
e n (b) (2m) e 0 (b) ,

and since e k (a) e k (b) 1 at any time k , you can show that 0.5 m 1
and thus 1 2m 2. hence the estimate for the fair coin hypothesis a must
decrease at each trial and that for the two headed coin hypothesis b must
increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.

the loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism , and between fair
coin and theism , with observations consistent with both. a tail , which
would falsify unfair coin , is analogous to an appearance of god s ,
which would falsify atheism. i am not claiming that the analogy extends
to the numerical values of the various probabilities , just that the principle
is the same.

constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them

is at all possible under the respective theisms , constantly increases

the notional estimated probability that they do n't exist ,

it 's important to draw a distinction between theism that could
be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that ca n't.
given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible ,
it does n't make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary
view.

quite so , but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg ,
in terms of our ockham 's razor discussion , and i 'd bin it on those grounds.

so it depends upon your conception of this god. if it 's a conception
like zeus , who happened to come down to earth to play quite
frequently , then i agree with you lack of evidence for this conception
of god is evidence that it does not exist. but if your conception
of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions (see below
on falsifiable predictions ) , then i disagree lack of evidence
does not support a disbelief.

the hypotheses do n't have to be falsifiable , and indeed in my `model' ,
the theism is n't falsifiable.

...

i used the phrase should obverse . given any specific 'x' theism
does not make the prediction p(x ht) 0 . that 's why i used the
word should theism makes no predictions about any specific event.
i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such
and such happens , or i believe god will do such and such. but
for any given 'x' i can never , a priori , say p(x ht) 0. i can
not even say this for the set of all 'x' or some 'x'. this is what
do n't like about your use of probability. we also have no way of
assigning these probabilities i hold science to positivistic
criteria if someone cannot tell me how to measure , even in principle ,
p(x h) , then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h. such
is the case when h ht (theistic) and ha (atheistic). for example ,
p(x ha) p(x ha) p(ha). what is p(ha) \? ! \? how do i measure it \?

you do n't have to. we do n't need , in the above analogy , to know any
prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the
fair coin hypothesis is less than unity , and that the corresponding
multiplier for the two headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.
you do n't need to know the initial values of the running estimates
either. it 's clear that after a large number of observations , p(fair coin)
approaches zero and p(two headed coin) approaches unity.

all you need to know is whether p(x ha) is larger than p(x ht) for
observed x , and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain
events rendered possible (not necessary) under ht which are not possible
under ha , and all else is equal.

baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations. but
what if the hypothesis is n't amenable to observation \? and even for
statements that are amenable to observation , some observations are
not relevant a sequence of observations must be chosen with care.
i'm curious to know what types of observations x 1 , x 2 , ... you have
in mind concerning theism and atheism.

any observations you like it really does n't matter , nor affect the
reasoning , provided that there are some possible observations which
would count as appearances of god s . examples of this might be
a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer , or of the veracity of
revelation.

but any statement about p(x h) for general x still counts as a
prediction of h. if the theism in question , ht , says that prayer may
be answered , or that miracles may happen (see my interpretation , quoted
again above , of what `god exists' means) , then this is a prediction ,
p(x ht) 0 for such x. it 's what distinguishes it from the atheist
hypothesis ha , which predicts that this stuff does not happen , p(x ha)
0 for such x.

theism does not make the claim that p(x ht) 0 for such x .
or i should say that my theism does n't. maybe i was too quick to
say we had a common language. you said that by the existence of god
you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by
christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents .
i agreed with this. however , i must be careful here. i believe
this i'm not making any claims. maybe i should have changed does
to can there is an important shift of emphasis. but any way ,
since i only have a belief , i cannot conclude p(x ht) 0 for
such x .

ok , we 'll downgrade does interact to may interact , which would
actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which
we both agree is misplaced.

i do n't think my theism makes predictions . maybe i'm not
understanding what you mean by prediction could you explain what
you mean by this word \?

i 'll explain , but bear in mind that this is n't central all i require of
a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of god s will
never happen , as does atheism. (before somebody points out that quantum
mechanics does n't make this prediction either , the difference is that
qm and atheism do not form a partition.)

predictions include such statements as prayer is efficacious (implying
if you do the stats , you will find that prayer is efficacious ) , or prayer
is not efficacious , or verily i say unto you , this generation shall not
pass , till all these things be fulfilled. i do n't think we have any problems
of misunderstanding here.

persistent observation of this stuff not happening , consistent with
ht though it may be , is more consistent with ha , as explained in the
bayesian stats post.

even if ht ( god exists ) is unfalsifiable , that 's
no problem for my argument , other than that you have to let the number
of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically.

btw , i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of
observations as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid.
we , as existing humans , can never make an infinite number of measurments
and any conclusion that reilies on this i do n't accept as valid.

that 's fine i do n't claim that theism is false , merely that the finite
number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is , and
that as i continue to observe , the suggestion looks better and better.

renormalization stuff deleted

in the bayesian stats post , i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable
in a finite number of observations. here 's the relevant quote

the important assumption is that there are some observations which
are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist
hypothesis , and thus would falsify atheism these are what i called
`appearances of god s' , but this need not be taken too literally. any
observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods
exist will count. all other observations are assumed to be compatible
with both hypotheses. this leaves theism as unfalsifiable , and atheism
as falsifiable in a single observation only by such `appearances of
god s'.

here is my problem with this. for something to be falsifiable it
must make the prediction that 'x' should not be seen. if 'x' is
seen then the hypothesis has been falsified. now , atheism is a word
in oposition to something theism. a theism aserts a belief and an
atheism aserts a disbelief. so there are certain atheisms that are
certainly falsifiable just as there are certain theisms that are
falsifable (e.g. if my theism asserts the world is only 6 , 000 years
old and that god does not decieve then this has been falsified). however ,
the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also
unfalsifiable. i could be wrong on this statment ...contd

i think you are an appearance of god s is sufficient to falsify
atheism , whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.

i 'll think more about it. until then , here is a general question.
suppse x were unfalsifiable. is not(x) also unfalsifiable \?

no by way of a counterexample , let x the coin is fair , or more
accurately (so that not(x) makes sense) the two sides of the coin are
different . this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of
heads is consistent with a fair coin , and you have to go to an infinite
number of tosses to falsify x in the limit. its converse is falsifiable ,
and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.

this is partly what 's wrong with you baysian argument which
requires observations x 1 ... x n to be made. there are simply
no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the
statement god exists . now , by use of your symmetry argument , i
can understand why someone would say since the statement
'god does not exist'

makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it. but none
the less this would be founded on a type of faith or if you do n't
like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable
evidence instead.

i 'll assume you meant `god exists' up there at the highlight. but by our
agreed definition of exists , the statement makes predictions as i said
above , although it is n't falsifiable in a finite number of observations.

actually , i mean 'god does not exist' makes no predictions.

oops. sorry. mea culpa.

the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are
refering to. but i can think of some conceptions of god for which
it is true. but once again i'm open to the posibility that i could
be wrong. so give me some examples of predictions of the statment
god does not exist . here is one that i can think of. if true , then
there would be no healing or miricles. but this can in principle never
be determined one way or the other. there are cases in which people
seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no
known reason. these situations do in fact happen. they are consistent
with a theistic hypothesis , but in no way support such a hypothesis.

we agree here.

they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis. i ca n't
think of one prediction from 'god does not exist' that is n't of
this type. but i might be missing something.

the rapture will not happen on october 28 1992. said rapture would have
falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened , although its failure
to happen does not , of course , falsify any theisms other than those which

simple logic arguments are folly. if you read the bible you will see
that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic .
our ability to reason is just a spec of creation. yet some think it is
the ultimate. if you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now.

your argument is of the type you 'll know once you try .
yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried , and believed
for many years , but were eventually honest enough to admit that
they had lived in a virtual reality.


obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe. so .. \?

so nothing. it may work for some , but not for others it does n't give any
insight into an overall god or overall truth of a religion it would seem to be
dependent solely on the individual , as well as individually created. and since
christians have failed to show us how there way of life is in any wy better
than ours , i do not see why the attempt to try it is necessary , or even
particularly attractive.


to learn you must accept that which you do n't know.

what does this mean \? to learn you must accept that you do n't know
something , right o. but to learn you must accept something i do n't
know , why \? this is not the way i prefer to learn. it is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read. suppose i write a book telling
how the great invisible pink unicorn (tm) has helped me in my
daily problems , would you accept this , since you ca n't know whether
it is true or not \?


no one asks you to swallow everything , in fact jesus warns against it. but let
me ask you a question. do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for
that matter anything in school. i mean it 's just what other people have told
you and you do n't want to swallow what others say. right ... \?

well , we will nerver know for sure if we were told the truth or not , but at the
very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that , say , there
was a military conflict in vietnam 25 years ago , then there is a supernatural
diety who wants us to live a certain way. the fact that jesus warned against
it means nothing. i warn against it too. big deal.


the life , death , and resurection of christ is documented historical fact.

this is not true. the first two choices here (life and death) are scantily
documented , and the last one is total malarky unless one uses the bible , and
that is totally circular. perhaps it be better to use the imagination , or
one 's ignorance. someone else will address this i'm sure , and refer you to
plenty of documentation...

as much
as anything else you learn. how do you choose what to believe and what not to \?
i could argue that george washington is a myth. he never lived because i do n't
have any proof except what i am told. however all the major events of the life
of jesus christ were fortold hundreds of years before him. neat trick uh \?

how is this \? there is nothing more disgusting than christian attempts to
manipulate interpret the old testament as being filled with signs for the
coming of christ. every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is
autmoatically interpreted as the cross. what a miscarriage of philology.


there is no way to get into a sceptical heart. you can not say you have given a
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have. you must trust , not just go
to church and participate in it 's activities. were you ever willing to die for what
you believed \?

well , since we have skeptical hearts (thank goodness , ) there is no way to get
into us. here we have the irreconcilable difference christians glorify
exactly what we tend to despise or snub trust belief faith without knowledge.
if i am lucky one day and i happen to be thinking of god at the same time my
enkephalins go up , then i may associate this as a sign of god (it will feel
right , and i will trust without knowing). maybe. religosity does not seem to
be anything that is conclusively arrived at , but rather it seems to be more of
a sudden affliction...
i believe many of us were willing to die for what we believed , many of us were
not. the question is , is suchg an attitude reflective of a correct or
healthy morality. it would seem not to be. the same thing could reflect
fanaticism , for example , and is any case an expression of simple selfishness.

christianity is a higher logic. athiest like u will not be able

we understand the higher logic in god .

so i asked him , so what is this higher logic \?

his answer , i do n't know.

this , the posting above highlights one of the worst things about
xtainity. it is abundantly clear to both atheists xtains that
their believe is both illogical irrational. their tactics , therefore
to disregard logic rationality altogether. silly excuses such as
the ones above and those such as , how can u trust science , science
was invented by man ! , only goes to further show the weakness of
their religion.

in my country where xtainity was and still is rapidly growing , xtains
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses.
they know it would be a fruitless act , given the irrational nature
of their faith.
they would wait until a person is in distress , then they would comfort
him her and addict them to their emotional opium.

never in my life had i met a person who converted to xtainity coz it 's
reasonable . rationality has no place in xtainity (see xtian arguement

i do n't think so. although some forms of execution are painful (the electric
chair looks particularly so) , i think the pain is relatively short lived.
drawing and quartering , on the other hand , looks very painful , and the
victim would n't die right away (he 'd bleed to death , i 'd imagine).
ah , so a cruel punishment is not just if it is painful , as you
origionally stated. it is about long term pain , eg non short lived.
why this sudden chance in your stance \?

i do n't think i 've changed my stance at all. my original stance was that
a painless execution was not a cruel one. i did n't say what would be
considered cruel , only that a painless death was n't. now , cruelty must
involve some sort of suffering , i believe. i do n't think someone that gets
shot in the head or electrocuted really suffers very much. even a hanging
probably produces one sharp instance of pain , but it 's over so quickly...

hmmmmm \?

pardon \?

could it be that a counter example has been made , which renders your
previous stance null and void \? why do n't you admit that your previous stance
is incorrect \? or , if you somehow managed to slip up , and misstated your
origional stance , why not admit it \?

no. well , again i stated that a painless death is n't cruel , but i do n't
think i stated that all painful executions are cruel. i think that some
are cruel , depending on the nature and duration of the pain.

by the way , how long is too long \?

anything more than an instant , i guess. any death by suffocation
asphyxiation , or blood loss would be cruel , i think (this includes the
gas chamber , and drawing and quartering). i 'd say that any pain that
lasts , say , over twenty seconds or so would be too long (but this may
be an arbitrary cutoff , i suppose).

(a) most of the people i debate disagree with my premises. hardly debate
otherwise.

your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged
more than once. when i did it , you said , good question , and did not
address it.

i 've addressed it (your caricature is not my favourite point , needless

eric rescorla.

(b) there 's little point in responding the same points everywhere i do

you still repeat that point.

i do \? curious , since i believe that was the first time i 've ever made it.
not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability
to understand you ask me the same question , i 'll give you the same
answer , especially when in this case , i know the answer to be true. i
do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply , but if everyone is
making the same points , and i'm pushed for time , then i try to respond what i
believe are the strongest formulations of those points. if that does n't
include your post , tough this is usenet , and life is tough all over.

(c) since there 's a great deal of responses this is n't always feasible i
do my best to honestly answer questions put to me.

you drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others. you appear
with the same issue every n months , and start the dicussion at the beginning
again.

i 've only debated this issue twice in a.a , and occasionally in t.a. the
first was in response to simon clippingdale 's positive assertion that
disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals
are relative. it does n't. now , simon has dropped out of the debate
for some time i take that to mean that he is either busy , or bored
with the topic. i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty. do you \?

(d) i ca n't always understand what you say

neither ca n't i understand you all the time. usually , one asks what the other
side means.

usually , one does. usually you 're clear , but sometimes you are n't
and i ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight
and i feel that i'm debating against line noise. sometimes i get tired , and
sometimes i have other things i 'd rather do. again , this is usenet , and
life is tough all over. you 're going to have to deal with it.

(e) you 're starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name
in the hat in future.

that 's supposed to be a threat \?

no , that 's a simple statement , and an assertion that i am not answerable
to those who offer me baseless insults. for example , those who accuse me
of lying about my personal beliefs , while also complaining that i do n't answer
their questions.

like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there.
if only everything would be so easy.

what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there.
because to all intents and purposes , it is there.
we had that argument. for one , your claim that everyone senses it
is not founded , and you have been asked to give evidence for it often.
and then , the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it
is there unless evidence against it has been found.

i have no problem with the second statement. i have provided an
argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable the
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey , and was offered
by some other people too essentially , that people disagree about
fuzzy concepts such as freedom. it 's a good point , and i'm thinking
about it.

your trick is to say , i feel a is not right , and so do many i know ,
therefore a is absolutely right. it neglects the possibility that
these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process ,
restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject
of that process. in other words , refutes it. you make the ontological
claim , you have to prove it.

nonsense. my trick is to say i feel that a is better than b and so
does almost any disinterested person i ask. best evidence is therefore
that a really is better than b , subject to the assumption that we
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b , and
that the resulting system of values is self consistent.

now get this really is better is an idealisation , a fictional model ,
in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model. it
may or may not correspond to something true. it is nonetheless a useful
assumption . far more useful than the equally assumed relativist
trick , to wit

i feel that a is better than b , and so does almost any disinterested person
i ask. however , if even one person disagrees that a is better than b ,
or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b ,
then it is the case that b is better than a for that person , and nothing
more can be said.

i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority
seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to
maximise b (e.g. a terrorist). to do that would be to claim that
a supermajority 's carefully considered morality would be better than the
terrorist 's which would , of course , be true , but a no no for an ethical
relativist. to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is
simply weasel words , and an example of compartmentalisation to rival
anything in the world of religion.

for a similar argument , i sense morality is subjective , it does not
hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by
others.

if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively
wrong , and it turns out not to be the case for you of course this
is possible. it is neither evidence for subjectivism , nor evidence
against objectivism (except sometimes , in a pragmatic sense).

it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to
judgements is absolute. and as long as you do n't provide evidence for
that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to
believe your hypothesis.

i 've done this freedom , with the proviso that i still have to
answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no
objective meaning.

further , in order to make morality absolute , universal , or objective ,
you would have to show that it is independent of humans , or the attributes
above look quite misleading.

not really. what evidence is there that anything exists independently
of humans \? you 'll be hard pressed to find any that is n't logically
equivalent when applied to values.

an analogous set of premises would be

premise 1 some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest
route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance
of the estate , and down the malahide road.

premise 2 i checked it out , and found that the shortest route from my
which is much closer.

you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my
house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim ,
using premises which are logically no different.


no. morals are a matter of belief so far. the people still believe that the
shortest way is through the main entrance. no agreement on belief here.
and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a
shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it
is the shortest way indeed. in other words , your analogy works only when
one assumes that your premises are right in the first place. if not , it is
a fallacy.

and if this were an argument for objectivism , you 'd be right. it is n't ,
though , it 's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument
against objectivism , nor argument for relativism. your gimmick is to
assume in the first place that values are n't real , and to use this to prove
that values are n't real. in other words , you beg the question against me.

famous sermon was of cosmic simplicity bob standing on the stage with his
hands in his pockets , smoking , looking around and saying nothing. heated

pain.
rather , it must be a different meaning.

i do n't think so. although some forms of execution are painful (the electric
chair looks particularly so) , i think the pain is relatively short lived.
drawing and quartering , on the other hand , looks very painful , and the

i replied to this query via e mail , but i think there are some
issues that are worth discussing in public.

mta (mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu) wrote
i am doing research on atheism , part of which involves field research here
on the net. the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief.

i would recommend you to take a look at

1) your dictionary
2) alt.atheism faq files

to notice that atheism is not a belief system , and what is common
to all atheists is not a belief , but a lack of belief in deities .
i cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without
paying careful attention to this issue.

first of all , i 've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail it 's possible to give
succinct answers to most everything , but there 's enough here to keep most of
you typing for hours , i'm sure.

imho , this is a poor method to do any real survey , although i'm sure the
replies might keep you amused for hours.

also , i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system
although i know some of you might contend that you do n't have any beliefs
, but
are skeptical towards everything. i understand but you know what i mean.
think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases
required to get the precise idea across.

no , i do not know what you mean. if you are surveying our individual
philosophies , fine , but that 's not strictly atheism. atheism is not
just another , godless version of the theistic explanations for life ,
the universe and everything. it is not a belief system , and it could
hardly be called a philosophical system.

once more atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities.
do not twist the meaning , or assume that we have some kind of
philosophy we all agree on.

some comments on your questions

what contact with other atheists have you had before and after (and during)
your conversion to atheism \? (certainly your involvement with alt.atheism
counts how have net discussions affected your beliefs \? )

i would also like to hear more about this. have we been able to 'convert'
anyone \?

are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
means (proofs of the non existence of god , etc) , or was it perhaps , at least
in part , through other means (alienation from mainstream religion , etc) \?

this question contains a contradiction in terms. beliefs
cannot be acquired rationally if they could , they would not be
beliefs ! you also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become
atheists those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily
become atheists , they just think very little about religion. it seems
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities.

those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question
quite odd how can lack of belief be acquired \? when did i acquire
lack of belief in the easter bunny \? (i did believe in santa , though ))

to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your
beliefs \? what phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything
from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human
affairs) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where
are they lacking as an explanatory method \?

this question does not make any sense , since atheism does not deal with
these issues it is not a worldview , or a philosophy , or a belief system.

sigh , why have n't i seen a good , well thought survey in the usenet
for three years... and what is the point of doing surveys in the net ,
anyway \? just to abstract some opinions \?

faith and dogma are inevitable. christians merely understand and admit
to the fact. give me your proof that no god exists , or that he does.
whichever position you take , you are forced to do it on faith. it does
no good to say you take no position , for to show no interest in the
existence of god is to assume he does not exist.

absolutely not true. without religion either an established one or
one you invent for yourself the theist and atheist are equally
(not) interested in god , because without religious revelation there
is no information about god available. strip away the dogma and
the theists atheists are no different , simply holding a different
opinion on a matter of little practical importance.

i contend that proper implementation of the christian faith requires
reasoning , but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you
do n't like , or find uncomfortable. hedonistic sexual behavior is
condemned in the bible and no act of true reason will make it any
less condemned. hatred , murder , gossip all these are condemned.
is there god ordained murder in the bible \? you bet , and if god ever
orders me to kill you , i will. but i will first use the gideon like
behavior of verifying that god actually ordered the hit , and will
probably discuss it in an abram like fashion.

whether it is god or satan with whom you are speaking \?

i can hear you now , this is how jim jones and david koresh justify

when the southern baptist church or the methodist church begin to do this

hi everyone ,
i'm a commited christian that is battling with a problem. i know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds , yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless , saying' you fools ,
do you still think that just believing is enough \? '

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by god , according to romans that person is still saved by there faith.
but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to
him (i.e. does n't know him condemned) so a lukewarm christian someone who
knows and believes in god but does n't make any attempt to live by the bible.

now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)
as taught in romans , but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james
in conjunction with the lukewarm christian being 'spat out'

can anyone help me , this really bothers me.

tgk@cs.toronto.edu (todd kelley) writes
in light of what happened in waco , i need to get something of my
chest.

faith and dogma are dangerous.

religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma , and
for that reason , i scorn religion.

i do n't necessarily disagree with your assertion , but i disagree with
your reasoning. (faith bad. dogma bad. religion (faith dogma).
religion (bad bad). religion bad.) unfortunately , you never
state why faith and dogma are dangerous.

if you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in
waco , you are missing the point.

the branch davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the
messenger. they believed koresh was a prophet , and therefore believed
everything he said. the problem was n't the religion , it was the
followers. they did n't die because of faith and dogma , they died because
of their zealotry (or , in the case of the children , the zealotry of their
parents).

i have expressed this notion in the past. some christians debated
with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning. i claimed
rationality is quelled out of christianity by faith and dogma.

so christians are totally irrational \? irrational with respect to their
religion only \? what are you saying \? one 's belief in a christian god does
not make one totally irrational. i think i know what you were getting at ,
but i 'd rather hear you expand on the subject.


a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind ,
whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and dogma present
in any religion.

again , this statement is too general. a christian is perfectly capable of
being a philosopher , and absolutely capable of changing his her mind. faith in
god is a belief , and all beliefs may change. would you assert that atheists
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a
god which , of course , may show unfair bias when studying , say , religion \?




i claimed that a ``christian philosopher'' is not a christian ,
but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those
of christianity. consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison
is not a prisoner , unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone
in a prison.
can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison \?
can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian
beliefs \? no , because if a person is free to go , he is not a prisoner.
similarly , if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma , he is not
a christian.

so , christianity is a prison , eh \? ever heard of parole \? you have read far
too much into this subject. a christian is one who follows the religion
based on the teachings of a man named jesus christ. nowhere does this
definition imply that one cannot change one 's mind. in prison , however ,
you ca n't just decide to leave. one is voluntary , the other is not. the
two are not compatible.


religion is like the gun that does n't kill anybody. religion encourages
faith and dogma and although it does n't directly condemn people ,
it encourages the use of ``just because'' thinking. it is
``just because'' thinking that kills people.

i prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine. 8 )
seriously , though , some (but certainly not all) religions do condemn
groups of people. the common target is the infidel , a curious being
who is alternately an atheist , a non insert specific religious
affiliation here , a person of a different race , or an egyptian. 8 )

please explain how just because thinking kills people. (and please
state more in your answer than waco. )


of course , not all humans are capable of thought , and we 'd still
have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide...but not as much.
i'm willing to bet on that.

i 'll see your conscientious peacenik and raise you a religious
zealot with bad acne. 8 ) by the way , i was n't aware mass suicide
was a problem. waco and jonestown were isolated incidents.
mass suicides are far from common.

it is also well known that the comments in josephus relating to jesus were
inserted (badly) by later editors. as for the four gospels being in harmony
on the issue of jesus... you know not of what you speak. here are a few
contradictions starting with the trial and continuing through the assension.

the death of judas after the betrayal of jesus

acts 1 18 now this man (judas) purchased a field with the reward of
iniquity and falling headlong , he burst asunder in the midst , and all his
bowels gushed out.

matt. 27 5 7 and he (judas) cast down the pieces of silver in the temple ,
and departed , and went and hanged himself. and the chief priests...bought
with them the potter 's field.

what was jesus' prediction regarding peter 's denial \?

before the cock crow matthew 26 34

before the cock crow twice mark 14 30

how many times did the cock crow \?

mar 14 72 and the second time the cock crew. and peter called to mind the
word that jesus said unto him , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny
me thrice. and when he thought thereon , he wept.

mat 26 74 then began he to curse and to swear , saying , i know not the man.
and immediately the cock crew.
mat 26 75 and peter remembered the word of jesus , which said unto him ,
before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice. and he went out , and wept
bitterly.

luk 22 60 and peter said , man , i know not what thou sayest. and immediately ,
while he yet spake , the cock crew.
luk 22 61 and the lord turned , and looked upon peter. and peter remembered
the word of the lord , how he had said unto him , before the cock crow , thou
shalt deny me thrice.

joh 13 38 jesus answered him , wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake \?
verily ,
verily , i say unto thee , the cock shall not crow , still thou hast denied me
thrice.

joh 18 27 peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew.

destruction of cities (what said was jeremiah was zechariah)

(this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made !
not the only time he does this either...)

mat 27 9 then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet ,
saying , and they took the thirty pieces of silver , the price of him that was
valued , whom they of the children of israel did value

zechariah 11 11 13
(nothing in jeremiah remotely like)

what was the color of the robe placed on jesus during his trial \?

scarlet matthew 27 28

purple john 19 2

the time of the crucifiction

mark says the third hour , or 9 a.m. , but john says the sixth hour (noon) was
when the sentence was passed.

inscription on the cross

matthew this is jesus the king of the jews
mark the king of the jews
luke this is the king of the jews
john jesus of nazareth the king of the jews

what did they give him to drink \?

vinegar matthew 27 34

wine with myrrh mark 15 23

women at the cross

matthew said many stood far off , including mary magdaline , mary the mother of
james , and the mother of zebedee 's children. mark and luke speak of many far
off , and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less.
john says that jesus 's mother stood at the cross , along with her sister and
mary magdalene.

jesus' last words

matt.27 46 , 50 and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice ,
saying , eli , eli , lama sabachthani \? that is to say , my god , my god , why
hast thou forsaken me \? ...jesus , when he cried again with a loud voice ,
yielded u the ghost.

luke23 46 and when jesus had cried with a loud voice , he said , father , unto
thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus , he gave up the ghost.

john19 30 when jesus therefore had received the vinegar , he said , it is
finished and he bowed his head , and gave up the ghost.

events of the crucifiction

matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent , that there was an
earthquake , and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour , that graves
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem , appearing to
many (beating jesus to the resurection). mark and luke speak of darkness and
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints.
john is the only one who mentions jesus 's side being peirced.

burial of jesus

matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being
stolen by the disciples , and for the tomb to be sealed. all of this was
supposedly done , but the other gospels do not mention these precautions.

how long was jesus in the tomb \?
depends where you look matthew 12 40 gives jesus prophesying that he will
spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth , and mark 10 34
has after three days (meta treis emeras) he will rise again . as far as i can
see from a quick look , the prophecies have after three days , but the
post resurrection narratives have on the third day .

time of the resurection

matthew says sunday at dawn , mark says the sun was rising , and john says it
was dark.

who was at the empty tomb \? is it

mat 28 1 in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first
day of the week , came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre.

mar 16 1 and when the sabbath was past , mary magdalene , and mary the mother
of james , and salome , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and
anoint him.

joh 20 1 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early , when it
was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and seeth the stone taken away from the
sepulchre.

whom did they see at the tomb \?

mat 28 2 and , behold , there was a great earthquake for the angel of the
lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door ,
and sat upon it.
mat 28 3 his countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as
snow mat 28 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as
dead men. mat 28 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear
not ye for i know that ye seek jesus , which was crucified.

mar 16 5 and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on
the right side , clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted.

luk 24 4 and it came to pass , as they were much perplexed thereabout ,
behold , two men stood by them in shining garments

joh 20 12 and seeth two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and
the other at the feet , where the body of jesus had lain.

belief that the disciples stole jesus 's body

matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story , but no other gospel makes
this claim.

appearences of the risen jesus

matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told
them , to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee. the disciples then went
to a mountain previously agreed opon , and met jesus there. this was his only
appearance , except to the women at the tomb. matthew only devotes five verses
to the visit with the disciples.

mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country , and that
they told the rest of the disciples , who refused to believe. later he
appeared to the 11 disciples at mealtime.

luke says two followers went , the same day that jesus rose from the dead , to
emmaus , a village eight miles from jeruselem , and there jesus jioned them but
was unrecognised. while they ate a meal together that evening , they finally
recognised jesus , whereopon he dissapeared. returning at once to jeruselem ,
they told the
disciples of their experience , and suddenly jesus appeared among them ,
frightening them , as they thought he was a spirit. jesus then ate some fish
and honey and then preached to them.

john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose , in
jeruselem , where they were hiding. he breathed the holy ghost opon them , but
thomas was not present and refused to believe. eight days later jesus joined
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas. once
more jesus made an
appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not
recognised.
after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat , jesus
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them. they all eat
together and converse.

the book of acts further adds to the confusion. it says that jesus showed
himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection (thus
contradicting matthew , mark , luke and john) and spoke to them of things
pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things , while
they beheld , he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight.
and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up , two men stood
by them in white apparel which also said , ye men of galilee , why stand ye
gazing into heaven \? this same jesus , which is taken from you into heaven ,
shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts 1 3 11

paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by 500
persons between the time of the resurection and the
assension , although he does not say where. he also claims that he himself as
one born out of due time also saw jesus. 1 cor 15 6 8.

the ascension

matthew says nothing about it. mark casually says that jesus was recieved into
heaven after he was finished talking with the
disciples in jeruselem. luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that
while he blessed them , he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.
john says nothing about it. acts
contradicts all of the above. (see previous section)

when second coming \?

mat 24 34 verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass , till all
these things be fulfilled.

mar 13 30 verily i say unto you , that this generation shall not pass , till
all these things be done.

luk 21 32 verily i say unto you , this generation shall not pass away , till
all be fulfilled.

1 thessalonians 4 15 18

how many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention
1 corinthians 15 5 (12)
matthew 27 3 5 (minus one from 12)
acts 1 9 26 (mathias not elected until after resurrection)
mat 28 16 then the eleven disciples went away into galilee , into a mountain
where jesus had appointed them.

ascend to heaven
and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven. (2 kings 2 11)

no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven , ...
the son of man. (john 3 13)

as you can see , there are a number of contradictions in the account of the
trial , crucifiction and resurection of jesus. if these are good witnesses ,
you would think that they could get some of these important details right !
(in fact , i cannot find very many points on where they agree. you would think
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly
observing ! ) because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error ,
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth.
(due to the nature of the story , i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of
truth.)

faith and dogma are irrational. the faith and dogma part of any religion
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals.

i disagree. in the end , the individual is responsible for his her own
irrationality. the individual 's belief in some dogmatic religion is a
symptom of that irrationality.

have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists \?

atheists and agnostics , i would imagine , but yes , that was my point. an
atheist would theoretically be just as ill equipped to study the philosophy
of religion as a christian , and yet there is a persistence of atheists
among the ranks of philosophers. therefore , the conflict between one 's
religious beliefs (or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher
must not be as great as you assert. the fact that most philosophers may
be non religious was a secondary point.


science , (as would be practiced by atheists) in contrast , has a
built in defence against faith and dogma.

as opposed to science practiced by theists \? be careful here.

science does have a built in defence against faith and dogma
skepticism. unfortunately , it is not foolproof. there is that
wonderful little creature known as the theory. many of us believe in
the theory of evolution. we have no absolute proof that this
theory is true , so why do we believe it \? because it makes more
sense than... \? there is quite a bit of faith involved here.


a scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to
suit whatever is the best information available at the time , and ,
and , and , a scientist understands that any current beliefs
are deficient in some way.

well , not all current beliefs are deficient , but basically i agree.


can you see the difference \? science views beliefs as being flawed ,
and new information can be obtained to improve them.

ideally , this is true. in reality , though , you have to acknowledge
that scientists are human. scientists have egos and biases. some
scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the
flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed
to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof
for the theory. remember cold fusion \?


by the way , i was n't aware mass suicide
was a problem. waco and jonestown were isolated incidents.
mass suicides are far from common.

clinton and the fbi would love for you to convince them of this.
it would save the us taxpayer a lot of money if you could.

not really. i agree that we spent far too much money on the waco
crisis ( 7 , 500 , 000 i believe) , especially considering the outcome.
my point was that mass suicides in the u.s. are rare (jonestown was
in guyana , incidentally , although we footed the bill for the clean up) ,
and the u.s. has far more important issues to address. compare the
number of u.s. citizens who have died in mass suicides with , say , the
number of u.s. soldiers who died during one week of the vietnam war and
you will see my point.

some stuff about biblical morality , though bill 's quote of me had little
to do with what he goes on to say

bill ,

i'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to
this.

apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism i think
many of these are well addressed in the famous faq. your generalisms
are then misplaced atheism need n't imply materialism , or the lack
of an absolute moral system. however , i do tend to materialism and
do n't believe in absolute morality , so i 'll answer your questions.

how then can an atheist judge value \?

an atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does according
to a personal understanding of morality. that i do n't believe in an
absolute one does n't mean that i do n't have one. i'm just explicit ,
as in the line of postings you followed up , that when i express
judgment on a moral issue i am basing my judgment on my own code
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad.
my moral code is not particular different from that of others around
me , be they christians , muslims , or atheists. so when i say that i
object to genocide , i'm not expressing anything particularly out of
line with what my society holds.

if your were to ask why i think morality exists and has the form it
does , my answer would be mechanistic to your taste that a moral
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society , and that humanity
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of
our ability to exist in large societies , thereby achieving
considerable survival advantages. you 'd probably say that god just
made the rules. neither of us can convince the other , but we share a
common understanding about many moral issues. you think you get it
from your religion , i think i get it (and you get it) from early
childhood teaching.

that you do n't like what god told people to do says nothing about god
or god 's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled
with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction.

i think you 've been reading the wrong sort of comic books , but in
prying through the gobbledygook i basically agree with what you 're
saying. i do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as god
commanded the genocide of the canaanites is mechanistic , but of
course i think that 's true of you as well. my reaction has little to
do with whether god exists or even with whether i think he does , but
if a god existed who commanded genocide , i could not consider him
good , which is supposedly an attribute of god.

all of this being so , you have excluded
yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil ,
etc. and cannot participate. your opinion about the bible can have no
weight whatsoever.

hmm. yes , i think some heavy faq reading would do you some good. i
have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person. in
fact , i can actually accomplish something in such a discussion , by
framing the questions in terms of reason for instance , it is clear
that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt
to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands , then the
quality of life will be generally poor , so a system that fosters
coexistence is superior , if quality of life is an agreed goal. an
absolutist , on the other hand , can only thump those portions of a
bible they happen to agree with , and say this is good , even if the
act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in
the discussion. the attempt to define someone or a group of people as
excluded from discussion , such that they cannot participate , and
their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or
reasoning (ad hominem poisoning the well) , and presumably the resort
of someone who ca n't rationally defend their own ideas of right ,
wrong , and the bible.

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes. irrational
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism.

(deletion)

theism is correlated with fanaticism. i have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism. the point is ,
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic. one could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism (for example) , but i just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it.

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.

bogus. i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.
the point is that theism is a factor.

that 's your claim now back it up. i consider your argument as useful
as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism. therefore
belief is a factor in fanaticism. true , and utterly useless. (note , this
is any belief , not belief in gods)


tiring to say the least. i have backed it up , read the first statement.

i have read it. conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.


the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. saying someone believes
something is hardly an information about the person at all. saying someone
is a theist holds much more information. further , the correlation between
theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism
because of the special features of theistic belief.

truth by blatant assertion. evidence \?


gullibility ,
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more
reliable indicators. and the really dangerous people the sources of
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical manipulators
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing.

that 's a claim you have to support. please note that especially in the
field of theism , the leaders believe what they say.

if you believe that , you 're incredibly naive.


you , frank o'dwyer , are living in a dream world. i wonder if there is any
base of discussion left after such a statement. as a matter of fact , i think
you are ignorant of human nature. even when one starts with something one does
not believe , one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says.

to give you the benefit of the doubt , prove your statement.

the onus of proof is on you , sunshine. what makes you think that
theist leaders believe what they say \? especially when they say
one thing and do another , or say one thing closely followed by its
opposite \? the practice is not restricted to theism , but it 's there
for anyone to see. it 's almost an epidemic in this country.

just for instance , if it is harder for a camel to pass thru' the eye
of a needle , why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner \? why
are there churches to the square inch in my country \?

now , some
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism ,
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom. ever read animal farm \?

that 's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to
fanatism , and not all fanatism is caused by theism. the point is ,
there is a correlation , and it comes from innate features of theism.

no , some of it comes from features which some theism has in common
with some fanaticism. your last statement simply is n't implied by
what you say before , because you 're trying to sneak in innate features
of all theism . the word you 're groping for is some .


bogus again. not all theism as is is fanatic. however , the rest already
gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and
theism. and further , the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them
to switch to fanatism easily. it takes just a nifty improvement in the
theology.

truth by blatant assertion.


gullibility , by the way , is one of them.

no shit , sherlock. so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism ,
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have , as opposed
to the case you are trying to make \?


because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people
causing the correlation. and the whole discussion started that way by the
statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism , which you
challenged.

indeed i did. as i recall , i asked for evidence. what is the correlation
of which you speak \?


and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men. interesting that you have nothing better to offer.

i said it reads like a warm up to that. that 's because it 's an irrational
and bogus tirade , and has no other use than creating a nice them us
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls.


blah blah blah. i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights
protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.

of course , other people are always fanatics , never oneself. your
wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.

it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between
that argument and the rise of fanatism. so far , it is just another of your
assertions.

so \? you can do it.


(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that
reason is always useful \?


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate. one point is that
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would
be irrational. which is it \?

that 's bogus. self reference is not circular. and since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems , it is allowed.

o.k. , it 's oval. it 's still begging the question , however. and though
that certainly is allowed , it 's not rational. and you claiming to be
rational and all.


another of your assertions. no proof , no evidence , just claims.

hey i learned it from you. did i do good \?


at the risk of repeating myself , and hearing we had that before we
did n't hear a refutation before , so we 're back. deal with it
you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful. someone
who thinks reason is crap wo n't buy it , you see.


that is unusually weak even for you. the latter implies that my proof
depends on their opinion. somehow who does not accept that there are
triangles wo n't accept pythagoras. wow , that 's an incredible insight.
i do n't have to prove them wrong in their opinion. it is possible to
show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims
unreliable or even absurd statements to be information.

totally circular , and totally useless.

their wish to believe makes them believe. things are judges by their appeal ,
and not by their information. it makes you feel good when you believe that
may be good for them , but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls. from
belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt.

truth by blatant assertion. i 've seen as many bogus proofs of the
non existence of gods as i have of their existence.


rational systems , by the way , does not mean that every data has to come from
logical analysis , the point is that the evaluation of the data does not
contradict logic. it easily follows that such a system does not allows to
evaluate if its rational in itself. yes , it is possible to evaluate that
it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that
system , but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon , that has as
little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes.

this just does n't parse , sorry.

so far it just a matter of consistency. i use ratiional arguments to show
that my system is consistent or that theirs is n't. the evaluation of the

nor this.
predictions does not need rationality. it does not contradict , however.


your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular.

anybody else think godel was silly \?


stream of consciousness typing \? what is that supposed to mean \?


the first part of the second statement contains no information , because
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it.


i 've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here.

an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy. have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice. and further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived. i exist is derived , if you want
it that way.

further , one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.

what is it you are trying to say \?

that at some point , people always wind up saying this datum is reliable
for no particular reason at all. example i am not dreaming .


nope. there is evidence for it. the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic
basis of a system is difficult , because the possibilities are interwoven.
one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions
that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway.

i 'd like to see this alleged evidence.

one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method
for usefulness , the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (that 's not
how one feels about it).

i see. you have no irrational beliefs. but then , fanatics never do , do
they \?


compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism \? to
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
i suspect you do not have.


using the traditonal definition of gods. personal , supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world. usually connected to morals and or
the way the world works.

imo , any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational. that does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence. some atheists are also scientists , for example.


they do n't use theism when doing science. or it would n't be science. please
note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well.
they just prohibit formulating them as objective statements.

ergo , nothing is objective. fair enough.


the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. however , the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis.

i do n't understand this. can you formalise your argument \?

person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice. that does not make
b true , it is at best a work hypothesis. however , the content of b is that
it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis. testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b (already believed)
says it is wrong a waste of time not possible. depending on the further
contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed , this can
have interesting effects.

peculiar definition of interesting , but sure. now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak. why are n't my
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants , for example \? maybe they
do n't believe in it. maybe it 's the conjunction of b asserts b and
jail kill dissenters that is important , and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant. it certainly seems so to me , but then i have no
axe to grind here.


the example with your neighbours is a fallacy. that your neighbours do n't
says little about others. and there were times when exactly that happened.

nope , it 's not a fallacy. it just does n't go to the correlation you
wish to see.

and tell me , when it is not irrelevant , why are such statements about
amalekites and idolaters in the holy books \? please note that one could
edit them out when they are not relevant anymore. because gods do n't err \?
what does that say about that message \?

excuse me the holy books \?

and how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok. a god
is the easiest way to excuse anything , and therefore highly attracting to
fanatics. not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can
have on the rest of the believers. happens again and again and again.

a god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything , nor the only way.

this is the most unmitigated bilge i 've seen in a while. jim brown obviously
has possession of the right wing token.

diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective.

in december , former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski told a
senate committee that sanctions were costing iraq 100 million per day , and
that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world.
iraq , he suggested , was losing badly every day it defied the un demands ,
while the community of nations won every day with no taking of life or
loss of life. fcnl washington newsletter.

the world is full of evil , and circumstances are not perfect. many
innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others. it it regretable ,
but that 's the way it is.

wrongful actions of murderers like leaders of the us government , perhaps \?
regrettable , of course the way it is certainly not.

the media is not totally monolithic. ... there are even conservative
sources out there if you know where to look. (hurrah for rush ! )

good heavens ! an escapee from rush limbot land ! conservative , my ass.

and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was
because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being
so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing
was n't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a
decisive way by any other method at that time. but in the gulf war ,
precision bombing was the norm.

bullshit ! ! ! in the gulf massacre , 7 of all ordnance used was smart. the
rest that 's 93 was just regular , dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. have
you forgotten that the pentagon definition of a successful patriot launch
was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage \? or that a
successful interception of a scud was defined as the patriot and scud
passed each other in the same area of the sky \?

and of the 7 that was the smart stuff , 35 hit. again try to follow me
here that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed.

the stories
of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.

prove it. i have a source that says that to date , the civilian death count
(er , excuse me , i mean collateral damage ) is about 200 , 000.

s

no one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in
washington state , but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than
incarceration.
california is spending more than 90 million annually on capital cases ,
and until this year had n't executed anyone since 1972. texas , the national
leader in the number of executions , spends an estimated 2.3 million per
execution. that compares to an average cost of incarceration in washington
state of 25 , 000 per maximum security prisoner per year.

with this in mind , to my understanding , we must look at the reasoning
behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeini 's fatwa. now , to
my understanding , the hadith upon which those who support khomeini 's
fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war
time. now , brother , in general , it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say
that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of
peace. i think any sensible human being can see this , so i personally
think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty ,
for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace
regarding this particular subject.

if you think i am wrong , please feel free to say so , with your
reasoning from qur'an and hadith , please. not because somebody said
so , i want the reasoning from al qur'an and the sahih hadiths.

perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam. please
email me , rashid , if you think we should do this.

by the way , i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment
for apostasy. the viewpoint i follow that there is in general no
punishment for apostasy is very strongly supported by qur'an and
hadith. this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law
by mohamed s. el awa (american trust publications , 1981).


i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little
justification for the punishment of apostasy in the qur'an.
in islamic history , as well , apostasy has rarely been punished.
belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there
is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief , apostates have
been generally left to believe or not believe as they will.

however , when an apostate makes attacks upon god and
his messenger the situation changes. now the charge of
apostasy may be complicated with other charges perhaps
charges of sedition , treason , spying , etc. if the person
makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public
attacks (as opposed to arguement) against islam , the
situation is likewise complicated. if the person spreads
slander or broadcasts falsehoods , again the situation
changes. the punishments vary according to the situation
the apostate is in. anyhow , the charge of aggravated
apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie 's case.

there is a distinction in the qur'an between a formal war situation
and being in the situation where someone unilaterally
wages war (by their actions) , creates disorder , makes mischief , etc.
against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm
to muslims. here , a small group or even a single individual could
be said to be engaged in such a practise. in other words , there is
a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two
clearly defined parties wage war , conclude treaties , exchange
prisoners , etc.) , and dealing with attacks that come from isolated
individuals or groups against islam. it is the second situation ,
the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that
would apply in the case of rushdie.

the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an
offensive book (banning the book is secondary)
a full set of circumstances following the publication of
the book come into play as well , including the deaths of many
muslims , and rushdie 's (and his publishers) media games.


now , i do not believe in blindly following anyone , no matter
how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law. if someone tells me
islam says such and such , i immediately say show me the support for
this statement from the qur'an and sunnah . i believe this to be my

my understanding , the hadith upon which those who support khomeini 's

think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty ,
for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace
regarding this particular subject.

i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. i believe
that one of the qur'anic verses on which the fatwa is based is 5 33.
every verse in the qur'an has a corresponding circumstance of
revelation but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir) of the
verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance
in which it was revealed. if this was the case then we could say
that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the
muslims were not involved in conflict , should be suspended when
they were at war. the logic does not follow. in complex , real life
situations , there may be many verses and many hadiths which can
all be related to a single , complicated situation. the internal
relationships between these verses may be quite complex , such that
arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how
each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task.
it is not necessarily a simple this or that process. there may
be many parameters involved , there may be a larger context in
which a particular situation should be viewed. all these matters
impinge on the situation.

in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the qur'an.
the qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses , but this reflection must
entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith.
if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety , then each
person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that.
however , if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to
the
state , to the gestation of laws and rulings , to the gestation of society ,
the dispensing of justice , the guidance of the community , then there
are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one
should achieve. jaffar ibn muhammad as sadiq(a.s.) relates some of
these requirements , as taught by the prophet(s.a.) , in a hadith

...he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating
verse from the abrogated one , and a specific one from a general one ,
and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between
a permission and an obligation , and does not recognize a verse of
meccan period from a medinite one , and does not know the circumstances
of revelation , and does not understand the technical words of
the qur'an (whether simple or compound) and does not comprehend the
knowledge of decree and measure , and is ignorant of advancing and
delaying (in its verses) and does not distinguish the clear from
the deep , nor the manifest from the esoteric , nor the beginning
from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer ,
the disjoining and the joining , and the exceptions and the all inclusive ,
and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the
subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the
detailed one , the obligatory laws and the permissions , the places of the
duties and rules , and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and
does not know the joined words , and the words that are related to those
coming before them , or after them then such a man does not know
the qur'an nor is he among the people of the qur'an.... .

based on these and other hadiths , and in accordance with many qur'anic
verses ( why should not a company from every group remain behind
to gain profound understanding (tafaqquh) in religion and to warn
people when they return to them , so that they may beware. (9 122)) ,
a science of jurisprudence arose. the requirements
for a person to be considered a mujtahid (one who can pronounce on
matters of law and religion) are many. i 've listed a few major
divisions below there are , of course , many subdivisions within these
headings.

knowledge of arabic (syntax , conjugation , roots , semantics , oratory).
knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir.
logic (mantiq)
a knowledge of hadiths
a knowledge of transmitters (rijal)
knowledge of the principles of juriprudence (qur'an , sunnah , consensus ,
reasoning)

the study of qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves
discussion of imperatives (awamir)
discussion of negative imperatives (nawahi)
discussion of generalities and particularities (aam wa khas)
discussion of unconditional and conditional
discussion of tacit meanings
discussion of the abstract and the clear
discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated

the principles of application of the law involves
principles of exemption
principles of precaution
principles of option
principles of mastery

the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. it is not a matter
of looking at one verse and one hadith.

now no one should blindly follow anyone , but there is a difference
between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself. there is the
famous hadith of the prophet (s.a.) in which he says
the fuqaha (religious scholars) are the trustees of the prophet , as
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires , pleasures ,
and wealth of this world. the prophet (s.a.) was asked o messenger
of god ! how may we know if they so concern themselves \? he (s.a.) replied
by seeing whether they follow the ruling power. if they do that , fear for
your religion and shun them. i do not yet know enough about the imams
of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them.

the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam . my only
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into
play a certain amount of expertise the specifics of this expertise is
delineated in the qur'an and hadith. those who acquire this expertise
are praised in both the qur'an and hadith those who without the requisite
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society , state , and religion
are cautioned.

the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this
group , is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa (that is ,
apostasy) , was wrong. when one discusses something they should at least
base their discussion on fact. secondly , khomeini was condemned as a
heretic
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible another instance of
creating a straw man and then beating him.

perhaps we should take our discussion to soc.religion.islam. please
email me , rashid , if you think we should do this.

i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup.
unfortunately ,
i do not have any access to email , so private discussion or a moderated
group
is out of the question (i cannot post to a moderated group like
soc.religion.islam. how about soc.culture.arabic or talk.religion.misc \?

the fact is god could cause you to believe anything he wants you to.
but think about it for a minute. would you rather have someone love
you because you made them love you , or because they wanted to
love you.

first , i do n't expect them to love me if they do n't even know i
exist. secondly , i would n't expect them to love me simply because
they were my creator. i would expect to have to earn that love.

the responsibility is on you to love god and take a step toward
him. he promises to be there for you , but you have to look for yourself.

are you daft \? how do i love something i do n't believe exists \?
come back when you 've learned to love your third testicle.

those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.
simple logic arguments are folly. if you read the bible you will see
that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic .
our ability to reason is just a spec of creation. yet some think it is
the ultimate. if you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now. to learn you must accept that which
you do n't know.

at which point you have stepped over the line and become a
complete asshole. even though it 's your first offense , i wo n't
let it slip becuase i 've heard it too goddamned many times.

you love jesus because deep in your heart you 're a cannibalistic
necrophiliac. because i say so , and i'm much more qualified to
assess your motivations than you are.

fortunately , there are some things i get to accept on evidence
rather than faith. one of them being that until christians like
yourself quit being so fucking arrogant , there will never be
peace. you 've all made sure of that.

in light of what happened in waco , i need to get something of my
chest.

sadly understandable...


faith and dogma are dangerous.

yes.


religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma , and
for that reason , i scorn religion.

to be fair , you should really qualify this as semitic western religions , but
you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway.

i have expressed this notion in the past. some christians debated
with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning. i claimed
rationality is quelled out of christianity by faith and dogma.

again , this should really be evaluated at a personal level. for example , there
was only one jesus (presumably) , and he probably did n't say all that many
things , and yet (seemingly) billions and billions of christian sects have
arisen. perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and
believes in christ as in pantheism. it would seem to go against the bible , but
it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal
interpretation .

a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind ,
whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and dogma present
in any religion.

this is a good point. we have here the quintessential christian he sets up a
system of values beliefs for himself , which work very well , and every
event experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this
system. however , we also have an individual who has the inability (at least
not without some difficulty) to change , which is important , because the problem
with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to
the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system
without destroying whatever faith is invested therein , unless of course , all
the tests fail. in other words , the fairer way would be to test and evaluate
moralities without the bias responsibility of losing retaining a system.


i claimed that a ``christian philosopher'' is not a christian ,
but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those
of christianity. consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison
is not a prisoner , unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone
in a prison.
can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison \?
can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian
beliefs \? no , because if a person is free to go , he is not a prisoner.
similarly , if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma , he is not
a christian.

interesting , but again , when it seems to basically boil down to individual
nuances (although not always , i will admit , and probably it is the
mass oriented divisions which are the most appalling) , it becomes irrelevant ,
unfortunately.


i admit it 's a word game.
i'm going by the dictionary definition of religion
``religion n. 1. concern over what exists beyond the visible world ,
differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith
or intuition rather than reason , ...''
webster 's

now let 's go beyond the word game. i do n't claim that religion
causes genocide. i think that if all humans were atheist , there
would still be genocide. there will always be humans who do n't think.
there will always be humans who do n't ask themselves what is
the real difference between themselves and people with different
colored skin , or a different language , or different beliefs.


granted

religion is like the gun that does n't kill anybody. religion encourages
faith and dogma and although it does n't directly condemn people ,
it encourages the use of ``just because'' thinking. it is
``just because'' thinking that kills people.


in which case the people become the bullets , and the religion , as the gun ,
merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves , if i
may be so bold as to extend your similie \?

sure , religion has many good qualities. it encourages benevolence
and philanthropy. ok , so take out only the bad things like faith ,
dogma , and tradition. put in the good things , like careful reasoning ,
and science. the result is secular humanism. would n't it
be nice if everyone were a secular humanist \? to please the
supernaturalists , you might even leave god in there , but the secular
emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking , and
they too would realize that a belief in a god really does n't put
anyone further ahead in understanding the universe (ok , i'm just
poking fun at the supernaturalists ).

also understandable... )


of course , not all humans are capable of thought , and we 'd still
have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide...but not as much.
i'm willing to bet on that.

i do n't have to make outrageous claims about religion 's affecting and
effecting history , for the purpsoe of a.a , all i have to do point out
that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate
atheism.

bill , you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its
sole purpose the validation of atheism. it does n't. this board is
used to discuss atheism as a philosophy , to share posters' experiences
regarding atheism , to debunk various theisms and theism as a whole , to
share resources relating to atheism , and even to socialize with others
with similar views. and of course with the number of theists who come
here to preach , it is also used to argue the case for atheism.


at no time have i made any statement that religion was the
sole cause of anything , what i have done is point out that those who
do make that kind of claim are mistaken , usually deliberately.

if you want to accuse people of lying , please do so directly. the
phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic.


to credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to
misunderstand human nature , the function of religion and of course ,
history. i believe that those who distort history in this way know
exaclty what they 're doing , and do it only for affect.

the two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are
christianity and islam. both of these claim to make their followers
into good people , and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been
accomplished through their faiths. imho they are right. the american
friends service committee (quaker) , catholic relief services , bread
for the world , salvation army soup kitchens , and mother theresa spring
to mind. (can someone with more knowledge of islam supply the names
of some analagous islamic groups \? )

when mother theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her
christianity , i believe her. her form of theism ascribes to her deity
such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care
for those in need. the point is that such a philosophy does have the
power to change the behavior of individuals if it is widespread
enough , it can change societies.

the same works for the horrors of history. to claim that christianity
had little to do with the crusades or the inquisition is to deny the
awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute. what it seems you

the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that
religion has had no evil impacts on history. that is absurd.

deletia in case anybody had n't noticed , frank and i are debating
objective morality , and seemingly hitting semantics.

secondly , how can i refute your definition \? i can only point up its
logical implications , and say that they seem to contradict the usage
of the word objective in other areas. indeed , by your definition , an
objective x is an oxymoron , for all x. i have no quibble with that
belief , other than that it is useless , and that objective is a perfectly
good word.

it may be that , being a non native english speaker , i 've
misunderstood your usage of objective , and tried to debate something
you do n't assert my apologies. i'm at a loss to imagine what you really
do mean , though.

how many ages can the universe have , and still be internally self
consistent \? i 'd be amazed if it was more than one. how many different
moral systems can different members of society have indeed , single
individuals , in some cases and humanity still stick together \?

begging the question. people can have many opinions about the age
of the universe and humanity can still stick together. you are
saying that the universe has a real age , independent of my beliefs about
it. why \?

wrong point. the age of the universe has no direct effect on
humanity 's sticking power , in the way the moral system of a society can
have.

i'm saying the universe has a real age , because i see evidence
for it cosmology , astronomy and so on. i say this age is independent of
people 's opinions of it , because i know different people have a lot of
different opinions in the matter , yet empirical tests consistently seem
to give roughly the same results.

the age of the universe , like most scientific facts , can be
emirically verified through means that 'll give the same result no matter
who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the
largish side...).

this assumes that the universe has a real age , or any kind of reality
which does n't depend on what we think.

i ca n't see how it does that. put a creationist to the task of
performing the tests and calculations , see to it (s)he makes no blatant
errors in measuring or calculating , and the result of the test will be
the same.

why should an extreme biblical
creationist give a rat 's ass about the means of which you speak \?

because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their
opinion. if those tests were just my opinion , then their own tests
(which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine , even if we
conducted said tests in identical manner , no \? they do n't , which i take
as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them.

i 've heard of no way to verify morality in a
consistent way , much less compute the errors of the measurement care to
enlighten me \?

the same is true of pain , but painkillers exist , and can be predicted
to work with some accuracy better than a random guess.

map the activity of nerves and neural activity , if you mean
physical pain. you have a sharp point , i 'll give you that but you still
have n't given me a way to quantify morality.

i wrote
elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value.

we agree. hypotheses , however , can change i hold that there is no
ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could
gravitate , but that they could be changed in any way imaginable ,
producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes.

if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if... ,
that can be tested ,

better and worse are (almost \? ) always defined in the context
of a moral system. your prediction will always be correct , within
that moral system . what you need now is an objective definition of
good and bad i wish you luck.

people 's ideas about the age of object x are not objective
you can have any idea you like , and i ca n't stop you. universae and
their ages is another ballgame they are what they are , and if you
dislike some detail of them , that 's a problem with your opinion of
them.

sure. assume an objective reality , and you get statements like this.

is n't that what you 're doing , when assuming an objectively
real morality \? besides , what exactly is provably wrong with my
statement \?

i claim that morality is an opinion of ours , and as such
subjective and individual. if i'm wrong , then some more or less
objectively real thing exists , which you label objective morality
can you back up this positive claim of existence \?

can you back up your positive claim above \? no. that 's because it 's an
assumption. i make the same assumption about values , on the basis
that there is no logical difference between the two , and the empirical
basis of the two is precisely the same.

claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive
claim \? besides , i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder
different individuals , both fully functional as human beings and members
of society , but yet with wildly different moral codes. if morality was
objective , at least one should be way off base , but yet hir
'incorrect' morality seems to function fine. how come \?

as for producing these individuals , it might be easiest to pick
them from different societies say , an islamic one and some polynesian
matrilineal system , for example (if such still exist).

deletia testing for footballs on desks

now take a look at morality. see anything \? if so , please inform me
which way to look , and why to look that particular way , as opposed to
some other. get my drift \?

no. just look. are you claiming never to know what good means \?

one thing is good under some circumstances , because we wish to
achieve some goal , for some reason. other times we wish to do something
else , and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all.

some things are hard to make good , because we 'd seldom if ever
wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. still ,
the aztecs were doing fine until the spaniards wiped them out.

i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why.
i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone , immutable.

...
that 's a simple( \? ) matter of proving the track record of the
scientific method.

i think it 's great , and should be applied to values. i may be completely
wrong , but that 's what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of
thought.

yes , me too , and i 've tried a thing or two down that line it
does n't look good for objective values to me at all.

in article 1993apr08.174942.45124@watson.ibm.com strom@watson.ibm.com (rob strom) writes
i was making two separate points , both of which attack
face value bible interpretation

(1) to judge the bible 's value today , you judge it based on
the way it is used today. that is , what do commentators
actually say , what do rabbis teach , etc.

i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have
been referring to one problem with a highly interpreted tradition
like this is what happens when a schism occurs , and over time certain
large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor
exactly a face value interpretation...

(2) to judge the bible 's value when originally written ,
you (a) read it in the context of its time (not
with today 's assumptions) , and (b) compare it to
the practices of surrounding people.

while the context of the time is important , value judgments must
ultimately be according to current understanding , or at least to some
base standard (relative stability success of a society , e.g.). this
is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people ,
for instance according to the bible , the surrounding people were
immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits. we need to look
rather at what those peoples were really like. for instance , in
what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is
symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of
whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue \? by the
bible 's own terms idolatry is inherently evil , but i see no evidence
that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time
were particularly bad people , relative to the people in the bible.

...scissors and cloth... now in the past , our ancestors
did cut cloth with scissors , but they at least knew that
their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth ,
so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from
their earlier barbarism , and made the transition to
modern civilized paper cutting that much easier.

sounds good , but it presupposes teeth rending neighbors , which i see
no support for. one can argue that post facto assertion of inhumane
neighbors can be used to make moral points , but that does n't mean that
the actual neighbors really were inhuman. more to the point , such
dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain , or
even of a different people dwelling among us , is all too common.

that complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting , but i still do n't
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it
to attack condemnation of the original history.

note that i'm speaking of historical interpretation here , for instance
claiming that hammurabi 's an eye for an eye was primitive brutal
retribution , while moses' version was an enlightened benign fine
(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way). as
of 3000 years ago or so , they probably both meant the same thing.

to be sure , i'm arguing from a parochial perspective.
i belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against
overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe ,
and this book is the book of my tribe. the book commands
us to dedicate ourselves to study , to improve the
world , and to set an example as a light to the nations .

we 've revered the book , and i think we 've been successful
as scientists , as artists and musicians , as leaders
in important humanitarian causes. it 's hard for me to
separate the success of my people from the virtue
of our book. you 'd have to argue that we 'd have
done significantly better with a different book or with no book ,
or that another tribe with a different book or
with no book has done significantly better.

i do n't belittle the accomplishments , particularly the intellectual
ones , of the jewish people. i have given up on trying to think by
analogy , since i do n't know of any other 'tribe' that is at all
similar (the closest i can think of are the romany , but i do n't know
enough about them to make a meaningful comparison). i think a
tradition of reflective study , of flexible rather than dogmatic
interpretation , is a good thing. i think that with such an attitude a
case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a
1943 captain america comic (or whatever the babylonian equivalent
would have been).

fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question ,

makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question ,

another one rescued from the bit bucket...

over the years the furor over this book has been discussed on a.a. and
elsewhere on the net. generally , the discussion comes down to the
contention on the one hand that tsv contains such blood libel against
islam as to merit , if not death , than at least banning and probably
some sort of punishment and on the other that rushdie , particularly
as a non muslim in a western country , had every right to write and
publish whatever he chose , regardless of whether some muslims find it
offensive , without fear of persecution or death.

i am naturally inclined to the latter position , but find myself in an
interesting position , because i think this is a fine book , only
incidentally concerned with islam , and moreover i'm damned if i can
find anything malevolently offensive in it.

over the years , when i have made this point , various primarily muslim
posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book
and had called it such things as filth and lies , i would rank
rushdie 's book with hitler 's mein kempf or worse , and so on.
unfortunately , these comments are usually generalities , and attempts
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so
offensive have met either with stony silence , more generalizations , or
inaccurate or out of context references to the book which lead me to
believe that few of them have actually read it . corrections and
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored.

anyway , since i seem to be the only one following this particular line

. . .
specifically , i 'd like to know what relativism concludes when two
people grotesquely disagree. is it

(a) both are right

(b) one of them is wrong , and sometimes (though perhaps rarely) we have a
pretty good idea who it is

(c) one of them is wrong , but we never have any information as to who , so
we make our best guess if we really must make a decision.

(d) the idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless (implying that
whether peace is better than war , e.g. , is a meaningless question ,
and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer)

(e) something else. a short , positive assertion would be nice.

as i hope you can tell , (b) and (c) are actually predicated on
the assumption that values are real so statements like these
ca n't consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values
are n't part of objective reality.

i am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you
phrase the question makes it unanswerable. the concepts of right
and wrong (or correct incorrect or true false ) belong to the
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions. it makes no
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is
legitimate to ask if it is good (or better than another position).

let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives
of epistemology and ethics perception and motivation , respectively.
one can certainly ask if a percept is right (correct , true ,
veridical) or wrong (incorrect , false , illusory). but it makes little
sense to ask if a motive is true or false. on the other hand , it is
strange to ask whether a percept is morally good or evil , but one can
certainly ask that question about motives.

therefore , your suggested answers (a) (c) simply ca n't be considered
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment.

now the problem with (d) is that it is double barrelled i agree with
the first part (that the rightness of a moral position is a
meaningless question) , for the reasons stated above. but that is
irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that
one cannot feel peace is better than war. i certainly can make
value judgments (bad , better , best) without asserting the correctness
of the position.

sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a) (d). my short (e) answer is
that when two individuals grotesquely disagree on a moral issue ,
neither is right (correct) or wrong (incorrect). they simply hold
different moral values (feelings).

the willingness of true believers
to die for their belief , be it in jesus or jim jones , is
well documented , so martyrdom in and of itself says little.

it does say something about the depth of their belief. religion has
both deluded believers and con men. the difference is often how far
they will follow their beliefs.

i have no first hand , or even second hand , knowledge of how the
original apostles died. if they began a myth in hopes of exploiting
it for profit , and followed that myth to the death , that would be
inconsistent. real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would
lead to discomfort , pain and death.

the story in 1 kings regarding the 450 prophets of baal is of no
help in this debate. one can easily assume that they believed that
no overwhelming vindication of elijah would be forthcoming. he was
simply a fool , who would be shown to be so. the fire from heaven was
swift and their seizure and deaths were equally swift.

panama we invaded , true (twice this century).

the us created panama in the first place by fomenting and then
intervening in a civil war in the then republic of colombia.

us troops landed in colombia , to help with the uprising , and then
colombia was duly dismembered and replaced by two countries , in

(about my reply)

diplomatic )

it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming , usenet , diplomacy
is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through , is n't it \?

i realize i'm fighting occam 's razor in this argument , so i 'll try to
explain why i feel a mind is necessary.

kevin , unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little
about , algorithms. your reasoning , as i see it , is very much along the
lines of roger penrose , who claimed that mathematical 'insight' cannot
be algorithmic in his book the emperor 's new mind concerning
computers , minds , and the laws of physics . however , penrose 's
claim that he has mathematical insight , or your similar claim
that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look ,
could be just illusions.

we are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints i try to ponder
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective ,
realising that it might not be anything special , but certainly
useful. thinking back of what i wrote , do you think worms have minds
or not \? they are able to experience pain , at least they behave
just like that. yet it is conceivable that we might some day
in the future perform a total synthesis of c. elegans from
the elements. would such a worm have a mind \?

firstly , i'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. they 're
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out , but not
at working out the method itself.

this is true to some extent. however , i do not think that our brains
work like computers , at all. in fact , there is substantial evidence
(skarda , 1985 skarda freeman 1987) that brains work more or less
chaotically , generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.
our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators , i suppose.

the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. does
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
pre programmed into our brains \? this is somewhat unlikely , given that
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic
material , much of which is n't used.

indeed , this is extremely unlikely , given the vast impact of nurture
on our mind and brain. i suggest , however , that before trying to
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms.

kevin , take a look at the references i mentioned , and think again.
i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind
are neurologists , neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not
flame me for my opinions) , since they study beings that are
conscious.

the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot
lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.

and please , do not bring qm into this discussion at all not
all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness
plays some special role in physics. i would say it does n't.

the other problem with algorithms is their instability. not many
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code , yet
people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are
side effects , but patients still seem remarkably stable.) also ,
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate
can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it 's
code \?

again , brains are not computers . do n't forget this. this does not
mean they need something else to work they just work differently.
their primary 'purpose' is perception and guidance of action ,
self awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.

the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour \? (replace
'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) presumably , the
materialist viewpoint is that it 's the product of some kind of
chemical reaction. the usual products of such a reaction are energy
different chemicals. is colour a mixture of these \?

you are still expecting that we could find the idea of 'green' in
our brains somewhere , perhaps in the form of some chemical. this is
not how i see it. the sensation 'green' is a certain time dependent
pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex , and it is distributed
with the help of areas v1 and v2 to the rest of the brain.

indeed , a firing pattern. i have sometimes thought of our consciousness
as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns ,
but this is just idle speculation.

scientific american 's september 1992 issue was a special issue on
mind and brain. have you already read it from cover to cover \? )
there are two articles on visual perception , so you might be
interested.

but again , please note that subjective experiences cannot be
observed from a third person perspective. if we see nothing but
neuronal activity , we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the
mind.

kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation
of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the
patients' state of mind. for instance , a patient whose septal area
was stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during
a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression , and
started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.

stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing
situations , when the patients have started flirting with the
therapist.

in conclusion , there is evidence that

1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences ,
brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage

2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in
various areas of brain when we think of colours , our
visual cortex is activated etc.

3) consciousness is an afterthought we become conscious of our
actions with a half a second delay , and our brains are ahead
of our 'conscious will' by at least 350 ms.

thus , i think it is fruitful to turn the question why do 'i' see
colours around and ask what is this 'i' that seems to be
observing \? , since it seems that our conscious mind is not
the king of our brains.

if this is so , a
computer wo n't see colour , because the chemistry is different. does an
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an
equivalent that does n't \? it should n't , because the outputs of each
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. so why do
we see colour \?

this depends on what is meant by 'seeing colours'. does a neural
network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from
0 to 9 see the numbers , if it is capable of sorting them \?

if you are asking , why does an animal who is conscious of itself
as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who
does n't , i have a good answer read my previous posting ,
where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap
roles and act more morally , so that they do n't unconsciously
kill each other with newly discovered weapons. (a bit extreme ,
but this is the basic idea.)

when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools ,
a sense of identity and the concept of 'self' had to evolve in
line with this development. indeed , respect for others and
conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages
for social animals , such as early humans.

if i remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction ,
with two processes acting on it. the first process has been called
'unitary evolution' (or 'u') , is governed by schroedinger 's equation
and is well known. the second process , called various things such as
'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'r') ,
and is more mysterious. it is usually said to occur when a
'measurement' takes place , although nobody seems to know precisely
when that occurs. when it does occur , the effect of r is to abruptly
change the wavefunction.

if minds are required for this , does this mean that until human
minds came to the scene , wavefunctions never collapsed , but remained
in the superpositions for aeons \? my , how powerful we are.

this has been discussed before , and i think this topic is irrelevant ,
since we do not agree that minds are necessary , and neither do
physicists.

anyway , i'm speculating that minds would be in part x. there seems to
be some link between consciousness and r , in that we never see linear
superpositions of anything , although there are alternative
explainations for this. i 've no idea how a brain is supposed to access
part x , but since this is only speculation , that wo n't matter too
much ) my main point is that there might be a place for minds in
physics.

i agree , but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics
needs sharp minds to solve many real problems. )

i 'll go back to my nice padded cell now , if that 's ok with you )

it 's ok , if you do n't forget to take with you the references i

i agree that religion and belief is often an important psychological healer
for many people and for that reason i think it 's important. however ,
trying to force a psychological fantasy (i do n't mean that in a bad way ,
but that 's what it really is) on someone else who is n't interested is
extremely rude. what if i still believed in santa claus and said that my
belief in santa did wonderful things for my life (making me a better
person , allowing me to live without guilt , etc...) and then tried to get
you to believe in santa too just 'cuz he did so much for me \? you 'd call
the men in white coats as soon as you could get to a phone.

false dichotomy. you claimed the killing were not religiously
motivated , and i'm saying that 's wrong. i'm not saying that
each and every killing is religiously motivate , as i spelled out
in detail.

which killings do you say are religously motivated \?

for example , i would claim that the recent assassination of four
catholic construction workers who had no connection with the ira
was probably religously motivated.

at the time
of writing , i think that someone who claims the current violence is
motivated by religion is reaching.

what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n.i
are not religously motivated \?

now , it 's possible to argue that
religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in
the present , but i do n't know of any evidence that this is so and i'm
not enough of a historian to debate it.

given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland
into a country that has a particular church written into its
constitution , and which has restriction on civil rights dictated
by that church , i fail to see why the word past is appropriate.


but to claim that the killings in n.i are not religously
motivated. is grotesque. all that means is that the church
and believers are doing what they always do with history
they ca n't face they rewrite it.

you 're attacking a different claim. my claim is that when an ira
terrorist plants a bomb in warrington s he does not have as a motive
the greater glory of god.

sorry , frank , but what i put in quotes is your own words from your
posting 1qi83b ec4@horus.ap.mchp.sni.de . do n't tell us now that
it 's a different claim. if you can no longer stand behind your
original claim , just say so.

i mean the same thing when i say the killings in n.i. are not religously
motivated as i do when i say when a terrorist plants a bomb s he
does n't have a religious motive. the example is meant to clarify , not
to be a new claim. the different claim to which i refer is the claim
which you were seemingly attacking in the previous post , namely that religion
is not a major historical cause of the present violence. i do n't assert
that , nor do i assert its opposite.

you do n't have to hand us a bunch of double talk about what
i was seemingly attacking. i quoted what i was attacking.

been opportune time for a 'messiah' to be born.


it has. there is a guy running around in switzerland who claims to have
been conceived similarly. his mother says the same. his father is said to
be a bit surprised.

but anyway , there have been a lot of messiahs , and many have had a similar
story about their birth. or their death. a list of messiahs could be quite
interesting.


would n't you feel bad if you turned out to be wrong and the conception of
christ was via god \? i can just imagine your faces as mary asks you if
you 've ever had a child yourself.


i would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing

would n't you feel bad if you 'd find out that stones are sentient , and that
you have stepped on them all your life \? and would n't you feel bad when you 'd

if they wanted to save image they could have done what joseph planned to
do in the first place have a quite wedding and an equally quite divorce ,
(i think it was quite easy to do under jewish law). in that regard they
would have been pretty dumb to think up a conspiracy like the one you 've
outlined in that they a bringing attention on themselves. (messiah
appearances were like royal scandals in zero ad israel , (see the part in
acts when the sandhedrin are discussing what to do about the growth of the
new church , (i.e. one wise guy said leave it alone and if it is what it
says it is nothing can stop it and if it is n't then it will just fizzle out
anyway)).


you 've forgotten the pride factor.


it did n't fizzle , (the church i mean).


the argument is a fallacy. it is like thanks for reading this far on the end
of a letter. most religions claim that they wo n't fizzle because they contain
some eternal truth. so does christianity. since there are old religions it is
no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last.

roll twelve dice. calculate the chance for the result. argue that there must
be something special about the result because an event with a chance of
1 (6 12) could hardly happen by chance only. feel elevated because you have
participated in letting that special event take place.

okay , so you are going to blindly believe in things without reasonable

real evidence for it , then great. but unsupported claims , or even claims
by such and such news agency will not be accepted. if you want to
stick to the sheer impossible , instead of the merely difficult , then
fine.

the statement that if such a fact is classified , then you

have access to classified information that you know to be classified ,
and you reveal it , there is a good chance that you or someone else

i never said that you could n't prove it to my satisfaction , i merely

25 of the iron weapons hit , again unprecedented. the following is a rough

pardon me \? i am trying to apply human terms to non humans \?

that 's right. you are basically stating that morality can only deal with
humans , because only humans are sentient enough to be moral (that is ,
you say that morality can only deal with intentions \? ).

i have never said that only humans are the only beings which are
sufficiently sentient to have intentions. in fact , i have explicitly
said that i am perfectly happy to consider that some animals are
capable of forming intentions.

what i am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive
behaviour to have moral significance , since , it seems to me ,
such behaviour does not involve intention.


i think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative ,
this does not prevent his behavior from being moral.
i'm sure you do think this , if you say so. how about trying to
convince me \?

i think that a moral act is moral whether or not the implementor
thinks it is.

that 's not the point. the point is whether the implementor thinks
at all . the issue is not whether thinking produces opinion a
or opinion b , but whether thinking takes place , period.


i 've offered , four times , i think , to accept your definition if
you allow me to ascribe moral significence to the orbital motion
of the planets.

hmm... perhaps you can ascribe it. i could say that many human actions
are not natural and thus do n't follow a natural morality.

since humans are part of nature , are not all human actions natural .

or perhaps you 're going to throw in a definition of natural that
will allow us to describe some actions as natural and some as
not natural . if so , what is the definition \?


other than those death which surround mating rituals , other animals
just do n't kill each other (within a species) that often , do they \?

sure they do , as multiple posters have show you. sharks , for example ,
eat wounded sharks. i 've personally seen cats eat their newborn.

are you in some kind of denial \? people give you example after example ,
and you go off the air for a week , and then pop up claiming that it
never happened. it 's very strange.

but why do n't animals kill each other \?

my point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human

i am doing research on atheism , part of which involves field research here
on the net. the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this
group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief. i would
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and
mail it back to me at mtabbott@unix.amherst.edu.

first of all , i 've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a
variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail it 's possible to give
succinct answers to most everything , but there 's enough here to keep most of
you typing for hours , i'm sure. as much detail as you want to give me (i mean
it) is great , but it 's also important for me to have as broad a base of
individuals as possible , so even minimal responses are far better than nothing
it 's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration.

secondly , i hope some of the questions do n't come off as obnoxious i know that
phrases like what would convince you of the existence of god imply that i am
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant godless heathens.
in fact , i'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself , so my
use of god is a question of locution rather than ideology it 's easier
than just repeating a deity or higher power every time.

also , i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system
although i know some of you might contend that you do n't have any beliefs , but
are skeptical towards everything. i understand but you know what i mean.
think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather unweildy phrases
required to get the precise idea across.

lastly , thanks ! please fill out as much as you can , in as much detail as
you can , and send them to me. my research and i thank you.



where would you place your beliefs , on the spectrum
theism agnosticism weak atheism strong atheism \?
feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs.


in what , if any , religious tradition were you raised \? did you ever believe
in the existence of a god \? (several of the following questions presume
that the answer to this is yes if you 've always been an atheist , or at
least never a theist , you may have to modify the question answer somewhat.)


how serious was your your family 's involvement \?

how and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe \?

how and when did your final break with your beliefs , if any , occur \? i
realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se
whatever the case , just describe it in whatever detail you wish.


what contact with other atheists have you had before and after (and during)
your conversion to atheism \? (certainly your involvement with alt.atheism
counts how have net discussions affected your beliefs \? )

to what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your
beliefs \? did you come by your beliefs through discussion , through
independent means , or by some combination of the two or other means \?


are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational
means (proofs of the non existence of god , etc) , or was it perhaps , at least
in part , through other means (alienation from mainstream religion , etc) \?


to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs \?
what phenomena of the universe and of human existence (anything from physical
phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs) do you
feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where are they lacking as
an explanatory method \?

what would it take for you to question , or change , your beliefs \? what would
convince you of the existence of god , what would convince you of the
plausibility of god 's existence , and so forth \? how dynamic are your beliefs
are they constantly changing have they stayed more or less the same for
some time \?

are you involved in a career or education in science \? to what extent do you
think science has influenced your beliefs \? (issac asimov claimed that science
was the new secular religion , and that scientists are , in a very real sense ,
the new priesthood. do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi
religious base , or even a religious element \? )



this survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals , but
also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose
ideas and histories could be very useful to me. would you be willing to have
me , on the basis of this survey , write you to find out more about you and your
beliefs \? if not , fine your filling out the survey alone is great.



thanks again. feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what
i'm doing with this data , or if you have anything to say in addition to what
i 've asked about above.

and in that area , what you care about is whether someone is sceptical ,
critical and autonomous on the one hand , or gullible , excitable and
easily led on the other.

indeed i may. and one may be an atheist and also be gullible , excitable
and easily led.

i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
that a person is easily led. whether they have a worship or belief
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
beside the point.

sure. but whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing ,
not whether they are easily led.

not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible , excitable
and easily led from some concrete cause. in that case we would also
have to discuss if that concrete cause , rather than atheism , was the
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour.

i'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour merely that
it is not relevant to the definition of atheism , which is 'lack of belief in
gods'.

point morals are , in essence , personal opinions. usually
(ideally) well founded , motivated such , but nonetheless personal. the
fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question ,
sometimes even for the same reason , does not make morals objective it
makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question ,
which can be good for the evolution of a social species.

and if a real large lot (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a
football on a desk , i'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two \?
perhaps you can explain the difference to me , since you seem to see it
so clearly.

(rest deleted)

that 's a fallacy , and it is not the first time it is pointed out.

it 's not a fallacy note the if. if a supermajority of disinterested people
agree on a fundamantal value (we 're not doing ethics yet benedikt) , then what
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
observation \?

for one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. unlike
a football. further , you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. the analogy
does not hold.

i have , however , given an example of a value people agree on , and explained
why. people will agree that their freedom is valuable. i have also
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
ethics the if assertion above. and that is what i'm talking about , there
is n't a point in talking about ethics if this ca n't be agreed.

one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football ,
while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals you have to give.

i'm not doing morals (ethics) if we ca n't get past values. as i say ,
the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
are n't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable.
maybe not , and i want to think about this some , especially the implications
of its being true.

further , the above is evidence , not proof. proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

garbage. that 's not proof either.

the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
the objections. evidence that you are a preacher.

name that fallacy.

since this is alt.atheism , i hope you do n't mind if we strongly disagree...

the fact is god could cause you to believe anything he wants you to.
but think about it for a minute. would you rather have someone love
you because you made them love you , or because they wanted to
love you. the responsibility is on you to love god and take a step toward
him. he promises to be there for you , but you have to look for yourself.

indeed , knock and it shall be opened to you . dan , why did n't this work \?
i firmly believed in god for 15 years , but i eventually realised i was
only deluding myself , fearful to face the truth. ultimately , the only reason
what kept me believing was the fear of hell. the mental states i
had sillily attributed to divine forces or devil 's attempts to
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination , and it is easy
to achieve the same mental states at will.

my faith was just learned fear in a disguise.

those who doubt this or dispute it have not givin it a sincere effort.

god is demanding too much. dan , what was it i believed in for 15 years \?
if sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief
what it was in my case i 'd rather quit. if god does not help me to
keep the faith , i ca n't go on.

besides , i am concerned with god 's morality and mental health. does
she really want us to believe in herself without any help (revelations ,
guidance , or anything i can feel) \? if she has created us , why did n't
she make the task any easier \? why are we supposed to love someone who
refuses to communicate with us \? what is the point of eternal torture
for those who ca n't believe \?

i love god just as much as she loves me. if she wants to seduce me ,
she 'll know what to do.

simple logic arguments are folly. if you read the bible you will see
that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic .
our ability to reason is just a spec of creation. yet some think it is
the ultimate. if you rely simply on your reason then you will never
know more than you do now.

your argument is of the type you 'll know once you try .
yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried , and believed
for many years , but were eventually honest enough to admit that
they had lived in a virtual reality.

what else but reason i can use \? i do n't have the spiritual means
christians often refer to. my conscience disagrees with the bible.
i do n't even believe i have a soul. i am fully dependent on my
body indeed , i am this body. when it goes up with flames , so
does my identity. god can entertain herself with copies of me
if she wants.

to learn you must accept that which you do n't know.

what does this mean \? to learn you must accept that you do n't know
something , right o. but to learn you must accept something i do n't
know , why \? this is not the way i prefer to learn. it is unwise to
merely swallow everything you read. suppose i write a book telling
how the great invisible pink unicorn (tm) has helped me in my
daily problems , would you accept this , since you ca n't know whether
it is true or not \?

note that the gipu is also omnipotent , omnipresent , and loves just
about everyone. besides , he (and she) is guiding every writer on this planet ,

to fight iran \? i agree. and i agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
who did or do. but we did sell arms to hussein , and it 's a done deal.
now he invades kuwait. so do we just sit back and say , well , we sold
him all those arms , i suppose he just wants to use them now. too bad
for kuwait. no , unfortunately , sitting back and letting things be
is not the way to correct a former mistake. destroying hussein 's
military potential as we did was the right move. but i agree with
your statement , reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to
sell arms to hussein. so it 's really not the gulf war you abhor
so much , it was the u.s. 's and the west 's shortsightedness in selling
arms to hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable , right \?

if so , then i agree.

my theory , though yet unproven , is that this is due to simple envy.

no its not.

its due to the fact that there are two issues here religion and religion.

religion is personal belief system.
religion is a memetic virus.

people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from
religion religion. people that want to save others are firmly
entrenched in religion ( memoids ).

rule 1 of not practicing religion is to shut the fuck up , unless
you discuss it politely. this means that the motive behind the conversation
is not only your self gratifying wish to spread the word.

religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person , and
reflects their value judgements. religion is something that is
contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements
(other than perhaps i think i 'll be brainwashed today ).

religion is a drug...

i believe you can discuss religion. however , the post that started this
off was not intented as discussion , it was more a proclamation of
someones religion.

if you think i'm talking about censorship or that i'm closeminded you have n't
understood this. i do n't have any problem with the discussion of
religion , its just religion that i ca n't stand...

according to jerry mander 's in the absence of the sacred (good
book , btw) , the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy
also played a significant role as a model for the u.s. constitution.
furthermore , apparently marx and engels were strongly influenced
by a study of iroquois society , using it as the prime example of
a successful , classless , egalitarian , noncoercive society. mander
goes on to say that both the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. would do well
to study the original document , figure out where each went wrong ,
and try to get it right next time.

that 's fascinating. i heard that the chinese , rather than
the italians , invented pasta.

that 's fascinating. i take it that you 're expressing skepticism
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced
the constitution of the people who stole their continent. you
could be right , but it sounds plausible to me. is there any
reason that you dismiss it out of hand \? here 's some more

recent scholarship has shown that in the mid 1700s indians were not
only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding
fathers , but that the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy
arguably became the single most important model for the 1754 albany
plan of union , and later the articles of confederation and the
constitution. that this would be absent from our school texts ,
and from history , and from media is not surprising given the devotion
americans feel to our founding myth great men gathered to express
a new vision that has withstood the test of time. if it were
revealed that indians had a role in it , imagine the blow to the
american psyche.
...
by 1754 , when most of these men and others gathered to creat the
albany plan of union , the first try at confederation , they invited
forty two members of the iroquois grand council to serve as advisors
on confederate structures. benjamin franklin freely acknowledged
his interest in the iroquois achievement in a famous speech at
albany congress it would be a strange thing...if six nations
of ignorant savages sic should be capable of forming such a union
and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has subsisted
for ages and appears indissoluble , and yet that a like union should
be impractical for ten or a dozen english colonies.
according to grinde , franklin convened meetings of iroquois chiefs
and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he
acknowedged to be similar to the iroquois confederacy.

grinde is professor donald grinde , jr. , of the university of california
at riverside whose book the iroquois and the founding fathers of the
american nation addresses this issue.

brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was
doing what felt good , did n't want anyone forcing their morality on me ,
or i do n't follow your morality \?

i believe that morality is subjective. each person is entitled to his
own moral attitudes. mine are not a priori more correct than someone
elses. this does not mean however that i must judge another on the
basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to
believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is
offensive to the majority.

why \? how \? might makes right \? how can they force their morality on me \? why
ca n't i do what i want \? who are they to decide \? what if i disagree \?

most criminals do not see their behavior as moral. the may realize that
it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral
system but being immoral.

good point , but it is being immoral in our opinion. we do n't let them choose ,
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them.

for someone to lay claim to an alternative
moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be
internally consistent. some sociopaths lack an innate moral sense

i admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense , but have little basis
for it as of yet. how far can such a concept be extended \?

and
thus may be incapable of behaving morally. while someone like hitler
may have believed that his actions were moral , we may judge him immoral
by our standards.

do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but
not him. after all , he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he
chose. on what basis do we condemn other societies besides , here 's the buzz
words , on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all
societies \?

holding that morality is subjective does not mean
that we must excuse the murderer.

why not \? do we have to be objective suddenly \?

socrates didnt exist cuz he , like jesus , has nothing from his hands that
have survived. only plato and others record his existance. many others
record jesus' existance , including the babylonian talmud. sorry guys , the
argument that jesus may not have existed is a dead point now. he did.
whether he was god or whether there is a god is a completely different
story , however.



most of them

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes. irrational
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism.

(deletion)

theism is correlated with fanaticism. i have neither said that all fanatism
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism. the point is ,
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic. one could of course
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism (for example) , but i just
have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it.

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered.

bogus. i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.
the point is that theism is a factor.

that 's your claim now back it up. i consider your argument as useful
as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism. therefore
belief is a factor in fanaticism. true , and utterly useless. (note , this
is any belief , not belief in gods)

gullibility ,
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more
reliable indicators. and the really dangerous people the sources of
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical manipulators
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing.

that 's a claim you have to support. please note that especially in the
field of theism , the leaders believe what they say.

if you believe that , you 're incredibly naive.

now , some
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism ,
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction
of religious freedom. ever read animal farm \?

that 's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to
fanatism , and not all fanatism is caused by theism. the point is ,
there is a correlation , and it comes from innate features of theism.

no , some of it comes from features which some theism has in common
with some fanaticism. your last statement simply is n't implied by
what you say before , because you 're trying to sneak in innate features
of all theism . the word you 're groping for is some .

gullibility , by the way , is one of them.

no shit , sherlock. so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism ,
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have , as opposed
to the case you are trying to make \?

and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men. interesting that you have nothing better to offer.

i said it reads like a warm up to that. that 's because it 's an irrational
and bogus tirade , and has no other use than creating a nice them us
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either
side of church walls.

(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that
reason is always useful \?


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate. one point is that
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information.

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would
be irrational. which is it \?

that 's bogus. self reference is not circular. and since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems , it is allowed.

o.k. , it 's oval. it 's still begging the question , however. and though
that certainly is allowed , it 's not rational. and you claiming to be
rational and all.

at the risk of repeating myself , and hearing we had that before we
did n't hear a refutation before , so we 're back. deal with it
you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful. someone
who thinks reason is crap wo n't buy it , you see.

your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular.

anybody else think godel was silly \?

the first part of the second statement contains no information , because
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an
axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is
used to obtain it.


i 've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here.

an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy. have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice. and further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived. i exist is derived , if you want
it that way.

further , one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.

what is it you are trying to say \?

that at some point , people always wind up saying this datum is reliable
for no particular reason at all. example i am not dreaming .

compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism \? to
say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which
i suspect you do not have.


using the traditonal definition of gods. personal , supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world. usually connected to morals and or
the way the world works.

imo , any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational. that does
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of
intelligence. some atheists are also scientists , for example.

the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis. however , the beliefs say they are
more than a work hypothesis.

i do n't understand this. can you formalise your argument \?

person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice. that does not make
b true , it is at best a work hypothesis. however , the content of b is that
it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis. testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b (already believed)
says it is wrong a waste of time not possible. depending on the further
contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed , this can
have interesting effects.

peculiar definition of interesting , but sure. now show that a belief
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak. why are n't my
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants , for example \? maybe they
do n't believe in it. maybe it 's the conjunction of b asserts b and
jail kill dissenters that is important , and the belief in gods is
entirely irrelevant. it certainly seems so to me , but then i have no
axe to grind here.

and in that area , what you care about is whether someone is sceptical ,
critical and autonomous on the one hand , or gullible , excitable and

indeed i may. and one may be an atheist and also be gullible , excitable
and easily led.

i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates
that a person is easily led. whether they have a worship or belief
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be
beside the point.

sure. but whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing ,
not whether they are easily led.

not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible , excitable
and easily led from some concrete cause. in that case we would also
have to discuss if that concrete cause , rather than atheism , was the
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour.

i'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour merely that
it is not relevant to the definition of atheism , which is 'lack of belief in
gods'.

throw away the faq. we can all just ask mr o'dwyer , since he can

i have considered it. but if someone spreads falsehoods out of
ignorance then they are still spreading falsehoods. those falsehoods
generally do not come out of nowhere but are produced by people
who know that what they are saying is (at least ) not the whole
truth. i still consider such spreading of falsehoods propaganda
on some level.


i'm not in a position to say , since i know nothing
about the situation. that does not , in my estimation , qualify me
as having my head up my ass.


bob , i never accused you of having your head up your ass ! it takes
me quite some time in dealing with someone before accusing them of
having their head up their ass. i was accusing the original poster

as per various threads on science and creationism , i 've started dabbling into a
book called christianity and the nature of science by jp moreland.

as i do n't know this book , i will use your heresay.

a question
that i had come from one of his comments. he stated that god is not
necessarily a religious term , but could be used as other scientific terms that
give explanation for events or theories , without being a proven scientific
fact.

it depends on how he defines god. the way i understand the meaning
of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. ideas drawn
from an understanding that god is supernatural precludes us from forming
scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide
that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations
drawn from them.

some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within
science to make them more reconcilable , and especially subserviant in a basic
way , to religious dogma. this pursuit always fails.

i think i got his point i can quote the section if i'm being vague.
the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates. are there
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
themselves , or can everything be quantified , measured , tested , etc. \?

reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the
tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge ,
or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. it
gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge
while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. science
and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional
answers , at best. science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful
questions. more questions can be posed than it can answer. at the basis of
sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve
in contradiction.

faith and dogma are inevitable. christians merely understand and admit
to the fact. give me your proof that no god exists , or that he does.
whichever position you take , you are forced to do it on faith. it does
no good to say you take no position , for to show no interest in the
existence of god is to assume he does not exist.

consider special relativity. it has n't be proved , nor has it been
disproved. no one has a proof one way or the other , but many people
are interested in it !

i 've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the
existence of god one way or the other. the two possibilities
are supernaturalism and naturalism. of course no set of circumstances can
be inconsistent with supernaturalism , but similarly , no set of circumstances
can be inconsistent with naturalism. in naturalism , any phenomenon that
could be described as god is considered part of the natural world , to
be studied as any other natural phenomenon (gravity , for instance).
for example , if a loud ``godlike'' voice vociferously announced , ``i
am god , i exist , and i will prove it by reversing the force of gravity , ''
and if then gravity did indeed reverse , a naturalist (probably a scientist)
would say , ``boy , we sure did n't understand gravity as well as we
thought we did , and that loud voice is something new. perhaps we
did n't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either.''

i contend that proper implementation of the christian faith requires
reasoning , but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you
do n't like , or find uncomfortable. hedonistic sexual behavior is
condemned in the bible and no act of true reason will make it any
less condemned. hatred , murder , gossip all these are condemned.
is there god ordained murder in the bible \? you bet , and if god ever
orders me to kill you , i will. but i will first use the gideon like
behavior of verifying that god actually ordered the hit , and will
probably discuss it in an abram like fashion.

i'm sure glad you do n't know where i live , since you do n't seem
to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices
in your head , and god 's voice.

i can hear you now , this is how jim jones and david koresh justify
their behavior. delusional religious cults bear the same relationship
to christianity that rape bears to consentual sex form but no substance.
when the southern baptist church or the methodist church begin to do this
then you have reason to blame mainstream religion for the behaviors of these
people. or should i associate every negative behavior i witness in any
non christian with you \?

you seem to have missed my point. even if jim jones and david koresh
were not religious people , my point remains that faith and dogma
are dangerous , and religion encourages them. jim jones and david koresh
also encouraged them. my point does not rely on jim jones and david
koresh being religious.

one really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be
interpreted , even though this would hardly seem moral. for example the best
thing for me is to ensure that i will eat and drink enough. hence all actions
must be weighed against this one statement. whatever helps this goal is
moral , whatever does not is immoral

of course this leads such a blank space there are so many different ways to
fulfill a goal , one would need a hyper morality to apply to just the methods.

i never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral , but i think
it could be. how do we differentiate between not doing something because it is
a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as
immoral \? do we fall to what the basis of these morals are \?

seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think
about it long enough ) on the other hand , maybe it is our first gut
reaction... which \? who knows perhaps here we have a way to discriminate
morals. i do n't instinctively thing vegetarianism is right (the same way i

possible ! \? ) ) see the difference \?

the point of my post was that rushdie was not being condemned solely
for the words in his book (although this was certainly a contributing
factor). it was the whole series of actions of rushdie and his
publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media
spotlight placed on the book , that (in large part) led to the fatwa. the
kind of fatwa levelled against rushdie is not lightly placed and there
are any number of anti islamic writers both within and outside the
islamic world who have not had fatwas made against them. here , someone
who adds fuel to an explosive situation , might be charged with incitement
to riot if people die in the rioting the charges against him might
become even more serious.

how can rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating
against him \? the deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with
the demonstrations , or on the demonstrators themselves , if they were
violent. to what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour
against rushdie \?

once the rushdie situation exploded into the media , the muslim voice on
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes
showing
the dramatic highlights of muslim demonstrations. for every twenty or so
newspaper , magazine articles , interviews etc. supporting rushdie , there
would
appear one muslim voice. this person was usually selected based on how
dramatic and incoherent he was , not on his knowledge of islam or the
situation at the time. this approx. twenty to one ratio continued
throughout the escalation of the crisis , with rushdie in the central
spotlight as the man of the moment , the valiant defender of everyman 's
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (as an aside , it 's
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up ,
some books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued
to be banned here. it was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of
hate towards these groups. for muslims this kind of double standard
was annoying.)

rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at
organized
islam , and he did so with admirable verbal skill. the only kind of islam
which rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular islam an islam
separated from it 's qur'an , it 's prophet , god , its legislation , and most
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena. fine rushdie
made
his views known the muslim 's made their anger at his book known. the
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions it was , by this
time ,
already a political situation affecting governments as well as
individuals.
the situation was a serious one , with far reaching political implications.
at the centre of this turmoil was rushdie , throwing fuel on the fire
engaged
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.

now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as

this has no responsibility , has no reason to exercise restraint of any
kind , has no
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till
matters calm down. perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary
work , no matter what insult they find within it. perhaps you see him as
a kind of secular heroic knight , mounted on the his media steed ,
doing battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism .

well khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who
grew up in a muslim atmosphere , knew well what muslim 's hold dear ,
who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions
to slander , insult , and attack islam and its most notable personalities
who , when
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis , continued with
his mischief in the world stage of the media who , even after people were
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation ,
continued his mischief , instead of having the good sense to desist.
khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale , mischief
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. the deaths
of muslims around the world and rushdie 's continued media mischief
even after this , was the triggering factor that seemed to
decide khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. the person at the
centre of all these events was rushdie he was the source of the
continuing mischief all media support , government support was
just that support. the source was rushdie (and his publishers , who
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy
to see rushdie constantly in the media). the islamic rulings that
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand scale mischief
making , was applied to rushdie.

you 're attempts at justification are not doing the
image of islam any good.

i have made no attempts at justification , only at explanation. image is
the chief concern of muslim 'apologists' for islam and for rushdie.
if muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub culture
within a larger secular culture , such that the secular principles and laws
had precedence over the laws of islam then i have no doubt that islam
would then be thought to have a good image (principally because it would
by and large reflect the secular image). a good image usually means be
more
like me .

your attempts at totally exonerating rushdie reflect exactly the attitude
that
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.

in iran , the situation was monitored for many
months when rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free
worldwide voice that the media gave him , the situation was monitored
more seriously. when , even after many deaths occured worldwide , rushdie
still did not desist the fatwa was pronounced. when behaving like
a total jerk endangers lives , and the jerk sees this and still insists
on his right to behave like a total jerk he has the rug jerked out
from under him.

if the muslims did n't make such a big fuss over the book , like issuing
death threats , and killing publishers , no one would have heard of it.

the fatwa came later much later. if rushdie did n't mouth off so much in
the
media , the fuss would have died down no one would have been killed , no
fatwa would have been passed the whole episode would have fizzled away.

with the southern baptist convention convening this june to consider
the charges that freemasonry is incompatible with christianity , i thought
the following quotes by mr. james holly , the anti masonic flag carrier ,
would amuse you all...

the following passages are exact quotes from the southern
baptist convention and freemasonry by james l. holly , m.d. , president
of mission and ministry to men , inc. , 550 n 10th st. , beaumont , tx
77706.

the inside cover of the book states mission ministry to men ,
inc. hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of
this booklet with two provisions one , the material is not changed and
two , the source is identified. i have followed these provisions.

freemasonry is one of the allies of the devil page iv.

the issue here is not moderate or conservative , the issue is god
and the devil page vi.

it is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public
school education in america were freemasons page 29.

jesus christ never commanded toleration as a motive for his
disciples , and toleration is the antithesis of the christian message.
page 30.

the central dynamic of the freemason drive for world unity
through fraternity , liberty and equality is toleration. this is seen
in the writings of the 'great' writers of freemasonry . page 31.

he jesus christ established the most sectarian of all possible
faiths. page 37.

for narrowness and sectarianism , there is no equal to the lord
jesus christ . page 40.

what seems so right in the interest of toleration and its
cousins liberty , equality and fraternity is actually one of the
subtlest lies of the 'father of lies.' page 40.

the southern baptist convention has many churches which were
founded in the lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the
lodge. each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of
repentance and of praying the blood and the name of the lord jesus
christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the
dedication of the church and or building. page 53 54.

i was talking to the head of the archeology dept. once in college and
the topic of mormon archeology came up. it seems that the mormon church
is (or was) big on giving grants to archeologists to prove that the
native americans are really the lost tribe of israel and other such
bunk. the archeologists would shake their head knowingly while listening
to them , take the grant , and go off to do real archeology anyway.

actually , it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us
and allied action. if some back water country took over some other
back water country , we probably would n't intervene. not that we do n't
care , but we ca n't be the world 's policman. or if a coup had occured
in kuwait (instead of an invasion) , then we still would n't have acted
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to
saudi arabia. but the combination of the two , an unprovoked invasion
by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west 's oil
interests , caused us to take action.

there are many indications that would have taken place had saddam
been wanting or planning on going into saudi arabia. there were
none. this has been openly stated by ex pentagon analysts. pull.

i'm not setting up a strawman at all. if you want to argue against the
war , then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep
kuwait. diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective.

actually , reports from other mid east countries showed that hussein
was ready to make concessions due to the sanctions. we just did n't want

basically , saddam was ok with us. he was a killer , who tortured his

agrino@enkidu.mic.cl (andres grino brandt) asks about mormons.

there are some mention about events , places , or historical persons
later discovered by archeologist \?

one of the more amusing things in the bom is a claim that a
civilization existed in north america , aroun where the mystical plates
were found. not only did it use steel and other metals , but it had
lots of wars (very ot). no one has ever found any metal swords or
and traces of a civilization other than the native americans.

this is just one example.

from free inquiry , winter 83 84 , the following is an
introduction to the article joseph smith and the book of
mormon , by george d. smith. the introduction is written by
paul kurtz.

mormonism the church of jesus christ of latter day saints
claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million. it is one of
the world 's fastest growing religions , with as many as
200 , 000 new converst in 1982 alone. because of the church 's
aggressive missionary program , covering more than one
hundred countries , it is spreading even to third world
countries.

mormonism is both puritanical in moral outlook and
evangelical in preachment. the church is run along strict
authoritarian lines. led by a president , who allegedly
receives revelations directly form god , and a group of
twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief
and practice , the church is opposed to abortion ,
pornography , sexual freedom , women 's rights , and other , in
its view , immoral influences of secular society , and it
forbids the use of tobacco , alcohol , coffee , and tea.

centered in salt lake city , the church is extremely wealthy
and politically powerful in utal and many other western
states. among well know present day mormons are ezra taft
benson (former secretary of agriculture) , the osmond family ,
the mariotts of the hotel empire , and a score of high placed
government officials.

the mormon church was founded in western new york in 1830 by
joseph smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had
found gold plates containing hieroglyphics buried on a hill
and that with the help of visits from the angel moroni he
had been able to translate the writing into the book of
mormon , the basis of mormon belief. this book , written by
the commandment of god , claims that the ancient hebrews
settled in america about 600 b.c.e. and were the ancestors
of the american indians. mormons believe that those who
have been baptized in the true church will be reunited
after death and that deceased non mormon family members can
be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the
hereafter. because of these beliefs , mormons have been
considered outcasts by mainline christian denominations and
as heretics by religious fundamentalists.

joseph smith was a controversial figure in his day he was
both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud. because
of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from
palmyra , new york , westward to ohio and then to illinois ,
where in 1844 he was shot to death by an agry mob. brigham
young , who reportedly had as many as eighty wives , took over
the leadership of the church and led the mormons further
westward , to found the new zion in salt lake city.
following the teachings of joseph smith in the practice of
polygamy was perhaps the mormons most controversial practice
in nineteenth century america.

while other religions go back many centuries
muhammadanism , 1200 years christianity , 2000 and judaism ,
3000 and attempts to examine their beginnings are
difficult , extensive historical investigation of mormon
roots is possible. some mormons are willing to examine this
history objectively , bu others maintain that such scrutiny
is dangerous to the faith.

in the following pages , free inquiry presents two articles
about the mormon church. first , george d. smith , a lifelong
member of the church , provides a detailed critical
examination of joseph smith and his claim the the book of
mormon was divinely revealed. second , we present a portion
of an interview with philosopher sterling mcmurrin , also a
mormon since birth , who questions the treatment of the
history of the church by mormon authorities. paul kurtz

i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view as i 've articulated it above (which may not be
the true view of khomeini) is from the basic principles of islam.
so that the non muslim readers of this group will see how far from
the simple basics of islam such views are on the face of them. and
if they are not in contradiction with the basics of islam , how
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in islam while
they are explicitly proscribed by the qur'an.

discussing it here is fine by me. shall we start a new thread called ,
say , infallibility in islam and move the discussion there \?

i think this should be illuminating to all. let me make a first
suggestion. when arabic words , especially technical ones , become of use
let us define them for those , especially atheists , to whom they may not be
terribly familiar. please also note that though i did initially refer
to khomeini as a heretic for what i understood to be a claim rejected
by you since of personal infallibility , i withdraw this as a basis
for such a statement. i conditionally retain this reference in regard
to khomeini 's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the
so called twelve imams , which is in clear conflict with the qur'an
in that it places the twelve imams in a category of behavior and example
higher than that of the muhammad , in that the qur'an shows that the
prophet was clearly fallible , as well as (it appears , given your
abstruse theological statment regarding the natures of the twelve
imams) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the
remainder of humanity , with the possible exception of muhammad ,
something which verges on the sin of association.

another article that fell between the cracks

in article 1qiu97innpq6@srvr1.engin.umich.edu ingles@engin.umich.edu (ray ingles) writes
as evidence for the resurrection , it is often claimed that the disciples
were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce
their claim that jesus had come back from the dead.
now , i skimmed acts and such , and i found a reference to this happening
to stephen , but no others. where does this apparently very widely held
belief come from \? is there any evidence outside the bible \? is there any
evidence in the bible \? i sure have n't found any...

briefly , no. there is widespread folklore , but no good documentary
evidence , or even solid rumor , concerning the deaths of the apostles.
further , the usual context of such arguments , as you observe , is no
martyrs for a lie i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather
than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief. this adds the
quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered
the chance of life by recanting. since we do n't even know how or
where they died , we certainly do n't have this information. (by the
way , even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could
have saved himself by recanting). the willingness of true believers
to die for their belief , be it in jesus or jim jones , is
well documented , so martyrdom in and of itself says little. see
1kings18 20 40 for a biblical account of the martyrdom of 450 priests
of baal .

when he asked for this book , the well educated american book store
assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section ,

should receive the book soon. in some places the assistants bluntly
said that they do n't know of such an author , or that he is not
a well known living author , so they do n't keep copies of his books.

such is the life and times of america , 200 years after the revolution.

on a similar note , a good friend of mine worked as a clerk in a
chain bookstore. several of his peers were amazing , one woman in

a customer asked her if they had the autobiography of benjamin

noting that a particular society , in this case the mainland uk ,
has few religously motivated murders , and few murders of any
kind , says very little about whether inter religion murders elsewhere
are religiously motivated.

no , but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent
in all religion (or for that matter , in catholicism and protestantism)
that motivates one to kill.

motivates or allows \? the christian bible says that one may kill
under certain circumstances. in fact , it instructs one to kill under
certain circumstances.

i 'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them
to kill under certain circumstances. i do get your distinction between
motivate and allow , and i do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'
atoricities , then that 's an indictment of that theism. but it rather
depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are. when you talk about
christianity , or islam , then at least your claims can be understood.
it 's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls
apart. one could believe in a god which instructs one to be utterly
harmless.

for my part , i conclude that something
else is required. i also happen to believe that that something
else will work no less well without religion any easy them us will
do.

and what does religion supply , if not an easy them us \?

not necessarily. love thy neighbour does not supply a them us it
demolishes it. and my definition of religion is broader than my
definition of theism , as i have explained.

by insisting that even the murder of four labourers , chosen because
they were catholics , and who had nothing to do with the ira , by
protestant extremists , is not religously motivated , i think what
you are saying is that you simply will not accept any murder as
being religiously motivated.

no. what about that guy who cut off someone 's head because he believed
he was the devil incarnate \? that was religously motivated.

what about the protestant extremists who killed four catholic
labourers \? that was n't religiously motivated \?

not in my opinion. if they were doing it because of some obscure
point of theology , then yes. but since all protestants do n't do this
(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them) , it 's just too broad
too say religion did this . i'm saying that the causes are far more
complex than that take away the religious element , and you 'd still
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism. you
know , when most catholics and protestants worldwide say 'stop the
killing' , one might listen to that , especially when you claim not
to read minds.


also , the murders ensuing from the fatwa on mr. rushdie , the inquisitions ,
and the many religous wars.

what 's so special about these exceptions \? is n't this all just a
grab bag of ad hoc excuses for not considering some other murders
to be religiously motivated \? what 's the general principle behind
all this \?

the general principle is that it 's fairly clear (to me , at least) that
religion is the primary motivator (enabler , whatever) of these. it 's
not nearly so obvious what 's going on when one looks at ni , apart
from violence of course.

it 's not an abstract argument . northern irish protestants say
we do n't want to be absorbed into am officially catholic country.

now what are we supposed to do \? are we supposed to reply no ,
that 's only what you think you do n't want. mr o'dwyer assures us
that no matter what you say you want , you really want something
else \?

you think the unionists would n't mind being absorbed into a non catholic
country (other than the uk of course) \? it 's a terrible thing to lose
a mind. maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks.
i certainly do n't believe that the unionists are in it for god i think
they wish to maintain their position of privilege.

i'm still listening to what they say , and you are still telling us
your version of what they think. you read minds , and i do n't.

you 've speculated on my motives often enough , and you do n't take
my statements of my own beliefs at face value therefore your claim
not to read minds has no credibility with me , sorry. i also note that
you fail to answer my question. it just looks to me very much like
you have an axe to grind especially as you are indeed ignoring what
most protestants say which is @stop the killing . the people you
refer to are properly described as unionists , not protestants.

as for their position of privilege , what is that if not religion
based \?

it is based on politics , bigotry , and heartless extremism. none of these
things are synonymous with religion , though there is certainly some
overlap.

perhaps you can explain the difference to me , since you seem to see it
so clearly.

(rest deleted)

that 's a fallacy , and it is not the first time it is pointed out.

it 's not a fallacy note the if. if a supermajority of disinterested people
agree on a fundamantal value (we 're not doing ethics yet benedikt) , then what
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial
observation \?


the reference to it 's not yet being ethics is dubious. you have used the terms
absolute , objective and others interchangeably. same with moral values , values ,
at all , worth , measuers , and usefulness. you infer from them as if they were
the same.

to the if. when the if is not fulfilled , your intermission is a waste of time.
assuming that you do n't intend this , it is reasonable to conclude that you
want to argue a point.

you have made a interesting statement here , namely that of the disinterested
observer. there is no such thing in morals. probably the shortest proof for
objective and morality being a contradiction.


for one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. unlike
a football. further , you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. the analogy
does not hold.

i have , however , given an example of a value people agree on , and explained
why. people will agree that their freedom is valuable. i have also
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective
ethics the if assertion above. and that is what i'm talking about , there
is n't a point in talking about ethics if this ca n't be agreed.


fine. and that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon. i could
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite. (not that that was n't
mentioned before). in other words , you have nothing to fulfill your strong
claims with.


one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football ,
while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals you have to give.

i'm not doing morals (ethics) if we ca n't get past values. as i say ,
the only cogent objection to my 'freedom' example is that maybe people
are n't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable.
maybe not , and i want to think about this some , especially the implications
of its being true.


clutching a straw. i do n't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were
loaded terms are fixpoints. those who deny the morality of freedom make quite
clear what they say , their practice is telling. yes , there are even those who
are willingly unfree. it is quite common in religions , by the way. for one ,
there is a religion which is named submission.

do n't even try to argue that submission is freedom.


further , the above is evidence , not proof. proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.

garbage. that 's not proof either.


if it were so , it would argue my case. but i am afraid that that is considered
proof.


the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer
the objections. evidence that you are a preacher.

name that fallacy.

there is something universally valued in a moral context.

i realise that this is widely held belief in america , but in fact
the clause on cruel and unusual punishments , like a lot of the
rest , was lifted from the english bill of rights of 1689.

according to jerry mander 's in the absence of the sacred (good
book , btw) , the great binding law of the iroquois confederacy
also played a significant role as a model for the u.s. constitution.
furthermore , apparently marx and engels were strongly influenced
by a study of iroquois society , using it as the prime example of
a successful , classless , egalitarian , noncoercive society. mander
goes on to say that both the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. would do well
to study the original document , figure out where each went wrong ,

this post of mine also illustrates that i am not simply a reactionary
who hates any book which does n't go out of its way to avoid upsetting

only those you have n't actually read \? sorry , but the irony remains.

i reiterate for the nth time also that i do n't agree with k 's fatwa ,
nor do i support censorship. my point in the original thread has been
to show why rushdie is not particularly due sympathy by those who hold
their religion in high esteem and do n't enjoy seeing things which slander
it (like the story of the satanic verses (as opposed to the rushdie 's
tsv )) played with for amusement.

so although you do n't agree with the fatwa , and apparently do n't think
rushdie should be killed for his book , yet you think he is not due
sympathy for being being under this threat. furthermore you base this
reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular
well known story which if true might reflect poorly on the
absolute truth of your religion. yet , this opinion is formed without
recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context ,

many of the atheists posting here argue against their own parody of
religion they create some ridiculous caricature of a religion and
then attack the believers within that religion and the religion itself
as ridiculous. by their own devices , they establish a new religion , a
mythology.

that is not an atheism mythology in any sense of the word.
religious paradoy would be significantly more appropriate.

the 2nd part is rendered null and void by the simple fact that i
do know several strong atheists. i am sure that others do. i myself am
strong in the sense that i find the standard concept of god without any
meaning. any attempt to bring meaning either results in the destruction of
the viability of language , or in internal self contradiction.

the concept of strong atheism is not just a whimsical fantasy. they ,
and i , exist.

your strawman is pointless and weak.

12) the 2 cheribums are on the ark of the covenant. when god said make no
graven image , he was refering to idols , which were created to be worshipped.
the ark of the covenant was n't wrodhipped and only the high priest could
enter the holy of holies where it was kept once a year , on the day of
atonement.

i am not familiar with , or knowledgeable about the original language ,
but i believe there is a word for idol and that the translator
would have used the word idol instead of graven image had
the original said idol. so i think you 're wrong here , but

well , suppose a probe emitting radiation at a constant frequency was

reaching the event horizon. the detected energy from the probe would keep
decreasing , but it would n't vanish. exp( t) never quite reaches zero.

that 's kind of what i meant. to be more precise , given any observer , in any

be able to detect the probe having crossed the event horizon \?

yes , unless the observer is at rest with respect to the singularity at

in article 114525@bu.edu jaeger@buphy.bu.edu (gregg jaeger) writes
as promised , here is rafiq zakaria 's discussion of the nature of
the so called satanic verses from which rushdie 's title has been
taken. (rafiq zakaria , muhammad and the quran , penguin '91)

here follows an introduction to the controversial incident , and an
apologetic explanation purporting to show why it could n't actually
have happened. the historicity of the episode does n't matter to what
follows

i do n't know whether i'm quoting gregg or zakaria below. anyway , back
to current affairs ,

rushdie has , by his own admission , drawn
on the version given by the orientalist watt

among others this incident is not something rushdie or watt or anyone
else dug up from nowhere , it is a well known story , a myth if you
will , known (according to umar khan) to every muslim school boy and
girl , and so presumably to rushdie , and to gibreel farishta.

and then allowed his
imagination to run wild

yes , this is what writing fiction is all about. rushdie was writing
about a crisis of faith , and chose this myth to present it , by placing
the actor gibreel in the role of the angel whose name he took.
rushdie was not writing a history or theology book , and nowhere claims
or implies that this is what actually happened. it 's somewhat like
stories woven around the relationship between jesus and the reformed
prostitute mary magdalene (another myth). or those referring to the
arthurian mythos , or the grail legend , or the wandering jew , or dozens
of others. if you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer ,
consider salman rushdie 's children 's book haroun and the sea of
stories for an idea of the way a storyteller a specific
storyteller works with existing story lines.

to ridicule muhammad 's integrity...

no. muhammad 's mahound 's integrity is not really impugned in this
part of the story , and there 's no reason to think this was rushdie 's
intent gibreel , as the archangel , produces the verses (divine and
satanic) , though he does n't know their provenance. it is not implied
(in a straight reading) that muhammad influences them

not my voice i 'd never know such words i'm no classy speaker
never was never will be but this is n't my voice it 's a voice.
mahound 's eyes open wide , he 's seeing some kind of vision ,
staring at it , oh , that 's right , gibreel remembers , me. he 's
seeing me. my lips moving , being moved by. what , whom \? do n't
know , ca n't say. nevertheless , here they are , coming out of my
mouth , up my throat , past my teeth the words.
being god 's postman is no fun , yaar.
butbutbut god is n't in this picture.
god knows whose postman i 've been.

it 's ambiguous is mahound somehow manipulating gibreel \? is it satan \?
or something else \? the answer is not given.

to be sure , the question is raised. this novel explores faith and the
role of revelation in religion , among other things. addressing loss
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation ,
but this novel proposes no answers , at least not directly. the very
existence of a newsgroup named alt.atheism raises the same
questions , more forcefully , and does propose some answers , which is
the real relevance. if rushdie 's mild fictional exploration is filth
and lies , and he asked for what he got , are we next on the fatwa
list \? (that 's a rhetorical question , of course.)

i love god just as much as she loves me. if she wants to seduce me ,
she 'll know what to do.

but if he she did you would probably consider it rape.

of course not. i would think that would be great fun , not having ever
felt the joy and peace the christians speak of with a longing gaze.
this is not what i got when i believed i just tried to hide my fear
of getting punished for something i never was sure of. the bible is
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. god did
not answer. in the end , i found i had been following a mass delusion ,
a lie. i ca n't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint
of her existence.

obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe. so .. \?

i suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe
and analyse their position. in fact , it is amusing to note in this
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the
opposite one should not examine one 's belief critically.

i 'll tell you something i left out of my 'testimony' i posted to this
group two months ago. a day after i finally found out my faith is over ,
i decided to try just one more time. the same cycle of emotional
responses fired once again , but this time the delusion lasted only
a couple of hours. i told my friend in a phone that it really works ,
thank god , just to think about it again when i hung up. i had to admit
that i had lied , and fallen prey to the same illusion.

no one asks you to swallow everything , in fact jesus warns against it. but let
me ask you a question. do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for
that matter anything in school. i mean it 's just what other people have told
you and you do n't want to swallow what others say. right ... \?

i used to believe what i read in books when i was younger , or what
other people told me , but i grew more and more skeptical the more i
read. i learned what it means to use reason .

as a student of chemistry , i had to perform a qualitative analysis
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. i hated experiments
like this they are old fashioned and increase the student 's workload
considerably. besides , i had to do it twice , since i failed in my first
attempt. however , i think i 'll never forget the lesson

no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is x ,
it may still be y. it is very tempting to jump into conclusions , take
a leap of faith , assure oneself , ignore the data which is inconsistent.
but it can still be wrong.

i found out that i was , after all , using exactly the same mechanism
to believe in god mental self assurance , suspension of fear ,
filtering of information. in other words , it was only me , no god
playing any part.

the life , death , and resurection of christ is documented historical fact.

oh \? and i had better believe this \? dan , many ufo stories are much better
documented than the resurrection of jesus. the resurrection is documented
quite haphazardly in the bible it seems the authors did not pay too
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. besides , the ends of
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance ,
the end of mark (16 9 20) is missing from many early texts , says my bible.

jesus may have lived and died , but he was probably misunderstood.

as much
as anything else you learn. how do you choose what to believe and
what not to \?

this is easy. i believe that the world exists independent of my mind ,
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what i
observe. nothing else need to be taken on faith , i will go by the
evidence.

it makes no difference whether i believe george washington existed or not.
i assume that he did , considering the vast amount of evidence presented.

there is no way to get into a sceptical heart. you can not say you have
given a
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have. you must trust ,
not just go
to church and participate in it 's activities. were you ever willing to
die for what you believed \?

a liar , how do you know what my attitude was \? try reading your bible
again.

i was willing to die for my faith. those who do are usually remembered
as heroes , at least among those who believe. dan , do you think i'm
lying when i say i believed firmly for 15 years \? it seems it is
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not
do so anymore. but i ca n't go on lying to myself.

blind trust is dangerous , and i was just another blind led by the blind.
but if god really wants me , she 'll know what to do. i'm willing. i just
do n't know whether she exists looking at the available evidence ,
it looks like she does n't.

war because he ca n't stand to live in the same country as all these other ,
non god fearing people.

its a survival trait. there are only a fixed number of resources (people)
for religions to inhabit. the doctrines of intolerance and not using
birth control are devices whereby the meme of the (capital r) religion
of christianity gains a larger share of the population than its memetic

strange constructions of indian english the yaar at the end of a
sentence , butbutbut , the occasional hindi phrase , etc.)

yes , this took some getting used to of course not having an indian
connection , no knowledge of hindi , etc. , this was not trivial for me.
i did have , thanks to the wonders of the net , a glossary to satanic
verses , posted to rec.arts.books by vijay raghavan , which explains a

even the islamic references ( jahilia , submission , the context of

and which order of creation do you accept \? the story of creation is one of the
many places in the bible where the story contradicts itself. the following is
an example...

gen 1 25 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle
after their kind , and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his
kind and god saw that it was good.
gen 1 26 and god said , let us make man in our image , after our likeness
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of
the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every
creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.

gen 2 18 and the lord god said , it is not good that the man should be
alone i will make him an help meet for him.
gen 2 19 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the
field , and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he

what i said was that people took time to copy the text correctly.
translations present completely different issues.


so why do i read in the papers that the qumram texts had different
versions of some ot texts. did i misunderstand \?

reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in
the world. newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of
religion , and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real
story (that is , a bigger headline).

let 's back up to 1935. at this point , we have the masoretic text , the
various targums (translations commentaries in aramaic , etc.) , and the
septuagint , the ancient greek translation. the masoretic text is the
standard jewish text and essentially does not vary. in some places it has
obvious corruptions , all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.
these passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and
to the septuagint.

so when they took the time to copy the text correctly , that includes
obvious corruptions \?


now , the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars
first , it includes additional texts , and second , in some passages there are
variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to fixing predating
the various corrupted passages). it must be emphasized that , to the best of
my knowledge , these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars , and
have little theological import.

so when they took the time to copy the text correctly , that does not
exclude variant readings from the masoretic text which are of little
theological import


the dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of
isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other ot books. there
is also an abundance of other material , but as far as i know , there is no
sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the
septuagint). as far as analysis has proceeded , there are also variations
between the dss texts and the masoretic versions. these tend to reflect the
septuagint , where the latter is n't obviously in error. again , though , the
differences (thus far) are not significant theologically. there is this big
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the
material , but so far this has n't happened.

the dss are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the
ot , unlike for the nt.

hey , you 're the expert.

... actually , i rather like your idea. perhaps
the rest of the world should have bombed (or maybe missiled) washington
when the us invaded nicaragua , grenada , panama , vietnam , mexico , hawaii ,
or any number of other places.

wait a minute , doug. i know you are better informed than that. the us
has never invaded nicaragua (as far as i know). we liberated grenada
...

liberate is the way an invader describes an invasion , including , if
i'm not mistaken , the iraqi liberation of kuwait. never invaded
nicaragua \? only with more word games can you say send in the
marines \?

so if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where
we cross someone 's border , you are right 5 out of 6. but normally
invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation.
(if some nation invades the u.s. virgin islands , would they be
invading the virgin islands or the u.s. \? ) so from this point of
view , your score falls to 2 out of 6 (mexico , panama).

oh , good word games. if you let the aggressor pick the words ,
there 's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action.


what 's a peace nik \? is that somebody who does n't masturbate
over guns'n'ammo or what \? is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik \?

no , it 's someone who believes in peace at all costs . in other words ,
a person who would have supported giving hitler not only austria and
czechoslakia , but poland too if it could have averted the war. and one
who would allow hitler to wipe all all jews , slavs , and political
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.

that 's a convenient technique , much seen on alt.atheism define those
who disagree with you according to a straw man extreme that matches
virtually nobody.

is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik , you ask \? well , it depends
on what your values are. if you value life over liberty , peace over
freedom , then i guess not. but if liberty and freedom mean more to you
than life itself if you 'd rather die fighting for liberty than live
under a tyrant 's heel , then yes , it 's bad to be a peace nik.

very noble and patriotic. i'm sure the fine young americans who
carpet bombed iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon ,
destroyed iraq 's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the
sky or further , or who bulldozed other iraqi infantry into their
trenches or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to were
just thrilled to be risking death (if not risking it by much) in the
defense of the liberty of ... well , wealthy kuwaitis. ca n't have
those oil fields under a tyrant 's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic
to us interests...

the problem with most peace niks it they consider those of us who are
not like them to be bad and unconscionable . i would not have any
argument or problem with a peace nik if they held to their ideals and
stayed out of all conflicts or issues , especially those dealing with
the national defense. but no , they are not willing to allow us to
legitimately hold a different point of view.

having pigeon holed peace niks (in this context , people who
disagree with me about the conduct of the gulf war ) into
peace at all cost hitler supporting genocide abetting wimps , you can
now express righteous indignation when they refuse to fit this mold
and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms. how dare
they !

they militate and
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace. (what rank
hypocrisy ! )

yes , hypocrisy indeed ! those violent peace niks ! (care to list an
example here \? )

all to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up
and defend our freedoms against tyrants , and who realize that to do
so requires a strong national defense.

wow instant '80 's nostalgia ! of course , peace nik itself is a
'50 's cold war derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism
with godless pinko communists . yes indeed , i felt my freedoms
mightily threatened by iraq...

just like history is written by the `winners' and not the `losers.'
from what i 've seen of religions , a religion is just a cult that
was so vile and corrupt it was able to exert it 's doctrine using

attracting more converts due to his `strength , ' hence becoming a

that is , since observation is not 100 reliable , how can we say
that anything is real . i do n't think this was the intention
of the original question , since you now define out the word
real so that nothing can meet its criteria.
just a thought.

brian

ps rainbows and shadows are real they are not objects , they
are phenomenon. an interesting question would be if atoms
are objects (classical) or phenomenon (neo quantum) or what \?

i 've been following this train of talk , and the question of dismissing atoms as
being in some sense not real leaves me uneasy.

it seems to be implied that we obseve only the effects , and therefore the
underlying thing is not necessarily real. the tree outside my window is in
this category... is observe the light which bounces off of it , not the tree
itself. the observation is indirect , but no more so than observations i have
made of atoms.

also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done
with individual atoms. i am thinking in particular of atom trapping
experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum zeno
effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time.

some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying
either. one has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid
technical background in the field. what i read seemed a little confused a
quite a red herring.

anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it
worked. after doing so , i'm willing to try to defend the following assertion
if anyone cares

atoms are as real as trees , and are real in the ussual every day sense of the
word real .

who did or do. but we did sell arms to hussein , and it 's a done deal.

sell arms to hussein.

arms to saudi arabia. the same month , we sold jet fighters to the same

it 's all very well to say oops , we made a boo boo , better clean up the

by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
economy reliant on arms sales.

point morals are , in essence , personal opinions. usually
(ideally) well founded , motivated such , but nonetheless personal. the
fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question ,
sometimes even for the same reason , does not make morals objective it
makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question ,
which can be good for the evolution of a social species.

and if a real large lot (nice phrase) of people agree that there is a
football on a desk , i'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two \?
perhaps you can explain the difference to me , since you seem to see it
so clearly.

(rest deleted)

that 's a fallacy , and it is not the first time it is pointed out.
for one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon. unlike
a football. further , you conveniently ignore here that there are
many who would not agree on tghe morality of something. the analogy
does not hold.

one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football ,
while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees
with a set of morals you have to give.

further , the above is evidence , not proof. proof would evolve out of testing
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories.


the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer

physics when you relate it to the real world , and if we ca n't do that

applied science but even theoretical physics gets applied to models of real

(consider , for instance , that speed of light in

speed of light in vacuum.)

it 's an axiom that it 's invariant. but if the two of us measure it , we 'll
get different answers. yes , we call that experimental error , but it 's not

diplomatic )

i realize i'm fighting occam 's razor in this argument , so i 'll try to
explain why i feel a mind is necessary.

firstly , i'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms. they 're
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out , but not
at working out the method itself.

as a specific example , i like to solve numerical crosswords (not the
simple do the sums and insert the answers type , the hard ones.) to do
these with any efficiency , you need to figure out a variety of tricks.
now , i know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles , but
in doing so you have to work out the tricks yourself , and program
them into the computer. you can , of course , 'obfuscate' the trick , and
write the program so that it is uncovered , but as far as i can see ,
the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered. does
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already
pre programmed into our brains \? this is somewhat unlikely , given that
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 chromosomes worth of genetic
material , much of which is n't used.

one way around this is to bring the environment into the equation , but
(again , as far as i can see) this still has an air of 'if you see
object x , then perform action y , ' and we do n't seem to get anywhere.
the algorithm has to anticipate what it might see , and what
conclusions to draw from it 's experience.

the other problem with algorithms is their instability. not many
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code , yet
people survive strokes without going completely haywire (there are
side effects , but patients still seem remarkably stable.) also ,
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate
can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it 's
code \?

the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour \? (replace
'colour' with the sensation of your choice.) presumably , the
materialist viewpoint is that it 's the product of some kind of
chemical reaction. the usual products of such a reaction are energy
different chemicals. is colour a mixture of these \? if this is so , a
computer wo n't see colour , because the chemistry is different. does an
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an
equivalent that does n't \? it should n't , because the outputs of each
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances. so why do
we see colour \?



however , such a view is actually a nonsolution. how should minds be
able to act as observers , feel pain and pleasure and issue
commands any better than the brain \? moreover , how do the interactions
occur \?

a bit of idle speculation...

if i remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction ,
with two processes acting on it. the first process has been called
'unitary evolution' (or 'u') , is governed by schroedinger 's equation
and is well known. the second process , called various things such as
'collapse of the wavefunction' or 'state vector reduction' (or 'r') ,
and is more mysterious. it is usually said to occur when a
'measurement' takes place , although nobody seems to know precisely
when that occurs. when it does occur , the effect of r is to abruptly
change the wavefunction.

i envisage r as an interaction between the wavefunction and 'something
else , ' which i shall imaginitively call 'part x.' it seems reasonable
to assume that something causes r , although that something might be
the wavefunction itself (in which case , part x is simply the
wavefunction. note , though , that we 'd need more than u to explain r.)

anyway , i'm speculating that minds would be in part x. there seems to
be some link between consciousness and r , in that we never see linear
superpositions of anything , although there are alternative
explainations for this. i 've no idea how a brain is supposed to access
part x , but since this is only speculation , that wo n't matter too
much ) my main point is that there might be a place for minds in
physics.

i 'll go back to my nice padded cell now , if that 's ok with you )

well , yes. this is the real mystery of the matter , and why i am rather
dubious of a lot of the source theories.

there are a number of places where the masoretic text (mt) of the ot is
obscure and presumably corrupted. these are reproduced exactly from copy to
copy. the dss tend to reflect the same errors . this would appear to tell
us that , at least from some point , people began to copy the texts very
exactingly and mechanically. the problem is , we do n't know what they did
before that. but it seems as though accurate transmission begins at the
point at which the texts are perceived as texts. they may be added to (and
in some situations , such as the end of mark , material is lost) , but for the
most part there are no substantial changes to the existing text.

you 're basically trying to make a mountain out of a molehill. some people
like to use the game of telephone as a metaphor for the transmission of

the clipper initiative is an announcement by clinton that all the

will be using the keys to listen in on illegal activities. many
people are really scared about such an initiative because it is
a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things
like email if you read the press release. the project was developed
by nsa and given to nist. it uses two keys s1 and s2 that the
government claims are needed to break the code. they claim that
these keys will be handed to two different companies , and when they
get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip) ,
they have to get the keys from both companies. people have poked holes
through and through the press release official version and shown how
it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds , and i have given the simplified

evolution some time ago \?

confuse you on the issue of
divine justice. according to the most fundamental doctrines of
christianity , when the first man sinned , he was at that time the
entire human race and any punishment meted out would necessarily
affect the entire race of which he was the sole representive.all
humans coming after him would , being of the same race (species) , share
in that judgement. it has nothing to do with who deserves what.
from the perspective of god , humanity is but one category of created
things and that category is condemned.

duh , gee , then we must be talking christian mythology now. i
was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable , logical
person , but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition
of the same boring mythology i 've seen a thousand times before.
i am deleting the rest of your remarks , unless i spot something
that approaches an answer , because they are merely a repetition
of some uninteresting doctrine or other and contain no thought
at all.

cobb@alexia.lis.uiuc.edu (mike cobb) writes

merely a question for the basis of morality

moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior .

1)who is society

society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self defined
rules. in terms of un decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented
at the un are considered part of that society. if we then look at us federal
laws provided by representatives of purely us citizens then the society for
that case would be the citizens of the us and so on.

2)how do they define what is acceptable \?

acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the
society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are
non verbally and , in effect , non consciously , such as picking your nose on
the oprah winfrey show , no one does it , but there is no explicit law against
doing it. in many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a
behaviour is acceptable , but one can deduce these behaviours by
observation.


3)how do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position \?

in an increasingly litigation mad society , this trap is becoming exceedingly
difficult to avoid. with the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures
in american (and australian , to bring in my local perspective) culture the
boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may
eventually become the definition of moral behaviour. for instance , some
cultures' dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals.
most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent. however , is
it moral , according to the multicultural american society \? this kind of
problem may only be definable by legislation.

obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is
acceptable behaviour or not , and much of this will be due to different
environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions.

one thing is for sure , there is no universal moral code which will suit all
cultures in all situations. there may , however , be some globally accepted
mores which can be agreed upon and instantiated as a globally enforcable
concept. the majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon
this earth are living in a similar environment (if that ever happens).

imagine that 1000000 alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every
month. suppose further that this money is being paid to you by (a) your
big hearted alterian benefactor , or (b) a bug in an alterian atm. let 's
suppose that this is a true dichotomy , so p(a) p(b) 1. trouble is , alterius
is in a different universe , so that no observations of alterius are possible
(except for the banks you could n't possibly afford it )

now let 's examine the case for (a). there is no evidence whatsoever that
there is any such thing as a big hearted alterian benefactor. however ,
p(exists(b h a b)) p(not(exists(b h a b)) 1. on the grounds that
lack of evidence for is evidence against when we have a partition like
that , we dismiss hypothesis (a).

turning , therefore , to (b) , we also find no evidence to support that
hypothesis. on the same grounds as before , we dismiss hypothesis (b).

the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible
hypotheses , and even though we know by construction that the money
arrives every month , we have proven that it ca n't , because we
have dismissed all of its potential causes.

that 's an extremely poor argument , and here 's why.

premise 1 ...this money is being paid to you by either (a) your big
hearted alterian benefactor , or (b) a bug in an alterian atm .

thus each monthly appearance of the bucks , should it happen , is an
observation on alterius , and by construction , is evidence for the
existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm .

premise 2 no observations on alterius are possible.

(except for the banks you could n't possibly afford it )

you forgot to include this. my premise is actually

premise 2 the cardinality of the set of possible observations on alterius
is one.

this is clearly contradictory to the first.

not if you state it properly.

trouble is , on the basis of premise 2 , you say that there can be no evidence
of either the benefactor or the bug , but the first premise leads to the
conclusion that the appearance of the bucks , should it happen , is evidence
for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug .

voila , a screaming contradiction.

with my highlights sc
but in a strawman argument. there is only evidence for oneof(benefactor , bug).
no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible. that is

not evidence for bug , and neither is it evidence for benefactor. nor

is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as
if there were no benefactor bug (two statements , both would be false).

this is still contradictory. it reduces to

(1) alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug .

(2) this is not evidence for benefactor , neither is it evidence for
bug (meaning that it does n't lend more weight to one than to the
other)

(3) therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence
can exist for bug .

but (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). when you say (paraphrased)
in (2) that this is not evidence for benefactor , for example , what you
mean is that it 's no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug .

yes , that 's what i mean.

in (3) , however , you 've shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor
so that it now means `absolute' evidence for benefactor rather than
`relative' evidence for benefactor w.r.t. bug .

not really , i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other. i
think this is just a communications problem. what i am trying to say ,
in my clumsy way , is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates
to theism making predictions (prayer , your 'rapture' example) , i do n't
buy your use of occam 's razor in all cases where a 0.

in my example , one could n't dismiss
benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity one of these is necessary
to explain the dosh. i brought up the 'one by one dismissal' process to
show that it would be wrong to do so. from what you 're saying in this
post , it seems you agree , and we 're talking at cross purposes.

(3) is still in contradiction to (1).

some sums may help. with b benefactor , b bug , d dosh arrives in account

(1) implies p(b b d) 1

assuming that p(bb d) 0 , so it 's either the benefactor or a bug
which is responsible if the bucks arrive , but not both , then

p(b b d) p(b d) p(b d)

so

p(b d) p(b d) 1

but (3) implies that

p(b d) 0 and p(b d) 0.

no , this is n't what i meant. p(b d) 0.5 and p(b d) 0.5 , with
necessarily no new observation (we 've already seen the dosh) to change
those estimates. i was trying to say (again , in my clumsy way) that
it would be wrong to assign 0 probability to either of these. and that 's
precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods gods are
one class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of
hypotheses one of which is necessary to explain something which otherwise
would not be satisfactorily explained. it can be thrown out or
retained on grounds of non rational preference , not of science or statistics.
alternatively , one could chuck out or retain the lot , on the grounds
that the answer ca n't be known , or that the notional probability estimates
are effectively useless , being equal (agnosticism weak atheism).

as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x ,
where x is gods , pink unicorns , nothing , etc. and no observation
tends to one conclusion over the other.

exactly the point i was making , i think. so we do n't throw out any of
these , contrary to your assertion above that we do.

some people do , simon , and they think they are doing excellent science.
my sole point was that they are n't.

only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis h i (i.e. x
where p(x h i ) 0) can cause p(h i ) to go to zero after a finite
number of observations. only in this case do we get to throw any of the
hypotheses out.

exactly my point , though i may have been unclear.

you said the diametric opposite , which i guess is the source of my confusion.

i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.

what i'm trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of
evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence , this does not hold true for
all , or perhaps any , versions of theism and it is n't true that those for
which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.

on the contrary , those for which it does not hold are exactly those which
can be discarded using the razor. see my post on the other branch of this
thread.

then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of. if
the razor holds for gods , then it holds for all like hypotheses. which
means that you 're assigning p(x h i ) 0 for all i , though we 've already
established that it 's not correct to do so when sum(p(x h i )) 1 over
all i.

simply put , anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or
non existence of gods , whether inductive or no , is at best mistaken , and
at worst barking mad.

luckily i make no such claim , and have specifically said as much on numerous
occasions. you would n't be constructing a strawman here , would you frank \?
although that does n't , of course , rule out my being barking mad in any case
(i could be barking mad in my spare time , with apologies to cleese et al).

but i think you miss the point once again. when i say that something is
evidence against an hypothesis , that does n't imply that observation of
the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis , reducing the
estimate of p(h data) to zero. if it reduces this quantity , it 's still
evidence against h.

no , i got that. i'm talking about the case when a 0. you 're clearly
correct when a ! 0. and i'm not constructing a strawman (though it 's
certainly possible that i 've misunderstood what you 're saying). however ,
by any standards , a system that says when a 0 , gods are highly unlikely ,
and when a ! 0 gods can be dismissed using the razor , is a system purporting
to be an inductive proof that gods either do n't exist , or are unnecessary
to explain any or all phenomena. in my experience , systems such as this
(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain
a fallacy upon close examination. if that 's not what you 're saying , then
please put me straight.

i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how
deviant the view as i 've articulated it above (which may not be
the true view of khomeini) is from the basic principles of islam.

from the point ov view of an atheist , i see you claim khomeini was n't
practicing true islam. but i'm sure that he would have said the same about
you. how am i , a member of neither group , supposed to be able to tell which
one of you two is really a true muslim \?

this is a very good point. i have already made the clear claim that
khomeini advocates views which are in contradition with the qur'an
and have given my arguments for this. this is something that can be
checked by anyone sufficiently interested. khomeini , being dead ,
really ca n't respond , but another poster who supports khomeini has
responded with what is clearly obfuscationist sophistry. this should
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to religionist
modes of obfuscationism.

so , to answer your question , the only way you can judge is by learning
more about islam , that is by reading the qur'an and understanding it 's
basic principles. once one has done this it is relatively easy to see
who is following the principles of islam and who is acting in a way at
odds with islam. khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles
of islam , which is that no human being is metaphysically different than
any other human being and in no sense any closer to god in metaphysical
nature.

i looked back at this , and asked some questions of various people and
got the following information which i had claimed and you pooh poohed.
the us has not sold iraq any arms.

what about the land mines which have already been mentioned \?

other countries (like kuwait). information is hard to prove. you are
claiming that the us sold information \? prove it. ... information
is hard to prove , almost certainly if the us did sell information , then that
fact is classified , and you ca n't prove it.

oh , very neat. dismiss everything i say unless i can prove beyond a shadow
of a doubt something which you yourself admit i can never prove to your
satisfaction. thanks , i 'll stick to squaring circles.

this is fascinating. atheists argue for abortion , defend homosexuality
as a means of population control , insist that the only values are
biological and condemn war and capital punishment. according to
benedikt , if something is contardictory , it cannot exist , which in
this case means atheists i suppose.
i would like to understand how an atheist can object to war (an
excellent means of controlling population growth) , or to capital
punishment , i'm sorry but the logic escapes me.

first , you seem to assume all atheists think alike. an atheist does not
believe in the existence of a god. our opinions on issues such as
capital punishment and abortion , however , vary greatly.

if you were attacking the views of a particular atheist (benedikt , i
presume) , then please present your argument as such and do not lump us
all together.

as for the issues , let 's start with abortion. personally , i do not support
abortion as a means of population control or contraception after the fact.
however , i support the right of any woman to have an abortion , regardless
of what my personal views may be , because it would be arrogant of me to tell
any individual what he she may or may not do to his her body , and the domain
of legislators should not extend into the uterus. that 's my opinion , and i
am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me.

i do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control , but i
certainly defend it as an end to itself. i think most homosexuals would
be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as
nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down.

as for atheists believing all values are biological , i have no idea what
you 're talking about.

finally , there are the issues of war and capital punishment. an atheist
can object to either one just as easily as a theist might. you seem to
be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and
population control. could this be the atheist cause you were referring
to a few posts back \?

ks this is the story of kent , the archetype finn , that lives in the
ks bay area , and tried to purchase thomas paine 's age of reason . this
ks man was driving around , to staceys , to books inc , to well , cleanlighted
ks place , to daltons , to various other places.

ks when he asked for this book , the well educated american book store
ks assistants in most placed asked him to check out the thriller section ,
ks or then they said that his book has not been published yet , but they
ks should receive the book soon. in some places the assistants bluntly
ks said that they do n't know of such an author , or that he is not
ks a well known living author , so they do n't keep copies of his books.

ks such is the life and times of america , 200 years after the revolution.

sigh , now i do n't feel so bad. searching for a copy in bookstores has
been a habit of mine for at least two years now. i spend a lot of
time browsing through bookstores , new and and used , and i 've not once
seen a copy. now , i know , all i do is pick up a phone and order the
darned thing , but come on , this is america and he 's one of the founding
fathers. and no one carries his books \? sure , you can find common
sense but i think that 's because it 's required reading for most
colleges.

i did find one hole in the wall bookstore where the owner said that they
usually carry one or two copies , but that they were currently out. i have n't
been back since so i do n't know if he was telling the truth or not.

sigh...

mathew , i agree. this , it seems , is the crux of your whole position ,
is n't it \? that the us should n't have supported hussein and sold him arms
to fight iran \? i agree. and i agree in ruthlessly hunting down those
who did or do. but we did sell arms to hussein , and it 's a done deal.
now he invades kuwait. so do we just sit back and say , well , we sold
him all those arms , i suppose he just wants to use them now. too bad
for kuwait. no , unfortunately , sitting back and letting things be
is not the way to correct a former mistake. destroying hussein 's
military potential as we did was the right move. but i agree with
your statement , reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to
sell arms to hussein.

but it 's still happening. that 's the entire point. only last month , john
major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of
arms to saudi arabia. the same month , we sold jet fighters to the same
indonesian government that 's busy killing the east timorese.

it 's all very well to say oops , we made a boo boo , better clean up the
mistake , but the us and uk keep making the same mistake. they do it so
often that i ca n't believe it 's not deliberate. this suspicion is reinforced
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a decrepit
economy reliant on arms sales.

so it 's really not the gulf war you abhor
so much , it was the u.s. 's and the west 's shortsightedness in selling
arms to hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable , right \?

no , i thought both were terrible.
