this may be a dumb question , but i need to put a hard drive on my father 's
pc xt , either mfm , rll , or ide. i know how to hook it up , but how do i tell
the computer the geometry of the drive. on my 386 , you set it in the bios , but
i doubt that 's how it 's done on an xt. i thought it might be software with
the controller card , but the ide card for xt 's that i saw did n't come with
any. also , how do i low level format it once it 's on the computer \? (assuming
a drive which needs formatting)

since there is no bios support for st 506 interface hard disks in an xt ,
that support must come from a bios extension rom on the (mfm rll) hard disk
controller. usually the controller has a rom based low level format
program (a common jump address is c800 0005 ... you can type g c800 5 from
debug to see) and a small table of drive geometries it knows about.
sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card , sometimes you
can enter them manually in the llf menu. failing that , you must use a
third party hd prep program like speedstor , disk manager , or the like.

ide drives come formatted already , and since the is controller part of the
drive mechanism itself , concerns about geometry are irrelevant. plug
it in and go to fdisk.

hi ,
that might look like a dull request , but i have been following this newgroup
for a couple of weeks and it did n't help me make my mind.

i bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the
pc world for a while (i have been running on an xt 5mhz till last january ! ! ).
the machine i bought came equipped with a ati vga xl 24 graphic card. it
gives a very nice picture and the windows drivers are pretty stable. the only
problem is that it is quite slow.

i would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400 range). i saw a lot
of comments on many products over the last weeks , but did n't get an overall
picture clear enough to make a choice. my question is could somebody
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest.
i would like to get information about
the refresh rates the various cards provide
quality of windows drivers
standard vga performance (non windows stuff).

direct me to a magazine article or something like that (i got winvid.zip
info , but it is not enough). if you have an isa card you are really satisfied
with it , let me know.
if this information is of any use , here is my system configuration
fujikama 486 33mhz isa system (contaq motherboard)
monitor darius 14 non interlaced multisync (up to 1024x768)
(can reach 70khz horizontally)

i would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the eprom of the
graphic card. this is the case with my ati card and it is very convenient
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent
enough to record settings.

merci a l'avance for any information you would be kind enough to provide me ,

i am planning on upgrading my old xt compatible system with a new
motherboard , hard drive , and 1.4 mb floppy.

i am interested in using my old power supply (150 w) to power the new
hardware , if possible.

i have been told by the motherboard vendor that i could probably
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard.
(apparently some xt vintage supplies had only 11 wires the
12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery).

my question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire
out of an 11 wire supply or using an auxiliary power source
to charge the motherboard battery \?

i do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if i can
make use of my existing one with simple hacks.

thank you for any information.
an email reply to rarbanas@rcsuna.gmr.com would be fine.

on 04 19 93 04 09 , john bongiovanni had the unmitigated gall to say this

suddenly , the date no longer rolls over. the time is (reasonably) accurate
allways , but we have to change the date by hand every morning. this involves
exiting the menu system to get to dos.

jb did i once hear that in order for the date to advance , something , like
jb a clock , has to make a get date system call \? apparently , the clock
jb hardware interrupt and bios do n't do this (date advance)
jb automatically. the get date call notices that a midnight reset flag
jb has been set , and then then advances the date.

when a program uses a dos call to get the system , it resets the flag that
tells the bios that it has passed midnight. it then uses this flag to
increment the date. if the menu does a call to the system to get the time
before midnight , before the bios sees the midnight flag , then bios will not
know that the day passed and the date will not get updated.

i might have some dos 's and bios 's mixed up (darned cold messed up my
brains) but this has been a well documented problem for years. i do n't know
of a workaround. hope this helps !

i am desperately trying to find a pc based e mail wide area network service
or the necessary network software to establish one myself. while i am aware
there are various bbs 's and other similar services avalible (like compuserve ,
canada remote systems etc.) i require fairly specific criteria. in
approximate order of importance they are

1) the mail files news are read written locally and batched to the network
server. (ie. no continuous on line connection)(note all users are remote
and will use modems over conventional phone lines.)

2) simple. the users i have for the system have very little computer knowledge
have never heard of unix , and have very little interest in learning. it is
essential that the client software is completely pain free.

3) cheap. we would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established
commercial network , just so we can send large files between members of the
group hence (1). in addition i would like the network server to be
something small , simple and inexpensive like a 486. (there are only about
40 people in the group , so it is not a huge network.)

4) the capability for internet access (for news mail).

5) internet style id 's (eg. pwood@math.uwaterloo.ca)


if anyone knows of a system similar to what i am describing , even if it
does n't sastisfy all my criteria , and i do n't care where it is , please please
e mail me and tell me about it. we are not adverse to making alterations to
an existing system if necessary.

the attached fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.

yes , this is a valid concern imho. with the directly attached fan units i 've
seen , it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all. in other words , if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage , not just stop working temporarily.

a suggestion slave (hook in series) a small pilot light off the fan
circuit. then , if the light goes out , you know your fan is not working.

some of our students change the ami bios passwords on a few of our computers
and set it for always. what we 'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass
or remove the password. we have tried switching bios , but to no avail. the
battery is soldered to the bord , an all three machines is still under
guarentee so if that would have help we ca n't remove the batteries.

as far as i know , there is no way to get around the bios password except by
shorting out the power supply to the cmos memory , thereby erasing it. this
will remove the password , but it will also destroy all the previous bios
settings , so then you 'll have to go and set them all up again. on my 386 ,
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of
shorting the battery. you just short this jumper briefly , and it interrupts
power to the cmos long enough to erase it. i would imagine there is
something like this on your board too.

in the future , i would suggest that you set the password , and leave it on
setup only. that way , no one else can go and reset it or set it to
always unless they know what password you used. they had to do this over
here too when they got a bunch of new 386 's , for just the same reason.

any problems !

well , now i want more disk space and went out and got another

to the chain(50pin ribbon that has 3 connectors) and run
the fdisk program to format initialize the disk.

that did n't happen. when the pc boots , the scsi prom shoots
back the devices that are attached to the board target
0 target1 target2 . all three disks are seen.

when i run the dos fdisk program to format the disk , i choose to

the first two disks show up no problem , but the third disk is
no where to be found....


i have got an adaptec scsi card , that comes with its own version of fdisk.
the problem with dos is that it will only see two hard disks , any more need to be
done by device drivers.


odd , fdisk works fine for me with 2 ide drives and a scsi drive on
my ultrastor 14f only with the device driver loaded , though.

subject re how hot should the cpu be \?
date wed apr 21 19 01 49 1993

the temp on my 486dx2 66 is over 96c (measured with a k type thermocouple
and fluke 55 dig thermometer). this is an idle temp not doing lots of
bus i o , not doing floating point , not doing 32 bit protected mode etc. this
is in a micron computer , without heatsink.

i recently put a heatsink fan on the chip , but i might take the fan off. it
makes a horrible whine at times , and i wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc...

end of file , press return to quit

rob ,
do n't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
of use , mine did...
as to the vibration well that something i thought about to as i have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. so i mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the cpu and its heatsink
instead. work just like a charm , but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan. if the fan should stop (burn out)
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. thats what
you should be thinking about. i have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet. but you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a led when the temp. goes
above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. cheep to do if
you use radio shack junk under 5....think about that one for a while !

no , vl bus ide is no faster than isa ide. the ide interface is
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the isa bus , and if
you hook it to vl bus it 'll work as fast as the slower of the two ,
meaning isa speed.

it 's not true. ide bus uses signals which has similar name and same
meaning to the counterpart of isa bus but its (ide bus) signal timing
does n't have to be same to isa signal timing. my vl ide bus card has
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3.3mb sec up to 8.3mb
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3
milion byte sec and 8.3 milion byte sec respectively). you
cannot transfer data at a rate of 8.3mb sec on the isa bus.

i hear that
the vl bus controller is slower than a ide controller \?

on the other hand , i would n't expect it to be slower ...

the attached fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.

yes , this is a valid concern imho. with the directly attached fan units i 've
seen , it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all. in other words , if the fan stops
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to
suffer permanent damage , not just stop working temporarily.

i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu depends a lot on case and board layout , though.

my zeos 486dx2 66 (tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu , and it 's
located so the front fan , which sucks air into the case , blows right on the
heat sink. if that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air
flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise. essentially the
arrangement you 're talking about and a good idea imho.

on chip fans from fry 's electronics in the sf bay area are about 30.00. i
get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.

which would you choose , and why \?

like lots of people , i 'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a) , and
a standard ide controller card on my isa 486 50.

i'm currently thinking about adding another hd , in the 300mb to 500mb range.
and i'm thinking hard about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit).
i believe i'm getting something like 890kb sec transfer right now (according
to nu).

how would this number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for
my isa pc , and the state of the art scsi hard drive (the best system i could
hope for) \?

obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would
you want to use on your isa system \? and how much would it cost \?

along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd 's if i
were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my 200mb , 15ms hd \?
and how much would it cost \?

ibm , apple , motorola ready to unwrap powerpc 601 processor


the wraps will come off the powerpc 601 processor this week , as motorola
corp. , ibm , and apple computer inc. detail the results of their yearlong
effort. this first in a series of powerpc processors will be a 32 bit
processor with a 64 bit memory interface , much like intel corp. 's
pentium , with the capability of performing as many as three instructions
per clock cycle , according to sources familiar with the chip. motorola
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two
configurations , running at 50 and 66 mhz with performance of 40 and 50
specint89 marks , respectively , sources said. floating point performance
for the 3.6 volt processors will be even better , as their specfp89
performance will be 60 and 80 , respectively. the 601 , a scaled down
version of the power 220 chip developed by ibm for its rs 6000
workstations , will also include a 32k single buffered cache on the chip
with protocols to support motorola 's 64 bit multiprocessor 88110 bus
built in. the chip , which is being designed initially to support the
micro channel architecture , is bus independent , so vendors could develop
powerpc based systems using a number of different architectures ,
including isa , eisa , or sun microsystems inc. 's s bus design , one source
noted.

according to sources familiar with the development effort , motorola has
been extremely successful in developing the powerpc as an inexpensive
architecture , despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million
transistors using a 0.6 micron technology. initial chips are expected to
be priced from 300 to 400 only slightly higher than intel corp. 's
486 processors but could be sold profitably for less than 100 , one
source said.

you unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the parity error

when it 's enabled , and not when it 's disabled. how high will the count go on
the memory check at boot up before this error occurs \? does the system beep
at all if so what 's the pattern of beeps \? the error could be occuring in
cache memory (not so likely) or video memory , as well as the simms.

the fact that you have ami bios is not conclusive in determining the board
manufacturer either. boards are made by thousands of small taiwanese companies
(among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some
simm sockets to make your board. i tend to doubt your problem is with your

dx2 50 s. also as someone else pointed out , local bus boards are

you are correct ! the motherboard manufacturer where i usually buy boards says

brian j schaufenbuel

i do n't see this as a problem with the chip set (a mistake) , i see this
as something that was designed in intentionally.

so it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32 bit eisa dma)
would require an update to the chipset. an update to the chipset may
begat an update to the motherboard board design.

what i'm saing is the motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this
off as a simple fix. in my mind the fix is a updated chipset from hint
along with a possible motherboard layout update. this is not simple.
if i were you i would be cautious about this.

you might look into the advanced integration research (air) vl eisa
motherboard. all slots are eisa isa capable. 2 (or 3) of the slots are
vl bus capable. the air people confirmed this board supports 'real'
32 bit eisa dma (i called them). pentium p5 ( \? ) capable. less expensive
than equivalent ami or micronics vl eisa board.

look in computer shopper (april '93). the zenon ads show the air mother
board. a associate bought the air board and is pleased with it. i'm
attempting to get the local dealer to trade out the hawk board for the
air board.

serial cables

there are only three output signals td , dtr , and rts.
there are five inputs signals rd , dsr , dcd , cts , and ri.

there are many differnt null modem requiremts as dictated by the software.
the ibm bios requires asserts dtr and rts and then waits for both dsr and
cts before sending. when a bios recieve call is made , it asserts dtr and
waits for dsr to become true (times out after a while and returns with an
error if dsr never becomes true). it requires cts to be true for sending
and recieving. most communications packages bypass this and replace it
with their own protocol. the key is that each comm. package could very
well have different requirements.

my favorite cable works in many cases short rts to cts at each end , but
also run rts through to dcd at the opposite end. td runs through to rd
and dtr runs through to dsr from both dte 's and of course sg goes through
to sg.

i have never had trouble with this null modem even though i have used it
with a comm. package that was expecting rts to go to cts instead of dcd.
the advantage of this cable is that it also works with the ibm bios.

has anyone (successfully) put both scsi and ide hard drives
on the same system \?

i would like to know as well , since i just bought a 200mb seagate ide
drive and want to add it to my computer (a four year old gateway
386 20) , which currently has an 80mb seagate scsi drive. the scsi
controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the cmos
setup , i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as not installed ,
and apparently the scsi controller works its wonders. i wondering if
this is a problem. also , i remember how , when i helped my cousin
install his second ide drive , we had to define a master slave
relationship for them do i need to do something similar here \?

i am particularly interested in having the scsi as the boot drive.

same here.

any help would be appreciated , since i intend to install this drive
asap i 'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before i start.
thanks !

i have been using both ide (or mfm) and scsi drives for years. i have 2
ide and 1 scsi on one system and the other with 2 ide , 2 scsi disk , and
1 scsi cdrom. i currently using always in2000 scsi card , but i also have
a future domain , a western digital scsi card , and i work with an adaptic
before. as i recall , all these cards can support boot and floppy drive.
however , to use with other controller (ide , mfm...) the boot drive has to
be the ide (or mfm). you can not boot from the scsi if you have other
controller in the system. if you guys only have 2 drives (1 ide , 1 scsi).
just set up the ide in your cmos setup. make sure you can boot from it.
then , set up the scsi controller (irq , dma , etc). set the scsi drive to
id 0. just plug and play for all the cards i seen so far. only if you
have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so
on. if you have more question , email me , i will try to answer it.
good luck !

(andy nicola) writes

in a previous article , cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (holly ks) says

what is the difference between the us robotics courier v32bis external and the
sportster 14400 external \? i see that the price of a sportster has dramatically
dropped to below 200 but the price of the courier remains above 400.

anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a courier \?

the courier is their top of the line product , thus the higher price. i 've
never taken a real look at the sportster line (only couriers) , but from what
i 've gathered , it 's basically more of an entry level modem. probably
does n't meet the same specifications that the courier does. i'm not sure
if the sportster line is fully dsp driven like the (more recent) courier
modems are , so upgrades in the future may be an issue.

again , take all of the above with a grain of salt...i 've never evaluated
the sportster , so i'm going by bits and pieces that i 've heard. if you
want a real answer , post the question in comp.dcom.modems and you 'll find
people who have worked with the sportster.

personally , though , if i were going to look at the courier modems , i 'd
buy the dual standard...then i 'd get both hst and v.32bis. in fact , this
is exactly what i did. ) i'm sitting here looking at my usr ds right
now.

and now , to correct a few very incorrect statements.... folks , if you want
to get reliable answers to modem and or uart questions , post them to
comp.dcom.modems. if you post in other groups , you never know what you 'll
get in the way of an answer (you may very well get a good answer...or you
may get something like the one below). at least in cdm , if someone posts
complete and utter bs , you 'll see a flurry of folks correcting them (to
avoid spreading faulty info).

the sportster at 14.4 has v.42 error control and v.42 bis data compression.

just as it does at lower speeds , too. there is absolutely nothing in
either ccitt recommendation v.42 or v.42bis that says that they can only
operate on modems that are running v.32bis. v.42bis , of course , is
currently only standardized for operation on top of v.42 (in its primary
mode of operation , lapm) , but that 's about as far as that goes.

and just in case there 's some confusion on this , v.42 v.42bis are also
supported by the courier line (unless you have a really ancient one).

the difference
with the courier , is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the hst mode.

take a second look at the original question

in a previous article , cs3sd3ae@maccs.mcmaster.ca (holly ks) says
what is the difference between the us robotics courier v32bis external

see the v.32bis up there \? the question was not about the courier hst
modem , or about the courier dual standard...it was about the courier
v.32bis modem. the modem in question does not support hst , period. it
therefore does not support the 16.8 kb hst.

also , not all courier hst courier dual standard modems support the 16.8 kb
version of hst. my dual standard only supports hst at 14.4 kb. there are
even older models that only run hst at 9.6 kb.

this is a proprietary mode of usr and it will only connect to another of
the same type unit to achieve this speed.

hst is usr 's proprietary modulation scheme.... but we 're not talking about
hst , we 're talking about v.32bis. v.32bis is most definitely not a
proprietary modulation scheme.

the sportster will do
asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous. the hst is one way
only.

i do hope you did n't mean for these two sentences to be related in some
way.....

first off , v.32 and v.32bis are both synchronous and asynchronous. this is
part of the ccitt recommendation (i.e. , part of the standard). it is n't a
feature unique to the sportster (i just looked at the appropriate chapter
in the courier ds manual).

second , hst is not ``one way only.'' more correctly put , it is an
asymmetrical modulation scheme , meaning it does n't work at the same speed
in both directions. hst operates at 9.6 14.4 16.8 in one direction ,
and has a low speed back channel in the other direction. the high speed
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow. this is fine if
you 're logged on to say , a bbs , and type one letter and get screens of
info back , transfer files (not using bimodem) , etc.... there is , of course ,
a penalty for turnaround time when the high speed channel needs to reverse
directions.

v.32 and v.32bis are both symmetrical , meaning they do transfer the full
data rate in both directions at the same time.

third , synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with
symmetrical vs asymmetrical...they are two completely different topics.

the hst 's will be upgradeable to the v.fast spec when it is available.

again , more correctly put , some of the courier line will be upgradeable
to whatever ``v.fast'' is called when it 's complete. if you have the large
footprint courier modems (like i do) , you 're s.o.l..... there was an
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety , which
could eventually be upgraded to support v.fast , but the cost of the two
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem.

later.....

i have a 105mb ide drive and am having a few problems ! i get
'data error on drive c' messages when reading some files. the problem is
also steadily getting worse.

i have run some diagnostic software (pctools v7.1) and it says that the
drive is ok but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly
flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).

does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these
sectors as bad (dos does n't) or preferably perform a low level format.
i have heard that the latter is possible on an ide. technical answers
would be appreciated. it would be nice to be able to use the disk again ! ! !

on 04 21 93 04 50 , r.x. getter had the unmitigated gall to say this

rg this may be a dumb question , but i need to put a hard drive on my
rg father 's pc xt , either mfm , rll , or ide. i know how to hook it up , but
rg how do i tell the computer the geometry of the drive. on my 386 , you
rg set it in the bios , but i doubt that 's how it 's done on an xt. i

most xt ide controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive
geometry and getting the information to the computer. the controller may
come with software to update its on board bios , or may be designed to work
with a particular drive. seagate drives usually have special controllers
for use on xt 's , and these are tailored to the drive.

also , you cannot low level format an ide drive. the low level format is
stored on specal magnetic areas on the disk surface called servos (not
like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than
the drive 's recording heads can generate. do n't try to low level format an
ide drive !

any problems with it \?

i had one and on three different motherboards it did n't work with nt and
in some cases dos. i sent mine back , but it is my understanding that
on some systems such as micronics motherboards it is necessary to
shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.

i 've yet to hear from someone running a 34f on any motherboard with
nt without shutting off the cache.

if you get one my advise it to be very sure you can return it first.

mine included. on one , he bought the stacker to doublespace converter ,
and it worked fine (rather , he sent in the coupon for the converter).

in other cases , i 've run the doublespace installation without a problem
when compressing a new drive , compressing free space , or whatever else.
seems to work for me.

ofcourse , we did not , repeat , not run any program called install
or setup or a very sophisticated ai auto configuring setup
installation program that will think for you and do what you never wanted to
do but could n't stop it from doing

well , i ran the normal setup thing and it worked fine for whatever that 's
worth.

also , dblspace is crap. it writes about 40 slower than stacker , reads about
20 slower , and compresses about 10 less. all tests were made on the same
computer with the same disk , no cache , and the same (big) files were used.

could n't agree more. on my 486 50 i do n't miss the speed. it 's still
faster than a normal disk read would be. as for the less compression ,
i 've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace.bin
load before anything else. with stacker , any changes to your config.sys
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those.

personally , i'm waiting for stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those
hooks and stuff. plus , the defrag that comes with dos is okay , but i
much prefer compress from pc tools for sheer bells and whistles. plus ,
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive.

but , dos 6 is quite good reformat disks \? i honestly do n't understand why
you had to do this.

is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a pc. by this i mean of
different types. ie. rll and mfm. if so how do you access the drives
in the cmos setup. do they just show up to be configured or do you
have to do low level writes to the controller.

as an example put 1 rll controller with 2 drives in a machine. put
a mfm controller and 2 more drives connected to it. i now have 4
drives with 2 controllers of different types. also can you
put 2 controllers of the same type into a pc and again how do you access
them.

i was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has
done this and can supply me with info i would very pleased

thanx in advance for any info...

on a few computers which we have here at sheridan college there are
files which we would like to make read only. i have used the dos attrib command
but some people , who carry around the attrib program in their pockets ,
have still been able to erase some of the more important files. are
there any software packages which would make an entire drive read only \?
an example , partition the drive into two partitions and have the first
drive contain the important files which can be only read and the second
drive you could both read and write.
any and all enquiries or help would be appreciated.

jcl i just got a problem , i have a cheapo 2400bps modem which i use to
jcl connect to my university , but i get too much garbage on the screen. i
jcl do know it 's because the noise in the line (i can actually hear it).
jcl so my question is will an error correction protocol help to eliminate
jcl this garbage \? , my modem does n't have any of these on hardware , can a
jcl software implemented protocol do the trick \?

there is a software version of mnp 5 available from mtez , and it will often
connect with other modems that are mnp compatible , but if the modem that you
are connecting to does n't support mnp then it wo n't help. error correcting
modems will eliminate line noise , but only id there are error correcting
modems on both ends of the conncetion. the added soeed is much worth the
price of error correcting modems. 9600 baud v.42bis modems are very
reasonable , and they are only about 15 slower than the more expensive
14 , 400 modems on the market.

i have a floppy drive which has developed general failure errors. (it 's a teac 1.44mb 3.5 drive).

i took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. i used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it 's quite clean now.

however , it did n't help the problem. i 've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk) , the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time. what i mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

is there anything more i can do to try and save this drive \? i 'd prefer not to shell out 100 for a new one if i can help it.

...
if you 're considering buying a system , with a view to using
it to run unix (linux , bsd , etc...) or some other special software ,
there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards.

that is , if the special software is free , like xfree86. there are
vendors that sells diamond x drivers for commercial unices. but
then , they charge .

this is due to diamond 's propriety attitude to it 's hardware
it 's impossible to get free information from them about their chips
(specifically their dot clocks) without paying , and signing non disclosure
agreements.

i think they only need a signing (i.e. no paying). this still
violates the fsf 's policy of publically available code.

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide
x windows compatibility with these cards , as diamond did n't want to
divulge programming neccessities.

while this is true , there are fixes for those who have already
bought diamond cards. in linux , for example , there are utilities
that will put the card in vesa mode before invoking x. of course ,
this means no fine tuning of diamond cards , but at least this
will allow those who 're stuck with them to use linux x.

i agree with mark 's suggestion if you are buying a video card
for specialized free software , avoid diamond. but if you already
have one , there may be a fix that can help you.

you can configure devices for the same irq as long as you do n't use them

wm the software is netware 286 level ii and i can see burnt on to the
wm screen sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a. however , to configure netware
wm for level ii (mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk , yes \?

yes. mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two
disks at once. duplexing , which is the preferred way of mirroring , uses
two controller cards and two disk drives. duplexing requires a special
card and two identical disk drives (in most cases). duplexing can
sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives controllers , as long
as the sizes are the same.

wm so how is the novell server 286a normally configured \?

the configuration is completely up to the user.

wm 1. can i install sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a as level i , or is this
wm what is causing my serialization error \?

if you only have one disk , then you ca n't use level ii sft. however , the
osobj disk has a serial number on it , and if this disk is for a different
version of netware then you would get a serialization error. make sure
that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the
netware installation set.

wm 2. is the novell server 286a normally equipped with two hard drives ,
wm one of which has failed \?

two drives could be either two netware volumes at sft i , or one volume
mirrored using sft ii. impossible to tell with the network being down.

wm 3. would this mean i can not install the network software because it
wm will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive \?

try disconnecting the failed drive , using a standard disk controller , and
installing the software as one volume under sft i. if the software will
install , and if the one disk is functional , then it should be able to work
in this configuration.

wm 4. what else can cause a serialization error \?

see the comment concerning the serial number on the osobj installation
floppy.

wm 5. what happens if the keycard fails \?

what is the keycard attached to \?

i have an internal modem that i configure as com4 with irq 3 , but
when i insert that card into my dos 5.02 pc , it shows up
as com3 , with irq3 and com4 's address (2e8) !

when i get into debug , and dump the data at 40 0 , it shows
the address 2e8 as belonging to com3 even though the modem
should be at com4.
...

this is a common misconception , shared my many manufacturers , programmers ,
and users alike. com3 , for example , is simply the third equipped comm
port , not necessarily the one with i o address 3e8. the bios just
searches sequentially through a set of potential comm port addresses. the
first equipped port it finds will become com1 , etc. if you 're playing by
the rules , you ca n't have a com4 unless you have a com3 equipped. the set
of standard (whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the
order in which the bios searches the i o address space in its search for
serial ports.

so , what you have is indeed com3 at the non standard address 2e8. were
this address in the 4th table slot instead , programs which query the bios
to determine the number of installed comm ports would not find it , as the
field in the bios data area which contains this number would indicate that
there are but 3 comm ports installed. (frankly , i do n't know of a simgle
program that would actually have a problem with this.)

have anybody succeded in converting a atari monomchrome monitor into a
mono vga monitor. if so please let me know exactly how you did and what
graphics card you used.

i wish i could help ! i posted a similar question about two weeks ago
i got no response at all. i 've asked locally at my friendly atari store.
i was told that it should be possible , but that they had no idea how
it might be done. nor did they particularly care to investigate.

ok , here 's my results so far....

1 you have to define the monitor as lcd it does n't really support
analogue video input (it works , but is n't very linear...)

2 the incoming sync pulses need inverting. this is best achieved
with either a cmos xor package or a transistor inverter.
if you do n't know how to do it , do n't even contemplate it.. )

3 it 'll only work in standard vga mode.

ok , having said that , i'm trying to either find a circuit or ic
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

i want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge , and does n't care about the polarity , outputting
the ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

there are 2 reasons for doing this

1 vga cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they 're
in herc emulation is , while mvga is , for example.

2 it means i do n't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
ibm. currently i have 3 (yes , 3 ! ) monitors sitting on my desk ,
and i want to get that number down as much as possible.
being able to use the atari monitor as a paper white vga
will cut things down to 2. if i forget about atari colour ,
i can get down to 1.

ultimately , the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor ,
but i'm as pressed for cash as anyone else , so it 'll have to wait...

do all scsi cards for dos systems require a separate device driver to
be loaded into memory for each scsi device hooked up \?

no. all that i 've seen have also an on board bios which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under dos (2 drives is a dos
limitation and you have the same problem with ide and all other
standards for that matter). software drivers often allow for better
performance , though. you have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.

will this also be true of the 32 bit os 's \?

obviously these are not able to use the 16 bit real mode bioses that
are written for dos , so you need software drivers. that 's not a big
deal (as long as the drivers are available) , because you wo n't have to
fight with any low memory problems either.

there are jumpers on each drive that must be set for both to work. the c drivemust be set to be the master drive , and d must be set to be the slave drive.

call phoenix. they can put you on line with replacement bios chips. i had
to do this when i upgraded a emerson 386 20 to an ide drive.

also , if you are installing an ide drive , and there is a bios setting that
has a total volume the same as the ide drive 's volume , try using it. the
ide drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries , as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive 's actual
size. the controller will do the necessary translation automatically , in
most cases.

warning ! ! ! do not use a bios setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive ! a smaller setting will not harm the drive , but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over. drive damage will not
result , but headaches will !

hello ,

i have a diamond stealth vram card (the older version
with the dip switches on the back). i have two problems

1 ) i 've lost the manual ! ! !

2 ) i have it in a machine with a network card , and
everything works fine until i run windows , when
the network connection dies.

(in case it 's important , the network card is an
smc arcnet 8 bit compatable card. it 's i o
address is 02e0 and it 's ram base address is
d000. it 's also using irq 2)

remainder deleted

i do n't have my copy of the manual with me right now , but i can offer the
following in the interim

1) the card uses port addresses 0x2e0 and 0x2e8 (which are not
configurable). these addresses , incidentally , were inadvertantly
omitted from my version of the manual.

2) i believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable
irq 2 (for cga or ega support \? \? ! \? ).

there are no standards for pc com ports above com2. while there are de

use up to 8 ports , i think , but i do n't know the specs. good luck !

enjoying spectacular performance with a micropolis mc2105 560mb 10ms

you can call buslogic and ask 'em about the nt question. i hear that
the support is excellent. i have not had to call them myself yet.

i went out and bought the pas16 yesterday , and installed it into my gateway
dx2 66v. i followed the instructions and set the sb side with dma 1 and irq5
(the default) and then the pas side with dma 5 and irq 10. my question is how
should i configure for mpu 401 compatibility. the manual and installation
program recommended irq2 , but on my machine it is configured to cascade to
irq8 15. so can i still use irq2 , or should i choose a different one \? right now
i have the mpu 401 emulation mode turned off. actually what is this cascade to
irq8 15 business \?

a related questions (to other gw or vl bus machine owners) i was told that
only dma 5 , 6 , 7 are 16 bit dmas , and 0 4 are 8 bit dmas. now what about
32 bit vl bus mastering dmas \? \? which dma channel(s) is used by the vl bus
extension to do 32 bit dma \?

yet another question , after installing pas16 , my links (golf game) will hang
the machine when i select sb mode and run , but works with adlib mode \? \?
civilization however works fine ( at least so far). any body knows what i might
have done wrong \?

lino montuno

i totally agree with your friend , since when the cpu is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
(checking for keyboard input for instance).

the exception to this is for cpu 's used in laptops , where the cpu can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing. in this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again.

i also am having a problem with com4 on a g2k system. i have a gateway 2k 486dx 33 system with the ati ultrapro video card (identical to the system mentioned in the original posting , except 33mhz instead of 66). for some reason , the system refuses to recognize com4. for example , if i configure the on board (motherboard) com ports for com1 com2 , everything is fine if i configure them for com3 com4 , com3 works ok , but com4 is not recoznized. the diagnostics shipped with the system , the msd utility





windows all act as if the port is n't there. it 's not an irq conflict , because i can swap the irqs for com3 and com4 , and com3 still works (and com4 still does n't).

i actually noticed this problem when trying to install 2 additional ports (a boca high speed 2s 1p card). the behavior with the boca card was exactly the same (e.g. it would work as com1 , com2 , or com3 , but not as com4).

this has the smell of an i o port conflict , but i ca n't imagine with what. there are no other expansion cards installed in the machine other than the video card , and gateway would have to be pretty stupid to have the on board com4 conflict with something else on the motherboard !

has anybody else had this problem \?


i ran into this about six months ago. my system is a gw2000 486dx 66v ,
8 megs ram , 1meg ati gup vlb. it seems the problem is that the ati

com1 3 are available. i believe this is documented somewhere in the

i got a et4000 w32 card which is made by cardex yesterday
and ran a winmark test on it. the card is a vl bus card which
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1mb dram.

it comes with et4000 w32 window drivers and a normal et4000 drivers.
the et4000 w32 drivers handles , 640x480 , 800x600 , 1024x786 in 256 colours.
also , in 640x480 and 800x600 , it supports hicolor , 32k and 64k colours.

here is my winmark result running on a 16mb 486dx33 eisa vl bus system using

from the result , the et4000 w32 drivers are specialized to use the
hardware feature of the et4000 w32 chip whereas the et4000 drivers are
just normal driver for et4000 based graphics card.

the price of this graphics card that i got is 185 from a local dealer.
it may be less from mail order. it has os 2 2.0 drivers comes with it
which supports 256 colors on all resolution.

from these results , it has double the performance of a et4000ax based card
in 256 colours mode.

color darkening and some others. i do n't use the drivers in

to be honest , up until now , i have only found one bug in the
diamond viper drivers , and it seems innocuous.

that is , under microsoft word , select format border , click
shading and take a look at the patterns. the 5 pattern
has been swapped with the 90 , and so on. the whole list
is completely reversed looks right onscreen , but take
it to another machine (i.e. , a gup or ss24x machine) or
print it and iy shows badly !

keep in mind that i use mainly 1024x768x65k mode , so i ca n't
speak for the others , but otherwise these drivers seem pretty
solid.

decnet requires this feature.

are we talking about a scsi 1 device (e.g. hd) on a scsi 2 controller
or
are we talking about a scsi 1 controller that had a chip upgrade
using the same chip that is on a scsi 2 controller board.
we are talking about a scsi 1 device (e.g. hd) on a scsi 2 controller.

here is a rewrite of my mac info sheet scsi section
scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm.
allows the use of any device hard drive , printer , scanner , nubus card
expansion mac plus only , some monitors , and cd rom. normal asynchronous
scsi is 5 mhz fast synchronous scsi is 10 mhz. difference between these
modes is mainly in the software drivers.
main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal
terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port
a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and end.
any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm .
scsi 1 8 bit 7 devices per scsi controller. asynchronous 1.5mb s ave
and synchronous 5mb s max transfers. 8 bit scsi 2 is often mistaken for
a fast version of scsi 1 see scsi 2 for details .
scsi 2 fully scsi 1 compliant. scsi 2 mode 10 devices per scsi controller.
8 bit scsi 2 is implimented as a very fast scsi 1 since it can run using
scsi 1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices , which
results in it sometimes being mistakenly consitered part of scsi 1. 16 bit
and 32 bit scsi 2 require different ports , electronics , and scsi software
drivers from scsi 1 which makes them more expensive than other scsi
interfaces . 32 bit scsi seems to run only in synchronous mode , hence term
'wide and fast scsi' transfer speeds are 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit ,
8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit , and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst
32 bit .

8 bit scsi 2 is the biggest headache due to the fact that it is the only scsi 2
that i know of that can pump scsi 2 speeds through scsi 1 devices and software
controlers. its main implimentation is on the mac though you do see adds
for scsi 2 at 10mb s maximum throughput for pcs. since 8 bit scsi 2 does not
need all the hardware including electonics and software of 16 bit and 32 bit
scsi 2 it is the cheepest of the scsi 2 interfaces. just pop out the scsi 1
electornics and pop in 8 bit scsi 2 electronics. some people consider
16 bit where scsi 2 really starts i used to be one of them but
4 6mb s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10mb s is not scsi 1
but is 8 bit scsi 2.
rule of thumb if it is scsin and over 5mb s then it is some type of scsi 2.

8 bit scsi can use part of scsi 1 electronics which further reduces its cost
compared to 16 and 32 bit scsi 2.

and fluke 55 dig thermometer). this is an idle temp not doing lots of
bus i o , not doing floating point , not doing 32 bit protected mode etc. this
is in a micron computer , without heatsink.

i recently put a heatsink fan on the chip , but i might take the fan off. it
makes a horrible whine at times , and i wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc...

maybe i should have been clearer. i have a intel 386dx 25 that i would
like to use to put together a system however all the motherboards that
the local vendors are now selling are running either at 33 or 40 mhz. i
guess i can cross my fingers and hope the cpu runs at that speed. )

i think i 'll take mark 's advice and see if any of the boards have
a socketed oscillator and head down to the local electronics store...

a humble response to a letter by gordon lang written 04 21 93 22 09.


gl i am interrested in the extrodinarily simple concept of the null
gl modem cable. (actually i have no idea , so do n't count that last
gl statement.) what i'm asking is what pins does it use (or what are
gl it 's specifications \? ) i just want to solder one myself instead of
gl buying one. i do n't even know what port is used.

you may want to save yourself the trouble and go to radio shack. they have
a null modem adapter which is a 9 pin connector that swaps the necessary
pins to allow two machines to communicate. these are a lot easier than
soldering the connections yourself , and usually a bit more reliable.

as i understand it , here is the process of adding such a drive. could

want
it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also , i have seen
on
the net that there are scsi and scsi2 drives. is this true \? does the
adapter need to be the same as the drive \? what type of drive is the
quantum \?


i have tried others , but i think that the adaptec is best value for
money.


2 connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power
cable.
do i have to worry about the power supply \? i think i have 200 watts
and
all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.


i dont think you can mix the two types of drive , unless you have one of
the
scsi ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off.


is this true \? \? \? i was under the impression that people on the net had both
scsi and ide working together.



well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting \?

this is normally the case , but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator

subject upgrading the processor on 386 486 machines
organization harvard university science center
lines 43


in case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine
without spending a lot of money , i looked into replacing the processor
on those machines and here are the facts (as i understand them).

if you have a ps 2 model 70 or model 80 , you can replace the i386 chip with
either 1) a cyrix 486dlc chip for 130 which will increase your processing
power by about 60 for normal fuctions , and not at all for math functions.
this chip will only run at your original clock speed , ie. if you have a 16mhz
machine the cyrix 486dlc will run at 16mhz.
note windows does not use the math functions , so it is a good upgrade if
you are running windows.
or , 2) you can get a kingston 486 now platform for 450 with a 25mhz i486sx
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100 , if you
were running at 25mhz originally. but again it will not increase the speed
of your math fuctions. i think that it will continue to run at 25mhz even
if your original processor runs at a slower speed.
there is also 3) the kingston 486 now platform for 750 with a 33mhz i486dx
on it. this might speed up your math functions as well , but i am not sure.

if you have a ps 2 model 70 b21 or other ps 2 machine with either an i486sx
or a non clock doubling i486dx (ie. it runs at either 25 or 33mhz) in it ,
then you can get an intel overdrive chip (which is really an i486dx2 chip) and
replace your chip with it. you should get about 95 better preformance for
both normal and math functions. the 25 50 mhz version of the overdrive chip
costs 450 and the 33 66mhz version costs 700. the replacement for the
25mhz 486sx chip is an espeacially good deal as it provides the math
coprocessor which the 486sx does not have. note that the speed ratings on the
overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run. if you have a
20mhz 486sx , then the overdrive chip will run at 20 40mhz , ie. 20mhz externally
and 40mhz internally. there is no reason to buy an overdrive chip which is
rated at faster then your machine , you will not get faster performance.

you should be able to buy these chips from any of the microchip merchants that
advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week. you might want to shop
around as prices do vary. if you need a name phone number for a source for
a particular chip , e mail me , and i will respond with a couple of sources.

my 66 dx2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
i am using the pc power and cooling cpu cooler. this one has
precision ball bearings in the motor. it has a pretty substantial
heat sink so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

it attaches with peel off adhesive. this is a full size at case , so
the fan has gravity in its favor. i would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

all of the cpu fans that i know of are powered from a drive cable.
there are other board type fans which are isa boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them. they are powered by the slot. i do n't
know how effective they are maybe someone else could comment.

the cpu is cool enough to touch with the pcp c unit.

pc connection at 800 243 8088 has them for 29.95 5.00 next day

vacsc0qe@vax.csun.edu wrote
i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one
i already had. my problem is this. my system only had a ide cable
for one drive , so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors
on it , and consequently have to switch cables. the problem is ,
the new hard drive 's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the ide card. but
for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
in the cable to align these.

most ide drives that i have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed
circuit board (this is sufficient to determine which side is which). if your
ide drive does not have a label , then you can look for a polarization notch in
the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins). if the receptacle
is center polarized , that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide
positioned in the center of one side , then you can identify pin 1 as follows
look into the pins with the notch at the top , pin 1 is at the top right. on
all drives i have seen this is toward the power connector. as for which pin
is pin 1 on the controller , well you can use the same criteria but look hard
for the labelling of any pin. once you know which end pin 1 2 are on or pins
39 40 (the oposite end) , then you are all set. all you need to do is keep
the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end. you do n't even have to look at the
cable itself. just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through. usually the
pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color (red usually). but
beware many cable makers are not very careful about this i have seen cables
with pin 40 being the one marked red. of course with non polarized connectors
this does n't matter you can plug the cable in either way and you decide
which side is pin 1.

secondly , the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives. does it matter which i plug into the master drive
and which into the slave \? any help appreciated. thanks...

it does n't matter what gets plugged where. but it does matter how the drives
are jumpered. there will be (amongst other options) two jumpers that you
should be concerned with on both drives. one jumper will select whether the
drive is the slave or the master. if it is the master , then a second jumper
selects whether or not a slave is present. you will have to consult the
docuementation that came with you drives. if you do not have docuementation ,
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have
one. this kind of information is routinely needed by people just like
yourself. they will fax you complete info about the jumpers. if you do n't
have convenient access to a fax machine , then you can usually get voice
help. or post the specific question to this group. (i probably wo n't be
able to help you).

good luck

to pin 2 etc. if you connect two pcs , cross rxd and txd.

if hardware handshaking is not needed , a so called null modem connection

you wo n't need long wires for these !
the null modem connection is used to establish an xon xoff transmission

remember the names dtr , dsr , cts rts refer to the lines as seen from

than 16 bit ide hdd fdd controller card \? i hear that
the vl bus controller is slower than a ide controller \?
which one is true \?

the vl ide adapter can be much faster then the normal ide , it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use. i am using a noname vl ide i o contr.
it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb s using a cheap seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kb s using a wd caviar 2340 , you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess , fastest setting gets 4600 kb s under coretest
but does not work reliable. you have to shadow the adapter bios to get the fast
speed. i haven t used a vl ide cache controller yet , but it might speed up twice.

i need to duplicate a bunch of floppy disks (3.5 ) and ideally would like to
be able to keep 2 to 4 floppies busy simultaneously on a single pc.
yes , i know that services to do this exist.

i know that standard isa bus floppy controllers can only have one drive active
at a time. i know that some controllers are available that can handle 4
floppies with serialized access. i know that microchannel machines can keep
more than one floppy active simultaneously. but does anyone have a controller
for an isa bus pc that can simultaneously keep 2 to 4 floppies going \?
how about for an eisa machine \?

if the limitation is a software limitation , i can work around that by using
os 2 1.3 on my pc 286.

new or used , i'm interested.

no. all that i 've seen have also an on board bios which enables you to
use up to 2 hard drives directly under dos (2 drives is a dos
limitation and you have the same problem with ide and all other
standards for that matter). software drivers often allow for better
performance , though. you have to use them if you want to use other
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks.

no. the always in 2000 , among others requires no drivers for up to 7 scsi

lh i seem to have a problem configuring my lpt port to accept this. how
lh can you adjust baud , parity , etc. to fit the system \? i tried mode , but
lh it did not work. if anyone can help , post of e mail. thanx.

lpt ports do n't recognize baud , parity , etc. settings. you might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port. try this attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the pc. use the mode command to set
the com port settings. try

c mode com1 , 9600 , n , 8 , 1

to set the port parameters. then use the mode command to redirect the
printer port lpt1 like this

c mode lpt1 com1

this should work. good luck !

below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which computer shopper lists as pc compatible. i 've omitted
radius because radius states that they no longer support the pc.

you will notice that nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5khz
horizontal frequency , which is the frequency normally used by vga cards
at boot up. my guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards. i 've left voice mail with nanao asking them to
send me some literature , and will report back to the net after i 've
studied it.

the prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship

organization compact solutions , canberra act australia

this may be a very naive question but is there any
basis for the
claim that a cpu will get hotter when a
computationally intensive
job is running \? my friend claims that there will be
little difference
in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu running a
computationally
intensive job.

from what i 've seen in coursework , most cpus never actually
idle . they will continue to service interrupts , etc. ,
etc. the clock will always be running at n mhz no matter
what it 's doing.

i suppose depending on the instruction , the cpu may use
circuitry which has more transistors than other
instructions , but if you consider the additional heat
generated by only a handful of additional , tiny resistors
and then spread that heat dissipation over the cpu 's
packaging , the change in temperature to the immediate
environment (ie. the surface of the package) will be
negligible.

subject re any info on cyrix 486dru2 chip \?
organization netcom online communication services (408 241 9760 guest)
lines 64

it seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the cyrix 386 compatible
486dlc and 486dru2. my info comes directly from cyrix 's fast fax service
and also from installing one of these chips in an ibm model 80.

the 486dlc is a 486 instruction set compatible cpu which fits into a 386dx
socket (pin grid array , or pga). the dlc currently is available in 3 speeds.
the 25 , the 33 , and the 40. they do not have a coprocessor on board , but any
software query will return coproc as present. i guess they emulate the
coproc instructions. math functions are on the 386dx level without the
actual coprocessor.

the internal cache on the 486dlc is 1k. cyrix literature claims a 85 hit
rate. my informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10 performance
boost when it is enabled by software. overall performance boost from a
386dx 25 to a 486dlc 25 is about 60 . the benchmarks i used were nu si and
qaplus dhrystones and whetstones. the performance , with the cache enabled ,
is about on a par with my 386dx 40 with 256k external cpu cache , which is
around the performance for a 486sx 25. the computer runs noticebly faster ,
and dos 6 with dblspace is not complaining. the company claims os 2
compatibility , but i did n't test it.

the 486dru2 is not a chip , as commonly thought. the 486dru2 is actually
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386dx , which contains
the logic to manage the clock doubler. this board plugs into the 386dx
pga , and the 486dlc 33 or 40 plugs into this board. i guess the board
doubles the frequency apparent to the cpu , and insert wait states when
access to the rest of the system is required. there are no info available
from cyrix there. anyway , the dru2 is available for 386dx 16 , and 386dx 20
only. double these clock rates , and you get the 32mhz and the 40mhz dlcs.
if cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the dru2 50 , then they need
to put out the 50mhz dlc2 first...

i also tested a dlc33 motherboard , along with a cyrix coprocessor. with 64k
external cache , performance were about 30 faster than the 25 , but still
significantly (25 \? ) slower than an actual intel 486dx.

imho , the dlc is a great , low price upgrade for people who ca n't afford , or
ca n't install , a new motherboard. it is definitely worth what i paid for it ,
but if you need 486dx 33 performance , the dlc33 wo n't cut it. i'm not sure
about the dlc 40 , but i think even if it matches the performance , it wo n't
beat it in any significant way.

the last time i posted info about the dlc , people sent quite a bit of mail ,
asking where i got it. so here is where i got mine

treasure chest peripherals , they advertise in the computer shopper.
1 800 677 9781
the 486dlc 25 kit was 179.00

but....

i liked the chip so much that i found the supplier , and became a dealer.
if you are interested in the chip , e mail me , and i can fax or mail you
more info. i'm well aware of the net 's policy against commercial use ,
so i can t post anymore info here. however , if there are more questions
regarding the 486dlc itself , i 'll post what i can.

i 'd like to add a second s3 based video card to my system. does anyone
know of a company that sells a card that can coexist with another one \?
all i really need is color text on one monitor and fast color graphics
on the other.

probably just a configurable address would do it.


for what it 's worth (i have n't confirmed it) , a diamond tech rep told
me that all s3 based video cards use port addresses 0x2e0 and 0x2e8.
if this is true , it appears that you cannot use more than one s3 card
in your system.

actually there is an s3 based card on the market that supports
multiple adapters in one system. unfortunately , it is vl bus
only (they may have an isa version by now... \? ) from a company
called metheus. the address and phone number is

metheus corp
ogc science park

beaverton , or 97006 6905
(503) 690 1550
be aware , this is a very high end card , capable of 4mb of vram ,
so it does not come cheap. but , i have personally seen two of
these boards running a dual screen windows 3.1.

stupid question from a new ibm pc user

i'm going to be selling my mac and getting a gateway 2000.

what is the difference between ide hd and scsi hd \?

the gw 486dx 33v comes with a 250mb western digital ide drive.
i asked how much more for the seagate 500mb scsi drive.

the guy asked me why are you going with scsi \? . i was lost for an answer.
i just said i know seagate better as a company , from a satisfaction point
of view .

are scsi drives faster than ide \? i'm not buying my gw for another 4 months

rationale

the rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for
the discussion relating to their needs. at the moment the main fora
for such discussion are in alt.cd rom and comp.multimedia neither
of which have publishing as their focus. some lists serve the
general cdrom community with focuses on library , government and
network usage , and until several weeks ago none were devoted
to publishing (cdpub has just been setup). in any case a list is not ,
and ought not , be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups.

the reason for the division into three groups is a natural
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics ,
and between the two main focal points of software , i.e. fulltext
and multimedia publishing. topics such as cdrom xa , cdi , cd r ,
photo cd and other related formats would be included as well.
topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly
hardware or software related such as books , copyright issues and
other legal matters , packaging , distribution , could be included in
the purvue of comp.publish.cdrom.software , as would any other
nonhardware or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom
publishing , in any format , and is appropriate to the internet.

the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.software would be topics such as
index and retrieval software , premastering software , cdrom
simulation software , hypertext , sgml , scanning and imaging
software , data capture software , data clean up , compression ,
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms.

the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.multimedia would be software that
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process audio and
video.

the main focus of comp.publish.cdrom.hardware would be hardware that
relates to cdrom publishing , as well as hardware for data capture ,
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware , as well as
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that
the intended enduser will utilize (the hardware that will
eventually play the published cdrom) including networks for cdrom.

notes

these groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like.
requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general
topics should be directed to other fora. questions about cdroms
mounted on lans should be directed to bit.listserv.cdromlan.

organization consultant 's connection

lines 54

thinking of buying from midwest micro of ohio \? think very carefully.
unless you are absolutely sure you wo n't have any problems , you may want
to trade elsewhere.

despite the fact that they answer the phone , hi ! i'm whoever and we 're
having a great day ! , they were n't quite so happy when i wanted to return
a modem that did n't work as i expected it to.

the details

i ordered one of their house brand infotel 14.4 df internal fax modems.
in reality , it was a twincom lightning fax that had a paper sticker over
the name. given the poor reports on the net about this modem , i would not
have ordered it , had i known this in advance.

it arrived on time. the documentation stated that it would work (and was
preconfigured) as com4 , providing that com2 was not in use at the same time.

for several reasons , i have a serial card configured for com1 com2. at the
time i installed the modem , nothing was connected to com2.

although the modem appeared to work , during every connection at 9600 or
14.4 , it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. after
spending some time on the phone with midwest 's tech support , they suggested
disabling the com2 port.

this appeared to solve the disconnect problem , but was an unacceptable long
term solution. i had to have com1 and 2 available , even though they both
would not be in use at the same time as the modem.

i called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in voicemail
hell , listening to repeated advertisements for midwest micro products. i
was then promptly disconnected. apparently it was quiting time and they
did n't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line.

i called the next day and asked the customer diservice agent for an rma
number. she promptly switched me to a tech support rep that implied that
it was my equipment at fault and that he was n't going to give me an rma
number. he suggested i use some nonstandard irq settings , a solution i
was not happy with. the modem should work as originally configured.

conclusion

i'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system , but it clearly does
not work in a multi port system like mine. since my time is worth more
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem , i gave it to a local
charitable organization (with a description of my problem) and ordered
a practical peripherals 14.4mt from pc connection.

for 30 more , i have a solid external modem built by a company i know
will support their users and sold by a company (based on personal
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. i should have
known better...

the original poster , john navitsky , said that he might use the monitor on
a sparcstation lx. the lx is able to generate a picture at 1280 1024 at
76 hz. not officially , but i tried to set this resolution and refresh rate
and the lx came up with a non syncing screen. our tube obviously could n't
handle this speed. at 67 hz , it worked perfectly.

when buying a third party monitor that 's going to be used on a sparcstation
lx , you might consider a monitor that 's fast enough to do 1280 1024 at 76hz.
i do n't know for sure whether the lx supports this (sun certainly wo n't tell

just got a 66mhz 486dx2 system , and am considering getting a fan for the
cpu. the processor when running is too hot to touch so i think this is a
fairly good idea. (long ago when i did some electronics training i read
somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctions gates etc
slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature , hence a hot
chip goes off spec sooner)

has anyone out there got a cpu fan \? \?

yes

is there more than 1 type \?

yes , seen glue on , tape on , clip on , one inch square and larger.
my favorite is the 3.5 inch plastic u.s.toyo fan i use just plopped
down on top of the chip during open case service.

do you have to remove the cpu from its scoket to install the fan \?

depends on the mounting

do all cpu fans derive their power from spare drive power lines \?

only if the manufacturer was smart

anyone had any trouble with cpu fans \?

only if it goes out got that blanket effect which does n't help chip life

does anyone have any evidence that cpu fans are a complete waste of money \?

longer system life makes good economic sense to me

how are these fans attached \? (glue \? clips \? melted cheese \? )

yes well , not the melted cheese

roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with a fan as opposed to without \?

lets you touch the surface the rule of thumb for cooling solid state

(an advert i 've read claims 85f vs 185f)

any info appreciated ,

the attached fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing.

i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel
to blow air across the cpu depends a lot on case and board layout , though.

on chip fans from fry 's electronics in the sf bay area are about 30.00. i
get the stock power supply fans for about 11.00.

no. in a standard isa bus , the one that almost all non laptop pcs use ,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt. this is due to
a screwup in the bus design. for example , if your soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7 , then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times , depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
this precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

when two or more devices in an isa bus pc share an interrupt , it 's
because they 're implemented by a single card.

and would really like it to handle my cd roms. i tried the orchid p9000 ,
which did neither of those things (though robert at wietek did say that the
70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base). so my thoughts go back
to hercules. they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the
graphite around the end of march. i have heard precisely zero about it since
then. does anyone know if the card was actually released , and what capabilities
(and price) it has \?

hmm your cd rom program must be using some oddball vga modes.

i think they are trying to get it out by the end of this month , when
it is released though it 'll be in limited quantities , i think they
have quite a back order right now (the 2 megs version will come out
a bit later).

since you have a viewsonic 17 (i think it has a 78khz horizontal
frequency right \? ) , you 're gonna love the 2 megs version. it can
do 1280x1024x256 at 75hz , 1152x900x256 at 80hz , 1024x768x256 at 90hz( ! ) ,
1024x768x65536 at 75hz. it can also do 640x480x16 mil. and
800x600x16 bit at 90hz , too bad i do n't have such a high bandwidth
monitor like yours ) ) (most of those modes need a 78khz monitor ,
otherwise you 'll have to use a lower refresh rate)

if you want more info. about the coming graphite vl , you should
go to the ibm hardware section on compuserve (ibmhw) , in the

everything is hunky dory except the 3.5 floppy , which will read , but not

depends on the model. many use clips make sure you use heat sink

without \? (an advert i 've read claims 85f vs 185f)

do these cpu fans also have heat sinks \? do you recommend using both
on the same chip (i.e. heat sink sandwiched between cpu and fan) \?

if we are just talking about a cpu fan blowing directly on the cpu chip ,
i ca n't see how heat sink grease is necessary (or even desireable).




edward mcclanahan edm@wrs.com
i have a pc power and cooling fan and it is a heat sink with a built in fan
that glues on top of the cpu. even if the fan quits you still have the heat
sink fins to aid cooling. the glue , of course , is the type that has high
thermal conductivity.

so , when you 've got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

one way is with dma or bus mastering. either of these make it
possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the cpu. the alternative is for the cpu to move
the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and
bus mastering.

how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus \?

as an earlier post noted through dma.

ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface
created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data
bytes , with no dma.

if we 're talking isa (at) bus here , then you can only have 1 dma channel
active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device.
so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus , explain how
all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card
to the isa at bus at the same time.

any one time means imho a single byte xfer. if i have four sources of
dma requests ready , the dma would service the one after the other. if
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the isa dma
bandwidth , this will work.

note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the dma
controller.

les ,

i am right now working on an mpr ii certified (swedish standards for
low emissions) hitachi superscan 15 monitor. it 's 1024x768 , up to 72hz at
that res , and it got a good write up for image quality in a recent (feb. \? )
issue of pc magazine. as far as i know , very little fully matches a nec in
image quality (at least according to the mags i ca n't tell any
difference between the two ! ) , but i think nec is low emissions on only one
of the two types. there 's vlf (very low frequency) and elf (i think that 's
extremely low frequency). the mpr ii standards set strict limits on both.
but many comapnies , nec included according to one article i read (i get a
bunch of mags so it 's hard for me to remember which ! ) , which claim low
emissions but not specifically mpr ii compliant or mpr ii certified
only control for one , usually vlf , and ignore the other.
so , the nec probably has higher overall image quality (i consis
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best) , but not as low
emissions as the hitachi. i like my image quality , but for all i know you
may be more discerning. good luck !

quantum lps240a hard disk phantom seeks

i just purchased and installed a 240mb quantum 3.5 hard drive , model
lps240a , and have a concern about its behavior.

although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file i o , it performs what i call phantom seeks.

when the pc is absolutely idle , i can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 30 40 seconds , lasting 1 2 seconds. this activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk led never
comes on. the disk led is attached to the disk controller card , not
the drive.

my other hard disk , a seagate st3283a , does not have this kind
behavior.

can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon \?

hello all i have a problem with my micro solutions backpack sometimes
it works , sometimes it doesnt. i will either start a backup , or
start a tape format , and at about 20 percent i get an error either saying
the tape is bad or the backup format has aborted for an unknown reason.
if i turn everything off and wait a half hour it works fine. is it
because the tape backup is too warm \? has anyone had similar experiences \?

i have a 486dx 33 isa pc compatible (insight) with an infotel internal

modem in , i pulled a phone out of the jack in another room , and ran a phone

worked fine. then i split the line from the jack in the other room , ran
the line into my room into the surge protector and up to my computer. then
i got a regular phone and plugged that into the phone jack in the modem.
now when i try to use the modem , quicklinkii says no dialtone . the phone
plugged into the back of the computer works fine. i tried unplugging the
phone , but still no dice. is it that the phone line was split too many
times \? (i do n't understand how this could be a problem , since the phone
worked fine.) please note none of the software or hardware parameters
were changed , only the phone line itself. is my new modem faulty \? what

djohnson@moose.uvm.edu 'tiggers are wonderful things ! '

i think you mean the ethernet numbers. the 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
electronic serial number (esn) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
this is a physical layer concept. the ip address is a higher layer protocol.
the analogy to telephone service is the ip address is your phone number , while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
i) physical identification scheme (number).

but to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number. of course the
manufacturer can always retro fit a board , but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

if your question is actually referring to the ip address , it is most definetly
changable. but it is strictly software.

on 04 21 93 04 30 , michael shapiro had the unmitigated gall to say this

ms the dos system date has a twenty four hour clock and a rollover bit.
ms when the system crosses midnight , the rollover bit is turned on.
ms subsequent reads of the time add one. there 's no change possible

ms (this information was current up through dos 3.3. i 've not checked to
ms see whether it applies to later versions.)

just a small tidbit with the advent of dos 3.3 and later versions , ms added
a small feature to the dos time function. if a program sets the dos clock
via dos system services , then dos will set the bios clock to the same value.
this breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the dos clock did not bleed over into the bios clock.

this may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the

i totally agree with your friend , since when the cpu is apparently idle
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second
(checking for keyboard input for instance).

the exception to this is for cpu 's used in laptops , where the cpu can
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but
doing absolutely nothing. in this case it needs a hardware interrupt
to get it going again.

actually , the iapx86 family has a halt instruction that causes the cpu to
cease processing instructions. the cpu resumes processing either by being
reset or by receiving an external (hardware) interrupt. this is different
from the power management facilities victor mentions. of course , whether an
operating system 's idle loop uses the halt instruction is another matter
entirely.

i ran into the same problem when i upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400
modem. any time i give the modem a reset command atz while , in windows.
the computer locks up. if i give the atz command in dos , it will work. my solution
was to not give the modem the atz command thru windows. in the procomm
install process i told the program i have a hayes compatible 2400 modem. atz
was not included in the initialization string it works fine. i called ms
about this , they did n't have a clue as to what the memory interupt conflict

is this reverisible \? you can unpoke as easy as you poke \?


well , i tried this method based on responses from several people. either
i am a klutz(probable) or they have changed the connector. i ended up having
to destroy the connector , put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and
then plug them into the sb connector in the correct order. it works great
this way so this turned out just fine. it certainly sounded easy based on
other people 's experiences but my attempts did not go too well...

i'm a novice in messing comp. hardware.
my original ide hd is a 42mb western digital which came with the system
when i bought it. and i just got a 213mb ide hd maxtor that i wanted to
add as a slave drive. i did change the jumper settings on 213a maxtor to
configure it as slave drv , but i did n't change anything on my 42m western
dig , since i did n't have any doc. on it. and as i predicted , it just beeped
and gave me an error message about hdd controller.
so , i had to take my 42m off install my 213a to be my only hd.

any help on this matter would be much appreciated.

my questions are

has anybody out there ever been succesful using such hard disks
together and if so what jumper settings and bios settting did he she

is it possible that my controller is the reason for my troubles \?
the only thing i know about it is that it is an

control \? in my case only one \?


thanks in advance

volker

ide drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave.
if it is a master , then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present.
these must be set correctly according to each drive 's manufacturers spec
ification. the cmos setup is almost positively not the problem. it is
probably not the controller ide controllers all support exactly two
drives maximum. check those jumpers.

i 've been told by our local computer guru that you ca n't do this unless you
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system
up for two hard drives from the beginning. i took him at his word , and i
have not tried to find out any more about it , because i'm not going to back
everything up just to add another hdd. if anyone knows for sure what the
scoop is , i would like to know also. thanks in advance also.

bill willis


1. do not do a low level format on an ide drive unless you have the
executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer. these are
available from bbs 's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal
fee.

2. in addition to the master slave jumper on an ide drive there is also
another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present. get it right !

3. the cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to
pin 1. no twisting or swapping on an ide cable. be sure of pin 1
on all three components do not make assumptions (guesses are ok
but assumptions are bad).

4. if the cable and jumpers are correct , and the cmos setup is correct ,
then you may have to do an fdisk followed by a high level format.
i have never personally found this necesary , but perhaps there is
something gone wrong with the data on the disks \? probably not but
i understand your predicament you will probably throw salt over
your shoulders , wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant
while dancing around the room if someone said it might help.

good luck

i am right now working on an mpr ii certified (swedish standards for
low emissions) hitachi superscan 15 monitor. it 's 1024x768 , up to 72hz at
that res , and it got a good write up for image quality in a recent (feb. \? )
issue of pc magazine. as far as i know , very little fully matches a nec in
image quality (at least according to the mags i ca n't tell any
difference between the two ! ) , but i think nec is low emissions on only one
of the two types. there 's vlf (very low frequency) and elf (i think that 's
extremely low frequency). the mpr ii standards set strict limits on both.
but many comapnies , nec included according to one article i read (i get a
bunch of mags so it 's hard for me to remember which ! ) , which claim low
emissions but not specifically mpr ii compliant or mpr ii certified
only control for one , usually vlf , and ignore the other.

nanao 's f series (e.g. f550i) and t series (e.g. t660i) monitors
are mpr ii compliant. according to my little pamphlet , the t series
monitors are also tco compliant , whatever that is.

the 200mb harddisk is n't supported in the bios. alas there 's no user type

getting bad blocks on the harddisk . question who knows a solution to this \?
i 've seen a small program for this once in the byte , but i have n't been able
to find this. would speedstor or diskmanager work for this , i used these
programs quite a lot in the xt days , but i do n't have these anymore , seagate

help will be greatly appreciated.

it first depends on what an idle cpu is doing !

is there anything to do \?
yes do it goto loop
no goto loop


the cpu is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions...

i 've done some asic and digital design , but not any cpu design.
it would seem to me that on a 486 , the fpu is not being used , most of
the cache is not being accessed , the off chip buffers drivers are idle ,
the multiplier is n't multiplying , the barrel shifters are n't shifting ,
microcode is n't microcoding , etc. this means transistors are n't
switching which means less power dissipated (in cmos) , which means
less heat.

from what i understand , the pentium shuts down those sections of the
cpu which are n't being used in order to cut down on heat power.

hi peeps ,

here 's another of those any ideas type queries.

i 've been given an oldish phillips televideo terminal type thingy , without

when i dismantled it , i discovered that it is really just a standard
rgb monitor with built in modem rom software etc.

phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the rgb inputs , so i
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked sort of.

the problem is that i have no idea where to connect the sync lines.
the display rolls continuously , but does change modes (ok only to
cga but useful for my laptop).

any of you wonderful people any knowledge of phillips monitors \?

i 've tried phillips in the uk and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort , but phillips computer
is now under the auspices of dec (at least in the uk). dec said
sorry phillips do n't make it any more. what is it anyway \?
a uk support dealer said circuit diagrams \? sync \?

so any ideas.

any advice \?
1. do n't hold your finger on it
2. when cooking with it use a very small pan and be sure
to not spill liquids on the components
3. if you do not plan to cook with it there are a number of
small cooling fans designed to mount on the chip and plug
into your power supply. look in consumer shoppers.

fast as the orchid p9000 could drive it. also , the 17 does claim to be able

i do n't know what some of those mean and do n't verify their accuracy , i just

dynamic astigmatism focus'. right. they mean they use two lenses. advanced
invar shadow mask. viewmatch color control which they claim is and easy to use
system that adjusts colors to closely match printer output. as near as i have
been able to figure out , this translates to separate controls for red , green ,

its no viper , but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of
the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson 's review.

micron system owner 's , i would be interested to hear your opinions on the
dtc 2270vl local bus disk controller. my system came with a maxtor 7120
drive (120 mb) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 kb s ,
i am now at 22 kb s. is this about as good as it gets \? i ca n't get a norton 's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls , at
least that was what the program said.

on 04 20 93 21 56 , tim king had the unmitigated gall to say this

tk accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from one particular
tk box of diskettets in the a drive when i boot up , rather than getting
tk the non system diskette message , the machine hangs and the cmos
tk gets overwritten (luckily , gateway sends a print of the standard

just a wild thought here , but how about this there is a small boot program
on every formatted diskette , whether or not it contains system files. it is
this small program that prints the non system disk error , not dos. if
this program tries to transfer control to a bios location that is
nonstandard on the gateway , then it could clear the bios.

i do n't think that the bios is overwritten , there is usually a small routine
to clear the cmos area , in case an invalid configuration prevents the
machine from booting. i think that the boot code on the fuji disks may
inadvertantly call this routine.

just a thought.

looking for help in just the right place...

does anyone have experience with the promise technology caching
ide controller dc99m \? i just ordered one , 110 with 512k installed ,
and have a few questions

1. is it easy to use \? does it need any kind of tsr 's , or is
it completely transparent to the system board , so that i wo n't
have to change the bios configuration \?

yes , it 's easy to use. it 's just like an ordinary controller.
you do n't have to change the bios config.

2. is it transparent to the ide drive \? will it work with any drive
or does it have to be configured explicity for the type of drive
installed \?

it 's transparent. it works with any drive. if you change the
drive you only need to change the bios config. as usual.

3. will it work with a dual drive system (master and slave) \?
yes , no problem.


4. with it , will i need smartdrive or dos buffers \?
that depends. you will get a little better performance
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition. that 's
because access to the card through the isa bus is slower
than access to system ram. i do n't use smartdrive myself ,
but i have a few buffers.


5. is the promise technology controller a good one \?

any information would be greatly appreciated. thanks !

after reading many postings concerning hard drives i'm still unclear
about one thing. these new cached hard drives is the cache on the
drive itself or is it separate , like on the controller or something \?
thanks to anyone who can clear this up.

i have two scsi hard drives , each has 512kb of 'cache'.

there several reasons for this

when the drive has read requested data from the disk the scsi bus may be
busy. this data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and
the data can be transmitted.

when the drive receives data to be written , the data can come down the bus
faster than the drive can write it to the disk. it needs to be stored
somewhere while the disk is writing it out.

in these situations the memory is being used as a buffer not a cache !

may be the drive does some read adead caching as well...

these lpt1 , com1 , disk controller are call devices. there are
devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership , eg. disk
controller (i6) and keyboard (i1). there are also devices that
does not require exclusive ownership , ie. it will share an
interrupt with another device , eg. lpt1

no. in a standard isa bus , the one that almost all non laptop pcs use ,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt. this is due to
a screwup in the bus design. for example , if your soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7 , then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times , depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
this precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

when two or more devices in an isa bus pc share an interrupt , it 's
because they 're implemented by a single card.

interesting. would you care to explain to me then , how my soundblaster
pro card and my printer card are sharing irq 7 successfully \? i assure
you that they are both set to irq 7 and that i have no problem. my
computer is a dtk 286 12 ibm clone.

simple. first , andrew is correct , although i can see where there might be
some confusion. it is indeed possible to have two cards configured to use
the same interrupt. they can not share the interrupt in the sense that it
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time.

here is an example. for some time , i was short of free interrupts. i had a
tape controller (not a floppy tape ) that needed one of irq0 irq7. (it 's an
old tape drive.) my solution was to use irq3 (also used for com2 , where my
modem is). i did this because i reasoned i would never be using the modem and
the tape simultaneously. when kermit runs , it installs its own interrupt
handler for irq3 and uses the serial port. if the tape drive were to generate
an interrupt , kermit would not have a clue what to do with for the tape
controller. (and since the tape controller would not be serviced , it would
most likely hang. ) likewise , when the tape backup software runs , it
installs an interrupt handler for irq3. that handler wo n't do anything for
the serial port.

under dos , printing is not interrupt driven. instead , the bios polls the
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent.
that 's why you can have your sound card and lpt1 both configured to use irq7.
try that on nt and see how far you 'll get. )

yes its realy simple , no one makes a mother board that runs the
bus at more than 33mhz....sam

which bus \? \? \?

i think there are several reasons

50mhz motherboards are harder to get right
50mhz need a fast l2 cache 12 15ns is a good idea
50mhz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant vesa bus
66mhz dx2 chips are faster for a lot of things


with a good , fast l2 cache a dx2 66 is going be be faster than a dx50...

one of the things going for the dx2 66 (over the 50) is that it 's
clock speed complies with the vesa local bus spec.

lance hartmann (lance hartmann.austin.ibm.com@ibmpa.awdpa.ibm.com)

a couple other problems with the 486dx 50

1.) system manufacturers had major problems solving the electromagnetic
interference problems with 486dx 50 systems. getting an fcc b (home use)
certification required additional shielding in the system.

2.) heat...a lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and or cooling
fans on their 486dx2 66 chips. i would guess that the 486dx 50 ran
temperatures inside the case even hotter. and heat is the enemy of system
reliability.

btw we have a system now to perform these tasks , it has the following

smc ethercard 8 bit

we 're quite happy with the ati card very fast , once the data gets to it ! !
slow repainting images under photostyler that have moved off screen , or
been uncovered !

there does n't seem to be enough raw cpu when running desqview x ! its sluggish
running the local window manager. also , many functions under photostyler take
a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).

there 's not enough memory in the system desqview x and a 1 meg smartdrive
do n't leave much room for other apps. photostyler will page to disk with
medium size images.

i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this
machine sustains only 120k sec over ethernet while our sparcs sustain 600k sec
on the same network. going to the 16 bit version of the smc card increases

i think the logic board may have been buggered , but the drive works perfectly without a disk cache.

i tried hyperdisk and various versions of smartdrive , all to no avail.

yes its realy simple , no one makes a mother board that runs the
bus at more than 33mhz....sam

this is n't quite true depending on the number of local bus slots , and
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board , it is
possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz. i 've also spoken to a few
people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble
(and a couple of people who could n't get a lb card to work at that speed).

which would you choose , and why \?

i have both !

i have ide only on my dros box and ide and scsi on my unix box.

ide on the dros box 'cos it only has a hard disk , scsi on my unix box 'cos it
has a scsi hard disk , cd rom and tape.

i bought scsi as it makes adding many devices easier. for the price of one
irq and dma i have three different types of device connected up.

faster drives are also available for scsi i have a dec dsp3085s that realy
does have a 9ms average seek time. i.e it finds data 25 faster than my 12ms
toshiba drive.


like lots of people , i 'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a) , and
a standard ide controller card on my isa 486 50.

i do n't think that scsi will increase your data transfer much on an isa bus (


i'm currently thinking about adding another hd , in the 300mb to 500mb range.
and i'm thinking hard about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit).
i believe i'm getting something like 890kb sec transfer right now (according
to nu).

890kb s is pretty good...


how would this number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for
my isa pc , and the state of the art scsi hard drive (the best system i could
hope for) \?

many state of the art scsi disks use the same mechanicals as many state of the
art ide drives. only the interface electronis differ look at the 520mb fijitsu
drive for an example !


obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would
you want to use on your isa system \? and how much would it cost \?

i use an adaptec 1542b on my unix box and no name ide cards on both.


along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd 's if i
were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my 200mb , 15ms hd \?
and how much would it cost \?

caching controller ! why \? what does it give you that smartdrive ( for dos ) does
not \? about 30kb extra lower memory ! that 's about it.

a properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching
controller ! my unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8.5mb s ! that 's
faster than the standards isa bus can ever sustain !



thanks for any comments.

help !

as i understand it , here is the process of adding such a drive. could you
please tell me if i'm right..

1 buy a scsi contoler. which one \? i know adaptec is good , but they are
kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the 100 region \? i want
it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also , i have seen on

adapter need to be the same as the drive \? what type of drive is the
quantum \?


i have tried others , but i think that the adaptec is best value for money.


2 connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable.
do i have to worry about the power supply \? i think i have 200 watts and
all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.


i dont think you can mix the two types of drive , unless you have one of the
scsi ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off.


3 setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive. what type
of drive is this \? i do n't have the numbers for this drive.


instructions for drive type are included with the controller. with some it may be
a type 1. no matter what the disk is. with others it may be a type 47. i had one
controller that i had to tell the bios that no hard disk was installed.


4 format and create partitions on the drive. do i use format or fdisk \? i
think that ide drives ca n't be low level formatted. is it the same with
scsi \? how exactly does fdisk work \? i have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk. ideally , i would want
the drive partitioned in to two partitions d and e how do i do this \?


do not low level format a scsi unless you have the scsi low level format program.
first use fdisk to set the partitions , then use format.


well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting \?

i am no expert on this. but i am pretty sure there is no way to recover this. ide drive has mapping information written directly on drives. when you low level format it , the information itself is gone as well , i do n't think you can get it back unless you send it back to western digital and ask them to refurbish it for you.

using the pc as an xterminal , running desqview x 1.1 and sun pc nfs ,
talking to our network of sparcstation 's this is where a lot of

having in mind the size of the images , my opinion is to go with vlb.
it has much more bandwith that eisa , which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (i have not made measures , so someone else may
share experience on that.)

also , the dx2 66 is faster in the operations , that run off internal
cache , slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
so my advice is the 66 vlb.

we 're quite happy with the ati card very fast , once the data gets to it ! !

have you tried running photostyler without the cache \? no need to have
paging and cache both. (well , you might argue , that the paging is

memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).

i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this

the bandwidth (theoretical) of isa is over 5mb s , which is far from
0.15mb s. i tried my isa ide hard drive (maxtor 213mb) and got the
same results 0.65mb s regardless of the isa bus speed
(5.5 8.25mhz). so i guess , that just the card drivers combination is
lousy.

also , are there dx2 100 's on the horizon \? what about dx3 99 's \? dx3 150 's \? \? \? !

the rumors are that dx3 99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
out. but note , that ibm is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards , so you 'll have to upgrade the mb.

any information is greatly appreciated.

to solder one myself instead of buying one. i do n't even know what port is
used.

help me please (at ke kimmell@vax.cns.muskingum.edu)

kevin

p.s. i'm intending to use the cable for pc to pc transfers (via lap link or
telix. ideas and info gladly accepted.)

i do not have specific knowledge of lap link or telix , but my recommendation
for any package is to follow each one 's instructions for making the null
modem cable. the reason is that each one may be different since there is n't
really a standard for pc to pc communications. the following is a tutorial
i wrote up that will give you an understanding about rs 232 and null modems ,
but you should still check your software !

i will eplain a couple of details of rs 232. rs 232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem. actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware. the terminology used is data terminal equipment (dte) and data
communications equipment (dce). rs 232 spells out the voltage levels , the
connector type , the pinouts , and the signal protocols. the connector is
a db 25 but ibm has set an alternative standard of db 9. the primary
signals are transmit data (td) , recieve data (rd) , and signal ground (sg).
there are other signals that provide control between the dte and the dce.
for example , the dte announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the data terminal ready (dtr) signal. dtr is an
output on the dte and an input on the dce. similarly , the dce announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the data set ready (dsr)
signal. dsr is an input on the dte and an output on the dce. ok that 's
five signals there are only four more of interest. the request to send (rts)
signal is an output from the dte (and an input to the dce) that is used
to ask the dce permission to send data. if the dce agrees , it sends an ok
via the clear to send (cts) signal. (for completeness , the cts is an input
to the dte and an output from the dce). the other two signals (of interest)
are ring indicator (ri) and data carrier detect (dcd). these are both inputs
to the dte and outputs from the dce. ri is just what you would expect
a signal to the dte saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the dce. this is rather specific to the modem telephone line setup.
dcd is a way for the dce to announce that the connection has been established
i.e. the local dce is talking to some remote dce. there that 's it. oh
there are many other rs 232 signals defined , but they are obsolete. i have
explained the nine signals that are on a pc. the pinouts are as follows

name db 9 db 25
sg 5 7
td 3 2
rd 2 3
dtr 4 20
dsr 6 6
dcd 1 8
rts 7 4
cts 8 5
ri 9 22

now to address your problem at hand. when you connect a pc to a pc (a dte
to a dte) , there is no dce pair in the middle and therefore the rs 232
signal definitions do n't work out quite right. there is no dce to assert
the cts , dsr , dcd , or ri. so the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all and also forget about the dtr and rts outputs as well. if
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through sg ,
and crosses td and rd (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end , etc). the problem with this solution is that a pc that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other pc is ready. it would have to just
send the data and hope it got through. therefore a better null modem would
include the dtr dsr pair crossed. a particular point a confusion is in the
software area. just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft
ware will use them. if you are using the built in bios to control the
serial port , then the bios dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used. but if you have a comm. package such as brooklyn bridge , or lap
link or telix , then those packages dictate the cabling requirements. the
only thing you can guess reliably is the sg , td , and rd. the dtr dsr is also
fairly common. there is one more issue that needs to be addressed here. and
that is flow control. in the rs 232 scenerio , the dce 's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the dce could n't possible over run the
dte. by this i mean that as long as the dte has its dtr line asserted , the
dce will send data without requesting permission first. note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow the dte must request permission by
asserting the rts line and it must wait for the cts signal before it can
send. and now in the dte to dte scenerio , the question is do you need flow
control \? the answser is usually. but how \? for non binary communications ,
one common technique is xon xoff which is implemented in software no
wires are dedicated to flow control the td and rd carry the xon and xoff
commands. this type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control , but the problem is that you ca n't send binary data because
your data might include the xon or xoff codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals. (a work around is to have the software insert and extract escape
codes , but the hardware flow control is prefered). the problem with hard
ware flow control is that there is no standard. there are lots of ways to
do it and i bet they have all been tried. one cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the rts cts for one direction. but beyond that anything is fair
game. again , you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
but i bet you 'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage. by the way ,
i am familiar with one package that uses rts cts and dtr dsr for flow control
the rts is request to send and the dtr is ready to recieve , the cts is the
clear to send and the dsr is the request to recieve. this does not mean a
differnt cable it is just software. the clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the uart directly controlled by the cts
signal which means that the cts must be present even if you are not support
ing it in software. for these cases you will find cables that short the
rts to the cts at the same end (or perhaps the dtr to the cts). other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you do n't have (or do n't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires). specifically i am talking about the dsr. shorting
the dtr to the dsr is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this. it is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose. one more
gotcha signal is the dcd. some software (including the pc bios) expects to
see the dcd before it will work. this signal sometimes gets shorted with the
dtr. but my favorite null modem has the rts and cts shorted at each end , but
the rts is also connected through to the other end and connected to dcd. and
of course the dtr dsr are crossed as are the td rd and of course the sg must
pass through. this null modem works with most software. the flow control ,
if any , can use the rts dcd with the dtr dsr. if your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for pc to pc connection , then i suggest you use
this one.

recently , i have been getting a cmos checksum error when i first turn on my

is going to happen. i have an ami bios and all of the setting are lost , for
example the drive types and the password options. however , the date and time
remain correct. if anyone knows what can be causing this , please let me know.

most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing this battery
maintains the contents of the cmos memory when ac power is turned off , and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the cmos will be lost and
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the cmos data). try
replacing the battery.

if , however , your pc does n't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the cmos , you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a
more normal lithium battery. if this is n't possible , make sure you leave
your pc on for a half hour or hour each day this will keep the capacitor
charged. i 'd opt for the battery change , though.

it 's also possible , but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is
corrupting the cmos. if your battery seems okay , get a virus scanner and
check out your system.

is this true \? \? \? i was under the impression that people on the net had both
scsi and ide working together.

no , it 's not true. you can get scsi and ide to work together , but
there are restrictions (at least with the adaptec 1542)

you must boot from the ide drive. there is no way to boot from the
scsi drive if you have both ide and scsi drives.

you must disable the scsi rom bios (i'm not sure about this , though) ,
and so you must also use some special drivers to access the scsi
drive. (hmm. i know that you have to disable something related to
the scsi bios , but i'm not sure if it is the rom itself.)

back in february , someone asked about ide and scsi (this question
gets asked again and again). at the end of this message , i 've included
an edited copy of my reply. you might find it interesting.

darryl okahata
internet darrylo@sr.hp.com

disclaimer this message is the author 's personal opinion and does not
constitute the support , opinion or policy of hewlett packard or of the
little green men that have been following him all day.


1) is it worth it to get scsi over ide \? will there be a noticable
decrease in access time increase in xfer rate \?

for msdos applications , isa based scsi and ide controllers
generally have comparable throughput. you might get slightly higher
throughput with a scsi disk , but you 'll also pay more for the disk
( 30 100 and up , in some cases). you 'll also pay much , much more for a
good scsi controller.

note that good scsi controllers really show their power if they 're
used with a good multitasking operating system (like a pc unix).
unfortunately , neither msdos nor windows 3.1 is a good multitasking
operating system. the performance advantage of scsi controllers is
mostly wasted with these , which leaves the advantage of being able to
connect multiple devices to the scsi bus as the only advantage.
however , note that you can expect to pay a premium for scsi devices.

if you 're only going to be using msdos , stick with ide. it 's
cheaper , and you 'll have less headaches.

4) will virtually any scsi device chain into the controller for my
hard drive (bernoulli box , cd rom , tape drive , etc).

note the following is true for msdos windows only. who knows what
the future holds for windows nt and unix \? \? \?

no. generally , you have to find drivers for each scsi device ,
which probably do n't exist unless you 're using one of the better high
performance scsi controllers. these are typically bus mastering scsi
controllers that cost around 180 400 (street prices) and up , and
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular
name brand scsi devices either come with the card , or can be purchased
(for under 100 list price). examples of such driver kits are

adaptec 's ez scsi kit (list 75). this works only with adaptec scsi
controllers.

corelscsi ! (from the same people who make coreldraw ! ) (list 99 ( \? )).
this driver kit will supposedly work with any scsi controller card
that has an aspi driver , like the adaptec.

central point 's pc tools for dos 8.0 supports a number of scsi tape
drives (the documentation lists 40 tape drives). unfortunately , it
works only with adaptec controllers.

5) are there likely to be other problems incompatibilities with a
scsi controller and sound cards video accelerators and similar
equipment.

yes , you will run into problems , if you 're using a
high performance , bus mastering scsi controller. this does n't sound
right , does n't it \? it 's true , though. with one of these controllers ,
you 'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound
cards , floppy controller based tape drives (like the cms jumbo 250) , and
windows 3.1. i know. i 've been to h ll and back getting my scsi
controller to work with various hardware software (thank god for tape
backups). if you want a copy of my adaptec 1542 hints and tips file ,
send email.

these problems are n't really the fault of the scsi controller card
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of
the pc (e.g. , no standards). however , adding a bus mastering scsi card
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible.

scsi holds a lot of promise , but you can run into a lot of pc
compatibility problems. if you 're planning on using only msdos windows
3.1 , stick with ide. if you want to use windows nt or a pc unix , you 'll
have to make some hard decisions a good scsi controller and more than
one scsi hard disk will probably give you excellent performance , at the
possible cost of msdos compatibility. i say , probably , because ,
while i know this to be true with a pc unix , i do n't know if this really
will be true of windows nt. i suspect that it will , but i do n't know
for sure.

at t dataport internal 14.4k fax modem

the modem is an internal at (e)isa 8 bit card (just a little longer
than a half card). it has v.32bis for 14.4kbps data 9600 bps fax ,
v.42 , v.42bis , and mnp5 for error correction and data compression , so
you can get error free links up to 57 , 600 bps on a conventional phone
line. they will fall back to any speed (down to 1200bps) and even
disable compression and error correction if necessary in order to
connect with slower and older modems.

it has a 16550 buffered uart for better compatibility with
multi tasking operating systems (windows , os 2 , unix , etc).

they use a patented technology called optical line interface (oli)
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and
cleanest connection possible.

these modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech
support (and the call is free , too) from at t.

they also include the lovely and talented quicklink ii for dos and the
new quicklink ii for windows communications and fax software which
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any dos or windows
application just by printing. the windows version will send faxes of
any font and can include graphics , etc. the dos version can fax
graphics and a limited set of fonts (i believe that there are 5 or so ,
as well as any hp laser ii resident fonts).

i'm asking 210.00 for this modem (plus utah tax). this is at or
below the prices of any other (reputable) manufacturer of an
equivalent modem (including zoom , us robotics , etc). and , it is
backed by a company that will never go away.

this price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of
downtown slc. i can also arrange shipping , or you can stop by my home
to pick it up. (if you 're concerned about installing an internal
modem , let me know and we can discuss an arrangement for including
installation.)

if you 're interested , please let me know. this is an excellent modem
at an excellent price (they normally list for 500 and retail for
about 300). i installed one of these last week and it is very nice.

if you have questions about this , at t has an info number at
(800) 554 4996 , or you can email me and i will attemp to answer them.

the modem will go to the highest bidder i get within the next week.

i have uploaded the most recent windows drivers for the cirrus gd5426

cirrus bbs (570 226 2365) last night. if you are unable to get them there ,
email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well.
i have a local bus based card (vl24 bitblaster from micron) but i think
the drivers work with isa cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version ,
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88)
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on
cirrus 's part but i do n't think so.

from steve gibson 's (columnist for info world) graphic card comparisons

following for the sake of comparison

its no viper , but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of
the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson 's review.

micron system owner 's , i would be interested to hear your opinions on the
dtc 2270vl local bus disk controller. my system came with a maxtor 7120

(specifically their dot clocks) without paying , and signing non disclosure
agreements.

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide
x windows compatibility with these cards , as diamond did n't want to
divulge programming neccessities.

i do n't think the two main free x systems ( xs3 and xfree86 ) are part
of the fsf as such.


considering the above , and some postings about diamond 's bad attitute
towars customers , i ordered and actixge vlb 2m card. it will arive
these days.

does anyone know of an e mail address for diamond to which penio could
forward his purchase information \?

hi !
i recently purchased the toshiba 3401 cdrom. i own an adaptec 1542b
scsi card , and i have so far failed to get the cdrom to work under dos. it
works very well under os 2 , so i know that the drive is not faulty.
in my config.sys , i have aspi3dos.sys , aspidisk.sys , aspicd.sys. in my
autoexec.bat , i have mscdex , which came with dos 6.0. mscdex seems to find
and install the drive as drive f , but when i switch to that drive and try a
dir , i get an error message telling me the drive is not ready or something
like that. the cdrom is locked too , and the adaptec utilities do n't seem to
recognize that i have a cdrom at that point.


the current adaptec drivers do not support the toshiba 3401. you should
get the corel scsi drivers , which do support it.

this is the method that i used , and it works well.

x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl9

a couple of months ago i tried out a hercules graphite card. a pretty nice
board. fairly fast , and seemed quite compatible even seemed to handle the
svga modes i have whined about here on occasion. at the time i was just
buying a vlb system , so after checking out the card i sent it back. i wanted
a vlb card , and purchased a fahrenheit vlb card. this card is fairly fast ,
will do 70 hz refresh at 1024x768 , but is not compatible with my cd roms
(the svga thing i think i have merely conjectured that is the cause of
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those
programs than the modern boards i have tried. i have not gotten a straight
answer out of anybody...). the monitor i am using it with is a 17 magnavox ,
which also tops out at 1024x768x70 hz so its really a pretty good match.

but...

that is for my wife. i just purchased a viewsonic 17 for myself , and am
looking for a graphics card to drive it. i want 70hz refresh ,
and would really like it to handle my cd roms. i tried the orchid p9000 ,
which did neither of those things (though robert at wietek did say that the
70hz was possible if i modifed the driver data base). so my thoughts go back
to hercules. they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the
graphite around the end of march. i have heard precisely zero about it since
then. does anyone know if the card was actually released , and what capabilities
(and price) it has \?

any info would be most appreciated.

kin chan (sparrow @cmu.edu) wrote
just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. remember
those 21 mb disks that look and feel like 3.5 floppies \? these drives
are scsi devices and can read and write both 720 kb and 1.44 21 mb
disks. sounds to me to be one great product for the pc market. are the
prices really that unaffordable compared to cd roms which are currently
not rewritable \? i know about the new rewritable cds and expect sony to
develop the first mds for the computer. my question is why is n't there
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals \?

certainly in the uk the 21mb flopticals are about the same price as a
cheap cd rom now (you seem to be able to get them for around gbp
200 250). however the bigger optical drives (e.g. 128mb) are much more
expensive around the gbp 1000 mark.

a couple of questions that someone may be able to answer the 21mb
flopticals are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do
they need driver software etc. i.e. do you just rip out the floppy
drive , plug the same cables into the floptical , stick in a flopti disk
and hey presto you have a 21mb floppy. this sounds far too easy.

on the subject of sony developing mds for computers , i have reread a
pcw article on this subject and there it says that sony have been doing
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a
product themselves. from the article it seems that the audio md format
is a byproduct of their computer storage work the md mechanism is
identical to their mo computer optical drives. a sony spokesman was
quoted as saying that a 2.5 md disk would hold about 100mb of data
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being
productized.

the article said that one of the problems holding back development in
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. given that it
probably needs mds being used as a distribution medium to get it
into the market and since this has already been cornered by cds it
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong marketting lead
to get mds accepted.

pdb059@ipl.jpl.nasa.gov (paul bartholomew) writes

clip clip

interesting. would you care to explain to me then , how my soundblaster
pro card and my printer card are sharing irq 7 successfully \? i assure
you that they are both set to irq 7 and that i have no problem. my
computer is a dtk 286 12 ibm clone.

running ms dos or a derivative os , obviously. please take note that the
following is not what exactly happens , but a slightly simplified
explanation.

technically , the irq line is only a means for the device (printer
adapter , soundblaster , modem , hard disk , ...) to signal the cpu that
something 's happening here , please take note. how the cpu is
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system.
in ms dos , the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the
function that handles each interrupt.

now , basic dos does n't care whether the printer reports that it 's ready
to print some more stuff or not it simply ignores the interrupt. when
dos prints , it looks at the lpt buffer. if there 's a character there ,
wait a while and check again. if there 's not , copy a new character to
the lpt port. since the irq 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt , it 's
free for use for any other adapters in this case , the sb.

with any multitasking or otherwise advanced os , this kind of printing
approach just does n't work (or more precisely , it wastes a lot of cpu
cycles.) hence , you ca n't share the irq 7 with lpt1 and sb if you 're
running unix or os 2 or whatnot.

another issue with the sb is that only the digitized sound uses
interrupts. when the sb plays plain music , the cpu simply tells it what
to play until told otherwise. with digitized sound the interrupt is
required to notify the cpu when the output ends and new data is
needed.

you can , however , hook two (or more) com ports to one interrupt , but use
them only one at a time. this is because the interrupt handling routine
is same for both ports , and it can see from which port the data came
from. this , of course , applies for some other devices (like lpt) as well.

remember , this was greatly simplified in parts , but i think gives the
general picture correctly enough.

(i ca n't prove it 's true , but i believe it) , lpt1 does not
actually use irq7 , even though that interrupt is supposed to
be dedicated to lpt1.

to put it a little differently

irq 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the
printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity.

dos does n't monitor irq 7 it uses other means to determine when it 's
time to send out another byte to the printer.

most (all \? ) (hardware) printer adapters have the ability to disable
the use of irq 7 , usually by merely breaking the connection between
the isa pin and the associated driver. other adapters control the
irq line by a tri state driver , and by programming just leave it
in the high impedence mode.

unfortunately , there are a lot of adapter cards which use bistate
drivers (i.e. , either assert high or assert low) for the irq lines
rather than tristate drivers (assert high , assert low , or do n't
assert anything). the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes
the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically
disconnected by a jumper.

(incidentally , note that there 's no requirement that a card hold
the irq line low when no interrupt is desired. if that were true
you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines , and
that certainly is n't a requirement.)

non dos operating systems (os 2 , nt ( \? ) , various unices or whatever the
proper plural of unix might be) require the use of irq 7 for performance
reasons.

and the sb16 , alas , is one of the cards which uses bistate drivers.

can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why , if i get os 2 , i might
need an scsi controler rather than an ide. will performance suffer that
much \? for a 200mb or so drive \? if i do n't have a tape drive or cd rom \?
any help would be appreciated.

so , when you 've got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

one way is with dma or bus mastering. either of these make it
possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the cpu. the alternative is for the cpu to move
the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and
bus mastering.

how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus \?

ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface
created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data
bytes , with no dma.

if we 're talking isa (at) bus here , then you can only have 1 dma channel
active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device.
so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus , explain how
all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card
to the isa at bus at the same time.

think !

it 's the scsi card doing the dma transfers not the disks...

the scsi card can do dma transfers containing data from any of the scsi devices
it is attached when it wants to.

an important feature of scsi is the ability to detach a device. this frees the
scsi bus for other devices. this is typically used in a multi tasking os to
start transfers on several devices. while each device is seeking the data the
bus is free for other commands and data transfers. when the devices are
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data.

on an ide bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has seeked
the data and transfered it. this is typically a 10 20ms second lock out for other
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time.


also , i'm still trying to track down a copy of ibm 's at reference book ,
but from their pc technical manual (page 2 93)

the (fdd) adapter is buffered on the i.o bus and uses the system board
direct memory access (dma) for record data transfers.
i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter.
so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at
hdd controller does n't ! \? ! \? that makes real sense.

universal arithmetic receiver transmitter. normally , the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 uart on board. those chips generate an irq for every char
they received. the 16550 uart has an internal 16 byte buffer , so with the
right software installed it generates an irq every 16 chars.

close. universal asynchronous receiver transmitter.

3) is it necessary for 14.4k or higher throughput \?

if you ran dos , you do n't need a 16550 , because dos runs only one task at a
time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer.

even if you are running dos , if your cpu ca n't handle the speed of the
interrupts , you will still lose characters. i have one 286 10 machine with
an external 9600 bps modem attached and ca n't drive the serial port any faster
than 19.2k without losing characters.

ide also uses dma techniques. i believe floppy controller also uses dma ,
and most a d boards also use dma. dma is no big deal , and has nothing to
do directly with scsi.

no. the simple 25 style ide controller does not use dma. the cpu performs
the data transfer with a string move instruction. this requires that the
cpu stop what it had been doing and transfer the data. only the smart drive
controllers , be they ide or scsi , can transfer via dma. these controllers
tend to cost the same wether they are ide or scsi. to get the dma benefits ,
ide must sacrifice it 's price advantage on the controller .

for example , when rewinding or formatting a tape , the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus. this greatly increases productivity or , at least , do
something else while backing up your hard drive ). which happens to be
what i am doing while reading this group.

you can thank your software for that. if dos had a few more brains , it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else. the
hardware will support it , but dos (at least) wo n't. again , this has
nothing to do with scsi.

floppies are n't on the ide bus , your arguement makes no sense , this is n't
an ide issue. the floppys have their own processor on their controller
board which handles all of these commands.

the difference between ide and scsi is that all scsi peripherials are
intelligent. they each have their own controller. they depend on the
cpu to do fewer things for them , i.e. ide drives needing a processor
to transfer their data.

its a long story , but i still use ide on my 486 except for the cdrom which ,
thanks to scsi , i can move between both machines. if , and when , scsi is
better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines , i plan to
completely get rid of ide.

and if you stick with dos you 'll wonder why you ca n't multitask.

again i ask why ca n't a unix or os 2 type os do all the miraculous things
with an ide harddrive that it can with a (single) scsi hard drive.

the dettach callback mechanism alows the cpu to make requests of the
devices on the scsi bus and then dettach and go about its business.
later , when the device is done , it issues a callback to say that the
data has arrived or the function has completed. most scsi cards will
also dma the data into memory without the interupting the cpu , therefore
allowing it to continue working uninterupted. ide supports no such concept
as dettach callback.

can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system \?

i ran out of time on my last reply to this string and i do n't

had to return something in the 30 grace peried that had a problem
at all with midwest micro. they may of thought that you did n't
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem.
but it sounded as you did n't give them much of a chance to correct
things at all. the fact that the ppi worked okay for you is because
it is setup more for the no nothing user that ca n't understand the
instruction and the commands to configure it to his her system.
when you find out things like the fact the the ec led that looks like
you have connected to another ec modem , does n't realy say that.
but that it only tells you that you have ec turned on , on your modem.
i think that these led are nothing more that just light to hype up
the product. just like i bet someone took home a few extra
in the last year for giving the ppi modems the pc magazine award
of the year. not so for the stash (12) of them that i saw on my test
bench. i could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems
that i found with the ppi modems but i will try to control myself.
i will not even go into the 6 weeks it took ppi to credit my card
back for the modems after they had received them back...no i will
not go into that one nor will i go into talking to the parent co.

can any body tell me where the most significant bit of the total horizontal

i am trying to use the 640x480x16m mode under unix (so i cant just call int 10h)i have a program which dumps the contents of the card registers under dos , but i
am not sure i trust it for the extended registers of the et4000.
anyway , the problem is that in this mode , the horizontal total register
(3d4h index0) is apparently set to 0x27 , but 3d4h index 1 (the displayed clocks)
is set to 0xef , so 0x27 is nonsense. a resonable value would be 0x0127 so is
there a high bit , and if so , where is it \?
also , how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and
what would be an appropriate frequency \? ). the documentation is n't really very
clear (tseng.txt from vgadoc2.zip from some ftp site) about this.
my card is a megavga 1024 1mb card. seems to have a tseng labs bios (ver 8.05 i
think.) works nicely under dos , and very well under unix (linux) in all the
non hicolor modes. great for running x windows in up to 1152x900x256ni if your
monitor will take it (only just in my case).

please email the answer , as i ca n't read news very often.
