i have a simple test. i take several people who can speak
only one language (e.g. chinese , russian , german , english).
then i let the gifted one start speaking in toungues .
the audience should understand the gifted one clearly
in their native language. however , the gifted one can
only hear himself speaking in his own language.
works everytime. 8 )

this thread si starting to get really silly. such nonsense do not
belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue.

we chose to believe whetever we want , but we are not allowed to define
our own christianity. we see in parts. if you see something that i do
not see , or vice versa , it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief !

there is no wonder that your miracle does not work. you designet it
yourself , and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe , i see no reason why your miracle should really
happen. god is the one who does miracles , not humans !

after all we are all on the same way , or at least , we are all headed
for the same goal , following different paths. remember that we are
going to spend eternity together. if i can not stand your view here on
earth , how can i possibly stand spending eternity together with you \?

tongues is a question of belief. not wether you believe in jesus , but
if you believe that he is able to give you this gift. just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the bible. but there is no evidence in
the bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others.

perhaps i would believe the gifted ones more if they were
glorifying god rather than themselves. then perhaps we 'd
witness a real miracle.

maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying god , i do n't know.
but if this is the case , it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked.

in the bible you will find that jesus did not always do miracles. he
said that i do nothing , except what my father tells me. perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example !

on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god.
to quote unger 's bible dictionary on the apocrapha
1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.
2. they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred scripture.
3. they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture.
4. they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling.

first , to point out the obvious while 4 would clearly be a highly
subjective issue , one would be hard pressed to point to another book
of the ot (or for that matter the nt) that does n't , on some issues , in
some way , fail one or more of the first three of these tests.

second , one factor the deuterocanonicals share is the lateness of
their composition. i do n't recall the exact dating of all of the
books , but most if not all were written after the latest of the
canonical books (i.e. daniel).

furthermore , while the deuterocanonical may or may not have been
originally written in greek , they are clearly deeply hellenistic in
nature. both of these features probably figured heavily in the
rejection of these books from the various canons.

these may not be strict and uniformly applicable criteria by which to
judge the canonicity of these books , but , as these discussions have
shown , i think the one thing we can see is that there are no purely
objective standards for determining canonicity.

i do n't necessarily object to the secrecy but i do question it , since i see

biblical reason why any aspect of christian worship should involve secrecy.

early in church history , the catechumens were dismissed prior to the
celebration
of the eucharist. it was secret , giving rise to the rumors that christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims. the actions were considered
too holy to be observed by non christians , as well as potentially dangerous

thanks for the reply , but this is n't quite the same thing. like i said before ,
i can understand why non christians would be denied access to holy
ceremonies , but the ceremony itself (communion) was not secret. in fact , all
four gospels record the first breaking of the bread in some detail.
communion was a fellowship meal , and it was (and still should be , in my
opinion) inappropriate to invite those who did not share in the fellowship of
the body of christ. the fact that unbelievers , denied access to these communal
meals , began to imagine all sorts of secret and debased rituals during
communion does not by any means imply that the early christians were in fact
hiding shameful things from the general public. in fact , i think if you read
some of the early church fathers , you will find that they were not at all
bashful about describing what went on during communion. that 's why it seems
funny to me when mormons , who claim to be the only true restoration of 1st
century christianity , insist on hiding certain rituals on the grounds that they
are too sacred.

mark

actually , that 's not quite the case. john omits the central elements
of the last supper. his gospel is full of symbolism of bread and
wine. but the actual story is n't there. some people think he has
omitted some of the details because they were not talked about in
public in his community. there is also evidence that some aspects of
baptismal practice were kept secret. see morton smith 's secret
gospel i do n't agree with his lurid speculations on what the
secret practices actually were , but there does seem to be some
evidence that mark omitted certain details because they were
inappropriate for publication. clh

there 's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote. both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals , but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute.

from what i understand of my experience in looking up this word , and
discussing it with a greek literate individual , the meaning of the
word is rather clear. basically it literally means he who beds with a man
or he who has sex with a man. the burden of proof is on the
pro homosexuality side of the argument to show that the word has an
idiomatic meaning nor evident from its literal meaning. one can speculate
all day long that it might mean something else , but we need evidence
before we create new doctrines , and get rid of the historical understanding
of the meaning of this word.

link hudson.


i 've read enough discussions of this passage , in both liberal and
conservative sources , to be sure that the meaning even the literal
meaning is not certain. that does n't mean one ca n't come to some
conclusion , nor does it mean that i think there 's any doubt about what
paul thinks of homosexuality. but there are plausible arguments for
a couple of different meanings. clh

it seems that during the middle ages , it was customary for pastors to
explain the trinity to their parishoners by analogy to water.
water is water , but can exist in three forms liquid , ice and vapor.
thus it is possible for one essence to exist in three forms.

this sounds to me like a sort of generic modalism (in the the three phases
of water are but different modes of behavior of the same physical stuff).
it certainly does not seem to me to describe the orthodox position.

of course , i suppose that the medieval view of water may have been
different , but now we know that the phases of water are just different
behaviors of the same physical stuff different modes , not different
identities but perhaps the medieval people did not know that .

and recently , the pastor of my church drew an analogy , which i
also found useful a woman is often percieved by others in three
ways , depending on their relationship to her a mother , a wife and
an employee in a business.

this is clearly modalistic monarchianism , since these three aspects depend
solely on point of view , and are do not really represent actual variety
within the person.

i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues ,
however , a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly
perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.
...
would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god \? how does this apply
to homosexuals \? i understand fornication to be sex outside of
marriage. is this an accurate definition \? is there any such thing as
same sex marriage in the bible \? my understanding has always been that
the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife. i am , however , willing to listen to scriptural evidence
to the contrary.

if we take things this literally then we must also forbid women from
speaking in church. paul while led by the holy spirit was human and could
err. i find it interesting that christ never discussed the issue of
homosexuality , certainly it existed back then and if it was a serious
transgression christ would have condemned it.
i find it disturbing that the modern church spends its energy trying
to stamp out something that christ did n't consider worth a single word
of condemnation. christ repeatedly warns us against judgement.
do n't we risk judgement in equal measure when we condemn people who
god himself did not judge when he walked on the earth \?

protestants love to play up jerome for all he is worth. they should
remeber that after the decree of pope st. damsus i , jerome did not
hesitate in accpeting the deuteroncanon , and quoted them as scripture in
his later writings. and as i have already pointed out , in a previous

i think what jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in matthew 's

resurrection. this goes along with our belief that if a person is
to marry at all it must be done on this earth... deletions

the problem with this view is that the topic under discussion in this
passage is marriages that were performed on earth. jesus' words
seem to me to indicate that he regards his response as the answer to their
question about which earthly marriage would be valid after the resurrection.
this being the case , the most straightforward interpretation , in my
opinion , is that marriage does not exist in the next life because those
who are raised are of a different nature than what we are now. other
wise , why would jesus offer but are like the angels in heaven as a
contrast to the idea of the resurrected marrying and being given in

and when we do , our earthly marriages will be irrelevant. or at least ,

subject arsenokoitai scroggs ( 3)
organization fnal ad net
lines 199

cont. dr. james deyoung 3

r. scroggs

robin scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and
suggested a new twist to the word. scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a
hellenistic jewish coinage , perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic
terminology. the term is derived from lev 18 22 20 13 where the lxx
juxtaposes the two words arsenos ( male ) and koiten ( bed ) , and represents
the hebrew miskab zabar ( lying with a male ). yet he believes that paul did
not originate the term , but borrowed it from circles of hellenistic jews
acquainted with rabbinic discussions (180 n.14). it was invented to avoid
contact with the usual greek terminology (108). if this is true , scroggs
observes , it explains why the word does not appear in greco roman discussions
of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it. it was meaningless to
native speaking greeks (108).

scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the
object of the second part , thus differing from boswell 's learned discussion
(107). yet scroggs understands the general meaning of one who lies with a
male to have a very narrow reference. with the preceding malokoi (i cor 6 9) ,
which scroggs interprets as the effeminate call boy , arsenokoitai is the
active partner who keeps the malakos of the 'mistress' or who hires him on
occasion to satisfy his sexual desires (108). hence arsenokoitai does not
refer to homosexuality in general , to female homosexuality , or to the generic
model of pederasty. it certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model , he
affirms (109).
this is scrogg 's interpretation of the term in i tim 1 10 also. the
combination of pornoi ( fornicators ) , arsenokoitai and andrapodistai ( slave
dealers ) refers to male prostitutes , males who lie with them , and slave
dealers who procure them (120). it again refers to that specific form of
pederasty which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual
purposes , and the use of these boys by adult males (121). even serious
minded pagan authors condemned this form of pederasty. he then uses these
instances of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the apparently
general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in rom 1.
consequently paul must have had , could only have had pederasty in mind (122).
we cannot know what paul would have said about the contemporary model of
adult adult mutuality in same sex relation ships (122).

in relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical
concerns , scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of
vices in i cor 6 have no deliberate , intended meaning in paul. the form and
function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped. any
relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually
nonexistent. he concludes that paul does not care about any specific item in
the lists (104).

both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary
phenomenon of a catalogue of vices , scroggs argues that the scriptures are
irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today (129). the model
in today 's christian homosexual community is so different from the model
attacked by the nt that biblical judgments against homosexuality are not
relevant to today 's debate. they should no longer be used in denominational
discussions about homosexuality , should in no way be a weapon to justify
refusal of ordination. . . (127).

reactions to the new interpretations of arsenokoitai

d. wright

in more recent years the positions of bailey , boswell , and scroggs have
come under closer scrutiny. perhaps the most critical evaluation of boswell 's
view is that by david wright. in his thorough article , wright points out
several shortcomings of boswell 's treatment of arsenokoitai. he faults
boswell for failing to cite , or citing inaccurately , all the references to lev
18 22 and 20 13 in the church fathers , such as eusebius , the apostolic
constitutions , clement of alexandria , tertullian and origen (127 28).
boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term
derives either its form or its meaning from the leviticus passages (129). this
is significant , for if the term is so derived , it clearly refutes boswell 's
claim that the first half of the word (arseno ) denotes not the object but the
gender of the second half ( koitai). the lxx must mean a male who sleeps with
a male , making arseno the object.

wright also faults boswell 's claims regarding linguistic features of the
term , including suggested parallels (129). though boswell claims that
compounds with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it
as an adjective , wright believes that the difference between the two is merely
one of dialectical diversity no semantic import attaches to the difference
between the two forms (131). wright believes that in most compounds in which
the second half is a verb or has a verbal force , the first half denotes its
object and where the second part is substantival , the first half denotes its
gender (132).

it is with boswell 's treatment of the early church fathers that wright
takes special issue , because the former has failed to cite all the sources.
for example , aristides' apology (c. ad 138) probably uses arrenomaneis ,
androbaten , and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male
homosexuality (133) , contrary to boswell 's discussion. boswell fails to cite
hippolytus (refut. omn. haer. 5 26 22 23) and improperly cites eusebius and the
syriac writer bardensanes. the latter uses syriac terms that are identical to
the syriac of i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 (133 34).

next wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in
parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers , the
dominant form of male homosexuality among the greeks (134). sometimes this
parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia ( adultery ) , porneia
( fornication ) , and paidophthoria , with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris
(136). clement of alexandria in protr. 10 108 5 cites the second table of the
ten commandments as you shall not kill , ou moicheuseis ( you shall not commit
adultery ) , ou paidophthoreseis ( you shall not practice homosexuality with
boys ) , you shall not steal. . . (150 n. 43).

another occurrence of arsenokoitein ( commit homosexuality ) exists in the
sibylline oracles 2 71 73. it may be , wright observes , that the word was
coined by a jewish pre christian writer in a hellenistic setting represented by
or.sib. , book 2 (137 38).

wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in rhetorius (6th c.) who drew
upon the first century ad writer teucer , in macarius (4th 5th c.) , and in john
the faster (d. 595) (139 40). the last in particular bears the idea of
homosexual intercourse , contrary to boswell.

wright next replies to boswell 's contention that the term would not be
absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted
(140 41). wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to
the first century ad since it did not exist before then , that the greeks used
dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality , that some sources (e.g.
didache) show no acquaintance with paul 's letters or deliberately avoid citing
scripture , and that boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140 41).

boswell 's treatment of chrysostom in particular draws wright 's attention
(141 44). boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of chrysostom ,
omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue. chrysostom gives a
long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on rom
1 26. boswell has exaggerated chrysostom 's infrequent use of the term. wright
observes that boswell has signally failed to demonstrate any us of
arsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual
activity (144). it is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature
and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly
specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the greco roman world.

wright also surveys the latin , syriac , and coptic translations of i tim
and i cor. all three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning
homosexual i.e. , they understand arseno as the object of the second half of
the word (144 45). none of these primary versions supports boswell 's limited
conclusion based on them.

wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the
catalogues of vices as a literary form. he believes that such lists developed
in late judaism as hellenistic jews wrote in clear condemnation of
homosexuality in the greek world. this paralleled the increased concern on the
part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence. the term came into
being under the influence of the lxx (145) so that writers spoke generally of
male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual
engagement with paides (146). if arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were
interchangeable , it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).

in summary , wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning
homosexuality and arises with judaism. the views of boswell , scroggs , and
others who limit the term to active male prostitutes or pederasty are without
significant support from linguistic and historical studies.

next the questioning of wrights position by william peterson. after that , we
get into the good stuff of historical linguistic studies. this will
include symposium by plato. if there is any doubt as to the modern
understanding of homosexuality being understood or contemmplated at the time of
paul , this will certainly clear things up. also we will review paul 's use of
lev18 20 in the nt and how , as for him , 1) the law was fulfilled , but not done
away with , 2) lev 18 20 was the universal and the following chapters the
general. those who put forth that the ot no longer holds true today in our
culture , should stick around for this one.

13 r. scroggs , the new testament and homosexuality (phil 1983) 86 , 107 8.
independently we came to the same conclusion. apparently the connection is
made in e.a. sophocles , greek lexicon of the roman byzantine periods (from
146bc to ad 1100).
14 see discussion , 101 4. he says the same thing about paul 's language in
rom 1 26 27 (128). but this is doubtful. see the more cautious words of p.
zaas , i cor 6.9ff was homosexuality condoned in the corinthian church \? sblasp
17 (1979) 205 12. he observes that the words moixai , malakoi , and arsenokoitai
were part of jewish anti gentile polemic. yet paul 's wors at the end of the
vice list , and such were some of you , indicate that paul is addressing real
or potential abuses of his ethical message , not citing primitive tradition by
rote (210). wright disputes zaas' attempt to associate the term with idolatry
(147).
15 on boswell 's treatment of rom 1 26 7 , the article by r.b. hays , relations
natural and unnatural a response to john boswell 's exegesis of romans 1 , jre
14 1 (spring 1986) 184 215 , is an excellent critique.
16 d.f. wright , homosexuals or prostitutes \? the meaning of arsenokoitai (i
cor 6 9 , i tim 1 10) , vc 38 (1984) 125 53.
17 in an unpublished paper , henry mendell , arsenokoitai boswell on paul ,
effectively refutres boswell 's claims regarding the philology of arsenokoitai.
he finds the meaning to be general , a male who has sex with a male (4 11).
18 wright 's endnotes (148 49) list additional sources in the church fathers.
19 we also have noticed the same tendency by boswell to fail to cite all the
references to sodom and sodomy in the apocrypha and pseudepigrapha. see j.b.
deyoung , a critique of prohomosexual interpretations of the ot apocrypha and
pseudepigrapha , bsac 146 588 (1990) 437 53.
20 in light of the claim made by boswell that the infrequency of arsenokoitai
points to a meaning lacking homosexual significance , wright asks pertinently
why neither philo nor josephus use paidofthoria , nor josephus paiderastia ,
and why . . clement did not use the latter and chrysostom the former \? (152 n.
71) in a more recent article , homosexuality the relevance of the bible , evq
61 (1989) 291 300 , wright reiterates these same points. paul shows a
remarkable originality in extending the ot ethic to the church (300).

baptism and the gift of the holy ghost by the laying
on of the hands , when eight years old , the sin be
upon the heads of the parents.

what is the sin of the parents \?

hi bruce. how do you reconcile this practice with ezekiel 18 \?
ezekiel 18 20 the soul who sins is the one who will die. the son will not
share the guilt of the father , nor will the father share the guilt of the
son. the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him , and
the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.

is ezekiel 18 not translated correctly in your eyes perhaps \?

ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle.
however , it assumes that fathers and sons have
equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.

parents are responsible to teach their children
the gospel and other life skills. should they
fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their
children , the parent would be held responsible
not for their children 's sins , but for not
teaching them properly.

whenever the lord installs someone to a position
of authority in either the family or the church he
expects that person to teach those in his charge.

in ezekiel 33 7 9 someone called to care for others
is likened to a watchman unto the house of israel.
if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from
his way , that man shall die in his iniquity but
his blood will i require at thine hand.
nevertheless , if thou warn the wicked of his way to
turn from it if he do not turn from his way , he
shall die in his iniquity but thou hast
delivered thy soul.

even though the d c prefaces this commandment with
parents have children in zion i believe all
parents are responsible for teaching their children
whatever good principles they understand.
however , lds parents accept greater responsbility
and could be judged more strictly.

without quoting at length from the preceeding post , i 'd just like
to say that i find it a much more appropriate way of dealing with
issues like the holocaust and bosnia that asserting that god is
punishing them.

the activity of god is always redemptive , which means restoring
what has been lost , broken , or distorted. so , god does not will
the brokenness , lostness , distortion , genocide , poverty , etc , but
is nonetheless capable , willing , and active to restore , heal , mend ,

referring to mary
she was immaculately conceived , and so never subject to original sin ,
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life. this was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god.

i have quite a problem with the idea that mary never committed a sin.
was mary fully human \? if it is possible for god to miraculously make
a person free of original sin , and free of committing sin their whole
life , then what is the purpose of the incarnation of jesus \? why ca n't
god just repeat the miracle done for mary to make all the rest of us
sinless , without the need for repentance and salvation and all that \?

concept of mary 's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the
rest of christian doctrine as i understand it.

it 's always a two way street. god gave her the grace to avoid sin ,
thus when she was visited by gabriel , she gave her fiat , her total
acceptance of god 's will. this fiat summarizes why catholics regard
her as the highest of all humans , that god chose her and that she
accepted. knowing this in advance , we extrapolate that she was
neither stained by nor subject to original sin.

god did create us all miraculously free to choose or not choose to sin.
sufficient for the day is the evil thereof and the grace of god to
command it. this amount of grace was precisely determined by god
to be the amount required to do what god asked of her. the grace
given to each of us is also enough , but we do not always choose
to accept it. we also believe jesus was fully human and never
sinned.

god could have created a much better person than myself , one who
always chose the right thing , yet he created me instead , despite
my flaws. he proves he loves me as i am , continually drawing me
towards perfection. for whatever purpose he has for me , he has
confidence that i will accomplish it. if i ask god to repeat his
miraculous creation of the mother of his son , where will that leave me \?

anyone who thinks being gay and christianity are not compatible should
check out dignity , integrity , more light presbyterian churches , affirmation ,
mcc churches , etc. meet some gay christians , find out who they are , pray
with them , discuss scripture with them , and only then form your opinion.

if you were to start your own religion , this would be fine. but there
is no scriptural basis for your statement , in fact it really gets to
the heart of the problem. you think you know more than scripture.
your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the word of god. just
because they are nice people does n't make it right. you can start all
the churches you want and it wo n't change the fact that it is wrong.
that is not to imply that gays do n't deserve the same love and
forgiveness that anyone else does. but to call their behavior right
just because they are nice people is baseless , and it offers satan a
perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing.

i suspect ann was suggesting that you look to see whether the
spirit is alive among them , not whether they are nice people ,

this has troubled me for a long time and needs to be dealt with.

from a long article available through an individual on this newsgroup.

about scripture being against homosexuality

when we are
less homophobic we will see that what we know as gay and lesbian people ,
engaging in loving , voluntary erotic relations with each other , are n't even
mentioned. in the bible , tk


this frightens me (not in the homophobic sense , but intellectually) ,
especially because it was written by someone from a homosexual church.

so , if my interpretation is different than theirs , i am homophobic ! this
ca n't be right. disagreement in interpretation of the bible and or rejection
of homosexual acts is not tantamount of homophobia.

on 20 april , stephen mcintyre writes

i would rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in
heaven knowing that even one man would spend his eternal life
being scorched for his wrongdoings....

stephen , i suspect that when you and i use the word hell , we have
different concepts in mind. when you encounter references to heaven
in terms of crowns and harps and golden streets , i trust that you do
not suppose (or suspect christians of supposing) that the golden
streets are to be taken literally , still less that they are what the
concept of heaven is all about. why then should you suppose that
about the fires of hell \?
have you read the novel atlas shrugged \? do you remember the
last description of james taggart , sitting on the floor beside the
ferris persuader \? this comes close to a description of what is meant
by hell in my circles. if the image of fire is often used in this
connection , there are two reasons that occur to me.
the first reason is that it conveys the idea of hell as
something that any rational being would earnestly wish to avoid (as
any rational being would wish to avoid the fate of james taggart
but the latter image is meaningful only to those who have read atlas
shrugged , a smaller audience than those who have played with
matches).
the second reason is the history of the hebrew word gehenna ,
one of the words translated hell in the new testament. it refers
to the valley of hinnon , outside jerusalem. in early days , it was a
place where the canaanites offered human sacrifices (burned alive)
to molech. later , it was made a garbage or refuse dump , where fires
burned continually , consuming the trash of the city of jerusalem.
to be cast into gehenna or to burn in gehenna thus became a
metaphor for to be rejected or discarded as worthless.

lest you think that identifying hell with the fate of james taggart
is my own private fancy , i commend to you the book the great
divorce , by c s lewis. it discusses heaven (no harps) and hell (no
flames). it is shorter than atlas shrugged , and available at most
bookstores and libraries.

in article may.12.04.30.10.1993.10089@athos.rutgers.edu jek@cu.nih.gov writes

gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives.

i wrote that the apostle paul , in romans 9 , speaks of god as
choosing jacob over esau , and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done , since they had not been born
yet.

clearly , paul does not believe that they had had previous lives , nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it. for if they had
had previous lives , it would not make sense to say , neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet , since they are not yet born.


paul 's statement only asserts that that particular choice was not
a matter of karmic fulfillment of the past , just as the fate of the
man born blind (john 9) was not. there is no question here of the
simplistic idea of karma as a machine that is the sole determiner
of one 's destiny. even the eastern traditions , or many of them ,
do not say that , as one knowledgeable poster pointed out.

and if in fact that paul did not know about or believe in reincarnation
does not say anything one way or another about it. even john the baptist ,
who jesus says emphatically is elijah (matt 11 14) , does not appear to
have been aware of it , at least at the point at which he was asked. but
it is interesting that his threefold denial to the question whether
he is the christ , the prophet (i.e. isaiah) , or elijah , is emphatic in
the first case and very weak in the third.

i would like to add once again that , while it is important to discuss the
different passages that may point directly to the teaching of repeated
earth lives , one way or another , what i really see as important in our
time is that the subject be revisited in terms of the larger view of
christianity and christian doctrine. for the most part , those who do
accept it either reject the central ideas of christianity or , if they
are christians , hold their conviction as a kind of separate treasure.
i believe that christianity has important new understanding to bring
to bear on it , and vice versa , much that is central to christianity
takes on entirely new dimensions of meaning in light of repeated earth
lives. it has a direct bearing on many of the issues frequently discussed
in this newsgroup in particular.

i have said openly that i have developed my views of repeated earth lives
largely from the work of rudolf steiner. not that i hold him as an
authority , but the whole picture of christianity becomes clearer in light
of these ideas. steiner indicated that the old consciousness of reincar
nation necessarily had to fade away that it could be renewed in later
times , after a time of development of the christ idea through the first
two millenia after christ 's deed on golgotha. in our own time , it becomes
important that , having received the basic gospel of salvation , our
understanding of life and of the human being can now grow to embrace the
significance of this idea. for the discussions in this newsgroup , i
have tried to focus on that which can be related as directly as possible
to scripture and to fundamental christian teaching and tradition.

does anyone now where an english translation of the long recension of
the acts of the apostles can be found \?

1 a english translation of this can be found in
the acts of the apostles , translated from the codex bezae , with an
introduction on its lucan origin and importance , j. m. wilson
(london , 1923).

2 another work that might be useful is
the acts of the apostles , a critical edition with introduction and
notes on selected passages , albert c. clark (oxford , 1933
reprinted 1970).

(this is an edition of text of acts that makes the assumption that the
text in codex bezae is the more authentic. i do n't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not.)

3 another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is
the theological tendency of the codex bezae cantabrigiensis in
acts , eldon j epp (cambridge , 1966).

4 the most recent reference i found was an edition in french from the
early '80s. (i can supply the reference if anyone 's interested.)

5 now , many of the works are going to be difficult to find. so if
you 're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in
a textual commentary on the greek nt , bruce metzger (united bible
society , 1971).

metzger 's book serves as a companion volume to the ubs 3rd edition of
the greek nt. it contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in
the ubs3. furthermore , notes on an addition 600 readings are
included in atcotgnt (the majority of these occur in acts).

in particular in the introduction to the section on acts metzger writes
an attempt was made to set before the reader a more or less full
report (with an english translation) of the several additions and
other modifications that are attested by western witnesses ...
since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
text volume , care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
evidence that supports the divergent readings. (p 272).

i understand that one of the early codexes , vaticanus and siniaticus has
this version of acts. it would be interesting to know what the
differences are between the long and the short forms.

6 most of the copies of the text of acts that we have (including the
ones in vaticanus and siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter
(or alexandrian) version. the longer version to which you refer is
usually called the western version and its main witness is the codex
bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).

7 as far as size , the difference is that in clark 's edition
(mentioned above) the book of acts contains 19 , 983 words whereas the
text edited by westcott and hort (a typical alexandrian text) contains
18 , 401 words i.e. a difference of about 8 1 2 .

8 to answer the obvious questions , no , there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text. the main
difference seems to expansion of detail in the western text (or , if
you prefer contractions in the alexandrian). the western text seems
to be given to more detail. there are some interesting specific
cases , but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.

9 the discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy. if there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents
purely the authentic version , (ii) each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however , (iii) the variant in the
alexandrian text is the better more often than not.

christians can also feel that
sense of difference , however , when they are associated with those
weird televangelists who always talk about satan . if you 'll excuse
the cliched sound of this , everyone has to deal with his her
differences from other people. i can understand how being an atheist
could be hard for you being a christian is sometimes hard for me.

this is not at all comparable. christianity is the main stream in
western culture. you are trivializing the experiences of others.

i remember what it was like being different as a christian. we
were told all the time that we were different , and in fact that
only members of the our church were really christians (though others
who believed in god were n't as bad as atheists) , so we were a small
minority. that was nothing compared to being an atheist.

the only thing comparable would be a young child being christian
being surrounded by staunch atheists , including parents , who
actively persecute any religious tendancies both actual punishments
and , even worse , emotional blackmail. they would also have
to have the whole mainstream society on their side. maybe these
conditions could have occured in the old soviet union not in a
country with under god in its pledge of allegiance.

i doubt it even then , because children have to be taught to be
christians and hence must have support somewhere.

i have sympathy for gays growing up in repressive environments and
having to hide and sometimes at first try to deny a part of themselves
because i 've been there. only in my case it was my rationality instead
of sexuality which i was forced to try to repress.

in some way the pressures were different , of course , because you
chose your beliefs or are you saying that they were not your
choice , but born of necessity \? please , no flames about whether or
not gay people choose their lifestyle that 's elsewhere in this
newsgroup

yes. my atheism was born of necessity. for an intellectually honest
person belief is mostly a response to evidence. will or wishes have
nothing to do with it. i could choose to lie , or to be silent about
my true beliefs. i could no more choose to believe in the god of
christianity than i could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to
me. still i should be clear that i'm not equating what i went through
with what gays go through. however it is a mistake to assume that
everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them.
happily some are made stronger , once we get past it.

i must say that i
was n't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends
who did n't become atheists. i was just hurt differently.

i'm not sure i understand this sentence could you explain \?

not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my
childhood friends. suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee
that a person will be happy and strong emotionally , and a repressive
upbringing can leave its scars even , or especially , on those who do n't
get free of it. i doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and
i feel no need to defend it.

by the way i am much happier and stronger being out of the closet. in
the end it has been , as someone eloquently put it in private email , an
experience of liberation rather than disillusion.

love in the morning (psalm 90 14)

by malcolm smith

moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of israel. a generation
before the time of its writing , the people of israel had stood at kadesh ,
gateway to canaan , and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather
than god 's way. they refused an adventure of faith in god which would
have given them canaan , the homeland of promise. god honored their
decision , and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the
land of promise until they were all buried in the sand. the young decision
makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old , and
destined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the
time they were seventy eighty , at the most. the lives of these wanderers
had been unending sadness. moses described it as ending each year with a
sigh (v. 9). the fact that they knew , give or take a few months , when they
were going to die , underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.
whatever heights of success they reached , they would be a heap of bleached
bones within forty years. the only ones to live outside of that depression of
hopeless disbelief were joshua and caleb , who had stood against the nation
at kadesh and had god' s promise of one day entering the land. the
forty year period was finally drawing to an end. the new generation , those
who were children at kadesh , were now grown and eager to take the
inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. in the light of this , moses
prays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.
all these years , as moses had walked with these moaning and complaining
people through the wilderness of their exile , he had carried a double burden.
his was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been but
he also knew why they had chosen as they had at kadesh. the problem was
that they were ignorant of the character of their god. if asked. who is your
god \? they would have described him as the god who is power. when
aaron had created their concept of god in an idol. he chose a calf. or young
bull a symbol of power , of virility. in their minds , god was the young bull
who had impaled pharaoh on his horns and gored egypt 's gods as he led
israel to sinai. but when man worships a god of power , his miracles grow
thin and even boring. after miracle food on the desert floor and water
gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland , the
god of almightiness becomes ho hum what' s next on the miracle menu \?
and a god of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. he might
be all they need , but then...who knows \? if he has all power , he has a right
to do whatever he wants , whenever he wants. the only person these people
had known who had absolute power was pharaoh , and men 's lives had hung
on the whim of his moods , which could change with the wind. they believed
god could work his wonders on their behalf , but they did not know him
and , so , could not trust him. israel had a god based on what he did , his
acts moses knew the heart of god , the motivation behind the acts. from the
day of his encounter at the burning bush , moses had been fascinated by god.
at sinai , he asked to be shown his glory...to know who he really was. he
had seen what god had done he wanted to know who god was. this
request was granted , and moses was given a glimpse of god 's glorious
person. he had come to know the heart of god as compassion and
lovingkindness (exodus 34 6 , 7). the word lovingkindness is not to be
understood as a human kind of love. it speaks of the kind of relationship
arising out of the making of a covenant. it can only be understood as the
love that says , i will never leave you nor forsake you. lovingkindness is as
tenacious as a british bulldog when the world walks out , this love digs in its
heels and refuses to leave.and it is not human romantic love , based on
feelings and rooted in emotions. it is a love of covenant commitment and ,
therefore , operates quite apart from feelings. god 's love is not an emotion
that wavers day by day it is the total commitment of his being to seek our
highest and best , and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. god
does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses his feelings
of love toward us...we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with
us ! if that were the case , the first ugly , sinful thing we did would cause him
to reject us. he is love , and he loves us because of who he is not
because of who we are. he does not love what we do , but he is committed
to us , pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. he will
not let us go. his is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us
but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. it is
saying to the recipient , for as long as we shall live , i am for you. the god
who has revealed himself to man through scripture and , finally , in jesus in
his coming , and in his death and resurrection is the god who is
lovingkindness. thus he loves us and gives himself to us...he will never
leave us nor forsake us. tragically , many believers have never seen him as
love they see him as power. no one will come to faith by just seeing
miracles. miracles point to who he is , and that is when faith springs in the
heart. israel did not see god as lovingkindness they saw his acts of power.
moses knew his ways , the kind of god he was , and the love that he had for
these people. because of their total lack of understanding of his love , they
could not trust him to be their strength in taking the land. faith is born out
of knowing the love he has for us it is the resting response to the one who
gives himself to us. he is not the force , and to call him the almighty is to
miss his heart. he is love who is the almighty and the infinite force. if
man is to make force or raw power work for him , he must depend on
knowing the forrnula and have faith in it. but the power that issues from
love demands faith in the person of love himself. the forty years of
meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to
know the god of love. at this point , with the new generation and the
possibility of enjoying all that god promised , moses prays verse 14. the
language moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its
mother 's love , now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. it is
waking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over , cared for ,
protected , fed , and cleaned , day and night , by the mother. suppose we were
to ask , what has the baby done to deserve this \? or , have arrangements
been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience \? our
questions would be considered unnatural , even immoral. the child was
conceived in love , anticipated and prepared for with love 's excitement , a love
that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. the parents' love is
unconditional , spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child
or its performance. so god is love. he loves us unconditionally ,
spontaneously. we were conceived in his imagination and fashioned after
his image , to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the
lord jesus. it is slanderous , and immoral , to even ask what we must do to
earn and deserve that love. the child discovers its personhood and identity
through the eyes and touch , through the cuddles , of its parents' love. it is a
scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or , if
it survives , will have severe emotional problems. and a person who has been
held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the
embrace and knowledge of love from god. moses prays that the new
generation will learn to wake every morning , resting with total confidence in
the love of god. and will receive all his promises and blessings with joy and
gladness. significantly , moses prays that they will be satisfied with his
love. satisfied. in the hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing
being filled with an abundance of gourmet food. it is also used to describe
the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received
enough water. moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be
drenched in the life giving love of god. that sense of satisfaction is the
lifelong quest of every man and woman. when we are satisfied in our
deepest selves , many of our emotional and even our physical problems
disappear. man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling
that he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning , which make
sense out of the ordinary and mundane. apart from god , man seeks this
satisfaction through intellectual pursuit , through the exciting of the
emotions , and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in
religious exercise. but man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding
to the love of the living god. only in knowing god 's love will the rest of life
make sense. as the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again
became the inheritance to be taken , moses prayed this psalm. i find it
fascinating that he should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of his
love. considering the awe with which the people held moses. one would
think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and , by
the knowledge they gained , they would live in it. but moses knew
better. god is the only one who can make known to us his love. we wo n't
find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to
manipulate him. nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and
give us god feelings. it is god , himself , the lover , who must open our eyes
and satisfy us with his love. this prayer is man , in helplessness , asking god
to make the love he is real in our hearts. moses' prayer was partially
answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which
worked by love in the book of judges. but it would not be answered in its
fullest dimensions until the coming of the holy spirit , who pours out the
love of god in our hearts (romans 5 5). in the history of the early church ,
we read of the holy spirit falling upon the believers. this is an ancient
expression that , in modern english , means to give a bear hug. it is used in
luke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and falling on his
neck and kissing him. the holy spirit is god hugging you in your deepest
self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your
being. this is not a one time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.
moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization
that we are loved. the world , and much of our religious training , has taught
us to perform in order to be accepted. we have spent far too long living in a
state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance
and love from others , and from god. we now come humbled to receive love
we cannot earn...to be still and let him tell us we are loved to let the holy
spirit descend into us , pouring out the love of god. we come in stillness to
think on and repeat his words of love to our minds. which have been jaded
with the doctrine of perform to be accepted. we begin to realize that he
loves us as we are , and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. i challenge
everyone reading this to begin each day , from the moment you open your
eyes , by celebrating the god of love and praying this prayer. you may not
feel anything , but something always happens. i was x rayed the
other day. i did not see or feel anything , but i noted that the technicians kept
behind protective walls. they know you cannot be exposed to those rays
without being affected. so it is as we consciously begin our day knowing
that we are loved. such experiential knowledge will produce , according to
moses , joy and gladness all our days. joy is the result of a life that is
functioning as god intended us to function when he made us. you might say
that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. man' s highest
performance is to rest in the love god has for him... the hum will be joy , and
the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now
has in life. stop wandering in the wilderness. be satisfied with his love and ,
in joy , day by day , receive all his promised blessings.

referring to mary
she was immaculately conceived , and so never subject to original sin ,
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life. this was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god.

i have quite a problem with the idea that mary never committed a sin.
was mary fully human \? if it is possible for god to miraculously make
a person free of original sin , and free of committing sin their whole
life , then what is the purpose of the incarnation of jesus \? why ca n't
god just repeat the miracle done for mary to make all the rest of us
sinless , without the need for repentance and salvation and all that \?

i do n't particularly object to the idea of the assumption , or the
perpetual virginity (both of which i regard as catholic dogma about which
i will agree to disagree with my catholic brothers and sisters in

christian atheist arguments , soc.religion.christian spends a lot of

aaron aaron bryce cardenas aaronc@athena.mit.edu writes

aaron colossians 2 11 12 in him you were also circumcised , in the
aaron putting off of the sinful nature , not with a circumcision done
aaron by christ , having been buried with him in baptism and raised
aaron with him through your faith in the power of god , who raised him
aaron from the dead.

aaron in baptism , we are raised to a new life in christ (romans 6 4)
aaron through a personal faith in the power of god. our parent 's
aaron faith cannot do this. do infants have faith \? let 's look at
aaron what the bible has to say about it.

yes , let do. try

and if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me
to sin , it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea
with a large millstone tied around his neck. mark 9 42

let the little children come to me , and do not hinder them ,
for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these. i tell you
the truth , anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god
like a little child will never enter it.

the colossians passage does not make faith a requirement
for baptism. it merely says that in baptism we are born again ,
regenerated , and resurrected through faith. in the case
of an infant i would say that baptism works faith in the
heart of the infant through the power of the word.

the colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision.
circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made
a part of god 's covenant with israel. it was commanded to be
performed on the eighth day. the early church understood this ,
and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the
eighth day , or if it could in fact be done earlier.

aaron romans 10 16 17 but not all the israelites accepted the good
aaron news. for isaiah says , 'lord , who has believed our message \? '
aaron consequently , faith comes from hearing the message , and the
aaron message is heard through the word of christ.

aaron so then we receive god 's gift of faith to us as we hear the
aaron message of the gospel.

and the gospel is surely preached at any infant 's (or adult 's)
baptism. indeed , in a very real sense , the sacraments are
the gospel made tangible.

aaron faith is a possible response to hearing
aaron god 's word preached. kids are not yet spiritually ,
aaron intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to respond to
aaron god 's word.

how do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith \?
do you know this on the basis of god 's word , or from your own
reason \?

faith is also described as a gift from god , ephesians 2 8 , 9.
he gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults , through
the power of the gospel , romans 1 6.

aaron if you read all of ezekiel 18 , you will see that god does n't
aaron hold us guilty for anyone else 's sins. so we can have no
aaron original guilt from adam.

here you show that you just do n't understand original sin
you are arguing against a straw man.
maybe you 've been talking to catholics too much. i do n't
know. but original sin does not consist of god 's imputation
of adam 's guilt to us. it consists of our inheritance of
adam 's sinful nature. it is actual sin. see for example ,
the augsburg confession , article ii , and the apology of the
augsburg confession , article ii , and , for extra credit ,
john knox 's `the scots confession' , article iii.

aaron now then that we have a little more background as to why
aaron original sin is not biblical , let 's look at some of the
aaron scriptures used to support it.

aaron romans 5 12 therefore , just as sin entered the world through
aaron one man , and death through sin , and in this way death came to
aaron all men , because all sinned


ask yourself this question. do infants ever die \? then ask
yourself , if infant baptism is not valid , then where was the
christian church during all the centuries when almost all
of the baptisms were performed on infants \? were luther , melancthon ,
calvin , zwingli , hus , knox , andrae , and chemnitz christians \?


aaron psalm 51 5 surely i was sinful at birth , sinful from the time
aaron my mother conceived me.

aaron this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble
aaron ourselves before god in repentance for sinning. david himself
aaron was a man after god 's own heart and wrote the psalm after
aaron committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband.
aaron all that david is saying here is that he ca n't remember a time
aaron when he was n't sinful. he is humbling himself before god by
aaron confessing his sinfulness. his saying that he was sinful at
aaron birth is a hyperbole. the bible , being inspired by god , is n't
aaron limited to a literal interpetation , but also uses figures of
aaron speech as did jesus (john 16 25). for another example of
aaron hyperbole , see luke 14 26.

who are you to say what is literal and what is not \? is a literal
interpretation manifestly absurd in psalm 51 by reason of direct
contradiction with a clear passage from the word of god \?

you might also compare genesis 8 21 , the lord smelled the
pleasing aroma and said in his heart , `never again will i curse
the ground because of man , even though every inclination of
his heart is evil from childhood....

aaron we see
aaron that he did grow and become wiser in luke 2 40 and 2 52. the
aaron implication is that jesus did wrong things as a child before he
aaron knew to choose right over wrong.

you are a long way from proving this (rather monstrous) assertion.
all you can say is that jesus grew in wisdom and in stature. a
conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation
of reason , not on a direct revelation in scripture.

david h. wagner but mad reason rushes forth and ,
a confessional lutheran because baptism is not dazzling like
the works which we do ,
regards it as worthless.

subject mary , blessed among women
lines 23

dave bernard writes

when elizabeth greeted mary with the words blessed art thou
among women (luke 1 42) , it appears that this places mary
beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.

but deborah says (judges 5 24)

blessed among women shall be jael the wife of heber the kenite ,
blessed above all women in the tents.

it can doubtless be taken that jael 's slaying of sisera was a type
of mary 's victory over sin. but even if we take deborah 's words as
applying prophetically or symbolically to mary , they must still be
applicable literally to jael. we may well take them to mean that
god used her as a part of his plan for the deliverance of his
people , and that she has this in common with mary. but we have no
reason to suppose that they mean that she was sinless , and thus no
reason to take the like expression applied to mary as proof that she
was sinless.

if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why does n't the bible
ever say so. it never comes right and says only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.
what christ did say was

i solemly assure you , no one can enter god 's kingdom without
being born of water and spirit ... do not be surprised that i
tell you you must all be begotten from above.

could this be because everyone is born with original sin \?

in some earlier discussions on this thread i may have
given the impression that even though children did n't
require baptism it would n't hurt if they were.
to the contrary , when you baptize children before
they are capable of comprehending it you deny them
their opportunity to demonstrate their desire to
serve god.

have any of you considered that children are not
accountable for sin because they are not capable of
repentance \?
peter said to a group of men and brethren , repent
and be baptized every one of you (acts 2 38).
notice that he specified that if they repent then
they may be baptized .

in following peter 's instructions people must first
demonstrate repentance (a forsaking of their sins and
a desire to obey god 's commands) before they are
eligible to be baptized.

since young children are not capable of repenting ,
they are not eligible for baptism.
and since god is both just and merciful sin is not
imputed when there is no law (romans 5 13) , young
children are not accountable for what they ca n't
comprehend.

i think it 's time for me to post the faq.

this is an issue throughout the presbyterian church. on the other
side , one of the major churches in cincinnati has been ordaining
homosexual elders , and has ignored presbytery instructions not to do
so. and the church in rochester where the judicial commission said
they could n't install a homosexual pastor has made her an
evangelist . these situations , as well as the one you describe , do
not appear to be stable. this will certainly be a major topic for the
general assembly next month. if the church ca n't come up with a
solution that will let people live with each other , i think we 're end

just an observation although the bodily assumption has no basis in

of the church in recent years , in that it implied the inclusion of the
feminine into the godhead.

jung may have said that , but he was in no way speaking for the
catholic church. the dogma of the assumption in no way means mary is
considered to be god or part of the godhead. therefore it implies no
such thing about the feminine in general.

also jung 's statement makes it sound as though the dogma was
announced out of the blue. this also is incorrect , as dogma is only
the formulation of what has always been part of tradition. this dogma
has always been believed , but was not formally defined until the

before you finalize your file in the faqs (or after) , you might want to
correct the typo in the following

kinsey (see below) is the source
of the figure 10 percent. he defines sexuality by behavior , not by
orientation , and ranked all persons on a scale from zero (completely
heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).

it seems one or the other end of the rating scale should be identified with
homosexual .

as a personal note , i guess i differ with you on the question of work
entering human life as a result of sin.
note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin.

before the fall (gen 2 15) and the lord god took the man , and put him into
the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it. which i would call work .
for me , the difference introduced by sin is the painful aspects of work added
at the fall (i take the cursing of the ground in vs.17 19 to apply to the
work for sustenance). in a way , some view work as a blessing (ecclesiastes
is a fun book ! for melancholies).

i hope i do not sound caustic , maybe you can enlighten me further.

well , this is certainly a delicate subject , and i guess you accomplished what
you state as your purpose it summarizes arguments for allowing christian
homosexuality , not for me the most noble goal , but you are writing a faq.

i wonder if you might temporize the apparent sentence of the specific
homosexual you propose (arguably tenuously define).
the danger in advising christians to
depend upon such a change is clear when conversion does n't happen ,
which is almost always , the people are often left in despair , feeling
excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement
of life long celibacy.
perhaps that would be true of celibacy from homosexual relations , or
refrainng from their choice relationships , but that does not forbid
heterosexual. could they not have enjoy heterosexual relations for what it
was worth \?

this depends upon the person. in some cases i think the answer is
no. even with those who could , consider what you 're asking. i assume
we 're talking about marriage i certainly would not want to suggest
sex outside that. you 're talking about a permanent commitment to a
kind of sexual relationship that they are n't really sure they can live
with. there may be people for whom this is a possible solution , but i
wonder whether it 's entirely fair to the other partner. i have a
cousin who was a victim of exactly this situation. we found out later
(after her death) that her husband had had problems with his sexual
identity. his family (conservative christians) knew it , and pushed
him into getting married. he continued having problems , and they were
near divorce. she died in an accident whose circumstances some of the
relatives consider odd. he has since had a sex change operation , and
has been moving around from state to state without being able to hold
a job , keeping their children in a kind of home life both sets of
grandparents consider irresponsible. i hope you can understand why i
am not enthusiastic about pushing homosexuals into marriage. i really
liked my cousin. this is sort of an emotional issue for me. again ,
it may be possible for some , but this is the sort of situation that
needs to be dealt with pastorally and not as a matter of fixed
ideology. clh

trust. fear and trust are generally incompatible. if my only motivation
is fear , is there room for trust \? if so , there 's room for faith.
if fear precludes trust , then there ca n't be faith.

osiris in egypt...)
much deleted

it bugs me when i see this kind of nonsense.

first , there is no reasonable evidence linking masonry to ancient
egypt , or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and
there 's nothing definitive before the 17th).

my wifes uncle was a 30 level mason. he let me look at some of the books
(which after his death his brothers came over and took from his greiving
widow before his body had even cooled). do n't tell me you do n't worship
osiris. you must not be past your 20th level. you should read wilkinson 's
egyptians and how he shows this egyptian religion paralleling his own british
masonry. there is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black
mason. i 've talked with him , though much he likes to hide ( mystery ).
special handshakes and all. when he first started trying to evangelize me ,
he told me all kinds on special this , and special that. here is truely a
mystery religion. there is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of.

second , worship of osiris is not , nor has it ever been , a part of
masonic practice (we are strictly non denominational).

i have n't read it , but the literature that is offered by the silver haired
apologist (ca n't remember his name) on tv , did n't exactly come to this same
conclusion.

khons , the son of the great goddess mother , seems to have been gernaerally
represented as a full grown god. the babylonian divinity was also represented
very frequently in egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity
i.e. as a child in his mother 's arems. this was the way in which osiris , 'the
son , the husband of his mother , ' was often exhibited , and what we learn of this
god , equally as in the case of khonso , shows that in his original he was none
other than nimrod. it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was
originally founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis , the goddess mother ,
or wife of osiris. but what could have led to the union of a masonic body with
these mysteries , had they not had particular reference to architecture , and had
the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in
perfecting the arts of fortification and building \? now , if such were the case ,
considering the relation in which , as we have already seen , egypt stood to
babylon , who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the
masonic art \? the strong presumption is , that nimrod must have been the man.
he was the first that gained faim in this way. as the child of the babylonian
goddess mother , he was worshipped in the character of ala mahozim , 'the god of
fortification.' osiris , the child of the egyptian modonna , was equally
celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.' this strong chief of the
buildings was origninally worshipped in egypt with every physicall
characteristic of nimrod. i have already noticed the fact that nimrod , as the
son of cush , was a negro. now , there was a tradition in egypt , recorded by
plutarch , that 'osiris was black'....... hislop

it was like a cold slap to my face , when my wifes uncle brought out his
cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin. i mean real leopard skin. he told
me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin. (the reason that he
started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months
to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in christ and he immediately
repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge ! )

nimr rod from nimr , a leopard , and rada or rad to subdue. it is a
universal principle in all idolatries , that the high priest wears the insignia
of the god he serves. any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of
some leopard. it is interesting that the druids of britian also show , or
should i say hide , this representation. they , however , worshipped the spotted
cow .

i 'll stand by my statements. masonry is of the mystery religions that all
find their source in babylon , the great harlot. sorry peter , i do not mean to
be a cold slap to the face but there is to much evidence to the contrary that
masonry does n't find its origins in egypt. of the masons i have personally
talked to , all refered to egypt as their origin. why are you now separating
yourself from this which not many years ago , was freely admitted \?

subject sleeping with one 's aunt
organization math , stats cs , dalhousie university , halifax , ns , canada
lines 37

the last time we discussed homosexuality , i asked whether anyone could
identify any other act besides homosexual intercourse that the bible
prohibited , but which might in some circumstances bring no apparent
harm to anyone. put another way , the question is whether homosexual
intercourse is the only act that christians are supposed to believe
is immoral solely on the basis that god says it is , with no insight
being offered as to why it is immoral. no one could answer my
question in either form from the bible. (i did get an interesting
response based on roman catholic theology).

however , i think now that i can at least answer my first question.
link hudson pointed me to it in his recent comments about sleeping
with one 's aunt. incest is held to be immoral in every society ,
that is , there are some degrees of relationship where marriage
(and thus , intercouse) is prohibited. the bible is no exception.
the trouble is that it may be difficult to see why a particular
relationship qualifies as incestuous. societies differ as to
how they define incest. genetic reasons are sometimes offered , but
all the biblical cases cannot be dealt with that way. why ca n't
a man sleep with his step mother assuming that his father is
dead and that he has married her \? how does this case differ
from the duty to marry one 's brother 's childless wife.

are these two cases parallel \? does the bible prohibit some incestuous
marriages and homosexual marriages for the same reason , perhaps
that god knows they are not good for us and yet we are incapable
of understanding why.

p.s. please do n't bother writing me to tell me that i am a homophobe ,
as some did last time. my mind is not made up on these questions.
you do n't know whether i am homophobic or not. you do n't
know me. to call me or anyone else a homophobe without knowing the
person may be as much an expression of bigotry as some homophobic
remarks.

michael michael siemon mls@panix.com writes

michael the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is
michael that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket
michael equation of homosexual behavior and rape. since christians
michael citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have
michael at least read the story , it amounts to slander a charge
michael that homosexuality rape to use that against us.

and

michael it is just
michael as wrong (though slightly less incendiary , so it 's a
michael secondary argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate
michael homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the
michael rape of god 's messengers.

let 's review the sodom and gomorrah story briefly. it states
clearly that the visitors were angels. but all the men from every
part of the city of sodom both young and old surrounded the
house. they called to lot , `where are the men who came to
you tonight \? bring them out to us so that we can have sex
with them.'

for the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men
of sodom and by lot as men . furthermore we know from gen 18 20 , 21
that the lord had already found sodom guilty of grievous sin before
the angels visited the city. it is clear that the grievous sin
of sodom and gomorrah involved homosexual sex. it appears that
the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had
group orgies in the public square which simply indicates
the extremity of their depravity. it does not show that lesser
degrees of homosexuality are not sinful , as michael would have us
believe.

ultimately our understanding of god 's will for sexuality comes from
the creation story not solely on the story of sodom and gomorrah. he
created us male and female , and instituted marriage as a relationship
between one male and one female , therefore a man will leave his
father and mother , and be united with his wife , and they will become
one flesh. this marriage relationship is the only sexual
relationship which god blesses and sanctions. he regulates and
protects the marriage of man and woman , and even uses it as a picture
of the relationship between himself and his church. but we find not
one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between
two men , or between two women.

everything else that we find in the bible about sexuality derives from
or expresses god 's will in instituting and blessing marriage. thus
the levitical code , which was given only to the jews , forbade incest ,
homosexuality , bestiality the ten commandments forbade adultery and
the coveting of our neighbor 's wife other commandments forbade rape.
the men of sodom and gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and
perverse (jude 7) because they abandoned and or polluted the marriage
relationship. thus also paul regarded homosexuality as `unnatural' ,
romans 1 26 , 27 not because this was simply paul 's opinion ,
but because it was contrary to god 's purpose in creating us
male and female.

michael christians , no doubt very sincere ones , keep showing up here
michael and in every corner of usenet and the world , and all they
michael ever do is spout these same old verses (which they obviously
michael have never thought about , maybe never even read) , in total
michael ignorance of the issues raised , slandering us with the vilest
michael charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
michael manage to conjure up , tossing out red herrings with (they
michael suppose) great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss
michael our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what
michael it is.

hate the sin but love the sinner ...i 've heard that quite a bit recently ,
.... my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity.
i would think not.

hate begets more hate , never love. ....

in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our
neighbors. he does n't say anything about hate. in fact , if anything , he
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. ....

scott

i too dislike the phrase hate the sin , love the sinner . maybe the
definite article is also part of the problem , since it seems to give
us license to fixate on our brother 's peculiar pecadillo which we have
managed to escape by a common grace of heredity , economic situation , or
culture. our outrage at evil is too often just a cheap shot.

that said , i do n't think scott has adequately explored the flip side
of this coin , namely the love of righteousness. in the beatitudes ,
jesus blessed those who hungered and thirsted for righteousness. in
the new testament , it is never enough just to behave well , one should
always actively desire and work for the cause of good. in that sense ,
it should be impossible to remain dispassionate about evil and its
victims , even when these are its accomplices as well.

maybe mourn sin , love sinners catches the idea slightly better than
hate , but only slightly , since grief usually implies a passive
powerless position. a balanced christian response needs grief , love ,
and carefully measured , constructive anger. jesus has all three. the
european pietists during wwii whose response to nazi atrocities was
devoid of anger do not fare well as role models , however much love or
grief they exemplified.

my sister is an actress in new york and a christian. a few years
back , jack , her long time professional friend and benefactor , died of
aids , impoverished by medical bills , estranged from his family , and
abandoned by most of his surviving friends. only my sister and
brother in law were there with him at the very end. in her grief over
jack 's death , my sister found quite a few targets for anger callous
bureaucracies , the rigid self protective moralism of jack 's family ,
the inertia in christians' response to aids , and , yes , even jack 's own
lapse in morality that eventually cost him his life. jack himself
shared that last anger. brought up with strong christian values , he
was contrite over his brief dalliance with promiscuous sex long before
his aids appeared. (i imply no moral judgement here about jack 's
innate sexual orientation , n.b.)

maybe the hardest job is making our anger constructive.

yes , there are these two senses of interpretation , and certainly our
decision to accept scripture as inspired ultimately rests on our own
private opinion. however , when reading scripture , we have to remember
that the scriptures were given by god for our instruction , and that
the interpretation that matters is the one god intended. for example ,
if i decide that the fact that john the baptist is elijah teaches the
doctrine of reincarnation , i am wrong because that is not the intended
interpretation. the prophets did n't make up this teaching it came
from god , and we must accept it as such. this necessarily means that
our private interpretations must take a back seat to the meaning god
intended to convey. certainly we must rely on our best efforts to
determine what this meaning is , but this very fact should make us
recognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically
accepted as the infallible interpretation of god. we need to test the
spirits to see if they are from god. when the holy spirit speaks , he
says the same thing to all he wo n't tell me that a passage means one
thing and tell you it means another. if the two of us come to
conflicting conclusions , we ca n't both be completely right. we know
our interpretations are reliable only when the church as a whole
agrees on what scripture means. this is how we know the doctrines of
the trinity , the dual nature of christ , etc. infallibly. these
matters are not up for private interpretation.

this is the reason peter goes on to talk about the deceptiveness of
the false teachers. they preferred their own private interpretation
to the god given teaching of the apostles. it is through such private
interpretation that the traditions of men , so soundly denounced in
scripture , are started.

this paragraph brought to mind a question. how do you (mormons) reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with christ 's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke , chapt. 20) \?

well , here is something i wrote some time ago in response to a
similar question. i hope it helps

begin repeat of previous post

as for the scripture mentioned i agree that it does seem to be a
problem , not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general.
luke 's version has jesus saying that the children of this world
marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain
the kingdom of heaven. it almost sounds like marriage disqualifies
one for salvation. (matthew and mark both omit this statement.) i
think the accounts are not as clear as they might be. let 's have a
look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable
ideas of what it means. the scriptures involved are mat 22 23 30 ,
mark 12 18 25 , and luke 20 27 36.

what happened was that the sadducees , who did not believe in the
resurrection , thought they could trap jesus. they made reference to
the leverite marriage which required the brother of a man who died
without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children.
the children would be considered children of the deceased , just as
though the woman 's first husband had fathered them. it seems
obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be
the wife of her first husband. however , the sadducees concocted a
scene in which 6 brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to
father children by the widow. they seem to imply that the leverite
marriage was equal to the first for they ask , whose wife shall she
be in the resurrection \? at this point it seems obvious that if she
is anybody 's wife , it is the first husband. after all , had she
borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of
which brother was the biological father. it is possible jesus was
refering to this when he says , ye do err , not knowing the
scriptures or the power of god. (mat 22 29 , compare mark 12 24 ,
phrase not in luke 's account).

anyway , the sadducees ask , whose wife will she be in the
resurrection , seeing that all 7 had her \? jesus answer is that ,
in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in
marriage... (mat 22 30) when they rise from the dead they neither
marry... (mark 12 25) they which are accounted worthy to obtain
that world neither marry... (luke 20 35) all 3 accounts go on to
say , but are as the angels in heaven or the equivalent. i find
this last not very helpful since the bible does not define angels
nor give any idea what their life is like. (some ministers claim
that they are sexless , different that humans etc. but i can find no
biblical support for this.)

i think what jesus is saying here (and it is clearest in matthew 's
and mark 's accounts) is that marriages will not be performed in the
resurrection. this goes along with our belief that if a person is
to marry at all it must be done on this earth. however , we do
believe that a marriage performed by the authority of god can be
binding in eternity. in fact , the first marriage appears to have
been performed by god himself before death entered the world (in the
garden of eden). what therefore god hath joined together , let not
man put asunder. (mat 19 6) jesus also told peter and the other
apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound
in heaven (mat 16 19 , 18 18). i believe that this also refers to
marriages performed by the proper authority.

2. it is more likely than not that when st. john (or whomever) wrote
the book of revelation what was then considered scripture was
not the same thing you and i are holding in our hands !

revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of
domition (sp \? ) , a.d. 80 96. thus it could be argues that we are all
in sin if we accept 2 peter as scripture , since it was added to the
book after the composition of revelation , when we are told to add
nothing more.

okay , i went back and looked sure enough , my hunch was right.

2 peter was most likely written between 100 120 a.d.

revelation was almost certainly written between 80 96 a.d.

odds are the gospel of john was written around 90 a.d.

best dates for luke and acts are around 80 a.d. , maybe later.

again , this is from footnoted information in the new american bible ,
the best translation i 've come across in regards to giving complete
historical information about each book.

of course the folks who you 're arguing with almost certainly do

bill rea (cctr114@cantua.canterbury.ac.nz) wrote
his theology clashed with the theology of the
local prophets. it was out of a very deep understanding of the mosaic
covenant and an actute awareness of international events that jeremiah
spoke his prophesies. the judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with
theological meaning.

in my opinion , both the portland earthquake prophesy and the david wilkerson
new york will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
theological depths of the jeremiah prophesies.

perhaps one other thing i should have added is that jeremiah 's prophesies
about the coming destruction of jerusalem would have been understood by
the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding
of their relationship with the lord. today the if the general populace
hears prophesies like the portland earthquake or new york will burn
ones , they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship
(or lack of it) with the lord. they are far more likely to think that
they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter.
that is one reason why i am always deep y suspicious of bald judgement
prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. this
does n't have to be long winded. to see a relatively modern example look
at abraham lincoln 's second inaugural speech. the relevant section is
below. it is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both
prophesies posted here.

excerpt from abraham lincoln 's 2nd inaugural speech

both read the same bible , and pray
to the same god and each invokes his aid against the other. it may seem
strange that any men should dare to ask a just god 's assistance in wringing
their bread from the sweat of other men 's faces but let us judge not
that we be not judged. the prayers of both could not he answered that of neither
has been answered fully. the almighty has his own purposes. ''woe unto the
world because of offences ! for it must needs be that offences come but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh if we shall suppose that american
slavery is one of those offences which , in the provdence of god , must needs come
but which , having continued through his appointed time , he now wills to remove
and that he gives to both north and south , this terrible war , as the woe due to
those by whom the offence came , shall we discern therein an departure from
those divine attribute which the believers in a living god always ascribe
to him \? fondly do we hope fervently do we pray that this mighty
scourge of war may speedily pass away. yet , if god wills that it continue ,
until all the wealth piled by the bond man 's two hundred and fifty years of
unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with
the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three
thousand years ago , so still it must be said the judgments of the lord ,
are true and righteous altogether
with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right ,
as god gives us to see the right , let us strive on to finish the work we
are in to bind up the nation 's wounds to care for him who shall have
borne the battle , and for his widow , and his orphan to do all which
may achieve and cherish a just , and a lasting peace , among ourselves ,

jesus christ is not sufficient to call one 's self a christian.

so , is there common definition of what christianity is \?

the basic definition that i use is
the belief that jesus was god incarnate.
the belief that jesus was crucified and raised from the dead
for our salvation.
the acceptance of jesus as personal lord and savior.

this would include most christian denominations , but exclude the unitarians.

i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus.
if the law is reflection of god 's character and true holy nature , then
those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem


though this will be addressed in the series of articles i'm posting now under
aresnokoitia , i ca n't wait. this just really blew my socks off. read i tim
1 3 11. verses 3 8 speaks against those who have perverted the teachings of
the mosaic law. in vv.9 10 , we have , in order , the 5th thru the 9th
commandments and in the midst of this listing is homosexuals. the decalogue ,
above everything else , is seen as god 's absolute. if you do n't believe in
absolutes , then you have nothing do do with jehovah of the ot , which paul
reveals to be the messiah of the nt. lord christ jesus transliterates to read
jehovah 's anointed savior.
in i cor5 , we see the same emphasis of moral separation from the pagan
gentiles as we do in lev 18 20. in i cor 6 9 10 , only one notation (drunkards)
is not found in lev 18 20. paul was not naive in his use of the lxx. he knew
full well how he was using the law of god that was given in the ot , for
application in the nt. as i 've said , the law was fulfilled , not done away
with.

of questions we are trying to deal with. he encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong. he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act
straight and fail , and he had never faced christians who are trying
to define a christian homosexuality , which fits with general christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between god and man. it is unfair to take paul 's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions.

this understanding is thoroughly rebutted in deyoungs article that is being
posted. please refer to it.


one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument
is because paul probably did face this and other problems.

we can do better than probably which is not an adequate defense against the
statement that paul 's culture did n't have the same understanding of
homosexuality as ours.
again read the article because it uses facts.

i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is
not entirely a theological issue , but also a pastoral one.

i do n't see how you come to that conclusion.

i think i do , because i have worked in the homosexual community by means of
working with aids patients. the pastoral is merely the practical application
of the theological truth however. those who are working thru the issue of
homosexuality need to have our love and understanding just as with a friend who
is contiplating cheating on his wife or a friend who lives with his girlfriend ,
yet you continue to witness to him. but , once the choice is made , and there is
no remorse , then i feel that paul 's pastoral care , as presented in the
corinthian church , come to bear significance. the one in active rebellion
should be placed outside of the church if a believer , and if a non believer ,
then one wipes his sandels and leaves it in gods hand. if there was a member
in your youth group who was constantly pawing at the little girls , you would n't
hesitate to deal with the matter quickly and decisivly. that , in part , betrays
the present political correctness of the issue. pederasty is not accepted at
the present , but some how we are to accept homosexuality because the latter is
politically correct , while the former is not at least not yet. this is how
the morals decay.

i guess this would follow the liberal application in the political realm of
economics. the liberals want to tax the rich in the federal , yet in their own
states , when they try to get businesses to settle there , they give tax
incentives to these same richies. it comes down to a moral code of
relativeness , or to use the cultural thing , politically correct at the moment.
rex

you might want to look over 1 tim 1 10 again. if this is really the
5th through 9th commandments , we seem to be missing thieves , and
homosexuals would have to be fit in under adultery. this is of course
possible if arsenokoitia has a narrower meaning than homosexuality
in general , but i think that 's not your thesis. i have no objection
per se to the idea that the author of 1 tim might have quoted the 10
commandments , but 5 through 9 , minus one and plus a few things , begins
to look a bit marginal. clh

if you read all of ezekiel 18 , you will see that god does n't hold us guilty
for anyone else 's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam.

this neatly eliminates the need for a savior and proves that we can be
saved by works alone ! if we have no original sin , then it is possible for
us to save ourselves by not sinning. i understand the reasoning behind your

imagine the worst depth of despair you 've
ever encountered , or the worst physical pain you 've ever experienced.
some people suffer such emotional , physical , and mental anguish
in their lives that their deaths seem to be merciful. but at least
the pain does end in death. what if you lived a hundred such lives ,
at the conclusion of one you were instantly reborn into another \?
what if you lived a million , a billion years in this state \?
what if this kept going forever \?


did this happen to jesus \? i do n't think so , not from what i heard. he lived
one day of suffering and died. if the wages of sin is the above paragraph , then
jesus didn't pay for our sins , did he \?

this is something i 've always found a little curious. i 've never quite understood
the trinity thing. on the one hand , jesus is supposed to be god incarnate. but ,
at the same time , he is god 's son for god so loved the world that he gave his
only begotten son . first question is , if jesus was god in human form , how could
he really be god 's son \? if the holy ghost planted the seed in mary , so to speak ,
then it seems that jesus' relationship to god would be the equivalent to the
human father son relationship. while a son might inherit alot of the father 's
qualities , he is not the father. they are still two separite entities. to try
and say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. in that
case , jesus and god are n't the same. on the other hand , if their relationship
is n't the same as the human father son relationship , but jesus is actually god
incarnate , then he 's not really god 's son and he never was. he 's just god
manifesting himself as jesus. at least , this is how i'm seeing it. can someone
who is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us \?

getting back to the original question , what is the great price that jesus paid
to redeem our sins \? was it dying on the cross \? since jesus knew that he would
rise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven , i have a hard time seeing
how this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. his earthly body
may have been killed , but then , so what \? he suffered a few hours of physical
pain , but then , there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.
the fact that jesus was god 's only begotten son does n't seem to me to have much
meaning since god can beget as many sons as he wants to. jesus being the only
one was simply a matter of choice. i suspect that these questions will be very
offensive to many christians on this net. to those people , please accept my
sincere apologies. it is not my intention to offend or to trivialize christ.
but , i do believe these are legitimate questions and i am genuinely curious.

note that the trinity and incarnation have to be looked at together.
first , your reading of the virgin birth is an uncommon one. (in this
group , it 's dangerous to say that no one believes something.) you
seem to be suggesting the jesus is god 's son in a physical sense ,
with the holy spirit as father and mary as mother. i consider that
terrible heresy , though some people react less violently. the virgin
birth says that jesus' birth is god 's responsibility. but it does n't
imply that god 's sperm was involved. indeed one (though by no means
the only) speculation is that god used joseph 's genetic material.

second , jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the father. in a
trinitarian context , the term son refers to the eternal logos , who is
a part of god. the son did n't come into existence with jesus' birth.
jesus is the incarnation of the son. so his sonness is n't
specifically a result of being incarnated. rather , it 's the son
who was incarnated.

ever say so. it never comes right and says only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.
what christ did say was

i solemly assure you , no one can enter god 's kingdom without
being born of water and spirit ... do not be surprised that i
tell you you must all be begotten from above.

could this be because everyone is born with original sin \?

(i presume you are quoting john 3 3 7.)

1. my king james bible says except a man be born of water
and of the spirit , he cannot enter into the kingdom of god
(john 3 5). (here man adult ).
(however , this could be a quibble between translations.)

2. we can also analyze to whom the lord is addressing
marvel not that i said unto thee , ye must be born again
(john 3 7). here jesus is clearly directing his remarks
to nicodemus a ruler of the jews (not a child).

3. we can ask ourselves why the lord would even
introduce the concept of spiritual re birth through
baptism if newborn babies were n't free from sin \?

yup , in john 3 5 man is not in the original. a better translation
is no one can enter... , as in nrsv. of course in 3 7 , jesus is

mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at

since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the

bernadette was 14 years old when she had her visions , in 1858 ,
four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the
pope.

james kiefer

i forgot exactly what her age was but i remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education , whatsoever , at the age of the apparitions.
she suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in a prison cell of some sort.

she had to ask the 'lady' several times in her apparitions about
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.
for several instances , the priest did not get an answer since
bernadette did not receive any. one time , after several apparitions
passed , the lady finally said , i am the immaculate conception .
so , bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking. so , when she told the priest , the
priest was shocked and asked bernadette , do you know what
you are talking about \? . bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest. the priest continued with , how did you remember
this if you do not know \? . bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

the priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
but bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of our lady to bernadette.

(note this lady of lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims. at the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water
flowing.)

christians were called to repent of america 's national sins , such
as sexual promiscuity.

to which i reply ...whoa there !

how can i repent of someone else 's sin \? i ca n't.

and when i claim to repent of someone else 's sin , am i not in fact
judging him \? jesus equipped us to judge activities but warned us
not to judge people. judge not that ye be not judged.

c. s. lewis made the same point in an essay after world war ii ,
when some christian leaders in britain were urging national repentance
for the horrors (sins \? \? \? ) of world war ii.


i see your point , but i cannot more strongly disagree.

to repent means to turn around. we , as a nation , have behaved incredibly
arrogantly toward god condoning , encouraging , and even forcing folks to
participate in activity directly opposed to the written word of god. we
have arrogantly set our nation far above the god who created it and allowed
us the luxury of living in this land. we have set a bad example for other
nations. we 've slaughtered unborn children by the millions. we have
stricken the name of god from the classroom. we 've cheated god out of the
honor due him at every turn , and we owe god an apology every bit as public
as our sins have been.

when jesus said judge not that ye be not judged , he was not addressing
those like john the baptist who had repented and were calling others to
repent. he was addressing those who remained in sin while heaping down
condemnation on others for their sins. his message to us all was to remove
the log from our own eye before removing the speck from our brother 's. but
he also said to rebuke and to reprove. do n't forget that this is a command
too.

our problem today is that we tend to judge and condemn as though we were
rebuking and we tend to neglect bringing folks back to the lord with the
excuse that we do n't want to judge anyone.

in truth , what we need to do is to judge less and call others to repent more
and to be able to distinguish between the two in our own motives. call sin
what it is and do so openly. let it 's charge fall correctly where it should.
but instead of running someone into hell over it , pull them out of their
hellward path and onto the heavenward path.

we want prevention , not merely punishment.
we must reach the root of the evil...

hate the sin but love the sinner ...i 've heard that quite a bit recently ,
often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality...
but the context really is n't that important. my question is whether that
statement is consistent with christianity. i would think not.

hate begets more hate , never love. consider some sin. i 'll leave it unnamed
since i do n't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not
something is a sin. now lets apply our hate the sin... philosophy and see
what happens. if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the
stronger our hatred of it will become. eventually this hate becomes so
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner. in addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and
do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even
believe what they are doing is a sin). after enough of this , the sinner begins
to hate us (they certainly do n't love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior). hate builds up and drives people away from god...this certainly
cannot be a good way to build love.

i do n't agree , but i can only speak for myself. i have a good friend
whose lifestyle is very sinful. do i hate the things she does to herself
and others \? yes. do i hate her \? absolutely not. in fact , she tells me
repeatedly that i am the best friend she has in the world. i care about
her very much despite the fact that i hate how she lives her life.

it 's very easy to fall into the progression you describe above. i 've
felt it with my friend more than once. there is a very important
part of christianity that you 've overlooked above and makes it possible
to love the sin but hate the sinner. before i look at someone
else 's life and sin , i look to myself and am as disgusted by what i see
in me as i see in others , probably more. self righteousness is
contradictory to christianity and is what makes the progression you
describe happen. if a christian can truthfully quote paul and say , wretched
man that i am ! romans 7 24 (nasb) , that christian will be able
to love the sinner and hate the sin. if we have the attitude of the pharisee
who said , i thank thee that i am not like other men... luke 18 11 (nasb) ,
we will hate both.

from original sin. a better way to phrase it would be why did he
not do it that way , but you misunderstand how mary 's salvation was
obtained. like ours , the blessed virgin mary 's salvation was obtained
through the merits of the sacrifice of christ on the cross. however , as
god is not bound by time , which is his creation , god is free to apply
his sacrifice to anyone at any time , even if that person lived before
christ came to earth , from our time bound perspective. therefore ,
christ 's death and resurrection still served a necessary purpose , and
were necessary even for mary 's salvation.

in the nt , the clear references are all from paul 's letters. in rom
1 , there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil.
note that the passage is n't about homosexuality it 's about
idolatry. homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment , or at
least result , of idolatry. there are a number of arguments over this
passage. it does not use the word homosexuality , and it is referring
to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality.
so it 's not what i 'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality.

that 's like saying that murder is only wrong for those of us who are n't natural
murders , and stealing is only wrong for those of us who are n't natural
thieves.

david hammerslag asked

how do you (mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage
with christ 's statement that in the resurrection people will
neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke , chapt. 20) \?

several explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed ,
but most lds scholars whose opinions i have studied take more or less
one of the following three positions

(1) jesus was talking to a group of people (sadducees) who were trying
to trip him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa
tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they
did n't believe in). these people and those associated with them
( now there were with us seven brethren , matt. 22 25) would not
be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage. hence ,
the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni
ties but that does n't mean other , more faithful people could not
have this blessing.

(2) jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of
being married , and the process of becoming married. the latter
activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in
the eternities , because all eternal marriages will be taken care of
before then.

(3) the account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic gospels) is
missing something that would make its real meaning clearer. note
that we (lds) do not believe in biblical inerrancy , so we do not in
general feel obliged to reconcile each and every bible text with
modern revelation through joseph smith and other latter day proph
ets. nor are we particularly upset that the account in question
was not significantly revised in the joseph smith translation or
inspired version of the bible , since we do not believe this work
was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the jst con
stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the kjv.

the blessed virgin mary appeared to catherine laboure , a nun of the
sisters of charity on july 18 , 1830 at rue du bac , paris.

sister catherine was awakened late that night by a small boy , age 5
or 6 , who was literally glowing with some sort of interior light.
the child led her to the sanctuary of the chapel where he promised
the virgin mary was to be found awaiting her. our lady appeared to
her and instructed her for two hours or more on matters pertaining
to her life and to the future of france and the world.

on november 27 our lady appeared again to catherine. she instructed
her to have a medal struck. she told her that those who wore this
medal would enjoy special protection from the mother of god and would
receive great graces. in less than a year there were three more
apparitions. in june of 1831 the medals were a reality. many reports
were received by those who wore it. within two years of its issuing
the medal was known as the miraculous medal . catherine died in 1876.
her body to this day is remarkably preserved (incorrupt). she was
canonized on july 27 , 1947. her body lies in the chapel at the
motherhouse on the rue du bac where she had her first meeting with
our lady.

the apparition on november 27 1830 was of average height and clothed
in white with a veil that flowed over the head and fell to the floor.
above the altar , a pyramid painted to represent god 's all knowing
wisdom looked down on them. our lady 's feet rested on a white globe
and there was also a green serpent with yellow spots that she was
stepping on. in her hands was a golden ball that represented the world.
great streams of light issued from her hands and she also showed
catherine an image of two hearts , the sacred heart wrapped in
piercing thorns and her own heart punctured by a sword. the sword
represented her suffering with jesus.

the apparitions announced the onset of the great battle and forewarned
that a dark era lay in the immediate future. it was the apparition
leading up to the recent ones. our lady began to dispense secrets.
and with the globe she revealed herself in worldwide dispute
with the forces of the dark. she told catherine the times are
evil. misfortunes will fall upon france. the throne will be
overturned. the entire world will be overcome by evils of all
kinds.

refer to books on st. catherine for more of our lady 's messages.
a copy of the medal is also available in catholic bookstores.

i will post other marian events every few days or so including
the ones happening today which are still under investigation.
these postings serve only to introduce you to these events.
please look more into them and understand the reason for

obviously you can replace homosexuality in the above statement by
anything from murder to sleeping late. that does n't mean that the
same people would accept those substitutions. the question is whether
the relationships involved do in fact form an appropriate vehicle to
represent christ 's relationship to humanity. this is at least
partly an empirical question.

in some cases types of human relationship have been rejected because
over time they always seem to lead to trouble. i think that 's the
case with slavery. one can argue that in theory , if you follow paul 's
guidelines , it 's possible to have christian slaveholders. but in
practice , over a period of time , most people came to the conclusion
that nobody can really have that degree of control over another and
not abuse it.

the message you were responding to was asking you to look at the
results from christian communities that endorse homosexuality. (note
christian homosexuals , not people you see on the news advocating some
extremist agenda). you may not want to base your decision completely
on that kind of observation , but i would argue that it 's at least
relevant. you ca n't answer the request by asking why you should n't
look at the incest association , because in fact there is no such
association. if there were , it might be reasonable for you to look at
it too. of course that does n't mean that the results of all such
examinations would necessarily come out the same way. part of why
there are n't groups pushing all possible relaxed standards is that
some of them do produce obviously bad results.

jesus is talking with the
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can
come elijah must first come. jesus replies that elijah has come , but they did
not recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was referi
ng
to john the baptist. this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.

this was a popular belief in the judaism of jesus` time , that elijah
would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
did not actually die). however jesus was referring to john the
baptist not in the sense that elijah was reincarnated as john
(remember elijah didn`t die) but that john was a similar prophet to
elijah.

there is no question of similarity in jesus indication about john.
the passage in matthew is very direct. where luke (1 17) reports
the angel gabriel prophesying that john will go before christ in the
power and spirit of elias , in matthew 11 14 , jesus himself says of john ,

and if you care to accept it , he himself is elijah , who
was to come .

it is interesting that jesus prepended the words , if you care to accept
it , as if to say that the implications of this truth , namely of rein
carnation , i will not force on you , but for those who can accept it , here it
is. a jewish poster to other newsgroups on jewish esotericism and other
topics has outlined the esoteric , cabbalistic jewish teaching of of
reincarnation and karma , a teaching that is little known among jews
today , but which is apparently widespread enough in israel that hannah
hurnard ( hinds feet on high places ) was told about it by a rabbi
she was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in palestine.
thus there may well have been a small number of jews who knew about this ,
whereas the large number of people did not. the statement of jesus about
john , the greatest human personality in the new testament , is guarded
but nevertheless quite direct. again , the subject of reincarnation , one
way or another , is not a subject of the new testament , nor is the fate in general
of the human being between death and the last judgement. but there are
occasional indications that point to it.

as for the popular belief that elijah would come again , it was more than
a popular belief , as jesus confirms it in more than one place , and he never
corrected those who were expecting elijah for example , those who thought
that jesus himself be he.

marhaba nabil ,

if we posit two minds in christ , the mind of the logos and the mind of the
human jesus , then we must admit two wills. a mind is not a mind without a
will. i know this has been dealt with in past church prnouncements , but there
is a philosophical problem here that should examined.

t. v. morris argued that the incarnation can be seen like this


(mind of logos)
( )
( ( ) ) here , the mind of jesus is circumsribed by god the
( ( human ) ) son. god the son has complete access to the human
( ( mind ) ) mind but the human mind only has access to the mind
( ( ) ) of god the son when the son allows access. this
( ( ) ) explains why jesus said even he did not know the
( ) time of the kingdom.

the ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from
the field of psychology , and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream , seeing
yourself acting , knowing that is you , but also being omniscient.


i 've explained it here before. if you want the full document , ask me by mail
rex


questions arise as we begin to think about logos and what his inner
consciousness was composed of. we need to clarify the two natures of christ
briefly. the divine nature , which has existed eternally , did not undertake any
essential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the
attributes of god , the foremost of these being his immutability. this would
mean that it remained impassable , that is , incapable of suffering and death ,
free from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation. in the realm
of the divine nature it is better to say that the son of god became that which
was not absolute and in himself. the result of the incarnation was that the
divine logos could be ignorant and weak , could be tempted and suffer and die ,
not in his divine nature , but by the derivation of his possession of a human
nature.
this would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the
human nature are properties of the person , and therefore ascribed to the
person. by this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent ,
omniscient , and omnipresent , yet at the same time be also a man of limited
power , knowledge , a man of sorrows , subject to human wants and miseries. there
is , however , no penetration of one nature into the other. deity can no more
share the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential
perfection of the godhead.
we are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the
possession of the double natures. christ 's human nature is impersonal , in that
it attains self consciousness and self determination in the personality of the
god man. we must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the
man. nature is defined

the distinguishing qualities or properties of something the fundamental
character , disposition or temperament of a living being , innate and
unchangeable.

nature is then , in essence , the substance possessed in common , in as such
the trinity have one nature. there is also a common nature of mankind.
personality , on the other hand , is the separate subsistence of nature , with the
power of consciousness and will. it is for this reason that the human nature
of christ has not , nor ever had , a separate subsistence , that it is impersonal.
logos , the god man , represents the principle of personality. it is equally
important to see that self consciousness and self determination do not , as
such , belong to the nature. it is for this reason that we can justifiably say
that jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills , but rather one. it is
theanthropic , an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the
human and the divine natures , being that neither the consciousness nor the will
are simply human or simply divine.


the quotation given above is not identified , and it 's not entirely
clear to me what position loren is taking on it. just for clarity ,
let me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic
christological heresies monothelitism. that 's the position that
christ 's two natures were not complete , in that there was only one
will. in most cases (which i think includes this example) , it was the
human will that was regarded as missing.

normally people who talk about christ 's human nature as being
impersonal mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense. that is , they
are using person as hypostatis , not in the usual english sense of
personality. in this use , the doctrine is called anhypostasia .
personally i think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of
denying that the logos took on humanity fully. however it has never
been formally ruled a heresy , and in fact has been held by influential
theologians both ancient and modern (e.g. athanasius). but the
quotation above appears to be going farther than even athanasius went ,
into the realm of the overtly heretical.

father , then the father is someone different than the son. i have no
problems with multiple gods. to me , the whole context of the scriptures
says be perfect , even as your father who is in heaven that we can be
co heirs with christ that we will be like him.

co heirs share all things equally including knowledge , power , dominion etc.
when i am like him (christ) , i will be the same as he is and he is a god.

if god cannot do this , the his is not all powerful and he is not god.
if he will not , he is a liar and he is not god.

but if he does , he is the greatest of all the gods.


i do n't know of anyone who says that jesus prayed to himself. the
whole point of the trinity is that there 's enough of a distinction
within god that relationship is possible. this implies some sort of
communication. i assume that in their native form , the father and
son are directly enough connected that prayer in our sense is n't
involved. but jesus is the incarnation of the son , i.e. the logos
made flesh. when he 's in a human form , his human actions are limited
to human capabilities. so communication with the father takes the
form of prayer. i do n't see that there 's anything problematical about
that. it seems to be implicit in the whole idea of incarnation.

homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses. some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations.
others simply do not address the issues.

i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues ,

there are exactly zero verses that clearly address the issues.

however , a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly
perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.

the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is that applied
to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape. since christians citing the bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least read the story , it amounts to slander
a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against us.

... do not be deceived neither fornicators , nor idolators , nor adulterers ,
nor effeminate , nor homosexuals , nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor drunkards ,
nor revilers , nor swindlers , shall inherit the kingdom of god. and such were
some of you... i cor. 6 9 11.

the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia
in this. i think we can all agree (with paul) that there are some kinds of
activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or
reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation. we may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories , however and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest
in making them clear , leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions ,
with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated
christian discussion of all these areas.

homosexual behavior is no different. i (and the other gay christians i
know) are adamant in condemning rape heterosexual or homosexual and
child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly
harmless but obsessive kinds of sex heterosexual or homosexual
that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning \?

'i am free to do anything , ' you say. yes , but not everything
is for my good. no doubt i am free to do anything , but i for one
will not let anything make free with me. 1 cor. 6 12

which is a restatement that we must have no other god before god. a
commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break. some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.
it is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary , so it 's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of god 's messengers.

i wo n't deal with the exegesis of leviticus , except very tangentially.
fundamentally , you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what porneia means. there are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus , most of
which christians ignore completely. they never even bother to examine
them. they just assume that they know which ones are moral and
which ones are ritual. well , i have news for you. any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too , but buried pretty deep).
and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus
from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us.

i'm dead serious here. when people start going on (as they do in this
matter) about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are and what
do they know about it , huh \? it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating
insects. on what basis , other than assuming your conclusion , can you
say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus is not a part
of the ritual law \?

for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can
be law for christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you in every case , handled on its own merits to
determine why you pick one and ignore another. i frankly think the
whole effort misguided. reread paul no doubt i am free to do anything.
but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this ,
the great commandment of love for god and neighbor. if you cannot go
through leviticus and decide each command there on that basis , then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy. in this
context , it is remarkably offensive to say

i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

well , la ti da. so what \? this is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality rape. i know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in defense of bestiality. it is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed , consensual human
adult realtionships) , so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut. if you cannot address the actual issues , you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world. if you want to address bestiality , that is your business , not
mine. and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings. you want to dismiss us , and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

jesus and paul both expound , very explictly and in considerable length ,
the central linch pin of christian moral thought we are required to
love one another , and all else depends on that. gay and lesbian christ
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues.

christians , no doubt very sincere ones , keep showing up here and in every
corner of usenet and the world , and all they ever do is spout these same
old verses (which they obviously have never thought about , maybe never
even read) , in total ignorance of the issues raised , slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up , tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is.

such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ.
why , for god 's precious sake , do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you do n't know and wo n't even take the trouble to listen
to before you start your condemnations \? is that loving your neighbor \?
god forbid ! is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or
condemn others \? christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in
insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in paul that you are
so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do.

why , for god 's sake \?

for god did not send the son into the world
to condemn the world ,
but that the world might be saved through him.
whoever believes in him is not condemned ,
but whoever does not believe has already been condemned
for refusing to believe in the name of god 's only son.
now the judgment is this
the light has come into the world ,
but men have preferred darkness to light
because their deeds were evil.
for everyone who practices wickedness
hates the light ,
and does not come near the light
for fear his deeds will be exposed.
but he who acts in truth
comes into the light ,
so that it may be sh0own
that his deeds are done in god. john 3 17 21

for long ages , we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected. some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do
show a sinful shunning of god 's light. blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the self righteous they shall be justified.

however , we have seen the truth , and the truth is the light of humanity
and we now know that it is not we who fear the light , but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us.

deletia recovery programs , etc

i do need you to show me that there is such a thing as
a spiritual need to do that it may be necessary to show
me that spirits (souls , whatnot) exist god is not
important to that as far as i can tell.

i get the feeling that we are debating at cross purposes that we
do not see the same fundamental assumptions , and this perhaps makes
my answers orthogonal to your questions. i will try again.

perhaps you believe that nothing exists aside from objectively
observable and provable things. in that case , i cannot show you
that there is such thing as a spirit or a spiritual need these
things do not exist in the realm of the objective , but in the
realm of the subjective.

otoh , if you wish you can simply (but explicitly , please)
assume spirits exist , and then show me that they would
have needs , and that a.a. handles these needs in some way.
you can assume god exists too if that will help. i 'll play along.

(by a.a. , i assume you mean alcoholics anonymous , and not alt.atheism )
i would not say that aa handles spiritual needs. rather i would say
that aa (and other 12 step programs) help people come to terms with their
needs ie that aa is facilitating the recovery , and that as part of the
recovery , they recognize their spiritual needs , and begin to rely on a higher
power (12 step 's term) to fill them instead of whatever substance abuse
they had been accustomed to. (sorry , there is no objective proof here
either no way to take 2 identical alcoholics and try to have one recover
by fulfilling spiritual needs , and one without and externally compare the
difference we are talking about the virtually infinite complexity of
people here.)

but i should say , if god is a necessary component
of your spiritual needs then i truely do not understand at
all. it sounds to me like spirits have needs that should be
fulfilled by god , but can be masked in other ways (drugs etc).
if this is the case , then you can leave out god just describe
the problem , not the solution.

spiritual needs could be defined as things that people need in addition to
physical requirements like air , food , sleep , etc. these are things like
the need for love and acceptance , and the need for meaning in life. if
one denies the existence of spiritual things , one would presumably call
these emotional needs . the reason christians call them spiritual needs
is that they have aspects that are not fulfillable except by spiritual
means ie a person could be loved and accepted by many people , and do
many meaningful things , but still have a need for love , which can only be
satisfied by the love of god. now the problem is that there are people who
accept the existence of these needs , and people who reject them. since i
believe in absolute truth , some of these people are right , and the others
are wrong. so here are the 2 possibilities

1) if christians are right , then we all have spiritual needs ie
we all need god. those who do not realize that they need god are
deluded they just have n't recognized it yet.

2) if christians are wrong , spiritual needs are an artefact of our brain
chemicals. well adjusted and properly integrated personalities do not
have such things. christians are simply using the concept of god and
spiritual needs to mask their own inadequacies.

i hate to belabour the point , but the existence of spirits and spiritual
needs cannot be objectively demonstrated or proven , just like the existence
of god cannot. and yes , this means that there is a risk that all my subjective
evidence is manufactured by my brain chemicals. but on the other hand , i
could venture into solipsism and say that there is a risk that everything that
i appear to objectively know is really manufactured by my brain chemicals.

i suspect this is an unsatisfactory answer to a request for evidence and
demonstration of the existence of spirits and spiritual needs , but my assertion
is that such things are not objectively demonstrable. as i have said before ,
i myself am on the christian side of agnosticism , having been pushed off the
fence by subjective evidence. (and no , i was not raised a christian , so it
is not a case of simply accepting what i was indoctrinated with.)

the source and nt meaning
of arsenokoitai , with implications
for christian ethics and ministry

james b. deyoung

w. petersen

more recently wright 's understanding has itself been questioned from a
different direction. in a brief 1986 study william petersen found linguistic
confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of
arsenokoitai. 22 he faulted wright and english bible translaions for
rendering it by homosexuals in i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10.

in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey , boswell , and scroggs into a
single assertion that reiterates , in effect , the position of bailey. he finds
homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic. a
major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the
thought and terminolgy in paul 's time (187 88).

what is this disjunction \? he bases it on historical and linguistic
facts. accordingly , ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as
polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts.
virtually all forms of behavior , except transvestism , were acceptable.
christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in
describing these actions. ancient society know nothing of the categories of
homosexuals and heterosexuals , and assumed that , in the words of dover
quoted approvingly by petersen , everyone responds at different times to both
homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . . (188). 23

in contrast to this , modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual
to desire and propensity. k.m. benkert , who in 1869 coined the german term
equivalent to homosexual , used it as referring to orientation , impluse or
affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts (189).

petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english
dictionary , which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no
mention of acts. petersen 's point is that by using homosexuals for
arsenokoitai , one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history
where no equivalent concept existed (189). consequently the translation is
inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles , . . . . incorrectly exludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . and incorrectly includes
female homosexuals (19 89). prior to 1869 there was no cognitive structure ,
either inour society or in antiquity , within which the modern bifurcation of
humanity into 'homosexuals' and 'hetersosexuals' made sence (189).

the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio
homosexual is mistaken. yet is it possible that petersen is the one
mistaken , on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds \? the next
phases of this paper will critically examine petersen 's position.

the justification for translating
arsenokoitai by homosexuals

historical grounds

a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai
by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence. since
virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul 's
usage , no historical settings earlier than his are available. yet much writing
reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary
with paul. the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of
homosexuality , particularly homosexual orientation , in a way similar to
present day concepts.

peterson , bailey , boswell , and scroggs claim that the homosexual
condition , desire , propensity , or inversion whatever it is called cannot be
part of the definition of the term. they assert this either because the term
is limited to acts of particular kind (boswell , active male prostitutes
scroggs , pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient
times (bailey petersen). the following discussion will show why neither of
these positions is legitimate. attention will be devoted to the latter postion
first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds.

in regard to the latter position , one may rightfully ask , did not the
homosexual condition exist before 1869 \? is it only a modern phenomenon \? yet if
it is universal , as alleged today , it must have existed always including
ancient times , even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it.
indeed , evidence show that the ancients , pre christian and christian , not only
knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior , including all forms of
same sex activity (transvestism included) , but also knoew about same sex
orientation or condition. petersen admits (190 n. 10) that plato in
symposium (189d 192d) may be a sole possible exception to ancient
ingnorance of this condition. he discounts this , however , believing that even
here acts appear to be the deciding factor. however , this is a very
significant exception , hardly worthy of being called an exception , because of
the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.

the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for
knowledge about the homosexual condition. 24 plato posits a third sex
comprised of a maile female (androgynon ( man woman ). hence original nature
palai physis , consisted of three kinds of human beings. zeus sliced these
human beings in half , to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the
gods. consequently each person seeks his or her other half , either one of the
opposite sex or one of the same sex. plato then quotes aristophances

each of us , then , is but a tally of a man , since every one shows like
a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two and each is ever
searching for the tally that will fit him. all the men who are sections
of that composite sex that at first was called man woman are
woman courters our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex ,
whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.
all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men
they are incllined rather to women , and of this stock are the she minions.
men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine , and so long as
their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by
making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be
clasped in men 's embrasces these are the finest boys and striplings ,
for they have the most manly nature. some say they are shameless
creatures , but falsely for their behavior is due not to shamelessness
but to daring , manliness , and virility , since they are quick to welcome
their like. sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity
these alone prove in a public career to be men. so when they come
to man 's estate they are boy lovers , and have no natural interest in
wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of
custom they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.
a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the
willing mate of a man , eagerly greeting his own kind. well , when
one of them whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort
happens on his own particular half , the two of them are wondrously
thrilled with affection and intimacy and love , and are hardly to be
induced to leave each other 's side for a single moment. these are
they who continue together throughout life , though they could not
even say what they would have of one another (191d 192c) 25

should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as
long as they live , or even in hades , aristophanes says that each would
unreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all
the time (192e).

several observations about this text are in order. lesbianism is
contemplated , as will as male homosexuality (191e). natural interest (ton
noun physei) , (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination.
the words , born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man
(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai) , (192b) reflect the modern claims to
be born this , i.e. , as homosexual. the idea of mutuallity ( the two of them
are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love , 192b) is
present. aristophanes even speaks of mutual love ingrained in mankind
reassembling our early estate (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai
tes archaias physeos synagogeus , 191d). the concept of permanency ( these are
they who continue together throughout life , 102c) is also present. further
mention of and or allusion to permanecy , mutality , gay pride , pederasty ,
homophobia , motive , desire , passion , and the nature of love and its works is
recognizable.

clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from
actions. the speakers in the symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is
crucial money , office , influence , etc. . . bring reproach (182e 183a , 184b).
they mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e). there are tow
kinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its desire and passion
(186b d). the speakers discuss the principles or matters of love (187c) , the
desires of love (192c) and being males by nature (193c). noteworthy is the
speech of socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is
related to love and its objects (200a 201c). desire is felt for what is not
provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack. this is
the object of desire and love. socrates clearly distinguishes between what
sort of being is love and the works of love (201e). this ancient
philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of
being or nature. his wors have significance for more than pederasty. 26

in summary , virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and
homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato. petersen is in error
when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts , not
inclination or orientation. widespread evidence to the contray supports the
latter. 27

biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where
homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction. in
rom 1 21 28 such phrases as reasoning , heart , becoming foolish , desires
of the heart. and reprobate mind prove paul 's concern for disposition and
inclination along with the doing or working of evil (also see vv. 29 32).
even the catologues of vices are introdiced (i tim 1 8 10) or concluded (i cor
6 9 11) by words describing what people are or were , not what they do.
habits betray what people are within , as also the lord jesus taught (cf. matt.
23 28). the inner condition is as important as the outer act one gives rise
to the other (cf. mt 5 27).

petersen errs regarding other particulars too. transvestism apparently
was accepted by the ancients. it was practiced among canaaniteds , syrian ,
people of asia minor , as well as greeks , according to s.r. driver. 28 only a
few moralist and jewish writers are on record as condemning it. for example ,
seneca (moral epistles 47.7 8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an
adult slave to dress , be beardless , and behave as a woman. philo also goes to
some length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women
(the special laws iii , 37 41 see also his on the virtues , 20 21 , where he
justifies prohibition of cross dressing). even the ot forbade the interchange
of clothing between the sexes (deut 22 5).

petersen is also wrong in attributing to christianity the creating of the
new labels of natural and unnatural for sexual behavior. these did not
begin with paul (rom 1 26 27) but go as far back as ancient greece and even
non christian contemporaries used them. plato , the test.naph. , philo , josephu ,
plutarch , and others used these words or related concepts. 29

25 the translation is that of w.r.m. lamb , plato symposioum lcl (cambridge
harvard univ , 1967) 141 143. note the reference to adulteress. if there is
a homosexual condition derived from birth or the genes , logically there must
also be an adulterous conditon derived from birth.
26 elsewhere in the symposium we are told that it is the heavenly love to love
the male and young men (181c) but this must not be love for boys too young
the latter should be outlawed (181d e). such love of youths is to be permanent
(181d) , lifelong and abiding (184a). where homosexual love is considered a
disgrace , such an attitude is due to encroachments of the rulers and to the
cowardice of the ruled (182d an early charge of homophobia \? ). in athens it
was more honorable to love openly than in secret (182d an ancient expression
of coming out of the closet ). mutality was present ( this compels lover and
beloved alike to feel a zealous concern for their own virtue , 184b).
for petersen to label the symposium a possible exception to his position
is inadequate and misrepresentative. it is a significant witness to greek
society hundreds of years before the time of christ.
27 dover (homosexuality 12 , 60 68) finds homosexual desire and orientation in
plato 's works (symposioum and phaedrus) and elsewhere. philo writes of those
who habituate themselves to the practive of homosexual acts (the special laws
3.37 42 cf. de vita contemplativa 59 63). josephus says that homosexuality
had become a fixed habit for some (against apion 2.273 75) clement of
alexandria on matt. 19 12 writes the some men , from birth , fhave a natural
aversion to a woman and indeed those who are naturally so consitited do well
not to marry (miscellanies 3 1) it is addressed in novella 141 of justinian 's
codex of laws (it referes to those who have been consumed by this disease as
in need of renouncing there plague , as well as acts). pseudo lucian (erostes
48) and achilles tatius (leucippe and clitophon ii.38) speak of it. finally
thucydides 2.45.2 has great is you glory if you fall not below the standard
which nature has set for your sex.
boswell (christianity 81 87) cites poets (juvenal , ovid) , witers
(martial) , statesmen (cicero) , and others who describe permanent , mutual
homosexual relationships , even marriages. even emperors could be either
gay married (nero) or exlusively gay (hadrian) , boswell says. scroggs
(homosexuality 28 , 32 34) admits that both inversion and perversion must have
existed in the past. he discusses possible references to adult mutual
homosexual and lesbian relationships , but dismisses them (130 44).
28 see specifics in s.r. driver a critical and exegetical commentary on
deuteronomy (edinburgh 1895) 250. he observes that the prohibition of
cross dressing in deut. 22 5 is not a mere rule of conventional propriety.
see also dover , homosexuality 73 76 , 144.
29 plato in his last work , in which he seeks to show how to have a virtuous
citizen , condemned pederasty and marriage between men as against nature (para
phosin)(laws 636a b 636c 836a c 838 841d e). according to test.naph
3 4 5 the sodomites changed the order of nature. the jewish writers , philo
(on abraham 135 137) and josephus (ant. 1.322 3.261 , 275 ag. ap. 2.199
2.273 , 275) label sexual deviation as against nature. finally , , first
century moralist such as plutarch (dianlogue on love 751c e 752b c) spoke of
homosexuality as against nature. christians clearly did not invent the
labels natural and unnatural . see j.b. de young , the meaning of 'nature'

it into something good. it seems to me , that this idea conflicts with
the belief that god gave humans free will. as far as i can determine ,
it is impossible to reconcile these two different ideas. if god were to
exert his influence upon anyone or anything at anytime , he would be
impeding upon someone 's free will. unless , of course , you believe that
god did not give us complete and unabated free will , but rather , some sort
of conditional free will. something that allows us to make our own choices
and control our own lives except when god wants to use us to fulfill some
good purpose of his own by hardening our heart or controlling us in some
other way. i hear alot of people who look at various events , mostly
catastrophies or things like the aids epidemic and make comments about
god 's will. i have a very difficult time understanding why people believe
that god controls anything that happens on this planet. except , possibly
when being asked to through someone 's prayer. according to the bible ,
pharoah was going to let moses' people go after one or two plagues , but
god kept hardening his heart so moses could cast all 7 plagues upon the
egyptians , the last plague causing the death of many innocent children.
so then , god impeded upon pharoah 's free will and used him as a puppet.
god did this not just to free the hebrews , but to free them in some sort
of a grand fashion. i suppose from the hebrew 's point of view , this could
be seen as turning something bad into good , but i'm sure the egyptians did n't
see it this way. all of your examples of how god turned something bad into
something good are based upon showing favortism to one group of people over
another. after all , it 's only good based upon your point of view. why does
god , who is supposed to be the god of all of humanity , play favorites \?

who is ram das \?

according to his brochures , he is a.k.a. richard alpert , phd , and is
somehow associated with the

seva foundation
8 n. san pedro road
san rafael , ca 94903

and the
hanuman foundation
524 san anselmo ave 203
san anselmo , ca 94960

he speaks publically on such topics as consciousness current
events , and has written some books and recorded some tapes on
similar subjects.

why do i care \? my wife wants to go to one of his lectures. when
i asked why , she said ram das was the greatest spiritual leader
of our time !

several years ago my wife got involved with a religious cult , and
we went through 9 months of hell that almost ended our marriage
before she quit. let 's just say i'm concerned about this ram das
and her interest , especially so with the recent religious cult
events from texas. i need information solid and real so i
know what i'm dealing with.

if you have any information about ram das or the organizations
shown above , i would be very interested in your correspondence.
please reply via e mail to me at scott hpsdde@sdd.hp.com

thank you !

the dictionary of cults that i use classifies this as new age , with
a basically hindu orientation. the headquarters is (or was when this
was written) at that lama foundation , which they identify as a new
age commune in san cristobel , new mexico. for information you might
read alpert 's books , which they list as be here now (an
autobiography) , the only dance there is , and grist for the mill .
it is dealt with briefly in a citation given as larson , new book , pp
339 41 . i assume this is bob larson , larson 's new book of cults .
i 'd warn you however that the whole approach to the new age is
controversial. sources such as the reference book i used , as well as
bob larson , believe in a satanic new age conspiracy , which some regard
as hysterical. however at the very least , it seems clear that this is
not a christian group. clh

daniels) who has difficulty posting to s.r.c , email replies to
daniels@math.ufl.edu

i am unable to post to the bitnet groups.
here is a capsule history of the shepherding discipleship movement in
the churches of christ (i.e. crossroads boston)

i could trace the movement back as far as 1800 , and indeed some of its
roots go back that far , but these were really influences on the movement ,
and not the actual movement , per se.
i will start in c.1920.
in that day , there were 'white' churches and 'colored' churches in
nearly every area (due to segregation). modern pentecostalism was developing
as a predominantly 'colored' phenomenon. here , there was great fanaticism ,
emphasis on emotional experiences , and belief in a personal guidance and
indwelling of the holy spirit.
many 'white' protestant churches were growing into what became known
as conservative fundamentalism. by the 1940s , the evangelical movement was
in full swing , and many groups were becoming part of it.
when the civil rights movement grew stronger (in the 1950 's and
1960 's) ,
many 'white' church groups began to be influenced by the 'black' churches and
by what was going on there. this spread started in the most liberal of groups
and spread to the more conservative ones by the late '60 's. in 1969 , even the
catholic church was displaying evidence of influence by the other
groups...still
evident today.

the churches of christ are (and were) a very conservative protestant
group. when the influence from outside began to reach the cofc in c.1965 , it
was generally not appreciated. conservative groups are very strongly
resistant
to change , and the new movement was very different from the cofc status quo.
the magazines put out at that time by cofc folks tell the story as it
unfolds. new ideas came into the cofc. there was a big push to reach out to
college students , young adults , and teens. some called this the campus
evangel
ism movement. emotions , generally not highly regarded in the cofc at large ,
played a more important role in the new movement. in some places , people
began
to speak in tongues (as their pentecostal predecessors did).
this was met with extreme criticism from within the churches of
christ.
in some places , people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or
for
advocating the holy spirit movement , another name for the new branch. the
term underground church of christ also came into use because these people
had
to hide their differences (or they might be ostricised).
there were several congregations , however , whose leaderships were
receptive to the new ideas (at least in part the tongues speaking never
really
caught on). one of these was the 14th street church of christ in gainesville ,
fl. campus ministry had already been regarded as important at 14th street ,
and
the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism. they also
seemed
to put vitality into the church , which many felt had been lacking.
in october of 1967 , the 14th street congregation hired chuck lucas to
be its campus minister. by 1970 , he would move to being the congregation 's
(lead) minister. in the late 60 's early 70 's , the congregation worked with
many
other groups. they held bible discussions at daytona beach during spring
break.
they organized talks in the fraternities on the university of florida campus.
they also worked with uf sports people.
in 1972 , the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed.
when it was finished , the group moved and changed its name (now no longer
appropriate). it became the crossroads church of christ from then on , a name
that would become legendary.

by this time , crossroads was basically the only cofc whose programs
were fully aligned to the new movement. while they did n't start it , they
continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going.
by 1975 , none of the other churches of christ in the area felt that
they could cooperate with crossroads , due to what they recognized as doctrinal
problems at crossroads.
crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize , and later require
attendance
at all church functions. it was seen as a good thing for each member to have
at least one close relationship , a person with whom you would share all of
your problems , pray , and get help from. the concept was called prayer
partners ,
which later became discipleship partners and also later became mandatory. the
leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while.
the book called the master plan of evangelism was a strong influence
on chuck lucas. he (and the group) believed that it was every person 's duty
and life purpose to carry out the great commission. crossroads was growing
in number , and numbers became very important (some would say all important).
a person who was evangelistic was spiritual . evangelism meant
inviting people to crossroads events if you did this a lot and some of them
converted , then you were spiritual . there were sermons about how if you
bought groceries , the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to
services. everyone at your job ought to receive invitations. since these
people needed jesus , you should be aggressive do n't take 'no' for an
answer.
if you did not evangelize enough , you came to be called lazy or
unspiritual .
by the end of the decade , the prayer partner system was integrated
into
a structure. the elders and ministers were on top (like a big pyramid). then
the group leaders , bible study leaders , and members. everyone who came in had
someone placed over them.
it is at this time , 1978 1980 , that the bad press about crossroads
began to circulate. the problem with rape on the university of florida campus
was tremendous , but crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate
problem. there were many complaints about the congregation and its pushy
evangelistic tactics. crossroads was considering the other churches of christ
to be dead churches , which aggravated them it was aggressively recruiting
out of the other church groups (denominations) , which aggravated them.

by this time , crossroads had grown numerically to the point (1100)
where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building , but
also they were sending out planting create a new church and
reconstructing
reorganize an existing church teams to other cities. by this time , the
crossroads movement was underway.
a group was sent to the 30 member lexington church of christ in
boston ,
ma. the team was headed up by kip mckean , who had been converted out of a
fraternity by crossroads (in gainesville). kip held a still stronger view of
church authority , which he believed was heavily vested in the evangelist(s) ,
and not so much in the elders. he had been fired in 1977 from the
congregation
that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong
with his theology , including the practice of what came to be called one over
one
christianity. called this by critics
in the first year , half of the 30 people felt that they did not want
to
be a part of the new congregation. they left. but others began coming into
the new boston church of christ.
ah , but i'm ahead of myself.
at crossroads , the heavy handed system had begun to take its toll on
the members. many have said that they felt that they were working hard , but
they were not achieving the results that were so important. the numbers were
dropping. from 1978 , crossroads membership declined steadily. the leadership
began to tighten the reigns on the congregation , who was seen as being largely
unproductive and unfruitful . the fruit passages in the nt were
interpreted
as referring to new converts. if you were not bearing fruit , said john 15 ,
you
would be cast into the fire ! boston still teaches this.
if you love your neighbor , you 'll save his soul (invite him to church
and convert him). if you 're not doing that , you do n't love your neighbor.
and if you do n't love , you 're in danger of backsliding. the logical arguments
continue in this vein.
in 1985 , chuck lucas was fired from his job as minister , due to
recurring
sins in his life. these struggles were never revealed to the congregation at
large , although many people outside the congregation had heard about them.
for
by now , there was very little contact (on a friendship level) between most
crossroads members and those outside. if you have contact , your focus should
be on converting them. bring them to a bible study.
chuck 's replacement was joe woods , who was fully supportive of the
boston system. as boston grew in number , they began to offer 'training'
sessions
for other ministers. joe went to boston to be trained and returned to cross
roads ready to emphasize the total commitment to the church that boston and
kip mckean were now emphasizing. eventually , in fall of 1987 , the elders at
crossroads (now 2 in number dick whitehead and bill hogle) made a decision.
boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under
the direction of the church in boston. the elders refused , citing their
belief
that each church should be autonomous (something true in all non boston
churches
of christ). perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here , since
crossroads was no longer the 'example' to the rest of the movement. the group
now numbered about 800 , while boston was now larger (in membership).
the churches of christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary
element of salvation. at crossroads , they taught what was called 'lordship'
baptism you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be
baptized. you had to 'count the cost'. at boston , they took this a step
further. if at some time you became unproductive , then your spirituality
was suspect. people would begin to ask you if you really understood what you
were getting into. anyone who said 'no' had their baptism deemed invalid
they
had n't counted the cost properly. they still had to be baptized. others
called
this rebaptism , and crossroads did n't approve of this practice.
when crossroads announced that it would not follow boston , many of its
members left crossroads and went to movement related ministries , which were
now called discipling ministries. you were either discipling (evangelizing)
or
you were dead . they also used the nickname movement of god for a while.
by summer of 1988 , crossroads was withdrawn from the movement and now
stood alone. they had few to no allies in the mainstream churches of christ ,
and now none in the movement.

boston , however , continued to chart its course in the direction that
they had been following. they sent reconstruction teams to many cities ,
which
usually meant that they split the church there. they stopped acknowledging
other
churches of christ as christians and began to call themselves the remnant .
the remnant of the jews in the ot are those who are saved by god. it was
felt that the remnant today represents all the christians. sometimes they
would simply call their movement the church .
they usually took the name of the city for their name , implying to the
other churches of christ that boston did not recognize their existence. many
campuses have now formally forbidden boston ministries from recruiting there
due to the number of complaints. in some cases , it has been documented that
boston ministries have lied to university officials in order to continue to
have
access to the campus. any resistance that they experience is termed perse
cution , which all true christians are expected to experience. are you really
a christian if you 're not being persecuted \?
the numbers at boston peaked at c.3000 in 1989. since then , they have
fought to remain steady. i have heard a tape of kip mckean shouting at the
leaders for failing to fulfill the great commission (their life 's purpose) as
god commanded them. their christianity is highly centered on commands and
obedience.

crossroads once was called a cult. boston is now recognized by the
cult awareness network and other national and international groups as a cult ,
under a formal definition , because of the techniques which they employ. the
term cult is usually differentiated from sect by the practice of those
techniques. the techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being
techniques of destructive pursuasion , also used by other shepherding
discipleship groups. robert jay lifton , margaret thaler singer , and many
others have written about the topic. these techniques include guilt
motivation ,
emotional manipulation , loaded language , the aura of sacred science (a sort
of mystic element seen in everyday events) , and others.

i have no particular axe to grind against the movement. i have numer
ous friends who are still part of the movement. i have never had a 'falling
out' with anyone in the movement. i disagree with many things which they
teach.
i recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system.
i hold no loyalty to the mainstream churches of christ and do not defend their
mistakes either.
i want to point out , though , that unlike in many other systems which
are in other ways similar , the leadership of the boston movement are as much
victims of the system as the members. we do not have a leader who enjoys
manipulating his people. the leaders believe what they teach , and they feel
accountable for the activites (and spiritual welfare) of the members. when
members do not evangelize to their expectations , for example , the leaders feel
personally responsible as well. the leaders are not out for money or power.
they want to evangelize the world in their lifetime.

i have said too much , but there is much more to say. there are many
examples i could give and quotes from other sources (including boston
bulletins)
that i could include. but this is too long already. you may post this if
you so desire.

subject what do we feel \?
lines 35

i see a parallel between what i will stupidly call the homosexual
issue and the atheist issue. please take no offense at these
comparisons.

the homosexual feels things that i admit i do not feel .
he learns that these feelings are classified as homosexual feelings
and learns of a model of sexuality that seems to apply to
his feelings , which he then can fit with his experiences.
that is , this model gives him a sense of understanding his
situation. models that do not match up with what he knows he
feels will be discarded. however , one wonders if once accepting
the idea of his being gay and deciding what exactly that
means he will analyze all his feelings and experiences based on
the definition he has already accepted , which of course validates
his model.

if that was hard to understand now listen to my parallel.

the christian feels things that an atheist claims he does not
feel. the christian accepts the christian theology as the true
description of what his feelings mean. once accepting this
model he interprets his experiences with regards to this model
which of course validates his christianity.

as a reminder , i am a christian , a catholic , i do n't hate
homosexuals or atheists , but am just trying to understand
them. i only compare them because they are both so foreign
to me. am i as blind to the homosexual as the atheist seems
blind to me \? or am i as prejudiced against atheistic denial of
religious experience as the homosexual is prejudiced against
attempts by society to deny his sexuality \?

or am i just out to lunch , again \?

i 'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents \?
in normal dreams , you ca n't control anything , so obviously
you are n't morally responsible for your actions. but if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an oobe , it seems like a morality applies.

i think that if someone often has immoral dreams , like lustful dreams ,
or dreams where you commit acts of violence , etc. etc. it may be a sign
that he has something sinful in his heart. it may be the holy spirit 's
way of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that
we can pray about it and have it removed. generally , if one has a
pure heart , and sets his mind on things that are holy , he will be holy
even when he dreams.

dreams also can be from the lord. joseph and nebucadnezzar are two examples
of people in the bible who received dreams from the lord.

regarding out of body experiences , this is something that we have to be
careful with. what is called an oobe can be spiritual in nature , especially
if what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.
christians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate
an out of body experience. some things that might be called an oobe
might actually be from the lord. paul wrote of what might of been an oobe.
in ii corinthians 12 , he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught
up into the third heaven. is an oobe truely an oobe \? does one really
leave his body , or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a
spirit , be it a demon or the holy spirit \? i do n't think it matters
that much. paul could not tell.

be that as it may , we should be careful not to open ourselves up to satan
to experience oobe 's. we should not meditate and pretend we are in a
place until our spirits apparently float there. this is dangerous. if
god wants to gice us what seems like an oobe , then he can do that of his
own sovereign will. in the bible , most often it seems that prophets are
just taken up by god 's sovereign will , and not because they are seeking
an oobe. john was in the spirit praying on the lord 's day when he was
caught up in the visions he received. ezekial was talking with some
jewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of god one
time. if god wants to take one of us up into a vision , he can do it.
people should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits
for the sake of a few thrills.

...there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of
repeated lives on earth.

does n't it say somewhere it is appointed to man once to die ,
and then judgement \? i do n't have a concordance here but i have
some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the bible.
given a fairly specific context for what judgement is , i 'd say
that more or less decides the issue.

heb 9 27 clh

indeed , the immediate context nasb is

26 otherwise , he would have needed to suffer often
since the foundation of the world but now once at
the consummation he has been manifested to put away
sin by the sacrifice of himself.

27 and inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die
once , and after this comes judgement

28 so christ also , having been offered once to bear
the sins of many , shall appear a second time , not to
bear sin , tro those who eagerly await him.


the first point is that this verse is part of an even larger
context , the subject of which is not the destiny of the
individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ 's
sacrifice , once , and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen
mankind. rudolf frieling elaborates this in detail in his
christianity and reincarnation . the thrust of the passage
in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and
sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual
experience of the human being after death. the once
is repeated and emphasized , and it highlights the singularity
of christ 's deed. one thing for certain it does is to
refute the claims of some that christ incarnates more than
once. but the comparison to the human experience die
once , then judgement (note not the judgement , but just
judgement . the word for judgement is krisis .

hebrews 9 27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense
of the doctrine that the bible denies reincarnation. at this
point , i would just emphasize again that the passages
that (arguably) speak against it are few , and that invariably
they are talking about something eles , and the apparent denial
of reincarnation is either inferred , or , as in the case of
hebrews , taken literally and deposited into an implied context ,
namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after
death.

what should be considered seriously is that the bible is essentially
silent about the fate of the individual human being between death
and the last day. if you take the few passages that could possibly
be interpreted to mean a single earth life , they are arguable. and
there are other passages that point , arguably , in the other direc
tion. such as matthew 11 14 and john 9 2.

we can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that
might have a bearinig on this , and indeed we should discuss them.
but what i wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach
to the idea of repeated earth lives that , unlike hindu , buddhist
and new age teachings , takes full cognizance of the divinity , singular
incarnation , death , burial , resurrection , and second coming of christ
as the savior of mankind the accountability of each individual for
his deeds and the reality of the fall and of sin and its consequences
the redemption of man from sin through christ the resurrection of
the body , and the last judgement.

taken in this larger sense , many serious questions take on an entirely
different perspective. e.g. the destiny of those who died in their
sins before christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to
works , the meaning of deathbed conversion , the meaning of the
sacraments , and many other things. not that i propose to answer all
those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience , but only that
the discussion takes on a different dimension , and in my opinion
one that is truly worthy of both man , the earth , and their creator and
redeemer. there are many deep questions that continue to be deep , such
as the meaning of the second death , and how the whole of christian
doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.

there are those who deeply believe that the things of which the bible
does not speak are not things we should be concerned with. but christ
also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know
in the future , including things that his disciples (and therefore others)
could not bear yet. this idea that the human capacity for growth in
knowledge , not only of the individual in one lifetime , but of the whole
of humanity , also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth
in the spirit is a long term process. the bible was not meant to codify
all spiritual knowledge in one place forever , but to proclaim the gospel
of the incarnation and redeeming deed of christ taking the gospel in the
greater context , from genesis to revelation. now , salvation (healing) becomes ,
not the end of man 's sojourn but its beginning. and the last judgement and
the new heaven and earth that follow it become its fulfullment.

yes , it is true. someone has published a rebuttal pointing out
certain flaws in the argument , and recently professor c anthony
anderson , of the philosophy department of the university of
minnesota , has written a revised version of the argument , perhaps
free of flaws , and at any rate free of the flaws complained of in

this came from. here 's his response kinsey (see below) is the source
of the figure 10 percent.

there was an article in usa today a few months ago showing the results
of a study that actually only about 1 were homosexual. i saw another
figure that listed 2 as the figure. of course , even if it were 99
that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior.
how many people have commited other acts of fornication \? how many
people have lied or sinned in other ways \?

but in all fairness , the shameless nature of their acts is a
reflection of the general spiritual state of the people , and not a
specific feature of homosexuality.

why is n't it a specific feature of homosexuality \? paul describes
men with men working that which is unseemly to describe the acts.
sure , there spirtual nature was depraved also , and like the other
sins , the idolatry , the other sexual immoraity , and the other sins
sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of
man 's not glorifying god as god and being thankful. still , their
acts were shameless.

homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases. on the
other hand , none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the
subject. rom 1 is really about idolatry. it refers to homosexuality
in passing.

is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the new testament \?
scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer. being ruled by the
spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism , it also
protects us from sins that are against the spirit. the word is a
two edged sword that cuts both ways.

i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus.
if the law is reflection of god 's character and true holy nature , then
those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem.
if homosexuality were natural (whatever that means) wholesome ,
endorsed by god , and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow minded
biggots , as some would have us believe , why is there a condemnation of
it in leviticus. this condemnation is in the midst of all the other
sex sin condemnations , and there is nothing in the text to say that this
law was limited to temple prostitution , and no good reason to believe that
this was the case. furthermore , male homosexual sex was a death penalty
crime !

is every sin elaborated on in the new testament \? take a look at
i corinthians 5. paul said that one of the corinthians had broken a
law not even heard of among the gentiles , that one should have his father 's
wife. there is a prohibition against having your father 's wife in
leviticus. no other new testament verse clearly condemns it (besides
this one.) notice that paul did not say that the sin was in commiting
adultery , etc. he spoke against having one 's father 's wife.

notice also that this sexual condemnation in leviticus is not mentioned
in the specific context of paganism either. and there was no pagan
coustom mentioned in i corinthians either. as a matter of fact
taking one 's father 's wife was n't even done among the gentiles. it was
just a plain blantant sin , whether worshipping idols was involved or
not.

one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds
of questions we are trying to deal with. he encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong. he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act
straight and fail , and he had never faced christians who are trying
to define a christian homosexuality , which fits with general christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between god and man. it is unfair to take paul 's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions.

one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument
is because paul probably did face this and other problems. sin can
be tough to over come , especially without supernatural power. is
homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin ,
like lusting after a married woman , or sleeping around with people of
the opposite sex \? i doubt it , and even if it is , that is no excuse.
god is greater than all of it.

another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural
power of god to intervene in this kind of situation. how many
people have been set free from sin by the power of god \? sure there
may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.
that is a reflection on the people involved in the program , and not
god 's willingness and ability to change a sinner. any program that
uses formulas may fail. what people need is the power of god to
change them , whether they are involved in homosexual sin , or any other
sin.

i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is
not entirely a theological issue , but also a pastoral one. paul 's
tendency , as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating
holidays , is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues
to look very carefully at the good of the people involved , and to
avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.
for example , while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat
meat , he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about
which they had personal qualms.

i do n't see how you come to that conclusion. paul 's dealings with
pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order
to spare others not to allow people to continue in sin because it
was just too difficult. take the example of eating meat offered to idols.
paul felt that there was nothing wrong , in an abstract sense , with
eating the meat. yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty
to eat meat in order to spare others.

but paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to
tough. paul wrote to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts
thereof. (romans 13 14) then he goes in to a discourse on how we
should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.

suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.
since others consider it to be a sin , then using paul 's approach
on pastorial issues , those who would otherwise be homosexuals should
sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a
member of the opposite sex. paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual
marriage ) to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered
a more damaging sin.

for another example , paul obviously
would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)
remain unmarried. yet if they were unable to do so , he certainly
would rather see them married than in a state where they might be
tempted to fornication.

yet marriage itself is not a sin. marriage is holy in all and something
that god ordains , and paul recognizes this.

note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. this
does n't mean that christians can stop working when we are saved.

actually , adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.
after he fell he would have to toil over the ground.

the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often
fails , and when it does , you end up with damage ranging from
psychological damage to suicide , as well as broken marriages when
attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.

that is why we are dependent totally on god what a vunerable and glorious
position to be it. we all must be transformed by the renewing of our
minds and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom , just
like anyone else.

but i can well imagine paul
preferring to see people in long term , committed christian
relationships than promiscuity. as with work which genesis
suggests was n't part of god 's original ideal either i think such
relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god 's love
with each other.

i'm sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this
conclusion. it 's like saying , how should i kill myself , with gun or
aresenic \? what about the person who just is overcome with a desire to
sleep with goats \? would it be better for him to sleep with one goat ,
or all of them \? what about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts \?
would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them \?

in all these cases , the more people or animals one sleeps with , the higher
the chance that they will get a disease. but this only deals with
physical aspects of the question. whichever sin is commited , it all
leads to spiritual death.

cent. actions are the same. when christian homosexuals say that their
relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul
would have been familiar with , this is exactly the same kind of
argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.

the issue that is most often addressed in scripture seems to be the
actual act. second , is n't it historical snobbery to say that
only homosexuals of this century are capable of having loving
relationships \? there are ancient writings glorifying homosexual love.
(btw , i am one who believes in refraining from making oathes. also ,
where do you get that tax collectors are sinners. that 's certainly not
explicit. jesus did n't tell zachias to quit his job.)

link hudson.


i'm reluctant to comment in this in detail. our basic concepts of
the intention of jesus and paul are greatly different. as i indicated
in the article , whatever the ambiguities of various words (and i still
think they are significant) , it does seem clear that paul considered
the homosexuality he saw around him wrong. what you do with this fact
depends upon your basic approach to the bible. i'm afraid that
communication between legalist and anti legalist christians is even
harder than between protestants and catholics in the 16th cent. since
you disagree with my starting point , obviously you 're going to
disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions.
sometimes discussion is still useful. i 've seen some very interesting
work on paul done by jews. obviously they do n't agree with him , but
they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant. but i do n't
see much sign for hope here. in talk.religion.misc there 's an axiom
that by the time hitler 's name is invoked , all hope for sensible
discussion is gone. on this subject , when sleeping with goats is
invoked , i do n't think there 's enough basis for understanding to be
worth pursuing. clh

any opinions expressed are my own !

as most people here know , i believe fundamentalist is sufficiently
ill defined that i advise using some more specific term. i think many
people use it to cover people who believe in inerrancy and a number of
related concepts (e.g. denial of evolution). while the original
fundamentals movement was somewhat more specific , i would think most
people who accept inerrancy would actually support the whole original
agenda. (it included a list of key traditional doctrines , e.g. the
virgin birth.) the term is now being used by the press to describe
aggressive conservative religions in general , most typically those who
are attempting to legislate religion.

legalism is yet another ill defined term. however there is some
reason for its use in this context. in fact the common theological
definition is the believe that salvation is through the law. i hope
no one here believes that our conservative contributors hold this
view. however there is a basic difference in approach over what we
expect to get out of the bible. the conservative approach expects to
find specific behavioral rules. generally the posters advocating this
approach talk about the relevant passages from paul 's letter as god 's
law. the liberal approach expects to find general principles , but it
regards specific behavioral rules subject to change depending upon the
culture and other things. it 's easy to see why a liberal would regard
the conservative approach as legalism. it 's hard to know quite what
other term to use. the issue in this case is not inerrancy , because
no one is saying that paul made a factual error. rather , the question
is whether his statements are to be taken as law. calling the
positive answer legalism seems obvious enough terminology. i have n't
seen any good alternative.

christianity i would hope. would they be willing to forgo sex

to avoid the chance that their interpretation might be wrong ,
etc \? if not , why not \? heterosexuals abstain all the time.
(it would be nice if protestant churches had celibate orders
to show the world that sex is not the important thing in life)

the difference is that straight members are given the choice of
abstaining or not , and celibacy is recognized as a gift , given only
to some. gays are told that , as a condition of acceptance , they
must be celibate. i do n't believe that god gives me a forced choice
between having a relationship with god and expressing my heterosexuality
(within the context of a faithful relationship). nor do i believe
that god gives that forced choice to gays. sex or christianity is a
false dichotomy.

to tell the truth , gay churches remind me a lot of henry the viii
starting the church of england in order to get a divorce (or is
this a myth). note that i am not denying that gay christians are
christian.

for my part , gay churches remind me of blacks starting their own churches
either because they were not allowed at all in the white churches , or , at
best , only with special restrictions that did not apply to white members.

praying for justice
(by peter hammond)

to those involved in ministering to christians suffering
persecution the imprecatory psalms are a tremendous source of
comfort. and those of us who are fighting for the right to life
of the preborn , or battling social evils such as pornography or
crime , are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon god
has entrusted to us in the imprecatory psalms.


the imprecatory psalms

early in my christian walk i encountered the prayers for
judgement in the psalms and was quite at loss to know how to
respond to them. prayers such as
break the arm of the wicked and evil men call him to account for
his wickedness ... psalm 10 15 did not seem consistent with the
gospel of love which i had accepted. yet psalm 10 15 was clearly
motivated by love for god ( the lord is king for ever and ever
the nation will perish from his land 10 16 , and why does the
wicked man revile god \? 10 13) , and by love for the innocent who
suffer ( you hear , o lord , the desire of the afflicted you
encourage them , and you listen to their cry , defending the
fatherless and oppressed , in order that man , who is of the earth ,
may terrify no more. 10 17 18)

nevertheless , i grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such
graphic prayers for god to judge the wicked as pour out your
wrath on them let your fierce anger overtake them 64 24 o
lord , the god avenges , o god who avenges , shine forth. rise up , o
judge of the earth , pay back to the proud what they deserve.
95 1 2 break the teeth in their mouths , o god ...let them
vanish like water .. let their arrows be blunted ... the
righteous will be glad when they are avenged , when they bathe
their feet in the blood of the wicked. then men will way , surely
the righteous still are rewarded surely there is a god who
judges the earth.' 58 6 11

certainly i wanted god to be honoured and yes i was deeply
destressed by the prevalence of evil but could i actually pray
for god to pour out his wrath on the wicked \?

the scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be
prayed for own selfish motives , nor against our personal enemies.
rather they are to be prayed in christ , for his glory and against
his enemies. the psalmist describes the targets of these
imprecation as those who devise injustice in their heart and
whose hands mete out violence (58 2) those who boast of evil
and are a disgrace in the eyes of god. your tongue plots
destruction , it is like a sharpened razor , and you who practise
deceit. you love evil rather than good , falsehood rather than
speaking the truth. 52 1 3 they crush your people ... they
slay the widow and the alien they murder the fatherless. 94 5
6 with cunning they conspire against your people they plot
against those you cherish. 83 3 you hate all who do wrong. you
destroy those who tell lies bloodthirsty and deceitful men the
lord abhors. 5 5 6.

to those unrepentant enemies of god the psalmist declares
surely god will bring you down to everlasting ruin 52 5
surely god will crush the heads of his enemies ... of those who
go on in their sins 68 21.

and the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared then
it will be known to the ends of the earth that god rules ...
59 13 to proclaim the powers of god 68 34 all kings will bow
down to him and all nations will serve him 72 11 who knows
the power of your anger \? for your wrath is as great as the fear
that is due you. 90 11

yet despite the fact that 90 of the 150 psalms include
imprecations (prayers invoking god 's righteous judgement upon the
wicked) such prayers are rare in the average western church.
however , amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much
more common.


praying against the persecutors

amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of marxist angola i
found the survivors of communist persecution including the
crippled and maimed , and widows and orphans praying for god to
strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the church.
i was shocked yet it was biblical (even the martyrs in heaven
pray how long , sovereign lord , holy and true , until you judge
the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood \? revelation
6 10).

the initiator of the communist persecution in angola was agestino
neto. described as a drunken , psychotic , marxist poet , neto had
been installed by cuban troops as the first dictator of angola.
he boasted that within 20 years there wo n't be a bible or a
church left in angola. i will have eradicated christianity. yet
despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is
not christianity that was eradicated in angola but agestino neto.
neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in
moscow.

in romania i learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded
of god judging the persecutors of the church in answer to prayer
a communist official ordered a certain pastor to be
arrested. the next day the official died of a heart attack.
another communist party official ordered that all the bibles
in his district were to be collected and pulped , to be
turned into toilet paper. this blasphemous project was in
fact carried out. but the next day when the official was
medically examined , he was informed that he had terminal
cancer. he died shortly afterwards.
on another occasion , a communist official who had ordered a
baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car
crash the very next day.
when an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on
the mountainside in a forest , the workmen flatly refused to
carry out the order. at gunpoint a group of conscripted
gypsies also refused to touch the church. in desperation ,
the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet point to
dismantle the structure. yet the officer in charge pleaded
with the local christians to pray for him , that god would
not judge him. he emphasised that he had nothing against
christians and was only obeying strict orders. the building
was in fact reconstructed later , and again used for worship.
they were all seized with sear and the name of the lord
jesus was held in high honour... in this way the word of the
lord spread widely and grew in power. acts 19 17 , 20

nicolae ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the
persecution in romania was overthrown by his own army and
executed on christmas day , 1989 , to joyous shouts of the
antichrist is dead in the streets. many testified that this was
in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of
romania.

another persecutor of the church who challenged god was samora
machel , the first dictator of marxist mozambique. samora machel
was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in
the 1960 's. he pledged his soul to satan and vowed that he would
destroy the church and turn mozambique into the first truly
marxist leninist state in africa. thousands of churches in
mozambique were closed confiscated , nationalised chained and
padlocked , burnt down or boarded up. missionaries were expelled ,
some being imprisoned first. evangelism was forbidden. bibles
were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of christians ,
including many pastors and elders , were shipped off to
concentration camps most were never seen again.

a month before his sudden death samora machel cursed god publicly
and challenged him to prove his existence by striking him
(machel) dead. on 19 october 1986 , while several churches were
specifically praying for god to stop the persecution in
mozambique , machel 's soviet tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent
thunderstorm. the plane crashed 200 metres within south africa 's
boundary with mozambique. amidst the wreckage the marxist plans
for overthrowing the government of malawi were discovered and
published. not only had god judged a blasphemer and a persecutor ,
but he had also saved a country from persecution.

in the months leading up to the first multi party elections in
zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor god to remove the 27
year socialist dictatorship of kenneth kaunda. this was done on
31st october 1991 when fredrick chiluba (a man converted to
christ whilst imprisoned for opposing kaunda) was elected
president of zambia and covenanted to make zambia a christian
country.

it is recorded in history that the wicked mary , queen of scots ,
declared trembling and in tears i am more afraid of john knox 's
prayers than of an army of ten thousand .

on 3 april 1993 the secretary general of the south african
communist party chris hani was shot dead. from the unprecedented
international wave of condolences and adulation reported one
could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a
martyr. certainly it was not the death and resurrection of christ
jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of south africa
this easter , but the assassination of chris hani.

the stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that 20 135 people
were murdered in south africa in 1992 , yet more collective
concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of
the sa communist party than for all the thousands of other
victims. indeed the sa government , the international community
and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported
over this one death than for all the 50 000 south africans
murdered since 2nd february 1990 when the anc , sacp and pac were
unbanned !

yet as a member of the anc revolutionary council since 1973 ,
deputy commander of umkhonto we sizwe (mk) the anc 's military
wing from 1982 , and chief of staff of mk from 1987 , chris hani
had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many
unarmed civilians. as jesus warned all who live by the sword
will die by the sword matt 26 52.

after personally confronting hani about his terrorist activities
at a press conference in washington dc (where he publicly
declared his support for fidel castro , col. gaddafi , yasser
arafat and saddam hussein and defended the placing of car bombs
and limpet mines in public places during the struggle ) i told
him that i was a christian and , while i did n't hate him , i did
hate communism and i was praying for him that god would either
bring him to repentance and salvation in christ , or that god
would remove him. he responded by swearing and declaring that he
was an atheist.

several other people also prayed that god would either bring hani
to repentance or remove him. similarly several churches in
america have begun to pray the imprecatory psalms against
unrepentant abortionists. in one town 8 abortionists were struck
down , with heart attacks , strokes , car accidents and cancer ,
within months of these public prayers for god to stop these
killers of preborn babies.

some praised god for his righteous acts of judgement and quoted
when justice is done , it brings joy to the righteous and terror
to evildoers proverbs 21 15. others were shocked that any
christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any
even of the blatantly wicked. yet the apostles prayed imprecatory
prayers (acts 13 8 12 galatians 1 8 9 2 tim 4 14 15) and so did
our lord (matt 11 20 24).

what then should our attitude towards the imprecatory psalms be \?
should we be praying the psalms \? to tackle these thorny issues i
would like to present a short summary of an excellent book , war
psalms of the prince of peace lessons from the imprecatory
psalms by james e adams , (published by the presbyterian and
reformed publishing company)

our lord jesus christ his apostles used the psalms constantly
in teaching men to know god. the new testament (nt) quotes the
old testament (ot) over 283 times. 41 of all ot quotes in the nt
are from the psalms. christ himself alluded to the psalms over 50
times. the psalms are the prayer book of the bible.


1. are the imprecatory psalms the oracles of god \?

some christian commentators theologians reject these psalms as
devilish , diabolical , unsuited to the church , and not god
's pronouncements of his wrath on the wicked but the prayers of
a man for vengeance on his enemies , just the opposite of jesus'
teaching that we should love our enemies.

yet 2 tim 3 16 17 declares
all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching ,
rebuking , correcting and training in righteousness , so that the
man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.
(see also 2 peter 3 15 16).

the fact that something in the word of god is beyond our
comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its
inspiration. to make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil
is to impudently take the place of god.

do we imagine ourselves to be holier than god \? wrong ideas of god
have led many to become evangelic plastic surgeons who have made
it their job to clean up god 's word according to their own
ideas of what is proper. they have forgotten that it is god alone
who must determine what christianity is and what is suitable for
his church. the essence of what many have done is to question the
authority of god 's word (like eve 's original sin of listening to
satan 's question yes , hath god said... \? ).

the psalms are part of god 's revelation of himself and his
attributes , and they are reaffirmed by the nt as the
authoritative word of god. those imprecatory psalms which these
evangelical plastic surgeons reject as unsuited and unworthy
for the church are the very psalms christ used to testify about
himself (eg mark 12 36 matt 22 43 44) and which the apostles
used as authoritative scripture (eg acts 1 16 20 acts 4 25 heb
4 7). see also 2 samuel 23 1 2.

ch spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory psalms , (especially
ps 109)
truly this is one of the hard places of scripture , a passage
which the soul trembles to read , yet it is not ours to sit in
judgement upon it , but to bow our ear to what the lord would
speak to us therein.

the rejection of any part of god 's word is a rejection of the
giver of that word , god himself.


2. who is praying these psalms \?

christ quoted the psalms not merely as prophesy he actually
spoke the psalms as his own words. the psalms occupied an
enormous place in the life of our lord. he used it as his prayer
book and song book from the synagogue to the festivals and at
the last supper.

on the cross christ quoted from the psalms not as some ancient
authority that he adapted for his own use , but as his very own
words the words of the lord 's anointed which as david 's son
he truly was.
father , into your hands i commit my spirit ps 31 5
my god , my god , why have you forsaken me \? ps 22 1

in his ministry christ foretells what he will say as the judge on
the day of judgement , and he quotes the psalms in doing so !
matt 7 23 then i will tell them plainly , 'i never knew you. away
from me , you evildoers'. ps 6 8

in heb 10 5 the apostle attributes ps 40 6 8 directly to christ
although nowhere in the gospels is christ recorded as having said
these words. similarly hebrews 2 12 attributes ps 22 22
directly to christ despite there being no record of his having
spoken these words while on earth. clearly the apostles believed
christ is speaking in the psalms.

christ came to establish his kingdom and to extend his mercy in
all the earth. but let us never forget that jesus will come again
to execute judgement on the wicked.
david as the anointed king of the chosen people of god was a
prototype of jesus christ. acts 2 30
being therefore a prophet , ... he foresaw and spoke of the
resurrection of christ.
david was a witness to christ in his office , in his lite , and in
his words. the same words which david spoke , the future messiah
spoke through him. the prayers of david were prayed also by
christ. or better christ himself prayed these psalms through his
forerunner david.

the imprecatory psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of
god , of his indignation against wrong doing , and his compassion
for the wronged.


3. but what about the psalms of repentance \?

christ is also the lamb of god , the substitutionary sacrifice for
our sins. christ in the day of his crucifixion was charged with
the sin of his people. he appropriated to himself those debts for
which he had made himself responsible. our lord was the
substitution for the sinner. he took the sinners place (isaiah
53).

god made him who had no sin to be sin for us , so that in him we
might become the righteousness of god. 2 cor 5 21

in history the psalms , especially the imprecatory psalms , have
been understood to have been the prayers of christ by st
augustine , jerome , ambrose , tertullian , luther and many others.
all the psalms are the voice of christ. christ is praying the
imprecatory psalms ! all the psalms are messianic. it is the lord
jesus christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance. it is
only right for the righteous king of peace to ask god to destroy
his enemies.

these prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of
king jesus. his prayers will be answered ! god 's word is revealed
upon all who oppose christ. anyone who rejects god 's way of
forgiveness in the cross of christ will bear the dreadful curses
of god.

he who prays psalm 69 23 28 will one day make this prayer a
reality when he declares to those on his left
depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared
for the devil and his angels. matt 25 41

all the enemies of the lord need to hear these psalms. god 's
kingdom is at war. the powers of evil will tall and god alone
will reign forever !
with justice he judges and makes war...out of his mouth comes a
sharp sword with which to strike down the nations. he will rule
them with an iron sceptre he treads the winepress of the fury of
the wrath of god almighty...king of kings and lord of lords.
rev 19 15


4. are jesus' prayers contradictory \?

what about jesus' command to love our enemies and to bless those
who curse us (matt 5 44) \?

christ is of course the loving and merciful saviour who forgives
sin but he is also the awesome judge who is coming in judgement
on those who disobey his gospel.

god is just. he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you
and give relief to you who are troubled...this will happen when
the lord jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his
powerful angels. he will punish those who do not obey the gospel
of our lord jesus. they will be punished with everlasting
destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from
the majesty of his power on the day he comes to be glorified in
his holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have
believed. 2 thess 1 6 10

jesus has power on earth to forgive sins , and he has power on
earth to execute judgement upon his enemies. in the psalms we see
both the vengeance and the love ot god.

even in the n.t. in the gospels we see imprecations.
woe to you , ...hypocrites...blind guides...blind fools...full of
greed and self indulgence...whitewashed tombs...you snakes ! you
brood of vipers ! how will you escape being condemned to hell \?
matt 23

in matt 26 23 24 christ quotes from ps 69 and 109 to refer to his
betrayal by judas.

we also need to acknowledge that christ 's prayers of blessing are
not for all. in john 17 6 9 it is clear that christ is only
praying to the elect of god those who have
obeyed your word ... accepted god 's word ... and have
believed . (see luke 10 8 16 those who reject the
message of god 's kingdom will be judged.)


5. may we pray the imprecatory psalms \?

martin luther pointed out that when one prays hallowed be thy
name , thy kingdom come , thy will be done then he must put all
the opposition to this in one pile and say 'curses , maledictions
and disgrace upon every other name and every other kingdom. may
they be ruined and torn apart and may all their schemes and
wisdom and plans run aground' .

to pray tor the extension of god 's kingdom is to solicit the
destruction of all other kingdoms , eg dan 2 44 the god of
heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed ... it
will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end , but it
will itself endure forever.

advance and victory for the church means defeat and retreat for
the kingdom of darkness.

there is a life death struggle between two kingdoms. the church
cannot exclude hatred tor satan 's kingdom from its love for god 's
kingdom. god 's kingdom cannot come without satan 's kingdom being
destroyed. god 's will cannot be done on earth without the
destruction of evil. the glory of god demands the destruction of
evil. instead of being influenced by a sickly sentimentalism
which insists upon the assumed , but really non existent , rights
of man we should focus instead upon the rights of god.

note psalm 83 where the psalmist prays against those who plot
together against god and his people
cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name o
lord... do to them as you did to midian , as you did to sisera and
jabin at the river kishon , who perished at endor and became like
refuse on the ground.

the story of sisera in the book of judges (chapter 4 and 5)
provides a vivid example of god 's judgement on the wicked. sisera
cruelly oppressed the israelites for twenty years and they
cried to the lord for help judges 4 3. in response to those
prayers the lord routed sisera and all his chariots and army by
the sword , and sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot...
all the troops of sisera fell by the sword not a man was left.
judges 4 15 16

the account then goes on to describe how sisera escaped to the
tent of jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety
and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer. the
song of victory by deborah and barak celebrated the crushing of
the head of sisera in graphic detail (judges 5 25 27). and it is
this that psalm 83 implores god to again do to his enemies.. as
you did to sisera ...


6. the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience

the imprecatory psalms are fully consistent with the law of god
if you do not carefully follow all the words of this law ,
which are written in this book , and do not revere this
glorious and awesome name the lord your god the lord
will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants. he
will bring upon you all the diseases of egypt that you
dreaded , and they will cling to you. the lord will also
bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not
recorded in this book of the law until you are
destroyed...because you did not obey the lord your god ...
so it will please him to ruin and destroy you. you will be
uprooted from the land you are entering to possess.
deuteronomy 28 58 63

the covenant god made with his people included curses for
disobedience as well as blessings for obedience. deuteronomy 27
records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in
an awesome account
the levites shall recite to all the people of israel in a loud
voice
cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol a thing
detestable to the lord , the work of the craftsman 's hands and
sets it up in secret.
then all the people shall say , amen !
cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother...
cursed is the man who moves his neighbour 's boundary stone...
cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads...
cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien , the
fatherless or the widow...
cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly...
cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent
person.
cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the law by
carrying them out.
then all the people shall say , amen ! deut 27 14 26

the new testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of
rejecting christ is the curse. if anyone does not love the
lord a curse be on him. 1 corinthians 16 22

(see also romans 12 19 21 hebrews 1 1 3 3 7 12 3 1519 10 26
31 12 14 29.)


7. how can we preach these prayers \?

the church of jesus christ is an army under orders.
scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the commander
in chief. but we have a problem those who are called to pass on
those orders to others are refusing to do so. how then can we
expect to be a united , effective army \? is it any wonder that the
troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the
strongholds of the kingdom of darkness \? if the church does not
hear the battle cries of her captain , how will she follow him
onto the battlefield \?

pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the church 's
commander , never withholding or changing his words. one whose job
is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain
and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general 's orders.
the pastor 's charge is of greater importance than that of a
courier in any earthly army. there 's no place tor the dispatcher
to decide he does n't agree with his commander 's strategy.

when jesus christ sent seventy two disciples on a preaching
mission , he told them to proclaim the coming of god 's kingdom (lk
10 9) that is , to announce that people must submit to god 's
rule in their lives. jesus instructed them to pray for peace on
any house they approach , assuring them that if anyone rejected
it , the peace would return on the disciples (verse 5). but we
must consider what he said they should do if their message were
rejected that is , if the hearers persisted in rebellion against
god 's rule but when you enter a town and are not welcomed , go
into its 'streets and say , 'even the dust of your town that
sticks to our feet we wipe off against you. yet be sure of this
the kingdom of god is near ' luke 10 11.

what would be the result of that denunciation \? i tell you , it
will be more bearable on that day for sodom on which god sent
fire from heaven in judgement for its wickedness than for that
town (verse 12). immediately jesus added curses on korazin ,
bethsaida , and capernaum tor their rejection of his message
(verses 13 15). he then explained to the disciples the great
authority he had given them he who listens to you listens to
me he who rejects you rejects me but he who rejects me rejects
him who sent me (verse 16). this is the fundamental basis tor
calling down god 's curses on anyone his persistent rebellion
against god 's authority expressed in his law and the ministry of
his servants.

we need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the
prince of peace. only then will the church awake from its
lethargy and once again enter the battle. if we tail to pass on
the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks
will be inevitable.

like psalm 1 our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of
obedience and the curse of disobedience. the eternal truth is
that god cannot be mocked. whatever a man sows that shall he
reap (galatians 6 7). the curses pronounced on disobedience in
deut 28 47 53 were fulfilled in detail in samaria (2 kings
6 2 29) and in judea (ad 70). the wrath of god upon covenant
breakers is real.

the i of the psalms is jesus christ. the we of the psalms
includes those of us in the lord jesus. the enemies are not our
own , individually , but those of the lord and of his church. the
psalms are ot christ as prophet , priest , and king. they record
christ 's march in victory against the kingdom of darkness. as
christ is the author of the psalms , so , too , is he the final
fulfilment of the covenant on which they are based. god will
answer the psalmist 's prayers completely in jesus christ on the
final day of judgment. while on earth jesus foretold the day when
he will say but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be
king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me
luke 19 27.

a fatal end awaits everyone who refuses to acknowledge and to
obey jesus as king and lord. hearing expositions of these war
psalms of the prince of peace will remind his people that god 's
kingdom is at war ! the kingdom of darkness is being overcome by
the kingdom of jesus christ , a war in which each local
congregation of believers plays a vital part. you must rally your
battalion to put on the whole armour of god , including the sword
of the spirit , which is the word of god eph 6 17. that battle
readiness also involves pray(ing) in the spirit on all occasions
with all kinds of prayers and requests n eph 6 18.

christ teaches his army to pray for the utter destruction of the
enemies of god as the psalmist did pour out your wrath on the
nations that do not acknowledge you , on the kingdoms that do not
call on your name ps 79 6.

to deal with the very real hurts and injustices in this world it
is necessary for us to pray for god 's justice. those who are
persecuted need the comfort of these prayers.

let the saints rejoice in his honour and sing for joy...may the
praise of god be in their mouths and a double edged sword in
their hands , to inflict vengeance on the nations and punishment
on the peoples , to bind their kings with fetters , their nobles
with shackles of iron , to carry out the sentences written against
them. this is the glory of all his saints. praise the lord. ps
149 5 9

prayer is , in fact , spiritual warfare. one weapon is prayer for
conversion of spiritual enemies another is prayer for judgement
on those who finally refuse to be converted. we handicap the army
of god when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that he
has given us. it is at all times a part of the task of the people
nf god to destroy evil.

if you have been guilty of dulling your sword , by neglecting or
undermining these psalms , repent of that sin , sharpen your sword
anew , and go forth to do battle in the name and for the glory of
jesus until the knowledge of the lord will cover the earth as
the waters cover the sea hab 2 14.

you might visit some congregations of christians , who happen to be homosexuals ,
that are spirit filled believers , not mcc'rs before you go lumping us all
together with troy perry.


gee , i think there are some real criminals (robbers , muderers , drug
addicts) who appear to be fun loving caring people too. so what 's
your point \? is it ok. just because the people are nice \?

the point is not about being nice. nice is not a christian virtue. the
point is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit (by their fruits you shall
know them mt 7 20) are manifested by and among prayerful , spirit filled
gay christians. it was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles
that convinced peter (acts 10) that his prejudice against them (based on
scripture , i might add) was not in accordance with god 's intentions.

i think the old saying hate the sin and not the sinner is
appropriate here. many who belive homosexuality is wrong probably
do n't hate the people. i do n't. i do n't hate my kids when they do
wrong either. but i tell them what is right , and if they lie or do n't
admit they are wrong , or just do n't make an effort to improve or
repent , they get punished. i think this is quite appropriate. you
may want to be careful about how you think satan is working here.
maybe he is trying to destroy our sense of right and wrong through
feel goodism. maybe he is trying to convince you that you know more
than god. kind of like the adam and eve story. read it and compare
it to today 's mentality. you may be suprised.

of course the whole issue is one of discernment. it may be that satan
is trying to convince us that we know more than god. or it may be that
god is trying (as god did with peter) to teach us something we do n't
know that god shows no partiality , but in every nation anyone who fears
him and does what is right is acceptable to him. (acts 10 34 35).

this was crossposted to a zillion groups. i do n't intend to
carry an entire discussion crossposted from alt.sex , particularly
one whose motivation seems to be having a fun argument. however
i thought readers might be interested to know about the
discussion there. clh

i intend to endeavor to make the argument that homosexuality is an
immoral practice or lifestyle or whatever you call it. i intend to
show that there is a basis for a rational declaration of this
statement. i intend to also show that such a declaration can be
made without there being a religious justification for morality ,
in fact to show that such a standard can be made if one is an atheist.

anyone who wants to join in on the fun in taking the other side ,
i.e. that they can make the claim that homosexuality is not immoral ,
or that , collaterally , it is a morally valid practice , is free to do
so. i think there are a lot of people who do n't believe one can have
a rational based morality without having a religion attached to it.

this should be fun to try and figure this out , and i want to try and
expose (no pun intended) my ideas and see other people 's and see where
their ideas are standing. as i'm not sure what groups would be interested
in this discussion , i will be posting an announcement of it to several ,
and if someone thinks of appropriate groups , let me know.

if someone on here does n't receive alt.sex , let me know and i 'll make
an exception to my usual policy and set up a mailing list to automatically
distribute it in digest format to anyone who wants to receive it as i 'll
use that as the main forum for this. by exception to usual policy is
that i normally charge for this , but for the duration the service will be
available at no charge to anyone who has an address reachable on internet
or bitnet.

i decided to start this dialog when i realized there was a much larger
audience on usenet internet than on the smaller bbs networks.

to give the other side time to work up to a screaming anger , this will
begin on monday , may 24 , to give people who want to make the response
time to identify themselves. anonymous postings are acceptable , since
some people may not wish to identify themselves. also , if someone else
wants to get in on my side , they are free to do so.

this should be much more interesting than abortion debates !

subject faq essay on homosexuality
lines 452

someone referred to my faq essay on homosexuality. since it has n't
been posted for some time (and i 've modified it somewhat since the
last time) , i'm taking this opportunity to post it. there is another
entry in the faq containing comments by some other contributors. they
can be retrieved from ftp.rutgers.edu as
pub soc.religion.christian others homosexuality. it contains far
more detail on the exegetical issues than i give here , though
primarily from a conservative point of view.



this posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and
christians. this is a frequently asked question , so i do not post the
question each time it occurs. rather this is an attempt to summarize
the postings we get when we have a discussion. it summarizes
arguments for allowing christian homosexuality , since most people
asking the question already know the arguments against it. the most
common but not the only question dealt with herein is how can a
christian justify being a homosexual , given what the bible says about
it \?

first , on the definition of 'homosexual'. many groups believe that
there is a homosexual orientation , i.e. a sexual attraction to
members of the same sex. this is distinguished from actual homosexual
sexual activity. homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by
most groups to be acceptable. however in a lot of discussion , the
term 'homosexual' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.
this is generally not accepted outside the most 'liberal' groups. in
this paper i'm going to use 'homosexual' as meaning a person engaging
in sexual acts with another of the same sex. i have n't heard of any
biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who
remains celebate.

i think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be
homosexual. this is often called a 'homosexual orientation'. it is
not known whether it is genetic or environmental. there is evidence
suggesting each. the best evidence i 've seen is that homosexuality is
not a single phenomenon , but has a number of different causes. one of
them is probably genetic. there are several groups that try to help
people move from being homosexual to heterosexual. the best known is
exodus international . the reports i 've seen (and i have n't read the
detailed literature , just the summary in the minority opinion to the
presbyterian church 's infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that
these programs have very low success rates , and that there are
questions about how real even the successes are. but there certainly
are people who say they have converted. however this issue is not as
important as it sounds. those who believe homosexuality is wrong
believe it is intrinsically wrong , defined as such by god. the fact
that it 's hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant
than the fact that it 's hard to escape from being a drug addict. if
it 's wrong , it 's wrong. it may affect how we deal with people though.
if it 's very difficult to change , this may tend to make us more
willing to forgive it.

one more general background issue it 's common to quote a figure that
10 of the population is homosexual. i asked one of our experts where
this came from. here 's his response kinsey (see below) is the source
of the figure 10 percent. he defines sexuality by behavior , not by
orientation , and ranked all persons on a scale from zero (completely
heterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual). according to kinsey ,
one third of all male adults have had at least one experience of
orgasm homosexually post puberty. ten percent of all adult males have
most of their experiences of homosexually. that was in 1948. the
percentages held true in a followup study done by the kinsey
institute , based on data in the early seventies but not published
until the early 80s or so , by bell and weinberg , i believe. i ca n't
put my hand on this latter reference , but here is the online

this figure is widely used in all scholarly discussions and has even
been found to hold true in several other cultures , as noted in the
recent newsweek coverstory is this child gay \? (feb. 24 , 1992). a
journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting
her book that allegedly refutes kinsey 's study , but the scholarly
world seems to take her for a kook......

i 've seen some objections to the kinsey 's study , but not in enough
detail to include here. (if someone would like to contribute another
view , i 'd be willing to include it.)

most christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.
not all , however. a few denominations accept it. the metropolitan
community churches is the best known it was formed specifically to
accept homosexuals. however the united church of christ also allows
it , and i think a couple of other groups may as well. the episcopal
church seems to accept it some areas but not others. in churches that
have congregational government , you 'll find a few congregations that
accept it (even among southern baptists , though the number is probably
only one or two congregations). but these are unusual few churches
permit homosexual church leaders. how carefully they enforce this is
another issue. i do n't have any doubt that there are homosexual
pastors of just about every denomination , some more open than others.

as to the arguments over the biblical and other issues , here 's an
attempt to summarize the issues

the most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of
homosexuality in previous discussions has been john boswell
christianity , social tolerance , and homosexuality , u chicago press ,
1980.

the argument against is pretty clear. there are several explicit laws
in the ot , e.g. leviticus 20 13 , and in rom 1 paul seems pretty negative on
homosexuality. beyond these references , there are some debates. some
passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant. e.g.
the sin which the inhabitants of sodom proposed to carry out was
homosexual rape , not homosexual activity between consenting adults.
(there 's even some question whether it was homosexual , since the
entities involved were angels.) it was particularly horrifying
because it involved guests , and the responsibility towards guests in
that culture was very strong. (this is probably the reason lot
offered his daughter it was better to give up his daughter than to
allow his guests to be attacked.) if you look through a concordance
for references to sodom elsewhere in the bible , you 'll see that few
seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin. there 's a jewish
interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests. at any
rate , there 's no debate that homosexual rape is wrong.

i do not discuss leviticus because the law there is part of a set
of laws that most christians do not consider binding. so unless nt
justification can be found , lev. alone would not settle the issue.

the nt references are all in paul 's letters. a number of the
references from paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly
vague. boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not
mean homosexual. here 's what he says the two greek words that appear
in the lists (i.e. i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10) are malakos and
arsenokoitai . unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words
actually mean. malakos , with a basic meaning of soft , has a variety
of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing. boswell suggests
wanton as a likely equivalent. he also reports that the unanimous
interpretation of the church , including greek speaking christians , was
that in this passage it referred to masturbation , a meaning that has
vanished only in the 20th cent. , as that practice has come to be less
frowned upon. (he cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the
catholic encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.) he
translates arsenokotai as male prostitute , giving evidence that none
of the church fathers understood the term as referring to
homosexuality in general. a more technical meaning , suggested by the
early latin translations , would be active mode homosexual male
prostitute , but in his view paul did not intend it so technically.

for a more conservative view , i consulted gordon fee 's commentary on i
cor. he cites evidence that malakos often meant effeminate.
however boswell warns us that in greek culture effeminate is not
necessarily synonymous with homosexual , though it may be associated
with some kinds of homosexual behavior. given what boswell and fee
say taken together , i suspect that the term is simply not very
definite , and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases , it
is n't a general term for homosexuality. while fee argues against
boswell with arsenokotai as well , he ends up suggesting a
translation that seems essentially the same. the big problem with it
is that the word is almost never used. paul 's writing is the first
occurence. the fact that the word is clearly composed of male and
f k unfortunately does n't quite tell us the meaning , since it
does n't tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the
action. examples of compound words formed either way can be given.
in theory it could refer to rapists , etc. it 's dangerous to base
meaning purely on etymology , or you 'll conclude that goodbye is a
religious expression because it 's based on god by with ye . however
since boswell , fee , and niv seem to agree on homosexual male
prostitute , that seems as good a guess as any. note that this
translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something
which fee and boswell agree on , but do not attempt to reproduce in
their translation).

in my opinion , the strongest nt reference to homosexuality is romans
1. boswell points out that rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something
that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual , as a result
of their corruption due to worshipping false gods. one could argue
that this is simply an example that if a homosexual worshipped false
gods , he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become
heterosexual. however i find this argument somewhat forced , and in
fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is
what paul meant.

however i am not convinced that rom 1 is sufficient to create a law
against homosexuality for christians. what paul is describing in rom
1 is not homosexuality among christians it 's homosexuality that
appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.
despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric , i'm sure paul
does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.
given his description of their situation , i rather assume that their
heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless. so yes , i do
believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.
but in all fairness , the shameless nature of their acts is a
reflection of the general spiritual state of the people , and not a
specific feature of homosexuality.

my overall view of the situation is the following i think we have
enough evidence to be confident that paul disapproved of
homosexuality. rom 1 seems clear. while i cor 6 9 and i tim 1 10 are
not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality , they do
not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of
homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases. on the
other hand , none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the
subject. rom 1 is really about idolatry. it refers to homosexuality
in passing.

the result of this situation is that people interpret these passages
in light of their general approach to scripture. for those who look
to scripture for laws about issues such as this , it not surprising
that they would consider these passages to be nt endorsement of the ot
prohibition. for those whose approach to the bible is more liberal ,
it is not surprising that they regard paul 's negative view of
homosexuality as something that he took from his jewish upbringing
without any serious reexamination in the light of the gospel. as
readers of this group know by now , the assumptions behind these
approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the
mouth when they see the opposing view described. there 's not a lot i
can do as moderator about such a situation.

a number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of
detailed exegesis of texts that is described above. however in fact
i'm not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their
own beliefs on such analyses. the real issue seems to rest on the
question of whether paul 's judgement should apply to modern
homosexuality.

one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds
of questions we are trying to deal with. he encountered homosexuality
only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was
wrong. he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act
straight and fail , and he had never faced christians who are trying
to define a christian homosexuality , which fits with general christian
ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the
relationship between god and man. it is unfair to take paul 's
judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make
judgements on these questions.

another is the following in paul 's time homosexuality was associated
with a number of things that christians would not find acceptable. it
was part of temple prostitution. among private citizens , it often
occured between adults and children or free people and slaves. i'm
not in a position to say that it always did , but there are some
reasons to think so. the ancients distinguished between the active
and passive partner. it was considered disgraceful for a free adult
to act as the passive partner. (this is the reason that an active
mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful. his
customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.) this
supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two
free adult males , at least not without some degree of scandal.
clearly christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children ,
slaves , or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible
partners. (however fee 's commentary on i cor cites some examples from
ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve
free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way. thus the considerations
in this paragraph should n't be pushed too far. homosexuality may have
been discredited for jews by some of these associations , but there
surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not
involve slaves or children.)

some people have argued that aids is a judgement against
homosexuality. i 'd like to point out that aids is transmitted by
promiscuous sex , both homosexual and heterosexual. someone who has a
homosexual relationship that meets christian criteria for marriage is
not at risk for aids.

note that there is good reason from paul 's general approach to doubt
that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative ,
apart from any specific statements on homosexuality. i believe his
use of the genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual
marriage as what god ordained.

however the way paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning
against being too quick to deal with this issue legally.

i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is
not entirely a theological issue , but also a pastoral one. paul 's
tendency , as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating
holidays , is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues
to look very carefully at the good of the people involved , and to
avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.
for example , while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat
meat , he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about
which they had personal qualms. for another example , paul obviously
would have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)
remain unmarried. yet if they were unable to do so , he certainly
would rather see them married than in a state where they might be
tempted to fornication.

i believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the
views paul expressed in rom 1. one may believe that homosexuality is
not what god intended , that it occured as a result of sin , but still
conclude that at times we have to live with it. note that in the
creation story work enters human life as a result of sin. this
does n't mean that christians can stop working when we are saved. the
question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful
or whether you believe that it 's a misfortune that is in a broad sense
due to human sinfulness. if you 're willing to consider the latter
approach , then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more
damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.
the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often
fails , and when it does , you end up with damage ranging from
psychological damage to suicide , as well as broken marriages when
attempts at living as a heterosexual fail.

this is going to depend upon one 's assessment of the inherent nature
of homosexuality. if you believe it is a very serious wrong , then you
may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.
clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency
to steal or with drug addiction , even though attempts to cure these
conditions are also very difficult. however these conditions are
intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for
homosexuality. (many problems associated with homosexuality are
actually problems of promiscuity , not homosexuality. this includes
aids. i take for granted that the only sort of homosexual
relationships a christian would consider allowing would be equivalent
to christian heterosexual relationships.)

in the course of discussing this over the last decade or so , we 've
heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow christians who are in
this situation. i 've also seen summaries of various research and the
results of various efforts for conversion . (aside from the
presbyterian report mentioned above , there 's an faq that summarizes
our readers' reports on this question.) the evidence is that
long term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a
par with healing miracles. the danger in advising christians to
depend upon such a change is clear when conversion does n't happen ,
which is almost always , the people are often left in despair , feeling
excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement
of life long celibacy. paul recognized (though in a different
context) that such a demand is not practical for most people , and i
think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that
judgement. the practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay
sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality. maybe
homosexuality is n't god 's original ideal , but i can well imagine paul
preferring to see people in long term , committed christian
relationships than promiscuity. as with work which genesis
suggests was n't part of god 's original ideal either i think such
relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god 's love
with each other.

there 's an issue of biblical interpretation underlying this
discussion. the issue is that of cultural relativism . that is ,
when paul says that something is wrong , should this be taken as an
eternal statement , or are things wrong because of specific situations
in the culture of the time \? conservative christians generally insist
on taking prohibitions as absolute , since otherwise the bible becomes
subjective what is to stop us from considering everything in it as
relative \?

when looking at this issue , it 's worth noting that no one completely
rejects the concept of cultural relativism. there are a number of
judgements in the new testament that even conservative christians
consider to be relative. the following judgements are at least as
clear in the bible as anything said on homosexuality

prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in
the ot it 's not in the nt , but i mention it here because
until relatively recently the church did consider it binding
on christians)
prohibition against swearing oaths
endorsement of slavery as an institution
judgement of tax collectors as sinner

we do not regard these items as binding. in most cases , i believe the
argument is essentially one of cultural relativism. briefly

prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific
agrarian society that the bible was trying to build ,
but not to our market economy.
few people believe that american judicial oaths have the
same characteristics as the kind of oaths jesus was
concerned about
most people believe that paul was simply telling people
how to live within slavery , but not endorsing it as
an institution
for people believe that the irs is morally equivalent to
roman tax farming

the point i'm trying to make is that before applying biblical
prohibitions to the 20th cent. , we need to look at whether the 20th
cent. actions are the same. when christian homosexuals say that their
relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul
would have been familiar with , this is exactly the same kind of
argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.
until fairly recently christians prohibited taking of interest , and
many christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed. (indeed ,
slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship
between god and human beings christians are often called servants
or slaves of god.)

i am not trying to say that everything in the bible is culturally
relative. rather , i'm trying to say that some things are , and
therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in
the bible , that ends the discussion. we need to look at whether the
action we 're talking about now has the same moral implications as the
one that the bible was talking about. if christians want to argue
that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against
homosexuality are still binding , i'm willing to listen. those who
claim that the question does n't need to be looked at are kidding
themselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey
all the rules listed above).

one thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue
creates. when you consider the weakness of the biblical evidence
some laws in leviticus , a passage in rom whose subject matter is
really idolatry rather than homosexuality , and a couple of lists whose
words are ambiguous the amount of concern this is raising among
christians seems rather out of proportion. this should suggest to
people that there are reasons other than simply biblical involved.
this is true on both sides clearly homosexual christians are as
strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the biblical arguments
as conservative christians are to find biblical arguments. but i
ca n't help feeling that the bible is being used by both sides as a way
of justifying attitudes which come from other sources. this is a
dangerous situation for christians.

on the other side of the issue , i would like to note some problems i
have with the pro homosexual position as it is commonly presented.
one of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically
determined. i.e. god made me homosexual , and i have no choice. i
think god made me homosexual is a fine view for people who already
believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable. but i
do n't see it as an argument for acceptability.

many people think that alcholism is largely biological , and drug
addiction may turn out to be as well. that does n't mean it 's ok.
most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong. some people
get angry easily. others tend to be arrogant. others tend to be
attraced to women who are married to someone else. homosexuality (if
we view it as wrong) would n't be different than any of these other
things. if we are going to follow god , we all end up at one time or
another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular
temptations that cause us problems. none of us can sit back and say
that because god made us the way we are we can just relax. as jesus
said , we all have to take up our cross daily. this concept of dying
to self (which also appears throughout paul 's letters) seems to
suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we
are called on not to accept. paul 's letters and the experience of
christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us , and
the battle against it is lifelong and difficult. the fact that
homosexuality is difficult to fight does n't necessarily say it 's ok.
maybe this is n't the place where we have to die to self. but i 'd like
to make sure that those who think it is n't are fighting the battle
somewhere else , and not rejecting the concept that all christians have
to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin.

i believe that the one
important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament
passages cited above did not know was that there is scientific
evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent
rather than completely learned.

note that scientific evidence in this area does not prove any conclusions.
there has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual 's
brains are different from heterosexuals but that proves very little.

also notice that the apostles did not have with them the scientific
evidence linking certain genes with alcoholism , or stealing with certain
genetic problems. even if they did have scientific evidence , i doubt it
would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the holy
spirit that these things are sinful.

this reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine. he said
something very true. christianity teaches that we should not give in
to our every inclination. most people do give in to their leanings.
in christianity , we have the concept of struggling with the flesh ,
and bringing it into submission. one person may have a problem with
his temper , and having a murderous heart , another may have a problem
with homosexuality , another may be inclined to greed. but god offers
us the opportunity to be more than conquerers.

sources where you can find this information , there is homosexual
behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals , which is in itself
suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned , or at least that
the word unnatural should n't really apply....

the preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates
with him. is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband \?
the bible is concerned with human morality , and only touches on animal
morality as it relates to humans.

the extent that well meaning people think they 've just flat out

different aspects , modes , or whatever , of one god. if you accept
economic trinitarianism , it 's possible that you do n't have any
substantive difference with the standard view. is it possible that
you just do n't find the neo platonic explanation illuminating \?
clh

i would put it stronger than that. i consider it nonsense.

simply put , i do not see any way that a platonic essence could have
any real existance. essence in the platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as i can tell it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways.

so , to attribute an 'essence' to god is to attribute to him something that
does not exist ! ! thus the orthodox platonic formulation seems to leave
the unity of god in limbo , since it is based on a non existant 'essence' ,
thus failing to avoid the very problem it was supposed to address.

thus , to me , the unity of god must be primary , and the triality must be
secondary , must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles , or to modes
of interaction) , since otherwise there is no meaning to saying god is one.

ok , let me see if i can get all this out concisely. i am on an
information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of
christianity churches there are.
my husband and i come from very different , but completely
christian backgrounds. i was a lutheran when i met him and he was a
born and raised church of christ member. at first i agreed with a lot
of what the c of c was about , i wanted to move from the liturgical
based lutheran church to something a little more biblical based.
however over the last year , i 've been regretting changing to the
church of christ for a number of reasons for one thing i am not a
fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the bible are
socio cultural in nature and do n't relate to the christian doctrine.
one of my sorest spots is the role of women. i believe that through
mary and other women , chris validated women as worthy disciples but
in the c of c the writings of paul are taken without exception and i
am told that i am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser
member , i am to submit to my husband in all things (if i hear that
verse one more time....) and i am not to take an active role in
anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men
(ie leading prayers , conducting bible studies etc). the last straw
was when the elders at our church came down on one of our college
groups because it was all women and they wanted a man to lead the
study.
also my husband and i really resent the way everyone at our church
feels that if you are n't a conservative republican you are n't a real
christian (i got told that nobody who voted for clinton should call
themselves a christian). hence we are subjected during the service to
long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with. we are
also do n't agree with the c of c 's dread of any new movement being
led by the young people.

so , we have been church hunting with no success. i want a reasonably
biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter
what their calling ( c of c really looked down on career women).
christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious
convictions , with adult baptism and a church where the members still
bring their bibles to service.

we are so confused here and we 're drifting around trying to find a
place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and
without reservation. if anyone can point us in a direction we 'd be
thrilled !
i'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to c of c and
even harder for me to stay churchless for long.

any responses would be welcome


the diel family

i would think somewhere in the baptist spectrum you might find what
you 're looking for. however the issue is probably more one of the
flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the
denomination baptists cover quite a spectrum. adult baptism sort
of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.
historically that 's been associated with movements that have the
character you 're trying to avoid. clh

the only problem with this is that jesus does use hell as a threat.
he does n't sound like some of the more extreme fire and brimstone
preachers , and i do n't think he wants people to live in abject fear.
but he talks a lot about people being found unworthy , and mentions
hell a number of times. i agree that it might be more pleasant to
think that it does n't exist. i certainly do n't agree that god is some
sort of sadist who tortures people forever. but i am very much afraid
that there really is a life and death spiritual struggle going on , and
that it is possible for people to lose in a serious way. clh

no disagreement at all that there is a very serious struggle going on.
but jesus more typically uses consequences as a threat. that 's quite
different from hell classic (tm). ) jesus does n't sound like the
usual hell fire type of preacher. he attracts people through what he
does. and the stongest example in jesus preaching is in the parable of
lazarus and dives , which is a parable ! in any case , my point is that
a fear based response to christ is not a freeing , life affirming choice
and is n't good news in a meaningful sense. there are plenty of good
reasons to follow jesus that have nothing to do with fear or a literal
hell , that still pertain to overcoming in the present struggle between
god and the disloyal opposition. a faith based in fear is not built
on rock , as we should found our faith , but on ice. if the fear were
removed , there would be no foundation.

that 's basically why it matters to me. i think we have many christians
that don't have a solid basis for relating to the living incarnate god.
i cannot be fully open to the working of god in and through my life if
my response to god is motivated on fear.

does anyone now where an english translation of the long recension of
the acts of the apostles can be found \?

1 an english translation of this can be found in
the acts of the apostles , translated from the codex bezae , with an
introduction on its lucan origin and importance , j. m. wilson
(london , 1923).

2 another work that might be useful is
the acts of the apostles , a critical edition with introduction and
notes on selected passages , albert c. clark (oxford , 1933
reprinted 1970).

(this is an edition of text of acts that makes the assumption that the
text in codex bezae is the more authentic. i do n't know if it
actually contains an english translation or not.)

3 another useful that discusses many of the variants in detail is
the theological tendency of the codex bezae cantabrigiensis in
acts , eldon j epp (cambridge , 1966).

4 the most recent reference i found was an edition in french from the
early '80s. (i can supply the reference if anyone 's interested.)

5 now , many of the works are going to be difficult to find. so if
you 're interested in examining the differences in the long recension
an excellent (and easily obtainable) discussion can be found in
a textual commentary on the greek nt , bruce metzger (united bible
society , 1971).

metzger 's book serves as a companion volume to the ubs 3rd edition of
the greek nt. it contains a discussion on the reasoning that went
behind the decisions on each of the 1440 variant readings included in
the ubs3. furthermore , notes on an addition 600 readings are
included in atcotgnt (the majority of these occur in acts).

in particular in the introduction to the section on acts metzger writes
an attempt was made to set before the reader a more or less full
report (with an english translation) of the several additions and
other modifications that are attested by western witnesses ...
since many of these have no corresponding apparatus in the
text volume , care was taken to supply an adequate conspectus of the
evidence that supports the divergent readings. (p 272).

i understand that one of the early codexes , vaticanus and siniaticus has
this version of acts. it would be interesting to know what the
differences are between the long and the short forms.

6 most of the copies of the text of acts that we have (including the
ones in vaticanus and siniaticus) adher pretty closely to the shorter
(or alexandrian) version. the longer version to which you refer is
usually called the western version and its main witness is the codex
bezae (althought there are a few other rather fragmentary sources).

7 as far as size , the difference is that in clark 's edition
(mentioned above) the book of acts contains 19 , 983 words whereas the
text edited by westcott and hort (a typical alexandrian text) contains
18 , 401 words i.e. a difference of about 8 1 2 .

8 to answer the obvious questions , no , there are no major revelations
in the longer text nor major omissions in the shorter text. the main
difference seems to expansion of detail in the western text (or , if
you prefer contractions in the alexandrian). the western text seems
to be given to more detail. there are some interesting specific
cases , but this probably not the place to go into it in detail.

9 the discussion over the years as to which of these versions is the
more authentic has been hot and heavy. if there is anything
approaching a modern consensus it is (i) that neither text represents
purely the authentic version , (ii) each variant reading has to be
examined on its own merits however , (iii) the variant in the
alexandrian text is the better more often than not.

mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at
lourdes. she referred to herself as the immaculate conception.
since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the
doctrine , the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed
the case for the doctrine.
bernadette was 14 years old when she had her visions , in 1858 ,
four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the
pope.

james kiefer

i forgot exactly what her age was but i remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education , whatsoever , at the age of the apparitions.
she suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in a prison cell of some sort.

she had to ask the 'lady' several times in her apparitions about
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.
for several instances , the priest did not get an answer since
bernadette did not receive any. one time , after several apparitions
passed , the lady finally said , i am the immaculate conception .
so , bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking. so , when she told the priest , the
priest was shocked and asked bernadette , do you know what
you are talking about \? . bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest. the priest continued with , how did you remember
this if you do not know \? . bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

the priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
but bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of our lady to bernadette.

(note this lady of lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims. at the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water
flowing.)

you might want to re think your attitude about the holocaust after
reading deuteronomy chapter 28.

on the contrary , after the holocaust , i would be very cautious about my
interpretatoin of deuteronomy 28. not everything that happens is in
accordance with god 's will. (you might guess which side of the
predestination issue i am on.) i will never assume that evil is
punishment by god , especially when i am speaking of the evil that falls on
someone else . for my own life , i will work to discern the hand of god
in the evil that befalls me .

austin c archer (archau@saturn.wwc.edu) wrote

i am interested in views about the non event of may 3. seriously , how can a
christian discriminate between messages from god which are to be taken
seriously , and those which are spurious \? is there a useful heuristic which
would help us avoid embracing messages which , by their non fulfillment are
proven to be false , thus causing the name of christ to be placed in
disrepute \? is this a problem at all \?

it is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision , but that he
interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con
sciousness , translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above
that of time and space into an immediate worldly context and getting it
wrong. not that he did it rationally , but rather that unconsciously the
perceptions became clothed in material images , instead of remaining in the
realm of the potential and not yet time space bound. this difficulty of
translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been
difficult , even for the prophets of old. that is why their prophecies are
so often subject to multiple interpretations. likewise , the apostles seemed
to feel that the return of the lord was to be very soon in the sense of
perhaps the same generation. yet the meaning of very soon has proven to
be different than they could grasp. prophetic vision tends to telescope
time , so that things that are far off appear to be very close.

another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to
happen , again in the realm of the potential but not yet manifest and which
was thwarted by other forces , including possibly an act of divine mercy.

there are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and
sincere and sober christians (and others too). it seems that great coming
events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these
apocalyptic times. the various predictions (i'm talking about those that
appear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept , yet hard to ignore com
pletely. one has the feeling something is about to start to get ready to
begin to commence to happen . we are living , as the chinese saying goes ,
in interesting times.

as for how to discriminate , the bible does n't help much. there is an old
testament passage (i forget where it is) that says you will know whether
a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass. that
helps eliminate the failures after the fact , but in the case of an earth
quake it is small comfort. it seems to me that all prophecies that give
specific times and places and events should be suspect , not in that they
are necessarily false , but in the sense stated above , that all such visions
are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the
plane of earthly time and space.

for what it is worth , rudolf steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate
could see into the future and predict coming events. his answer was that
it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti
cipation in them , including proclaiming what he saw. if this is in fact
a spiritual law , then the answer to your question about how to discriminate
is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law ,
knowingly or unknowingly , and as such his message should be considered
a priori to be dubious. i.e. i would expect that those capable of making
true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in
the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake did. however , i can
sympathize with the person who published the prophecy. given the same
overwhelming experience that he apparently had , i too might feel impelled ,
and even commissioned by god to tell my fellow human beings about what
i had seen.

of course the doctrine was explained more fully later on by sts.
augustine , aquinas , etc. , but the seeds were ther from the beginning.

this is really confusing to me , especially since i still believe that
christ jesus died for all of us. preknowledge of obstinacy seems
like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses. but

i think you are reading it wrong. i say those who are not saved are not
saved on account of their own sins. it is not because god did not give
them sufficient grace , for he does do so , in his desire that all men
might be saved. however , as only some are saved and those who are
saved are saved by the grace of god , not by works , lest any man should
boast the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to
heed the call of god. they are damned by their own free will and
chosing , a choice forseen by god in his causing them to be not
predestined , but reprobated instead.

so god uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it 's needed
and not where it is n't \? and so there are the saved and the not saved ,
and nothing in between. hmmmm.

certainly god does not distribute grace evenly. if he did , no one could
have their heart hardened (or rather , harden their heart , thus causing
god to withdraw his grace). but , you are correct the world is divided
into those who god knows to be saved , and those god knows to be on the
road to perdition. the key is that god knows it and we do not. thus ,
no one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect
and predestined. but no one who is a christian in good standin should
doubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in god).

be punished after we die. you 're saying what we get after we die has
a direct bearing on how we live now \? strange....

you must admit it is possible. anyway , why would you want something in
the hear and know , when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven \? better to
lay up your treasure in heaven is what jesus said.
this is not to condemn the rich , but simply to point out that those who
are rich are frequently very evil or immoral , so god must give them
their blessing know , as they have chosen. remeber , jesus promised
tribulation in this world , and hatred of others because we are
christians. he did not promise heaven on earth. he promised heaven.

so sin is either punished now or later and not both \? what if it 's
sort of half punished \? are there any grey areas in this doctrine \?

not really. unless you do penance here on earth , you will have to do it
in purgatory , as paul pointed out (1 corinthians 3.15). those with
poorer works , though still done with good intentions , will only be saved
through fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately , for
whatever good they did was not for god but for self (dead works)). of
course , the church gives indulgences , has confession , and annointing of
the sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin , so there is really
little excuse for ending up in purgatory it is a last hope for the
somewhat lazy and careless as i said above in referring to paul.

and no comments were taken as flames. you are one of the more polite
people i have talked to over the net.

does he believe in predestination
of course i believe in predestination. it 's a very biblical doctrine as
romans 8.28 30 shows (among other passages). furthermore , the church
has always taught predestination , from the very beginning.

really \? you may be right , but i 'd like proof. as far as i know (and
i am not a div school student ! ) the catholic church does not seem to
accept predestination. my chaplain told me beware of greeks bearing
gifts with reference to this doctrine it seems to have the curious
result that human beings are not held responsible for their own
actions ! i 'll answer how you deal with this in a minute.

but to say
that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free
will. men freely choose the course of their life , which is also
affected by the grace of god. however , unlike the calvinists and
jansenists , i hold that grace is resistable , otherwise you end up with
the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god (1 timothy 2.4).

right. that does n't really seem like predestination to me , but i 'll
continue with what you 're saying....

for god must give enough grace to all to be saved. but only the elect ,
who he foreknew , are predestined and receive the grace of final
perserverance , which guarantees heaven. this does not mean that those
without that grace ca n't be saved , it just means that god foreknew their
obstinacy and chose not to give it to them , knowing they would not need
it , as they had freely chosen hell.

this is really confusing to me , especially since i still believe that
christ jesus died for all of us. preknowledge of obstinacy seems
like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses. but
then , i am not really biblically supported in this opinion or am i \?
others \?

people who are saved are saved by the grace of god , and not by their own
effort , for it was god who disposed them to himself , and predestined
them to become saints. but those who perish in everlasting fire perish
because they hardened their heart and chose to perish. thus , they were
deserving of god s punishment , as they had rejected their creator , and
sinned against the working of the holy spirit.

so god uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it 's needed
and not where it is n't \? and so there are the saved and the not saved ,
and nothing in between. hmmmm.

yes , it is up to god to judge. but he will only mete out that
punishment at the last judgement.

well , i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some
blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little) ,
for those he ca n't bless in the next life , he blesses in this one.

although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause
social problems , it ends up doing just that if there is supposed to
be some sort of sign that someone is elect , like lots of children or
success at work , then those who have a good life on earth will go
around thinking that those who do n't are doomed to hell.

in a way , though , this sounds like the opposite idea those doomed
to hell will have a great life on earth. that 's almost like the
converse of what i believe responsibility for what we do now will
be punished after we die. you 're saying what we get after we die has
a direct bearing on how we live now \? strange....

and
those he will not punish in the next life , will be chastised in this one
or in purgatory for their sins. every sin incurs some temporal
punishment , thus , god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it
(cf. 2 samuel 12.13 14 , david 's sin of adultery and murder were
forgiven , but he was still punished with the death of his child.) and i
need not point out the idea of punishment because of god 's judgement is
quite prevelant in the bible. sodom and gommorrah , moses barred from
the holy land , the slaughter of the cannanites , annias and saphira ,
jerusalem in 70 ad , etc.

so sin is either punished now or later and not both \? what if it 's
sort of half punished \? are there any grey areas in this doctrine \?

my stuff deleted
we should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf proverbs 24.11 12) , but
does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the
u.s. or even the u.n. involved \? i do not think so , but i am an
isolationist , and disagree with foreign adventures in general. but in
the case of bosnia , i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily
involved , it would not be a just war. blessed after all , are the
peacemakers was what our lord said , not the interventionists. our
actions in bosnia must be for peace , and not for a war which is
unrelated to anything to justify it for us.

the idea (well , my idea) would be that you would intervene to
establish peace and stop the atrocities. i'm not suggesting wwiii. i
do n't really understand what you mean by a just war . of course i am
not an isolationist , although i see some merit in not jumping in at
the first opportunity (can you say kuwait \? ). we happen to be a big
country with a lot of resources (as well as a lot of debt) , and this
gives us some responsibility in the world , whether we like it or not.
flashbacks of wwii , as well as vietnam , should be haunting us.

yet another difference of opinion. so be it.

it bugs me when i see this kind of nonsense.

first , there is no reasonable evidence linking masonry to ancient
egypt , or even that it existed prior to the late 14th century (and
there 's nothing definitive before the 17th).

i'm going to cut rex 's ramblings down a bit.

...
you must not be past your 20th level. you should read wilkinson 's
egyptians and how he shows this egyptian religion paralleling his own british
masonry. there is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black
mason. i 've talked with him , ...
there is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of.

rex , there are literally hundreds of thousands of 32nd degree
masons in this country , and thousands of 33rds. if nasty stuff was
really going on , do n't you think you 'd have more than a couple of
disgruntled members exposing it \? heck , if what you say is true , then
rev. norman vincent peale is an osiris worshiper.

...
long quote from someone named hislop (source not given) deleted. i'm
attempting to extract from it the relevent points

osiris is actually nimrod , a babylonian deity.

it is admitted that the secret system of free masonry was originally
founded on the mysteries of the egyptian isis , the goddess mother , or
wife of osiris.

the babylonian nimrod and osiris are both connected with the building
trade , ie , with masonry.

nimrod , as the son of cush , was a negro. is n't this refering to a
biblical nimrod , rather than the babylonian god \?

...there was a tradition in egypt , recorded by plutarch , that 'osiris
was black'.
...

there is a long tradition in masonry of claiming ancient lineage
for the order , on the flimsiest of grounds. this dates right back to
the constitutions of 1738 , which cite adam as the first mason. i 've
seen other claims which place masonry among the romans , greeks , and
egyptians , and atlanteans. i even have a book which claims to prove
that stonehenge was originally a masonic temple.

claims prove nothing. where 's the beef , rex \?

...claims ex mason showed him leopard skin he wore in lodge
any representation of osiris usually show the wearing of some leopard.

i 'd have to check this. the tomb paintings i remember do n't show
this.

it is interesting that the druids of britian also show , or should i say
hide , this representation. they , however , worshipped the spotted cow .

can you give ancient citations for this \? the druids were suppressed
over 2000 years ago. what 's your point \?

this whole leopard skin business sounds bizarre. i have not yet
gone through the scottish rite (which contains all of those higher
degrees anti masons get so excited about , and which was invented in
the 1750 's) , but i know enough people who have (and who are good
christians) , that i reject your claim.

i 'll stand by my statements. masonry is of the mystery religions
that all find their source in babylon , the great harlot. sorry peter ,
i do not mean to be a cold slap to the face but there is to much

not so much a 'slap in the face' as 'a weary feeling of deja vu'. i'm
going through a very similar argument over on soc.culture.african.american.

evidence to the contrary that masonry does n't find its origins in
egypt. of the masons i have personally talked to , all refered to
egypt as their origin.

why do n't you try reading some serious books on masonic history , such
as hamill 's the craft \?

why are you now separating yourself from this which not many years ago ,
was freely admitted \?

because we got honest. if you can come up with actual evidence that
masonry existed prior to 1390 , i 'd be very impressed (actually ,
anything earlier than 1630 would be pretty good.)

any real existance. essence in the platonic sense does not have
any referent as far as i can tell it is just an imaginary concept
invented to provide an explanation for things better explained in
other ways.

you are quite confident that essences do not exist. how do propose to
define beings \? can a thing can be one without definition \? can a being
have a definition and know essence \?

what about properties \? do beings have properties \? does god have
properties \?

does numbers exist in reality as abstract entities or do we invent them \?

thus , to me , the unity of god must be primary , and the triality must be
secondary , must be modal or aspectual (relating to roles , or to modes
of interaction) , since otherwise there is no meaning to saying god is one.

seeing as how the two babylons has been brought up again , it is time for
me to respond , once again , and say that this book is junk. it is nothing
more that an anti catholic tract of the sort published ever since the there
were protestants. its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.


i have not seen this book , though i have had several people quote it in
support of some tendentious assertions they were making , so i have become
curious about it.

i do n't want to malign this hislop fellow , whoever he may be , as i have only
heard the arguments at second hand , but both of the arguments seemed to turn
on false etymology that seemed to be derived from hislop.

i would be interested in knowing more about these things.

the first one claimed that the word church was derived from the greek
cyclos , and that it was therefore related to the worship of circe .

i do n't know if hislop is the source of this assertion , but it does seem to
be based on false etymology.

the second claimed an etymological relationship between ishtar and
easter , which seemed to be even more fanciful and far fetched than some
of the wilder notions of the british israelites.

regarding the latter , as far as i have been able to find out , easter is
derived from the old english name for april eosturmonath . the venerable
bede mentioned that this was associated with a goddess called eostre , but
apart from that reference i have not been able to find out anything more
about her. it also seems that the term easter is only used by the english
and those they evangelized. the germans , for example , also use the term
ostern , but germany was evangelized by english missionaries.

so i would be interested in any evidence of easter being used for pascha
by people who do not have any kind of connection with the ancient anglo
saxons and their offshoots. such evidence might support the claims of those
who appear to derive the theory from hislop.

in history seems to imply some pretty serious sin. the one of the
pastors in the church i attend , christchurch city elim , considers
that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a judgement from the lord
is a clear sign that the prophesy is not from the lord.

i would like to see his reasoning behind this. you may have gotten
burned by natural disaster prophecies down there , but that
does not mean that every natural disaster judgement prophecy is
false. take a quick look at the book of jeremiah and it is obvious
that judgement prophecies can be valid. here in the us , it seems like
we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies , though i
am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.

sometimes god does give words that are difficult to swallow. the
relative positiveness of a prophecy is not necesarily grounds to
dismiss it. much of the ot is not happy stuff.

from dhammers@pacific. \? (david hammerslag)

how do you (mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with
christ 's statement that in the resurrection people will neither
marry nor be given in marriage (luke , chapt. 20) \?

footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the book of tobit.
tobit is in the septuagint. goodspeed published it in a book called
the apocrypha . most any bookstore will have this. at any rate , the jews
of christ 's day had this book. it is a story mostly centered around the
son of tobit who was named tobias. there was a young lady , sarah , who had
entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. the brothers
all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.

tobias was entitled to have sarah for his wife (3 17) because tobias was
her only relative and ...she was destined for tobias from the beginning
(6 17).

tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. the
seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. that does not
eliminate tobias , her eighth husband. tobit is a fun and interesting
story to read. it 's kind of a mythical romance. it 's a little shorter
than esther.

the lds also have scriptures that parallel and amplify luke 20. most
notably doctrines and covenants 132 15 16.

therefore , if a man marry him a wife in the world , and he marry
her not by me nor by my word , and he covenant with her so long as
he is in the world and she with him , their covenant and marriage
are not of force when they are dead , and when they are out of
the world therefore , they are not bound by any law when they
are out of the world.

therefore , when they are out of the world they neither marry nor
are given in marriage but are appointed angels in heaven , which
angels are ministering servants , to minister for those who are
worthy of a far more , and an exceeding , and an eternal weight of
glory.

subject hate the sin...
organization georgia institute of technology
lines 33

hate the sin but love the sinner ...i 've heard that quite a bit recently ,
often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality...
but the context really is n't that important. my question is whether that
statement is consistent with christianity. i would think not.

hate begets more hate , never love. consider some sin. i 'll leave it unnamed
since i do n't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not
something is a sin. now lets apply our hate the sin... philosophy and see
what happens. if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the
stronger our hatred of it will become. eventually this hate becomes so
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner. in addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and
do things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even
believe what they are doing is a sin). after enough of this , the sinner begins
to hate us (they certainly do n't love us for our constant criticism of their
behavior). hate builds up and drives people away from god...this certainly
cannot be a good way to build love.

in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our
neighbors. he does n't say anything about hate. in fact , if anything , he
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. so , how are christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others \? i suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. we
need to ask god to help us with our own sin , and to help those we love
with theirs. only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. the best way to
love someone is to pray for them.

lines 26

ever since i was a kid and learned to tell when i was in a
dream i have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems.
in my dreams i have done everything from yell at my mom
to machine gunning zombies , not to mention myriad sexual
fantasies. i have deliberately done things that i would never
do in real life. i understand the need to control ones
thoughts , but i always felt that dreams were format free ,
no morals , no ethics , no physical laws , (though sometimes i would
have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)

is this an incorrect attitude \? rather than weakening my inhibitions ,
i could argue that i got certain things out of my system by
experiencing them in dreams. by analyzing a dream i can determine
if i have a problem with a certain situation , i.e. in a dream
something will be exagerated that i can then contemplate and
see if it really bothers me or not.

i ca n't believe that other people do n't do the same. it seems
silly to attach moral significance to dreams.

i think that this is entirely different from out of body
experiences , which i have never had.

does n't the bible say that god is a fair god sic \? if this is true ,
how can this possibly be fair to the infants \?

andrew byler writes

what do you mean fair \? god is just , giving to everyone what they
deserve. as all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf
romans 5.12 , psalm 1.7) , they cannot possibly merit heaven , and as
purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins , it
is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven....

why is it fair to punish you , me and the rest of humanity because of
what adam and eve did \? suppose your parents committed some crime before
you were born and one day the cops come to your door and throw you in
jail for it. would you really think that is fair \? i know i would n't.

well , suppose your mother was a crack addict and crack user abuser while
she was pregnant \? suppose your husband gave you some sdt (this recently
happened to a close friend of my wife and mine) \?

often , the consequences of our sin are at least partially inflicted on
innocent people. several times in the ot , this is pointed out , even
saying that descendants would suffer consequences for a person 's sin
for several generations. even today , we see multi generational (to
coin a phrase) effects from alcoholism , child abuse , and spousal
abuse just to name three.

so , god 's definition of fair and ours differ.

some points of perspective

though the predisposition towards sinning is now inbred (see webster 's
first definition of inbred) thanks to adam , it is arrogant and foolish
for any of us to think we would have done any different if we were in
their shoes. i know myself pretty well , and i'm just not that good. take
god 's word for it , neither are you. there is no one righteous...

more important , when a person decides to be a disciple of jesus , god
promises supernatural help in overcoming our physical self 's sinful
tendency. we can , of course , choose to ignore this help. (rom 7 , 8)

...god made mankind upright , but men have gone in search of many
schemes. eccl

a brief description about ahmadiyya islam



the ahmadiyya movement in islam , an international organi
sation , was found in 1889 in qadian , india. the founder of this
movement , hazrat mirza ghulam ahmad (1835 1908) , was proclaimed to
be the promised reformer of this age as foretold in the scriptures
of almost all major religions of the world. he claimed to be the
fulfillment of the long awaited second comming of jesus christ
(metaphorically) , the muslim mahdi , and the promised messiah.

the claims of hazrat ahmad raised storms of hostility and
extreme opposition , which are often witnessed in the history of
divine reformers. even today this sect is being persecuted especial
ly in some of the muslim regimes. the right of ahmadi muslims to
openly practice their religion and to define themselves as muslims
has been severely restricted in many muslim countries. the united
nations , human rights organizations such as amnesty international
and top leaderships of some countries have voiced their concerns
against this denial of basic human and civil liberaties to the
members of this movement , but so far to no avail.

despite the opposition and persecution , the movement cont
inues to grow with a current membership of millions from around the

and as someone mentioned earlier , from the apocryphal book of enoch ,
satan was apparently kicked out for three times asserting his own will ,
i will . hmmm...pro choice looks kinda creepy here.

then there are the references around the bible about taking a third

subject hate the sin...
date 12 may 93 08 27 08 gmt

hate the sin but love the sinner ...i 've heard that quite a bit recently ,
my question is whether that statement is consistent with christianity. i
would think not. hate begets more hate , never love.

if you are questioning whether or not hating sin is consistent with
christianity i ask you to consider the following scripture

romans 12 9 let love be without hypocrisy. hate what is evil , cling
to what is good.

what is it that paul , through the inspiration of the holy spirit is
calling us to hate \? would god call us to do something that would
eventually lead to hating our fellow man especially when he commands us to
do the opposite , to love your fellow man \?

consider some sin. now lets apply our hate the sin... philosophy and see
what happens. if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the
stronger our hatred of it will become. eventually this hate becomes so
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to
hate the sinner.

that has not been my experience. i 've not found myself hating anybody
as a result of hating the sin that may be in their life. as a sinner
myself , i find myself having more compassion for the person. jesus too ,
since the bible teaches that he was tempted in every way that we are , is
able to have compassion on us when we our tempted and fall. jesus is our
very example of how to hate the sin but love the sinner. in the account of
the woman caught in adultery (john 8) , jesus had compassion on the woman
but he also called her to leave her life of sin. this is what it means to
love sinners but hate their sin it means loving them unconditionally ,
while at the same time calling them to leave their sin.

in addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and do things
which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even believe
what they are doing is a sin).

the blame for this can not always be laid at the feet of the
christian. i have seen and been guilty of taking offense by someone merely
pointing out my sin and calling me to repent of it. it was not unloving
for the christian to call me out of sin in fact , i believe it was the most
loving thing that that person could have done. he loved me enough to want
to spare me the consequence of remaining in my sin.

after enough of this , the sinner begins to hate us (they certainly do n't
love us for our constant criticism of their behavior). hate builds up and
drives people away from god...this certainly cannot be a good way to build
love.

again , i do n't think that you can lay the blame for this at the feet of
the christian. if we have loved them as jesus loved sinners (exemplified
in john 8) and the sinner hates us for it , then we have done the best we
can. we will have extended to them the most perfect expression of love and
they will have rejected it.

now it we hate the sin but forget to love the sinner , then indeed , we
will , ourselves , be in sin.

in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our
neighbors. he does n't say anything about hate.

i would like to encourage you to do a word study on hate in the new
testament. i really think that you will be surprised.

in fact , if anything , he commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves.

criticism is very different from calling a sinner to repent.

hope this helps ,
in christ ,

could anyone enlighten me on how the mormon church views
children born out of wedlock \? in particular i'm interested to know if any
stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents. i'm especially
keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on
bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big
genealogical
book the mormons keep in salt lake city. if this is an issue on which the
official position has changed over time , i'm interested in learning both
old
and new beliefs. e mail or posting is fine. all information or pointers are
appreciated.


well , since my wife is (in your gentle term) a bastard , i can
probably speak with a bit of authority on this. any stigma
associated with children conceived and or born out of wedlock rests
solely upon the parents they 've committed a sexual transgression for
which they should repent. the child itself has no a priori limitations
on him or her indeed , the concept of blaming the child for the
parents' sins is one most mormons would find appalling note that lds
theology rejects original sin , as the term is usually defined , and the
subsequent need for infant baptism (cf. moroni 8 in the book of
mormon). indeed , lds doctrine goes one step further and in some cases
holds parents responsible for their children 's sins if they have
failed to bring them up properly (cf. d c 68 25 28 note that this
passage applies it only to members of the lds church).

also note that there is no big genealogical book in salt lake city .
the lds church has a massive storage facility in the nearby mountains
containing (on microfilm) vital statistic records (birth , christening ,
baptism , marriage , death) gathered from all over the entire world. i
may be misremembering , but i believe they have records for some 2
billion people in that vault. at the same time , the lds church is
building up an on line genealogical database. in neither case is there
some kind of worthiness screening as to whether someone can be
entered in. the only potential issue is that of establishing who the
parents were , and that would apply only in the case of the database.

bruce@liv.ac.uk (bruce stephens) suggests different levels of acceptance of
homosexuality

1) regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil , whatever)
2) regard homosexual behaviour as a sin , but accept orientation
(though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who
indulge
3) as 2 , but love the sinner
4) accept homosexuality altogether.

i would add 4' our churches should accept homosexual orientation but hold all
people to certain standards of sexual behavior. promiscuity , abuse of power
relationships , harrassment , compulsivity are equally out of place in the lives
of homosexual as of heterosexual people.

of course , this would bring up the dread shibboleth of homosexual marriage ,

mmh@dcs.qmw.ac.uk (matthew huntbach) writes

i would say only to the extent that the roman catholic church
neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment , as
confirmed in the recent catechism , though there are many rcs
who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was
not explicitly condemned.

i quote from the journal , 30 days in the church and in the world ,
1992 , no. 8 9 , p. 29.

regarding the new draft of the universal catechism

in procuring the common good of society the need could arise
that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot
cause harm. by virtue of this , the right and obligation of
public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties ,
including the death penalty , is acknowledged. for similar
reasons , legimate authorities have the right to impede
aggressors in society with the use of arms. the church 's
traditional teaching has always been expressed and will
continue to be expressed in the
consideration of the real conditions of common good and the
effective means for preserving public order and personal
safety. to the degree that means other than the death
penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the
peace , then these non violent provisions are to be preferred
because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.

as is clearly shown by this excerpt , the church 's teaching on capital
punishment remains today as it has always been in the past in total
accord with my sentiment that i do not disagree with the use of deadly
force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.

i do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken
as support for capital punishment. i take it that as a roman
catholic you are opposed to abortion , and would still onsider
it wrong , and something to be objected to even if legalised by
authority .

i seek to conform my will to the will of god as expounded by his
instrument of the visible church here on earth whenever the question
of faith or morals arises.

a weekly dialogue with a local pastor on the news of the day

by carl (gene) wilkes

this week's thoughts

last week the supreme court refused without comment to hear an
appeal by rensselaer , in , school officials desiring the
distribution of bibles in their public schools (rel65 , 5 21). a
lower court had banned the local gideons , an international bible
distribution group , from passing out bibles to fifth graders. the
aclu 's barry lynn was quoted as saying that the court 's action
protected the religious neutrality of our public schools. he also
said that schools must serve students of all faiths and none.
schools were not to be a bazaar where rival religious groups
compete for converts , according to lynn.

several gideons , men who are responsible for putting bibles in
hospitals and hotels , are members of our church. they tell of
similar stories where they are only allowed to distribute bibles on
sidewalks around the schools , but cannot go inside the schools.
they tell of mild harassment by parents who do not want their
children receiving a bible from a stranger. they are willing to
continue their work at a distance , but find the school 's position
somewhat disheartening.

i understand rationally and logically the court 's position. and , i
can see the sense of fairness for all groups. but , on the other
hand , when does neutrality become nihilism \? when does plurality
turn into no position at all \?

i see a couple of ironies here. one is that we can pass out condoms
but not bibles in our schools. think on that one for a moment.

the other is that while we are seeking religious neutrality in
our schools , countries like russia who , by the way , practiced
religious neutrality for the past seventy years are making the
bible part of their public school curriculum. when i was in st.
petersburg in march , the church we worked with had trained over 100
public school teachers to teach the bible , and the government had
requested hundreds more ! i recently heard a medical doctor who is
president of the gideon chapter in moscow tell how they are eagerly
invited to the university of moscow to distribute bibles to the
students and are given class time to explain its contents. i
remember seeing a photograph of this doctor holding a bible and
speaking to the university students standing under a statue of
lenin. now , that 's ironic !

i admit two things 1) we are a pluralistic society , and all faiths
have equal footing. this is what our country was founded on. 2) to
allow every group on school grounds could create a bazaar like
atmosphere. each city must work to be inclusive of all religions
and provide a hearing for them. 3) i know i said two the vitality
of religious faith is not dependent upon whether or not the public
arena acknowledges it as valid.

however and you knew this was coming i believe , disallowing the
distribution of the bible by law abiding , caring adults in our
schools only signals once again our culture 's movement away from a
singular base from which we as individuals and as a nation can make
moral and ethical decisions.

what do you think \?

i guess there are at least some people who are not able to support
this claim. there are still a lot of languages without the bible , or a
part of the bible. there are still many languages which we are not
able to write , simply because the written version of the language has
not yet been defined !

yes , i suppose that 's true. of course , notice i qualified with nearly
every language ). and there are missionaries out there who can
speak every imaginable language and dialect. but then , the fact that
not all languages have a written gospel lends no credence to the
concept of pentecost type xenoglossolalia since most tongues occur not
in these places of un written language , but rather in churches full
of people who do have a written language and a bible in that language.

as a final note , the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign a
common statement of christology , in which the heresey of monophysitism
was condemned. so the coptic orthodox church does not believe in
monophysitism.

sorry !

what does the coptic church believe about the will and energy of christ \?
were there one or were there two (i.e. human and divine) wills and
energies in him.

also , what is the objection ot the copts with the pope of rome (i.e. why
is there a coptic catholic church) \? do you reject the supreme
jurisdiction of the 263rd sucessor of st. peter (who blessed st. john
mark , bishop of alexandria was translator for) and his predecessors \? or
his infallibility \? or what other things perhaps \?

for your first set of questions (regarding the energy and will of christ)
i quote to you the relevant part of the statement signed by both eastern
(chalcedonian) and oriental (non chalcedonian) orthodox scholars a few
years ago (both families both orthodox churches)

1. both families agreed in condemning the eutychian heresy. both families
confess that the logos , the second person of the holy trinity , only begotten
of the father before the ages and consubstantial with him , was incarnate and
was born from the virgin mary theotokos fully consubstantial with us , perfect
man with soul , body and mind ( nu o upsilon zeta ) he was crucified ,
died , was buried and rose from the dead on the third day , ascended to the
heavenly father , where he sits on the right hand of the father as lord of all
creation. at pentecost , by the coming of the holy spirit he manifested the
church as his body. we look forward to his coming again in the fullness of his
glory , according to the scriptures.

2. both families condemn the nestorian heresy and the crypto nestorianism of
theodoret of cyrus. they agree that it is not sufficient merely to say that
christ is consubstantial both with his father and with us , by nature god and
by nature man it is necessary to affirm also that the logos , who is by nature
god , became by nature man , by his incarnation in the fullness of time.

3. both families agree that the hypostasis of the logos became composite by
uniting to his divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy , which
he has in common with the father and the holy spirit , created human nature ,
which he assumed at the incarnation and made his own , with its natural will
and energy.

4. both families agree that the natures with their proper energies and wills

are united hypostatically and naturally without confusion , without change ,

without division and without separation , and that they are distinguished in

thought alone.


5. both families agree that he who wills and acts is always the one hypostasis
of the logos incarnate.

...

i guess that adresses your question adequately.

as for your second set of questions , i am afraid they are irrelevant to the
discussion (at least from my point of view) of monophysitism. i do not see
how they relate to the topic we are discussing (other than to start an
endless orthodox rc debate which i do not plan to engage into). as a brief
answer to your questions , the position of the coptic orthodox church
regarding the roman pontiff , his jurisdiction , his infalability , etc.
is exactly the same as all the other orthodox churches.

i came across something that was completely new to me ,
and i thought i 'd offer it for comment.

to keep this as brief as possible , let me state my
observation as a declarative statement , and then whoever
wants to can comment on it. basically , what i think
i 've observed is that the phrase the ten commandments ,
as used by moses , is not a reference to ex. 20 1 17 , but
rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from ex.
20 1 through ex. 31 18. that is , the phrase the ten
commandments should more accurately be translated the
ten discourses , of which the passage we call the ten
commandments is really only the first.

i'm not completely convinced that the above is true , but
for purposes of discussion , let me argue it as though i
was sure.

arguments supporting the above idea

1) there are n't really ten commandments in ex. 20 1 17.
in order to get 10 commandments , you have to get two of
them out of verses 3 6 , and the verses themselves do not
support such a division because they are all about not
worshipping other gods. that is , verse 3 commands to
have no other gods , and verse 5 commands to not worship
the idols mentioned in verse 4. you ca n't violate
verses 5 6 without violating verse 3 , indicating that
the whole passage is one command , and leaving us with
only nine commandments . i could go on at length about
this , but for now i 'll just stop with this summary.

2) there are ten speeches between ex 20 1 (the beginning
of the traditional ten commandments ) and ex 31 18
(where god actually gives moses the two tablets with the
ten commandments discourses written on them). i break
these ten down as follows 20 1 17 20 22 26 21 1 23 33
25 1 30 10 30 11 16 30 17 21 30 22 33 30 34 38
31 1 11 and 31 12 18. in most cases , each of these
passages begins with some variation of the phrase , and
the lord spoke to moses , saying... the exception is
ex. 21 1 , which begins now these are the ordinances
which you are to set before them...

3) the word translated commandments in the phrase
the ten commandments is n't really the word for
commandment , its the word for a speech , or an
utterance. it 's a word often used for longer discourses
rather than individual statements for instance , when
combined with the word 'yom' (day) , this word is
translated chronicles in such phrases as now the rest
of the acts of so and so , are they not written in the
chronicles of x \? ... the word for commandment is
freely used throughout the books of moses , and perhaps
it is significant that when moses spoke of the ten x 's ,
he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and
chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer
than just a single command.

4) god tells moses that he is going to give him the
stone tablets with the law and the commandments (ex
24 12) , yet he does not give moses the tablets until he
has finished all ten discourses on mount sinai. if the
ten commandments were only ex. 20 1 17 , it is not
immediately clear why god would wait several days and
nine more discourses before giving these tablets to
moses. on the other hand , if we have the ten discourses
written on the tablets , then it makes perfect sense that
god would not give moses the tablets until he had
finished delivering all ten discourses.

5) when moses did get the tablets , he found that both
tablets were written on both sides (ex. 32 15). if
these ten commandments were only the first 17 verses
of ex. 20 , god would have had to have written in large
letters ! not that he could n't have , of course , but it
does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to
two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal
sized letters.

6) in ii cor. 3 , paul seems to specifically single out
the commandments written on stone as being the
ministry of death , that which is fading away , and
the ministry of condemnation. with the possible
exception of the commandment about the sabbath , it is
difficult to see why paul would refer to the commands in
ex. 20 1 17 as being temporary , fading away type
commandments. this is less of a problem if the stone
tablets should happen to have included all of the
commandments from ex 20 through ex 31.

arguments against this idea

the main argument against this idea , aside from the fact
that it contradicts a long standing tradition , is that
in dt 5 22 , moses says , after quoting the commands in
ex. 20 1 17 , these words the lord spoke...and he added
no more. and he wrote them on two tablets of stone and
gave them to me. this appears to identify the words
just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone
tablets.

that was my first impression , anyway. however , after
some thought , i noted that a great deal hinges on how
you understand the phrase these words. if moses meant
these words which i have just related to you were
spoken by god etc. , then that would mean that only the
traditional ten commandments were on the stone
tablets. if , however , moses was making a parenthetical
comment these words which i am now telling you were
spoken by god etc. then that 's quite different.

i did note that in the dt 5 account , moses tells of
being given the stone tablets before telling of the
people asking moses to represent them before god ,
whereas in the exodus account , the people asked this of
moses between the first and second discourses , several
days before god gave moses the stone tablets. this
reinforces the idea that moses' remarks in dt 5 22ff
were intended as a parenthetical remark , rather than a
strictly chronological account of when god wrote what ,
and at what point he stopped adding to what was on the
tablets.

summary all things considered , i find it somewhat more
likely that the nine commands in ex 20 are really only
the first of what moses regarded as the ten discourses
of god. i do n't know if anybody has ever espoused this
idea before it 's brand new to me. so , while i lean
towards accepting it , i would be very interested in
hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to
offer.

my stuff about dealing with defferences deleted

this is not at all comparable. christianity is the main stream in
western culture. you are trivializing the experiences of others.

i am sorry i did not mean to. i think i understand how your
experiences were much worse than the small bit of ridicule i have had
to put up with. i guess i did n't really understand before now i do.

i remember what it was like being different as a christian. we
were told all the time that we were different , and in fact that
only members of the our church were really christians (though others
who believed in god were n't as bad as atheists) , so we were a small
minority. that was nothing compared to being an atheist.

wow , pretty conservative church. (please excuse me if this seems like
a ridiculous understatement to you.)

the only thing comparable would be a young child being christian
being surrounded by staunch atheists , including parents , who
actively persecute any religious tendancies both actual punishments
and , even worse , emotional blackmail. they would also have
to have the whole mainstream society on their side. maybe these
conditions could have occured in the old soviet union not in a
country with under god in its pledge of allegiance.

(on a side note , that under god was n't in there until recently i
believe my father , who is in his sixties , remembers saying the pledge
of allegiance without that in there. i do n't know the history behind
that though.)

emotional blackmail ouch. thank goodness (i 'll be neutral in my
thanks here ) ) i was raised in a completely tolerant household , so
that i could make my own decisions !

i doubt it even then , because children have to be taught to be
christians and hence must have support somewhere.

so atheism does n't have to be taught , but christianity does. i guess
i can see that , although i can see a child believing in some sort of
god without anything other than his her own imagination as a basis.
(sorry , i guess this is sort of minor)

my query about parallel between lack of choice for homosexuals and
lack of choice for him as an atheist deleted
yes. my atheism was born of necessity. for an intellectually honest
person belief is mostly a response to evidence.

hmm , i wonder why i am a christian then \? this is n't a flame , this is
a real wonder. does anyone else have opinions to offer on why you
believe in something that has n't necessarily been proven to you \?

will or wishes have
nothing to do with it. i could choose to lie , or to be silent about
my true beliefs. i could no more choose to believe in the god of
christianity than i could decide that the ordinary sky looks red to
me.

sounds like you are an atheist by nature , then. or is it possible
that at least part of it is due to the apparently repressive nature of
the christianity of your childhood \? if this is getting too personal
perhaps you should ignore it , or we can take it to email.

still i should be clear that i'm not equating what i went through
with what gays go through. however it is a mistake to assume that
everyone who goes through painful experiences are broken by them.
happily some are made stronger , once we get past it.

this may have been a general remark you do not sound broken to me ,
but indeed stronger.

i must say that i
was n't hurt by my experiences in church any more than some of my friends
who did n't become atheists. i was just hurt differently.

i'm not sure i understand this sentence could you explain \?

not without going to details and violating the confidences of some of my
childhood friends. suffice it say to that religion does not guarantee
that a person will be happy and strong emotionally , and a repressive
upbringing can leave its scars even , or especially , on those who do n't
get free of it. i doubt that any sane and sincere person doubts that and
i feel no need to defend it.

yes , i agree with that. i 've seen some of the damage repressive
religion can do , and as a result i intend to raise my own children as
much as i can to look around before accepting one religious stand
(atheism is included in this) and to question everything this is
very important.

by the way i am much happier and stronger being out of the closet. in
the end it has been , as someone eloquently put it in private email , an
experience of liberation rather than disillusion.

i can see that.

often times (most recently on this list in the last few days) i 've
heard the passage from revelation

...whoever adds to the sacred words of this book...whoever removes
words from this book...

used as an arguement against the deutercanonical books.

i feel this is ridiculous for two reasons

1. they were n't added later by the catholic church they were
always part of what was considered inspired scripture.
(this has been dealt with in previous postings...no reason
to repeat the info.)

2. it is more likely than not that when st. john (or whomever) wrote
the book of revelation what was then considered scripture was
not the same thing you and i are holding in our hands !

if one takes the translation of this book in rev 18 22 (or somewhere
around there) to mean all of scripture , then all of us are likely
holding something that is in violation of this command.

it is impossible to exactly date the scriptures , even the n.t. ones
(they did n't like to date their letters , i guess). i really wish i
had my bible with me right now to get the facts straight , but i believe
that several of the n.t. letters , chief among them 2 peter , have their
most likely date of composition in the early second century a.d.
revelation was almost certainly written durin the reign of
domition (sp \? ) , a.d. 80 96. thus it could be argues that we are all
in sin if we accept 2 peter as scripture , since it was added to the
book after the composition of revelation , when we are told to add
nothing more.

if you want to get the exact dates , get a copy of the new american
bible. i 'll try to follow this up tomorrow if i remember.

when elizabeth greeted mary , elizabeth said something to the effect that
mary , out of all women , was blessed. if so , it appears that this
exactly places mary beyond the sanctification of normal humanity.

i do n't see how this logically follows. true enough , mary received a blessing
beyond any granted in all the history of humanity by being privileged to be
the mother of the savior. it says nothing about mary needing to be a blessed
person first in order that she might thereby be worthy to bear the son of
god. again , i think the problem is that as humans we ca n't comprehend how the
sinless incarnation could spring from sinful human flesh and god 's spirit.
rather than simply accept the gracious miracle of god , we must needs try
to dope out a mechanism or rationale as to how this could be. mary 's own
words ,

...my spirit rejoices in god my savior , for he has regarded the low
estate of his handmaiden , ...

sound like the words of a human aware of her own humanity , in need of a
savior , similar to what david proclaimed in his psalms...not the words
of a holy being with no further need for god 's grace.

i really apologize for harping on this , i do n't suppose it 's important.
it 's just that i see mary and joseph and the baby reduced to placid ,
serene figurines i feel we lose the wonder in the fact that god chose
to come down to you and i , to be born of people like you and i , to share
our existence and redeem us from it 's fallenness by his holy incarnation.

hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of babel , we see how
god punished by giving us different language. can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all , that they have the same one
amongst other angels \? after all , they were not punished in any manner.

if the languages we sepak are the result of babel , then it stands to
reason that angels would speak a different language from us. you do
have a valid point about multiple angelic languages. but angelic
beings maybe of different species so to speak. maybe different species
communicate differently.

i do n't know either. truth be known , so little is known of angels
to even guess. all we really know is that angels always speak in
the nativ tongue of the person they 're talking to , so perhaps they
do n't have any language of their own.

trouble is , while such stories abound , any and all attempts at
verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances , or that outright
fabrication was involved. the brother puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing. and linguistically , a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language , inflection or no.

i have heard an eyewitness account , myself. such things are hard to prove.
they do n't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well. i don' t
know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway.

well , we are told to test the spirits. while you could do this
scripturally , to see if someones claims are backed by the bible ,
i see nothing wrong with making sure that that guy lazarus really
was dead and now he 's alive.

much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories (since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable) and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated , so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy or lay.

that 's an unprovable statement. how can you prove if somethings been proved \?
there is no way to know that you 've seen all the evidence. once i
saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of
his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer.

it 's a common fallacy you commit. the non falsifiability trick. how
can i prove it when not all the evidence may be seen \? answer i
ca n't. the fallacy is in assuming that it is up to me to prove
anything.

when i say it has never been proven , i'm talking about the ones
making the claims , not the skeptics , who are doing the proving.

the burden of proof rest with the claimant. unfortunately ,
(pontification warning) our legal system seems to be headed in
the dangerous realm of making people prove their innocence (end
pontification).

but truthfully , corinthians was so poorly written (or maybe just
so poorly translated into english) that much remains unknown
about just what paul really intended (despite claims of hard
proof one way or another). some will see his writings in
1 cor 12 14 as saying do n't do this do n't do this and using
sarcasm , metaphor , etc. while yet others take what he says literally
sarcasms and metaphors notwithstanding.

me \? when i read 1 cor 14 about praying speaking in tongues regarding
building oneself the church , i see him using compare contrast ,
saying do this because it build the church , while doing this
builds onself (implying do n't do that). it 's a common usage
of writing that we all employ , and it is easily seen how it
could be interpreted this way. why some do and some do n't is
a mystery.

continuing with dr. deyoung 's article

survey of new interpretations of arsenokoitai

d.s. bailey

d.s. bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning
of arsenokoitai. he takes the term in i cor 6 9 as denoting males who actively
engage in homosexual acts , in contrast to malakoi ( effeminate ) , those who
engage passively in such acts. 4 however , he insists that paul knew nothing
of inversion as an inherited trait , or an inherent condition due to
psychological or glandular causes , and consequently regards all homosexual
practice as evidence of perversion (38). hence bailey limits the term 's
reference in paul 's works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the
term as homosexuals. bailey wants to distinguish between the homosexual
condition (which is morally neutral) and homosexual practices italics in
source . paul is precise in his terminology and moffatt 's translation
sodomites best represents paul 's meaning in bailey 's judgment (39). bailey
clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers.

j. boswell

the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is
that of john boswell. 5 whereas the usual translation 6 of this term gives
it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense , boswell gives it a passive
sense.

in an extended discussion of the term (341 53) , he cites linguistic
evidence and common sense to support his conclusion that the word means male
sexual agents , i.e. active male prostitutes. his argument is that the arseno
part of the word is adjectival , not the object of the koitai which refers to
base sexual activity. hence the term , according to boswell , designates a male
sexual person or male prostitute. he acknowledges , however , that most
interpret the composite term as active , meaning those who sleep with , make
their bed with , men. boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the
historical setting. he argues that in some compounds , such as paidomathes
( child learner ) , the paido is the subject of manthano , and in others , such
as paidoporos ( through which a child passes ) , the paido is neither subject
nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance. his point is
that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning. more
directly , he maintains that compounds with the attic form arreno employ it
objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno use it as an adjective
(343). yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno .

boswell next appeals to the latin of the time , namely drauci or exoleti.
these were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects. the greek
arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the latin drauci the corresponding passive
would be parakoitai ( one who lies beside ) , boswell affirms. he claims that
arsenokoitai was the most explicit word available to paul for a male
prostitute , since by paul 's time the attic words pornos ( fornicator ) and
porneuon ( one committing fornication ) , found also in the lxx , had been
adopted to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed
fornication. 7

in the absence of the term from pagan writers such as herodotus , plato ,
aristotle , and plutarch , and from the jewish writers philo and josephus ,
boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that
arsenokoitai did not connote 'homosexual' or even 'sodomite' in the time of
paul (346). 8 he also demonstrates its absence in pseudo lucian , sextus
empiricus , and libanius. he subsequently finds it lacking in all discussions
of homosexual relation (346) 9 among christian sources in greek , including
the didache , tatian , justin martyr , eusebius , 10 clement of alexandria ,
gregory of nyssa , and john chrysostom. chrysostom is singled out for his
omission as final proof that the word could not mean homosexuality. 11

boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of i cor and i tim from
discussions of homosexuality among latin church fathers (348). 12 cited are
tertullian , arnobius , lactantius , and augustine. the last named uses
circumlocutions. other latin writers include ausonius , cyprian , and minucius
felix. the term is also lacking in state and in church legislation. by the
sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual
activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife
(353).

having surveyed the sources , boswell concludes ,

there is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted
homosexuality in the time of paul or for centuries thereafter , and every
reason
to suppose that , whatever they came to mean , they were not determinative of
christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts (353).

it is clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male
prostitutes. he even goes so far as to conclude that paul would probably not
disapprove of gay inclination , gay relationships , enduring love between
persons of the same gender , or same sex eroticism (112 , 166 17).

male prostitute , for it does not occur at all in any literature prior to paul
(as a serach in the thesaurus linguae graecae using ibycuc confirms). if paul
coined the term , it would have no prior history , and all such discussion about
its lack of usage in contemporary non christian and christian literature is
meaningless.
8. again this would be expected if paul coined the word.
9. the key phrase here apparently is discussoin , for boswell admits later
(350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of paul but there is no discussion in the
context. hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer
(polycarp to the philippian 5 3 theophilus ad autolycum 1.2 , 2.14 nilus
epistularum libri quattuor 2.282 cyril of alexandria homiliae diversae
14 sybilline oravle 2.13 ) meant. yet polycarp , who was a disiple of hohn
the apostle and died about a.d. 155 , argues in the context that young men
should be pure. he uses only the three terms pornoi , malakoi , and arsenokoitai
from paul 's list. this at least makes boswell 's use of all subjective.
apparently clement of alexandria paedogogus 3.11 sromata 3.18 also belong
here.

10.. yet eusebius uses it in demonstraionis evangelicae 1.
11. either boswell is misrepresenting the facts about chrysostom 's use of
arsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of i cor 6 or i tim 1 ,
or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when
chrysostom uses it. yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our
study , whether in the lists or other discussions. boswell later admits (351)
that chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on
i cor. although boswell suggests that the passage is strange , it may be that
paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.
12. apparently jerome is a significant omission here , since he renders
arsenokoitai as masculorum concubitores , corresponding almost exactly to the
greek (348 n.36).

(350 n.42) that it occurs in quotes of paul but there is no discussion in the
context. hence the implication is that we cannot tell what these writer
(polycarp to the philippian 5 3 theophilus ad autolycum 1.2 , 2.14 nilus
epistularum libri quattuor 2.282 cyril of alexandria homiliae diversae
14 sybilline oravle 2.13 ) meant. yet polycarp , who was a disiple of hohn
the apostle and died about a.d. 155 , argues in the context that young men
should be pure. he uses only the three terms pornoi , malakoi , and arsenokoitai
from paul 's list. this at least makes boswell 's use of all subjective.
apparently clement of alexandria paedogogus 3.11 sromata 3.18 also belong
here.

10. yet eusebius uses it in demonstraionis evangelicae 1.
11. either boswell is misrepresenting the facts about chrysostom 's use of
arsenokoitai and its form (about 20) in the vice lists of i cor 6 or i tim 1 ,
or he is begging the question by denying that the word can mean homosexual when
chrysostom uses it. yet the meaning of arsenokoitai is the goal of his and our
study , whether in the lists or other discussions. boswell later admits (351)
that chrysostom uses the almost identicl form arsenokoitos in his commentary on
i cor. although boswell suggests that the passage is strange , it may be that
paul is seeking to make a refinement in arsenokoitai.
12. apparently jerome is a significant omission here , since he renders
arsenokoitai as masculorum concubitores , corresponding almost exactly to the
greek (348 n.36).

consequently ,
this verse indicates that she was without sin. also , as was observed at
the very top of this post , mary had to be free from sin in order to be the
mother of jesus , who was definitely without sin.

if the mother of jesus had to be without sin in order to give
birth to god , then why did n't mary 's mother have to be without
sin in order to give birth to the perfect vessel for jesus \? for
that matter , why did n't mary 's grandmother have to be without sin
either \? seems to me that with all the original sin flowing
through each person , the need for the last one (mary) to have
none puts god in a box , where we say that he could n't have
incarnated himself through a normal human being.

my god is an all powerful god , who can do whatever suits his
purpose. this includes creating a solar system and planet earth
with the appearance of great age providing a path through the
red sea for the children of israel that does not depend on the
existence of a ridge of high ground and a wind blowing at the
right speed and direction and the birth of himself from a normal
sinful person without being tainted by her original sin.

i see far too much focus on the objects of religion and not
nearly enough on the personal relationship that is available to
all believers with the author of our existence , without the
necessity of having this relationship channeled through conduits
to god in the form of mary , apostles and a pope.

note that the idea of mary being conceived without original sin , i.e. the
immaculate conception , is distinct from the idea of mary not having sinned
during her lifetime , which is a separate doctrine and , i believe , also
held by the catholic church.

if mary was born without original sin , and did n't sin during her
lifetime , how is she any different from jesus \? this means the
world has had two perfect humans one died to take away the sins
of the world the other gave birth to him \? i would certainly
want to see some scriptural support for this before i would start
praying to anyone other than god. everything i have ever read
from the bible teaches me that jesus was and is the only sinless
lamb of god , not his mother , grandmother........

hope this is useful to you.

lines 31

i hate to sound flippant , having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before , but i'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that the assumption of mary would be better phrased our
assumptions about mary. in all the time i 've been reading about
mary on this group , i can not recall reading much about mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant , if any , scriptural
foundation.

i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ 's parents
as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to god 's working , beyond doubt. but the almalga
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures , untouched by sin or human
desire. only christ himself was so truly sanctified , and even he knew
temptation , albeit without submitting to it.

i also do n't see the necessity of saying the holy parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of god 's grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being.

i wo n't start yelling about how people are worshipping mary , etc. ,
since folks have told me otherwise about that , but i do think we
lose part of the wonder of god 's incarnation in christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless , sexless , deathless , otherworldly beings.

we chose to believe whetever we want , but we are not allowed to define
our own christianity. we see in parts. if you see something that i do
not see , or vice versa , it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief !

it is important if christianity is being damaged by it. if
people who speak in tongues make claims that they are
miraculously speaking a foreign language through the power of
the holy spirit , when it can easily be shown that they are simply
making noises , it damages all christians , since many who are
not christians do not distinguish between the various sects.

the more modest claim for tongues that it is simply
uncontrolled praise in which words fail you is surely the one
that should be used by those who make use of this practice.

i agree with the point that charismatic practices like this
can lead to forms of worship which are more about the
worshipper showing off than genuine praise for god one of the
things jesus warned us about.

in all candor , i would be happy to be proven wrong about believing
in atheism . problem is , i will have to be proven wrong.

in mentioning some nonsense about psychology ) and atheism , bob muir asks
the following question.

no smiley on the part about atheism , i see. do you realize that your
statement says that i was mentioning nonsense about atheism \? this is
hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making , as you
have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the
first. please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it
out of hand.
but , because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of english , i may be
misinterpreting your wording here. please clarify did you or did you not
mean to call my statements about atheism nonsense \? if so , care to back
up that claim \?

do i sound broken to you \?

i answer in the affirmative.

ok , then. start up the amatuer psycology again. how am i broken \?

is it politically correct for christians to be the only besieged group
permitted the luxury of arrogance \?

yawn excuse me , i do n't recall any portion of my post in which i called
christians arrogant quote me , if i did. i do remember calling christianity
silly and then following that up with information that i was nine years
old when i thought that. i also said that i find faith to be intellectually
dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of your god 's
existence. i define faith as belief in the absense of any proof , btw.

also , i subscribe to a.a as i mentioned and we see fundies of all types
there , so in answer to your question no.

finally , i 'd hardly call christianity beseiged in this country. i seldom
see christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing
crosses or having christian bumper stickers. i do n't know for sure , of
course , i only say i have n't seen it happening. what i have seen happening
is my homosexual and or friends being beat up , or preached at by people
who claim to be christ 's followers. i know that this sort of thing is n't
practiced by the majority of christians , but it is a very vocal minority
who are doing it and i do n't see comperable victimization of christians.

now i have a question for bob. why in the world would any self respecting
atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group \?

the implication being that i am not self respecting , of course. i'm not a
student of psychology , btw , but i am a student of creative writing and
linguistics , so literary analysis is my forte. also , if the implications
i see are improper , please let me know.
i'm here because i'm not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as
you seem to think atheists should be. did it occur to you that i do n't
think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that
will change my life \? have you read my other posts here or did you see
atheist and decide it was time to poke at someone who does n't deserve
your respect \?
aw , geez. i'm sorry , i probably am getting my back up a little too high ,
here. it 's just that the nonsense thing really annoys me. i figure you
should see my first reactions , though , since they are my true reactions to
your question.
now , the smoothed feather version
i seek all sorts of knowledge. that 's why i came to my university. yes , i
am looking at your religion (well , sorta , i have no idea what kind of
christian you are) from the outside , and hopefully with an objective view.
i 've been trying to ask reasoned questions here , because i genuinely do n't
know the answers to them , but when i saw the question directed at atheists
i figured i would answer. after all , you can speculate about atheist
motives here all you want (hence the amatuer psychology crack) , but
without an atheist , you ca n't be sure of even one atheist 's motive.
i'm hoping people really
want to know and i was trying to show that i actually checked out several
religions and i actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and i
actually think about these things. instead , i'm still faced with the
implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only broken
people are atheist.
try it from the flip side i posit that atheism is the natural
state and only broken people are theists. i offer as proof that so many
people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they
discovered their religion , that religion is regional (if people did n't
follow the religion of their areas , there would be a more homogenous
mix) , so many terrorists claim theistic motives , and that theists tend
to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. why are religions
so successful \? because there is so much suffering in the world , which
breaks people.
it 's an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it , which is another
reason i'm here , to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as
a watchdog for logical fallacies ).
i have a
difficult enough time keeping up with it , and i think i know something

about the subject.

the implication here being that atheists ca n't possibly know anything
about christianity. probably jumping at shadows again , but i think my
reaction is somewhat justified. after all , the first post suggested that
atheists are broken , hostile people. this post confirms that someone
else believes it.


bob reminds me of my roommate. in order to disbelieve atheism , he says

he will need to be proven wrong about it.

well , he got me there. i am a strong atheist , because i feel that lack of
evidence , especially about something like an omnipotent being , implies
lack of existence. however , i have n't met the strong atheist yet who said
that nothing could ever persuade him. call me a seeker if you like , i
do n't.
weak atheism is being ignore here , though. some atheists simply say i
do n't believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no
god(s) exist. for the weak atheist , the is no atheism to disbelieve ,
because they do n't actively believe in atheism. (if you think this is
confusing , try figuring out the difference between protestants and
methodists from an atheist point of view ).
this is another fallacy many theists seem to have , that everyone believes in
something (followed up by everyone has faith in something ). guess what \?
my atheism ends the moment i'm shown a proof of some god 's existence. is
that really too much to ask \?


well , i do n't even waste my time trying.

well , i guess you wo n't succeed in converting him or me. why the
supposition that you will fail to convince him \? (amatuer psycology on) is
it because you yourself are unconvinced \? )

i tell him that he 'll just have to take my word for it.
and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest. note that
i can only speak for myself. if you find faith to be honest , show me how.
i have been unable to reconcile it so far. maybe that 's how i'm broken \?
i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that
you should just take my word for it. if you accept that , you are of a
fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you
think. all i ask for is proof of the assertion god exists . logical or
physical proofs only , please. then we 'll discuss the nature of god .

in response , he tells me he will say an atheist 's prayer for me.
prayer \? ! uh , oh , we 'll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie ! )

good luck , bob. and , best regards.

good luck to you , as well. and , again , i apologize if the inferences i
made were inaccurate.

that last paragraph just about killed me. the deuterocanonicals have
always been accepted as inspired scripture by the catholic church ,
which has existed much longer than any protestant church out there.
it was martin luther who began hacking up the bible and deciding to
remove certain books not the fact that the catholic church decided
to add some much later that is the reason for the difference between
catholic and protestant bibles.

this is misleading , at best. the question , really , has to do with the
status of the greek septuagint versus hebrew scripture. and the issue
predates the reformation by quite a bit jerome was negative about the
deuteroncanonicals and in fact , even though he transalted them , he put
them after the hebrew canon (reordered from the greek ordering to the
hebrew one.) his translations of them were quick and dirty , also (he
reports having done one of them in one day , and another overnight , just
dictating his translation to an amanuensis.

that is to say , it is the vulgate , and all of its massive importance in
western christianity , along with the veneration of jerome , which took the
first steps in reducing these books from the status they had (and have)
among the greeks.

furthermore , it is inaccurate to say that the reformers threw out these
books. basically , they just placed them in a secondary status (as jerome
had already done) , but with the additional warning that doctrine should
not be based on citations from these alone.

i think that the emphasis on the hebrew originals is sound , though it
seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as
part of a collection whose principles of selection (in hebrew or greek)
are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident. it also seems
to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow
more inspired as if magical , and conveying a message untranslatable
than a translation , as if we could not hear god 's word to the jews in
greek (or german , or english , ...). this tendency seems to have got a
big boost in sola scriptura protestantism , even to the point of current
inerrancy bizarreness , despite the more basic , underlying tendency of
the reformers to see that the texts should and could be translated. if
we can profit from an english rendering of hebrew and greek , there is
surely little reason to keep sirach , at least , out of our bibles (and of
course , anglicans do n't do so )). for texts originally in greek , it
would seem more to be anti greek prejudice (notably , by the time the
hebrew canon is fully attested , including anti christian prejudice which
led to the jewish abandonment of the septuagint) which is operative.

btw readers may enjoy some lectures of bruce metzger on the issues of
translation of the bible (including some of what i said about jerome ,
above) in the current numbers of the journal bibliotheca sacra two
of four have been published so far.

jerryl payne writes
to sublimate a culture for the sake of what you perceive as unity seems
antithetical to the very message of inclusion that you preach.

i agree , with the exception that i do n't preach ignoring our cultures.

the body as a whole must be unified. the question is , shall we be a
melting pot , boiling ourselves down to one legitimate expression , or
shall we be more like a stew , maintaining the textural integrity of the
expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought \? it released
all churches from the use of the latin mass (unity) to allow them to
speak to the people in the common language (diversity).

in revelation 2 3 , we see that in the first century church , there was one
congregation in each major city. so there was one unified church. now in
each city , there were people of different cultures. naturally , they
formed something of a stew , with different members having different
heritages. nevertheless , they were one body. they met together ,
sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups
in places such as the temple courts.

now in a particular city , then and now , you will find that there is a
common language associated with that region. for instance , in rome , latin
was spoken. in the united states today , english is spoken. so it would
make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common
language and not necessarily latin.

naturally , you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common
language. in the first century church , there were probably many people
in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the
message for people of foreign ethnic groups. today , however , you do n't
see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons , even in so called
pentacostal churches. we do have a modern day equivalent though
bi lingual speakers. now in the unified church of which i am a member
sometimes called the international churches of christ , when we all meet
together on sundays , there are headphones on people who do n't speak
english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their
native tongue. neat idea , huh \?

now , we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays ,
so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish
speaking people , for example , who will hear an evangelist preach in their
native language. in addition , we meet in small groups a couple of times
during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals. so someone
who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also
speak his language (assuming the congregation is large enough) for those
meetings.

as for the people who speak the common language , they can keep in touch
with their culture , if they want , but they will also have equally deep
friendships among their church relationships with people of many various
nationalities.

has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action \?

the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of
latin \? indeed not ! see my second paragraph in response to the second
clipping of your article.

however , if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a
culture , then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted.

i 'll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping.

rather i believe it has been enhanced , for paul exhorts us to become as
one of them that we might reach them. thus , if a person or group of
people feel more comfortable among their own , shall we not give them a
place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still
l ove god \? my guess aaron

you have met some needs of people , certainly , by helping them to be proud
of their cultural heritages when most denominations did n't. yet you have
largely isolated yourselves from having quality christian friendships
outside your nationality (and your denomination).

we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their
heritage. however , we will do this in a way that does not destroy church
unity , but rather encourages friendships among all disciples.

this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite.

it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions , but they are going
about things in the wrong way. and names like the african methodist
episcopal church still make me cringe , although not as much as before.

i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such
groups to be formed , but now we should try to unite. i know that it 's
hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one
body of people on earth , but it is quite possible , and i am working to
make it happen. however , what might be a smaller step towards unity ,
would be taking the word african out of your denomination 's name. then
perhaps someday a long time off , you can also remove the methodist
episcopal part also , and simply be part of the church .

with regard to inclusivity , i note tht your .sig emits from mit. as you
know , the 'tute is religiously and culturally diversified , and not
everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with english , much
less american culture. what shall be the conduct of the campus churches
then shall there be one church , for the sake of unity \? or shall the
organizations like kcf be useful in helping students new to america make
the transition in culture , language , and thought \?

there shall be one church , for the sake of unity , and it shall be useful
in helping students new to america make the transition in culture ,
language , and thought. we should n't make a new denomination to try to
solve problems. the whole denominational mindset only causes more
problems , sadly.

in the ame church , we retain african cutlure at the root of our
expression , but we are by no means exclusive. since you live in
cambridge , i invite you to visit the local assembly there

thank you for the invitation. that shows me that you indeed have the
heart to spread the gospel of jesus as well as take part in your cultural
heritage. thank you also for responding to my post. i know (all too well)
how they can be very time consuming.

the whole idea of celebrating your culture is paved with good intentions ,
but i still feel that you must restore and preserve unity at the same
time. my own church , the boston church , has the acapella singing that you
mentioned in your post , yet does n't limit expression of my mexican
culture , even though i am in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish
(speaking) zone. i have made a commitment to god that i will go to the
sunday services of my church , because i know that my brothers and sisters
here are fully devoted in love for god as his disciples.

i do n't believe in tongues , as you may have already picked up on , because
of my understanding of biblical christianity. however , i am certainly
willing to visit your congregation provided that it does n't interfere with
my normal worship. since you also live in cambridge , i also extend an
invitation to you to visit our services as often as you like. you can
meet the mit students at the student center (across from 77 mass. ave.) at
9am on sundays to leave for worship or simply call me after wednesday
night to find out where the service will be held on a particular day.
my number is 225 7598 , but will be 354 1357 in a few weeks from now and
for the rest of the summer. our service normally last from 10am to noon ,
but occasionally are later or earlier (1 3 times per year).

let us always strive to reach all with the gospel by any means necessary.
as we move from milk to meat , the petty things of the world that
temporally separate us will dissolve away , and we shall stand with our
naked realizations that god has shed his grace on all of us , his
delightful creation.

definitely !

a) the united states of america
b) mho db) which was as a figure of the fallen spiritual powers who
corrupt and oppress human society
c) historical jerusalem
d) historical rome

dare i suggest that the passage might be many layered in meaning \? how
about the prophecy reveals god 's judgement on the corrupt idolatrous
state oppressing his chosen people (d) that god 's judgement extends
especially to his once chosen city (c) because , despite that city 's
special call , it still rejected god 's grace at the decisive time (rev
11 8 \? also is n't rev19 24 equally suggestive of rome as jerusalem \? )
that the usofa is guilty of many of the crimes of rome babylon (a) and
is equally subject to god 's judgement that the good book(tm) actually
encompasses all these viewpoints by revealing the corrupting spiritual
powers warring against mankind through the very society that we 've

i think mary 's view has a lot of sense because there seems to be a

jerusalem chosen by god but never (historically) fulfilling its vocation
and the new jerusalem perfected (outside of history) purely by god 's
grace. eg details like rev 17 1 `.. who sits on many waters' cf rev 22
the single stream in the new jersualem `the river of life flowing from
the throne of god and of the lamb.'

if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why does n't the bible
ever say so. it never comes right and says only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.
what christ did say was

i solemly assure you , no one can enter god 's kingdom without
being born of water and spirit ... do not be surprised that i
tell you you must all be begotten from above.

could this be because everyone is born with original sin \?

do we attach some meaning of the israelites entering the promised land to
christianity \?

i submit god did not hold the children responsible when the adults chose
to follow the bad report of the 10 spies over joshua and caleb. this is
recorded for us in deuteronomy 1 39 moreover your little ones , which ye said
should be a prey , and your children , which in that day had no knowledge
between good and evil , they shall go in thither , and unto them will i give
it , and they shall possess it.

at least to me it seems there was is an age , or point in maturity where
they were are held responsible , and could not enter the promised land ,
younger ones were not held to the same rules , at least not by god.

there is no reason to believe that paul 's thorn in the flesh was
a sin in his life. that makes little sense in the light of paul'
writings taken in totality. he writes of how he presses for the
mark , and keeps his body submitted. no doubt paul had to struggle
with the flesh just like every christian. paul does associate his
thorn with a satanic messenger , and with physical infirmities and tribulation ,
but not with a sin in his life.

i certainly agree with the last paragraph. also , jesus s statements on

was much of his other teaching. there 's more than enough hell here on earth
that we are freed from by following jesus that the rest just does n't mattter

though there is a command in the law not to heed to one who prophecies

the lord had commanded him to not eat or drink till he returned home.
another prophet wanted this man of god to stay in his house , so he
prophecied falsely that the lord wanted the man of god to stay in his

who lied a word that the man of god would die from breaking the word of

of faith (if you want to know , i feel that faith is intellectually
dishonest).

i 'd appreciate some support for this statement. i'm not sure
it really makes sense to me.

i define faith as belief , in the abscense(sp \? ) of evidence . i also
include in evidence past experiences. because i have no past experience
in a god actually having an effect on my life and because i have never
seen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the
neccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional
works i have read (and other reasons) , i do not believe in any god(s).
from what i have seen , some people reconcile this lack of evidence by
using faith.
it is faith in that sense (the only way i currently understand the word
faith ) that i find intellectually dishonest.

the ambiguity of religious beliefs , an unwillingness to take
pascal 's wager ,

i 've heard this frequently what exactly is pascal 's wager \?

pascal 's wager goes something like this
premise 1 either there is or there is n't a god.
premise 2 if god exists , he wants us to believe and will damn us for not
believing.
premise 3 if god does not exist , then belief in god does n't matter
because death is death , anyway.
conclusion belief in god is superior to non belief because
non belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong , while belief in
god only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.

sound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. the problem is ,
premise 1 presupposes 1 1 odds between belief and non belief. this is
flat out wrong , because of the sheer number of religions out there and the
fact that , for the most part , the religions are mutually exclusive. i have
heard theists referred to as 99 atheists because they believe in their
god (or gods) to be the one god (or set of gods). the consequence of
this is what if i pick the wrong god \? suddenly , the odds do n't look so
good because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still
leaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another
god 's version of hell.

do i sound broken to you \?

i do n't know. you point out that your mother 's treatment upset you ,
and see inconsistencies in various religions. i'm not sure if that
constitutes broken ness or not. it certainly consititutes
disillusionment.

i do n't see how disillusionment enters into it. you see , i presented my
mother 's treatment of me to show the cause of my questioning my atheism , a
questioning which continues to this day. i had already been an atheist for
five years before having any contact with my mother 's version of
christianity. if anything , i had become somewhat disillusioned with
atheism (uh , oh , i thought , what if there is a god \? ). yes , in a way , i
have also become disillusioned by many religions , simply because i had
thought at one time that they had all the answers , if i only found the
right one.
i'm still looking , but each time i look in a different place , i become a
little stronger in my attitude (belief , if you will , no faith , though ,
it 's based on the evidence of past experience) that i 'll never find a
religion which has all the answers.
sorta like looking for easter eggs. the more time it takes you to find the
next one , the more convinced you become that you may already have found
all the eggs you 're going to find.
someone else mentioned that critisism is n't going to make me think any
more highly of christians. i have a contrary position constructive
critisism will likely improve my attitude towards christians. abusive
critisism will turn me off.

because i forgot to reply to that one.

year. i would recommend it highly to catholic interested in
apologetics. there will be lots of music , well known catholic speakers ,
fellowship , as well as eucharistic liturgies friday and sunday.

registration is 85 per person , but i believe financial aid is
available if you need it. housing in residence halls (each of which has
its own blessed sacrament chapel) , if desired , is 30 person for double
occupancy for two nights ( 30 total). reservations can also be made for
you at the very nearby holiday inn. i think it was 47 a night there
for my single room. meals are available at the cafeteria (friday dinner
through sunday lunch) for 38 or 32 , with or without breakfast ,
respectively.

franciscan university of steubenville is located in eastern ohio on
us route 22 , 1 2 mile west of the ohio river and ohio route 7. greater
pittsburgh international airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from
campus.

i'm leaning... sirach... is more directly referenced by james
than job or ruth is... in any nt verse i 've seen.

it would help if you mentioned chapter and verse from sirach and
from james.

job 5 13 ( he taketh the wise in their craftiness ) seems to be
quoted in 1 corinthians 3 19.

james 5 11 ( you have heard of the patience of job ) , while not a
quote , implies that james and his listeners are familiar with a
story of a man named job who exhibited exemplary patience. it is
possible that the story they know is not that found in the hebrew
bible , but rather another similar and related story. (one has the
same problem with direct quotes.)

again , matthew 1 5 ( boaz begat obed of ruth ) tells us that matthew
knew a story about a woman named ruth who married a man called boaz
and became the ancestor of david. since ruth is not mentioned in
the ot outside the book of ruth , it seems likely that matthew was
familiar with the book and respected it , and thought ruth important
enough to be one of the few women mentioned in the genealogy.

references like this do not prove that the nt writer considered his
ot source inspired or inerrant or canonical. but neither do direct
quotes.

erh0362@tesla.njit.edu writes

could anyone enlighten me on how the mormon church views
children born out of wedlock \? in particular i'm interested to know if any
stigma is attached to the children as opposed to the parents.

all children are born pure , i.e. , without sin.
however , most saints would view a pregnancy
outside of marriage as an occasion of mourning.
(some church members would be much more
judgmental , but that is their problem.)

in situations where welfare assistance is
provided through our church , bishops usually
require that the family be making some effort to
live the gospel standards and provide for
themselves.

however , there are occasions when assistance is
provided because of the children in the home.
as a former bishop of mine said , children are
always worthy before god.

i'm especially
keen to learn if there is or is not any prohibition in the mormon faith on
bastards entering heaven or having their names entered in the big genealogical
book the mormons keep in salt lake city.

i am not sure what you mean by the term bastards
in this context.

latter day saints believe that through the
temple ordinances the family unit may be
preserved in eternity.

if you use genealogical material or software
produced by the church , you may notice a section
for temple ordinances. within that section
there should be a spot for signifying bic
which stands for born in the covenant.

the children born to couple sealed (married)
within the temple are born in the covenant
and are eligible to be part of that eternal
family unit.
children born to other couples (whether in a
civil marriage or not) would have to be
sealed to their parents after their marriage
is solemnized for eternity.

supposing a child were born to a woman out of
wedlock , he or she could be sealed to his or
her parents at a later date or adopted into
any eternal family unit (which may include one
of the birth parents).

if this is an issue on which the
official position has changed over time , i'm interested in learning both old
and new beliefs. e mail or posting is fine. all information or pointers are
appreciated.

i ca n't say if this principle of adoption
was revealed at the same time as the sealing
ordinances , but it has been accepted for the
15 years i have been in the church.

i would tend to discount any admonitions from
the church authorities against having children
out of wedlock because even though there are
provisions within the lord 's plan to recover
what we have done wrong the church does not
want to give anyone the impression we can sin
and repent at our leisure.

a lot of stuff deleted i'm focusing on just one point
well , he got me there. i am a strong atheist , because i feel that lack of
evidence , especially about something like an omnipotent being , implies
lack of existence. however , i have n't met the strong atheist yet who said
that nothing could ever persuade him. call me a seeker if you like , i
do n't.
weak atheism is being ignore here , though. some atheists simply say i
do n't believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no
god(s) exist. for the weak atheist , the is no atheism to disbelieve ,
because they do n't actively believe in atheism. (if you think this is
confusing , try figuring out the difference between protestants and
methodists from an atheist point of view ).

i'm a little confused about the difference between this weak atheism ,
as you put it , and agnosticism. is agnosticism not believing or
necessarily disbelieving in anything , or what is it \? i used to be
agnostic (by this definition) but if weak atheism includes not
necessarily believing in god , then i guess i was one of those. \? \? \?

actually what i have a hard time understanding is people who do not
ever decide what they believe. i am constantly in a state of
self examination , as it would appear many others are as well (including the
atheists , of course i 'd assume that 's why they 're here ! ). i guess
some people do n't really consider it important to think about the
answers to life , the universe and everything any comment \? just
wondering....

this is another fallacy many theists seem to have , that everyone believes in
something (followed up by everyone has faith in something ). guess what \?
my atheism ends the moment i'm shown a proof of some god 's existence. is
that really too much to ask \?

tough call , as these things seem to be based on faith wish i could
help you , but i already tried once with someone who was a
self professed agnostic thinking of becoming a christian , and it
did n't work too well ! especially tough as i'm still mulling over
whether or not i believe in miracles (looks like another email to my
chaplain is coming up....). all i can do is wish you the best of
luck , and please do post what you find.

and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest. note that
i can only speak for myself. if you find faith to be honest , show me how.

hmm , how so \? i guess i really do n't understand. there are times , of
course , when i say to myself of course i have absolutely no way of
knowing that what i believe in is true except the satisfaction and
sense of peace i get from it which of course could just be
psychological . somehow i live with this anyway is this what you
mean \?

the only proof i have is that i believe god spoke to me once
which could of course be my own imagination. the odd thing is ,
though , that if you do n't at some point start believing in something ,
after a while it all gets sort of ridiculous. maybe it 's just a
question of where you draw the line.

i have been unable to reconcile it so far. maybe that 's how i'm broken \?
i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that
you should just take my word for it. if you accept that , you are of a
fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you
think. all i ask for is proof of the assertion god exists . logical or
physical proofs only , please. then we 'll discuss the nature of god .

i 'll only add one question have you read pascal \? what did you
think of him if you did \?

also you may (or may not) be interested by cslewis surprised by

one 's written words will be interpreted. i am not interested in

there is a contradiction related to the moral issue of polygamy in the
mormon writings. in the book in the book of mormon called the book of
jacob , joseph smith wrote that it was an abomination to god for
david and solomon to have many wives. later , when joseph smith wrote
the doctrines and covenants (possibly when polygamy was becoming an
issue in his personal life) he wrote that it was not an abomination for
david to have many wives. how do mormons answer this contradiction \?

the deutero canonical books were added much later in the church 's
history. they do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of scripture. i do not believe the church that added these
books was guided by the spirit in so doing. and that is where
this sort of discussion ultimately ends.

the apocryphal books that are in the septuagint were part of the canon
used by the greek speaking churches from the inception of the church.
they were not added later (or much later). this is a common misconception.

the preference of the hebrew canon over the greek canon is a later
innovation. the church did not need to be guided to add the books
since they were part of the faith once received by the apostles and
passed to the church.

referring to mary
she was immaculately conceived , and so never subject to original sin ,
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life. this was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by god.

i have quite a problem with the idea that mary never committed a sin.
was mary fully human \? if it is possible for god to miraculously make
a person free of original sin , and free of committing sin their whole
life , then what is the purpose of the incarnation of jesus \? why ca n't
god just repeat the miracle done for mary to make all the rest of us
sinless , without the need for repentance and salvation and all that \?

i do n't particularly object to the idea of the assumption , or the
perpetual virginity (both of which i regard as catholic dogma about which
i will agree to disagree with my catholic brothers and sisters in
christ) , and i even believe in the virgin birth of jesus , but this
concept of mary 's sinlessness seems to me to be at odds with the
rest of christian doctrine as i understand it.


if you do n't agree with joseph 's accurate statement of the catholic dogma
of mary 's perpetual sinlessness , then how do you interpret luke 1 28 ,

and when the angel had come to her , he said , hail , full of
grace , the lord is with thee. blessed art thou among women.

and luke 1 48 \?

...for , behold , henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

i suppose that these verses might be interpreted to mean that mary was
possessed of some limited quantity or quality of grace , just as some of
us are , but it seems to me that full of grace means just what it says
filled to the brim , incapable of containing more. the only other people we
know of who have an abundance of grace are those souls existing in heaven now
(another catholic dogma , based on the communion of saints , as i explained in
an earlier post). full of grace to me means sinless , and anyone who has
ever sinned in his life cannot be without sin in the same sense as mary
was sinless.

as a catholic , i too find certain of the dogmas tough to embrace. but
that 's where the catholic faith and prayer come into play. i pray god
to strengthen my will to accept the faith given the bride of christ ,
which in turn usually strengthens my community faith in his church. and ,
as you probably know , faith in christ 's church is tantamount to faith in
christ inasmuch as the church is christ 's mystical body. a catholic by
nature must have two aspects to his faith in christ (1) a personal faith in
christ as his own personal redeemer and (2) a community faith in the church
as the body of christ.

i am not against capital punishment. i feel this way because god is not
only a god of love , but a god of justice. as we christians are the
instruments of his will here on earth , we are expected to be true to the
mandate given us by the lord to judge the actions of our fellow man.

my favorite scriptural reference in this regard is romans 13 1 7.

let every person be subordinate to the higher authorities , for
there is no authority except from god , and those that exist have
been established by god. therefore , whoever resists authority
opposes what god has appointed , and those who oppose it will
bring judgment upon themselves.

my views reflect the teaching of the roman catholic church.

i would say only to the extent that the roman catholic church
neither approves nor disapproves of capital punishment , as
confirmed in the recent catechism , though there are many rcs
who were rather surprised and upset that capital punishment was
not explicitly condemned.

for myself , as a catholic , i see my own opposition to capital
punishment as much the same as my opposition to abortion a
reverence for life. here in the uk , the anti abortion case is
often let down by the explicit link which those on the
political left make with anti abortionists and
pro executionists. there is a tendency to condemn people who
hold both views as hypocrites. i feel that if there were many
more anti abortionists who were also vocal in their opposition
to capital punishment on a pro life line , it would end this
kneejerk association of anti abortion as a right wing thing ,
and get many to think seriously about the issue (there are
plenty who are pro abortion equally for a kneejerk left wing
reason).

i do not think your biblical quote can automatically be taken
as support for capital punishment. i take it that as a roman
catholic you are opposed to abortion , and would still onsider
it wrong , and something to be objected to even if legalised by
authority .

subject re atheists and hell
lines 41

to summarize
while questioning the sagacity of someone who said they would
rather spend an eternity in hell than be beside god in heaven
knowing even one man would spend his eternal life being
scorched for his wrongdoings... i described how horrible hell
is and compared the above statement with jesus'
suffering on the cross in order to prevent people going to hell.

which kenneth engel challenges
did this happen to jesus \? i do n't think so , not from what i heard.
he lived one day of suffering and died. if the wages of sin is
the above paragraph , then jesus didn't pay for our sins , did he \?

i will wimp out and admit that i never liked the metaphor of
jesus paying for our sins in the sense that many christians
accept as literal. the point is that god understands the suffering
we go through , not just intellectually like when we watch
the somalians on tv , but really understands , he can feel
our pain. this fact is manifested by jesus' life. we can argue
that someone in history might have suffered more than jesus ,
we can think of more horrible torture than crucifixion , we can
think of cases of betrayal and fruitless effort leading to
worse despair , but the main point is that jesus is in the
trenches with us , he is in everyone , whatever i do to the least
of humanity i do to him , and whatever i do for the least of
humanity i do for him.

now , to reconcile this with the existence of hell is beyond my
capabilities , but that was n't my goal.

i 'd be surprised to see the moderator let this one through ,

thankfully our moderator is surprising.

but i seriously want a reasonable explanation for this.

as i re read this i must admit that this is more of a description
of my faith than an explanation , but perhaps that 's all
i can do , hopefully that 's all i have to do.

as to why these early practices only parallel and do not exactly
duplicate the modern lds ceremony , there are a couple of reasons

1. quite likely we do not have the exact original from ancient
times. this stuff was not commonly known but bits and pieces
undoubtedly spread. (much as bits and pieces of the modern ceremony
get known.) what we have in the 40 day literature , the egyptian

dr. walter martin


dr. walter martin personally selected hank hanegraaff to succeed him
as president of the christian research institute the largest
evangelical counter cult organization in the world. in this skillful ,
careful treatment of an explosive subject , hanegraaff documents and
examines how the beliefs of the word of faith movement clearly
compromises and confuse the essentials of the historic christian
faith. for the first time ever , this large and influential movement
is legitimately labeled as cultic.

in this book , hanegraaff discusses such leaders of the word of faith
movement as e.w. kenyon and the twelve apostles of another gospel
(gal 1 6 9) (kenneth e. hagin , kenneth copeland , benny hinn , frederick
k.c. price , john avanzini , robert tilton , marilyn hickey , paul (david)
yonggi cho , charles capps , jerry savelle , morris cerullo , and paul and
jan crouch).

the book is now available through harvest house publishers and should
be in most christian book stores soon. you can order a hard back copy
through cri for 14.99 by calling 1 800 443 9797 and avoid retail
mark ups.

the christian research journal , which is a quarterly publication by cri
has an article in it 's most recent issue just released called , what 's
wrong with the word faith movement \? this is a good article that will
inform you of each of the teachers above , and tide you over until your
book arrives. if you are interested in receiving the journal yourself ,
you can order it from cri at the number above for 14 a year. it is the
best source of the most accurate and well researched info in christiandom
today.

hate the sin but love the sinner ...i 've heard that quite a bit recently ,
often in the context of discussions about christianity and homosexuality...
but the context really is n't that important. my question is whether that
statement is consistent with christianity. i would think not.

hate begets more hate , never love. consider some sin. i 'll leave it unnamed
since i do n't want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not
something is a sin. now lets apply our hate the sin... philosophy and see
what happens. if we truly hate the sin , then the more we see it , the
stronger our hatred of it will become. eventually this hate becomes so
strong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate
the sinner. in addition , our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and

that is an assumption on your part. where is your proof that one always will
degenerate into hating the sinner , because he hates the sin.

i am reminded of the civil rights movement in america. it is true that many
individuals hated the proponents of racism. it is also true that many
individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and
never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it. dr. king 's
message was this. love the individual , the loving of the individual would
transform him into a friend. however , this did not take away his hatred for
segregation. his hatred for injustice.


in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our
neighbors. he does n't say anything about hate. in fact , if anything , he
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. so , how are christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others \? i suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. we
need to ask god to help us with our own sin , and to help those we love
with theirs. only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. the best way to
love someone is to pray for them.

i would ask , did john the baptist practice love when he criticized the jewish
leaders of his day \? did jesus practice love when he threw the moneychangers
out of the temple \?

we must have at least a distase for sin. we must in order to fight it in
ourselves. also we must be ready for the call from god to call sin by its
right name. jesus loved everyone , but he called sin by its right name.

it is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk , but it is
also true that sometimes the love for god calls us to stand up for truth.

subject baptism requires faith
organization massachusetts institute of technology
lines 144

it troubles me that there have been so many posts recently trying to support
the doctrine of original sin. this is primarily a catholic doctrine , with no
other purpose than to defend the idea of infant baptism. even among , its
supporters , however , people will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants
will go to hell.

it 's very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of
scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine. however , if we have the
heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically
based , then we can come to an understanding of the truth. let 's now take a
more complete look at scripture.

colossians 2 11 12 in him you were also circumcised , in the putting off of
the sinful nature , not with a circumcision done by christ , having been
buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the
power of god , who raised him from the dead.

in baptism , we are raised to a new life in christ (romans 6 4) through a
personal faith in the power of god. our parent 's faith cannot do this. do
infants have faith \? let 's look at what the bible has to say about it.

romans 10 16 17 but not all the israelites accepted the good news. for
isaiah says , 'lord , who has believed our message \? ' consequently , faith
comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word
of christ.

so then we receive god 's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel. faith is a possible response to hearing god 's word preached. kids
are not yet spiritually , intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to
respond to god 's word. hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life.

ezekiel 18 20 the soul who sins will die. the son will not share the
guilt of the father , nor will the father share the guilt of the son. the
righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him , and the
wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.

if you read all of ezekiel 18 , you will see that god does n't hold us guilty
for anyone else 's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam.

ezekiel 18 31 32 rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted ,
and get a new heart and a new spirit. why will you die , o house of israel \?
for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone , declares the sovereign lord.
repent and live !

the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit. kids
cannot do this. acts 2 38 39 says that when we repent and are baptized , we
will then receive a new spirit , the holy spirit. then we shall live.

now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is
not biblical , let 's look at some of the scriptures used to support it.

romans 5 12 therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and
death through sin , and in this way death came to all men , because all
sinned

sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned. death came to
each man because each man sinned. note that it 's good to read through all
of romans 5 12 21. some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than
others , but if we read them in context we will see that they are all
saying basically the same thing. let 's look at one such.

romans 5 19 for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many
were made sinners , so also through the obedience of the one man the many
will be made righteous.

through the disobedience of each individual , each was made a sinner. in
the same way , through the obedience of jesus , each will be made righteous.
we must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each
man only because each man sinned , not because of guilt from adam.
otherwise the bible would contradict itself. i encourage you to read
through this whole passage on your own , looking at it from this point of
view to see if it does n't all fit together.

psalm 51 5 surely i was sinful at birth , sinful from the time my mother
conceived me.

this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves
before god in repentance for sinning. david himself was a man after god 's
own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and
murdering her husband. all that david is saying here is that he ca n't
remember a time when he was n't sinful. he is humbling himself before god
by confessing his sinfulness. his saying that he was sinful at birth is
a hyperbole. the bible , being inspired by god , is n't limited to a literal
interpetation , but also uses figures of speech as did jesus (john 16 25).
for another example of hyperbole , see luke 14 26.

now then , even though people see that baptism requires faith and that
original sin is not biblical , they will still argue that infant baptism is
necessary because children sin by being selfish not sharing toys with
other children , by being mean hitting others and fighting , etc.

certainly we have observed children doing wrong things , but my gut feeling
is always that they do n't know any better. let 's look to see if the bible
agrees with my gut feelings.

isaiah 7 14 15 therefore the lord himself will give you a sign the
virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son , and will call him
immanuel. he will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the
wrong and choose the right.

now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy
about jesus. if they do n't , then point them to matthew 1 23 and find a new
leader. jesus certainly could n't have had less knowledge than normal human
babies. yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent
before he would know the difference between right and wrong. we see that
he did grow and become wiser in luke 2 40 and 2 52. the implication is
that jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over
wrong. since we know that jesus was perfect without sin , we have rather
conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they do n't know to choose
the right instead of the wrong.

jesus himself was baptized , albeit with john 's baptism , not as an infant ,
but as a thirty year old man (luke 3 21 23) and started his ministry as
soon as he was baptized (luke 3 23). immediately afterwards , he was
tempted by the devil (luke 4 1 13 matthew 4 1 11 mark 1 12 13).

i think you 're overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of
your response. first , original sin is not a catholic only doctrine.
it was held by luther and calvin as well , and is still present in one
form or another in the lutheran and reformed traditions. second ,
saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is
an ad hominem argument , which has considerable evidence against it.
the original baptist theology included original sin , and some baptists
still hold it. and there are certainly groups that baptize infants
without believing in original sin. among protestants , the sacraments
tend to be a bit more symbolic than among catholics. protestants who
baptize infants see baptism as a sign of god 's acceptance of us ,
rather than our acceptance of god. in traditional protestant
theology , god 's grace precedes our response , and is applicable to
children. there are a number of passages one can cite to indicate
that god accepts even children. clh

the god of both testaments are one and the same , and in
neither is there evidence god is strictly love.

to the people who wrote the bible and to whom the bible is written ,
there is evidence of love , but that is a cultural bias. this is
a poor answer which you need n't rebut.

i will now pull the old bait and switch.

i think you should use the bible to judge man , not god.
by that i mean , if your moral intuition does n't like what
is described in the bible , realize that such things are going on
now. i will avoid the semantic arguments about the cause of evil
and ask what are you doing to fight it \? not you specifically ,
but everyone , including myself. if i do n't like the genocide
in the bible , what about the genocide that goes on right now \?
to move beyond the question of a hell , realize that many people
right now are suffering. if you think hell is n't fair and are
willing to sacrifice everything just to deny its existence ,
what about how life is n't fair \? right now there is a young mother
with three little kids who does n't know how she will get through
the day. right now there is a sixth grader who is a junkie.
right now there is an old man with no friends and no money to
fix his tv. instead of why does n't god help them ask why do n't
we help them. i think you are correct to challenge any christian
who does n't live his life with the compassion you seem to possess.

you want evidence of god. find someone who is making a difference ,
someone you admire , someone who has been through some tough times
and has come out with his head up. ask the person how he does it. ask
the vietnam vet who was battle medic how he kept his mind. ask the
woman who was pregnant at 15 , kept the baby and now is a successful
business woman. ask the doctor who has operated on a 1 1 2 pound
baby. they wo n't all be christians , or even what you might
call religious , but there will be something in common.

god is not defined in the bible , god is defined by what is
in those people 's hearts. it does n't matter if you ca n't give
intellectual assent to any description you 've heard , they 're
all wrong anyway. the compassion you already feel in your heart
is a step in the right direction. follow that instead.
then come back and read the bible and you 'll see that same
thing described there.

if nothing else makes sense , hang on to that idea , that god is love.

i would say something similar , but in reverse order love
is god.

good , i guess we only have to work on your grammar. 8 )

i have enrolled in the history of christianity at a college here in
st. louis. the teacher of the class is what i consider to be
closed minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of
christianity is. his definition is tied directly to that of the
trinity and the catholic church 's definition of it and belief in
jesus christ is not sufficient to call one 's self a christian.

what you call the trinity and the catholic church 's definition
of it is precisely the result of the first christians getting
together and trying to find an acceptable answer to your
question what is a christian \? . i ca n't see what you are
objecting to someone is saying what historians of all beliefs
would agree on , and you are calling him a closed minded bigot \?

you really ought to say what you mean by belief in jesus
christ . it is not a wording that is sufficient to describe a
christian. muslims believe in jesus christ although they
believe he was a prophet and not the incarnated son of god. but
followers of eastern religions might be quite happy to say that
jesus was the incarnation of god along with large numbers of
other historical and mythical figures.

so perhaps you ought to rephrase your question and say
precisely what it is in the traditional definitions of what it
is to be a christian , as handed down by the universal church ,
you object to but regard as unnecessary for being a christian.

on the basis of these examples i would say that joe moore was only wrong
in claiming augustine as a prime mover of the sin sex view. these quotes
clearly equate sexuality with defilement and incontinance , even within
the marriage relationship (else they would not apply to mary after her marriage
to joseph).

so joe 's assignment of the reasoning behind the concept of the perpetual
virginity of mary does seem to be supported by these quotes.

if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why does n't the bible
ever say so. it never comes right and says only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.

this is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. it assumes that
if the bible does n't say specifically that you do n't need to do something ,
then that must mean that you do need to do it. i know there 's a specific
term for this form of logic , but it escapes me right now. however , if it
were sound , then you should be able to apply it this way if the bible
does n't specifically say that something is wrong , then it must be ok ,
which , coincidentally , leads perfectly into a question i 've often pondered.
if slavery is immoral (which i believe it is , can i assume that everyone
else in this group does too \? ) , why does n't jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it \? owning slaves was common practice back then. paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral. he apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. why
does n't anyone mention slavery \? if god 's morals are eternal and do n't
change like the morals of society , then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today.

(aaron bryce cardenas) writes

romans 10 16 17 but not all the israelites accepted the good news. for
isaiah says , 'lord , who has believed our message \? ' consequently , faith
comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word
of christ.

so then we receive god 's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel. faith is a possible response to hearing god 's word preached. kids
are not yet spiritually , intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to
respond to god 's word. hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life.

catholics view the effects of baptism slightly differently , and that 's
one primary reason why they baptize babies. they believe that baptism
produces a change in the soul of the baby , quite independently of any
volitional act on the part of the baby. this change in the baby 's
soul gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have
without baptism. since the infant does not have the use of his
intellect and will yet , these new faculties are dormant. but as the
child gets older , the gifts of baptism come more and more into play.

ezekiel 18 20 the soul who sins will die. the son will not share the
guilt of the father , nor will the father share the guilt of the son. the
righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him , and the
wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him.

if you read all of ezekiel 18 , you will see that god does n't hold us guilty
for anyone else 's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam.

adam was given a number of gifts by god. the chief among them was
what catholics call sanctifying grace . (in the new testament , the
word used for this is charity .) by his sin , adam lost this grace.
he did n't lose it just for himself , however , he lost it for the whole
human race. because once he lost it , he could n't pass it on to his
descendents.

that 's why catholics baptize babies. through his original sin , adam
lost sanctifying grace for all his descendents. christ instituted
baptism to give it back to everyone.

babies are not being punished for anything they personally did they
are simply lacking in something they need , in order to enter heaven.

dhammers@pacific. \? (david hammerslag) writes

this paragraph brought to mind a question. how do you (mormons) reconcile
the idea of eternal marriage with christ 's statement that in the ressurection
people will neither marry nor be given in marriage (luke , chapt. 20) \?

here is the short answer because only
certain marriages are recorded in heaven.

now for the long answer

in doctrine and covenants section 132 , the
chapter discussing eternal marriage (and , yes ,
plural marriage) , the distinction between
sealings under the priesthood and other
marriages is revealed.

when the children of this world marry , or are
given in marriage when they receive the
resurrection from the dead , neither marry , nor are
given in marriage (luke 20 34 35).
jesus was simply teaching that marriages until
death do you part are not in force after death.

however , the doctrine and covenants continues
describing eternal marriage.

d c 132 19
and again , verily i say unto you , if a
man marry a wife by my word , which is my law , and
by the new and everlasting covenant , and it is
sealed unto them by the holy spirit of promise ,
by him who is anointed this power and the keys
of this priesthood ... shortened for brevity ai
and shall be of full force when they are out of
the world and they shall pass by the angels ,
and the gods , which are set there , to their
exhaltation and glory in all things , as hath been
sealed upon their heads , which glory shall be a
fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever
and ever.

the lord told peter whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth shall be bound in heaven (matt 16 19).
do you doubt that peter was given the power to
perform sealings \?
peter thought so because he taught that husbands
and wives were heirs together of the grace of
life (1 peter 3 7).

in order to obtain the highest (degree of
celestial glory) , a man must enter into this
order of the priesthood (d c 131 2).
when a man and wife are sealed they truly become
one flesh because their eternal increase
(destinies) are enjoined completely.

our father has an eternal companion (and maybe
more because of the plural marriage conditions
of the law) who participated in our creation
and is equally concerned with our progress here.

there is no scriptural basis for this doctrine.
if fact , the only mention of our mother is in
one verse of a hymn written early in the history
of the church

o my father

i had learned to call thee father ,
through thy spirit from on high ,
but , until the key of knowledge
was restored , i knew not why.
in the heav'ns are parents single \?
no , the thought makes reason stare !
truth is reason truth eternal
tells me i 've a mother there.

why do n't we hear more about our mother \?

1. because our father presides under priesthood
authority (which is not a calling for her)

2. because we do n't all (necessarily) have the
same mother it would be confusing for worship

3. because our father wishes to withhold her
name and titles because of how some people
degrade sacred things.

however greatly we extoll mary , it is quite obvious that she is in no
way god or even part of god or equal to god. the assumption of our

redemptive work of christ , she was assumed (note that she did not
ascend) body and soul into heaven , and is thus one of the few , along
with elijah , enoch , moses (maybe \? \? \? \? ) who are already perfected in
heaven. obviously , the virgin mary is far superior in glorification to
any of the previously mentioned personages.


as i said , it is a provocative thought.

from answer to job

the logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed
and it leaves protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a
man 's religion which allows no metaphysical representation of woman.
...protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the
signs of the times which point to the equality of women. but this
equality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a
divine woman , the bride of christ. just as the person of christ
cannot be replaced by an organization , so the bride cannot be re
placed by the church. the feminine , like the masculine , demands an
equally personal representation.
the dogmatizing of the assumption does not , however , according
to the dogmatic view , mean that mary has attained the status of a
goddess , although , as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix , she is
functionally on a par with christ , the king and mediator. at any
rate , her position satisfies the need of the archetype. par. 753 4


jung should stick to psychology rather than getting into theology.

jung made it clear that he was talking about psychology , not theology. his
comments had to do with the psychological image of god and its function
in the human psyche , not about the actual existence or nature of god.

there is no doubt that we have here two editions of the same
text and as that of de sacramentis is localised in upper italy
and dated about the year 400 , it is the most ancient witness we
possess as to the principal parts of the roman canon , which only
appear in the sacramentaries some time after the seventh
century. the question as to whether the roman canon is not older
even than that of de sacramentis is discussed by
liturgiologists. mgr. batiffol is of this opinion , but we , on
the contrary , think that the former bears traces of closer
composition , of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy , and that
consequently it is a text corrected from de sacramentis. we
shall see , in studying the list of names in the memento of the
living and that of the dead , that mgr. batiffol argues with good
reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of
symmachus (498 514). we thus have the state of the roman mass ,
or at least of the chief parts of the canon , at the beginning of
the fourth century.

does n't know anything about christianity \? \? \? \? in my (albeit limited)
experience atheists are often the ones who know more about the
bible , having searched it from end to end for answers. i myself am a
christian , but that does n't mean i consider myself more of an
authority on my religion i just have a different perspective on it
(more biased in favor , naturally ) ).

it seems quite obvious why he is subscribed , if i may infer from what
he says he is looking for an explanation. who are we to question his
motives anyway at the very least (although i dislike this kind of
logic) , one could hope that he will see the light . critcism will , i
fear , not give him a very positive picture of christians....

bob reminds me of my roommate. in order to disbelieve atheism , he says
he will need to be proven wrong about it. well , i do n't even waste
my time trying. i tell him that he 'll just have to take my word for it.
in response , he tells me he will say an atheist 's prayer for me.

with regard to this , i guess i do n't really feel sentiments of this
order can be proven faith has a lot to do with it. this is why
those who search the bible from cover to cover for answers wo n't
necessarily get what they 're looking for. of course that does n't help
anyone who does n't already have faith what a big catch 22. i
discovered this quite recently when i ran into an agnostic looking for an
explanation of my faith and i quickly discovered that i could give him
nothing more than my life story and a description of my nature. faith
is a very personal thing any attempt to prove the facts behind
it must be questioned.

good luck , bob. and , best regards.

likewise no matter what you believe.

...

sac also , we know that
sac the bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven.

where exactly does it say that \?

sac everyone includes infants , unless there is other scripture to the
sac contrary , i.e. an exception. since there is no exception listed in the
sac bible , we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the bible means what
sac it says , that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven.

i think we do see an exception in the case of cornelius and his
household , mentioned in acts. of course , they were baptised , but only
after god showed that he accepted them by giving them the holy
spirit . this means they were already acceptable to god before their
baptism , and had they suddenly died they would have gone to heaven.

in case that seems far fetched an ancestor of mine was a missionary
who worked among the hereros in namibia. some of the tribesmen were
jealous of christianity , and they poisoned the first convert before he
could be baptised. surely he still went to heaven \? i'm inclined to
agree with a comment recorded at the time it is not the neglect of
baptism , but its contempt , that condemns.

i hate to sound flippant , having shot off my mouth badly on the net
before , but i'm afraid that much of this material only adds to my
feeling that the assumption of mary would be better phrased our
assumptions about mary. in all the time i 've been reading about
mary on this group , i can not recall reading much about mary that
did not sound like wishful veneration with scant , if any , scriptural
foundation.

i find in the new testament a very real portrait of christ 's parents
as compellingly human persons to be honored and admired for their
humility and submission to god 's working , beyond doubt. but the almalga
mation of theories and dogma that has accreted around them gives me
an image of alien and inhuman creatures , untouched by sin or human
desire. only christ himself was so truly sanctified , and even he knew
temptation , albeit without submitting to it.

i also do n't see the necessity of saying the holy parents were some
how sanctified beyond normal humanity it sounds like our own inability
to grasp the immensity of god 's grace in being incarnated through an or
dinary human being.

i wo n't start yelling about how people are worshipping mary , etc. ,
since folks have told me otherwise about that , but i do think we
lose part of the wonder of god 's incarnation in christ when we make
his parents out to be sinless , sexless , deathless , otherworldly beings.

you did a wonderful job of not doing anything humany possible to
offend us catholics hopefully i can be just as careful in my wording as you
were.
i also do n't want to extend this topic into an entire major issue of
debate (anymore than it already is) , but just a note or two

1. please do n't talk about jesus' parents the doctrinal positions
of the church an unequivocally different regarding mary and
joseph. i (personally) have never heard of anything being
attributed to st. joseph other than his sainthood that is ,
no reference ever to him being sinless , assumed into heaven ,
immaculately conceived , etc. all these ideas apply only to
mary.

2. i would agree there is very little scriptural evidence for our
doctrines about mary. needless to say , that presents a
significant problem to those who accept the bible as the only
source of doctrine. if , however , one turns to the sacred
traditions of the undivided christian church , there is no
problem finding plently of evidence that it was basically a
unanimous belief among the apostles and all the early
generation that mary was assumed into heaven , body and soul ,
etc. etc. it was n't until the reformation that these doctrines
were called into question. as far as i am concerned (again , my
personaly feelings) if it 's a choice between the apostles or
luther , i 'll choose the apostles every time , whether or not
it is recorded within the writings that the traditions of men
have determined to be the bible .

like a said , just a couple of notes. as is often said , i believe that
we must agree to (politely) disagree.
may god 's peace and blessings be with you always in your search to
discover his absolute truth.

ok , what 's more important to gay christians \? sex , or christianity \?

i'm afraid i see that question as very tendentious. try rephrasing it

what 's more important to christians \? love of god or love
of other human beings \?

to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like
the other. i am deeply suspicious of any flavor of christianity
which would elevate one clause of the great commandment to a priority
over the other such as to claim a conflict. true , we are told to let
the dead bury the dead , to hate family rather than let it keep us from
following christ. but the dichotomy here is not one between love of our
fellows and love of god , but of allowing social constructs to blind us
to the presense of god. it is particularly satanic to twist love of god
in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different
level than the one who is so caught up in love of god.

the trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex. yes , it
has sometimes been the case that the church has taught that all sex
was nasty , evil , sinful stuff. but when man and wife leave their parental
homes to become helpmates , living in one flesh , it is the sex that is the
vehicle of becoming one flesh (if you doubt me , read st. paul on what
is wrong with frequenting prostitutes )). less provocatively , what i
mean is just this sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social
interaction , and in particular is the foundation of the institution of
marriage , so that unlike with many mammals , human males remain with and
foster the children they beget and support their children 's mothers.
this is the schema behind genesis 2 18 24 (and behind jesus' citation of
that passage.)

i observe , by the way , that not all human males in fact do as
i have just described but another thing that characterizes
human societies is our raising of non begotten children , not
only orphans and adoptees and the like , but products of the
quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. we are
in this not unique in the animal world , but the full extent of
social consequences and implications is most intricate for us.

yes , of course it sometimes goes wrong like all else we do , it is
infected with sin , and you find married couples where there is no bond ,
and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond
formation (the infatuation , falling in love phase) that they break
any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep
unity god has prepared for us , and stepping back out again right away.
satan may indeed use sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love
but in the edenic creation , that is not its nature , and with god 's grace
under the power of christ to make all things new it need not be a problem
for christians (though we must be vigilant , even in christ , as the devil
is watchful , prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)

so , returning to the original question , what is more important to straight
christians \? sex , or christianity \? paul , clearly , tended to think that
sex was at best a distraction from christianity (though to be charitable
to him , his context was in expectation of immediate parousia , so that the
hard tasks of a married union the lifelong building and adaptation to
each other seemed somehow to undercut the proper preparation for an
immediate eschaton. since we do not know the hour of return , we should
act both with instant readiness for that and with a commitiment to our
mates that proposes a long lifetime together. and telling people not to
bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause
of the the commandment to love. i would claim that only a very few saints
have the capacity to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication ,
mind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual
life in married union growing together as one flesh and that means in
the type case , with a persistent and continued sexual relationship. we
are human , and little good comes of trying to mortify the flesh to the
point of pretending to be otherwise , pretending not to be sexual beings.

christianity i would hope. would they be willing to forgo sex
completely , in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others ,

it depends entirely on context. if that context is major hypocrisy
on the part of those who find us stumbling blocks i am much less of
a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about my sins.

there are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift ,
and maybe even a victory against a to them troubling sexual urge that
seems to them to lead only to sin. nothing i say should ever be read
as demeaning such a gift. nor the even rarer gift of love for all our
conspecifics , and indeed for all god 's creation , that can develop to
the full without the tutoring of a spousal helpmate marriage founded
in sex. but there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance
telling people that they have to have a particular gift (or else \? what \? )
is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our
spiritual endowments from god. to one person is given the gift of
speaking in toungues , to another intepretation of toungues to yet
another prophecy and to still another teaching. the notion that some
particular gift is required of all is one of the earliest heresies.

baptisms draw parents' ire children at church carnival in springs
told they 'd be killed by bee stings if they did n't submit to religious
rite.

by dick foster rocky mountain news southern bureau

colorado springs outraged parents say their children were lured to
a church carnival and then baptixed without their permission by a
baptist minister.

doxens of children , some as young as 8 years old and unaccompanied by
their parents , thought they were going to a carnival at the
cornerstone baptist church , where there would be a big water fight ,
free balloons , squirt guns and candy.

before that may 1 carnival was over , however , children were whisked
into a room for religious instruction and told they should be
baptized. in many cases they consented , although they or their
families are not of the baptist faith.

the baptisms by the church have angered many parents , including
paulette lamontagne , a methodist and mother of twin 8 year old girls
who were baptized without her knowledge or consent.

'my understnading was they were going to a carnival. i feel that 's a
false pretense , ' said lamontagne. her daughters said the minister
told them they would be killed by bee stings if they were not
baptized.

cornerstone church officials defended their actions.

'we take our instructions from the word of god and god has commanded
us to baptize converts. no one can show me one passage in the bible
where it says that parental permission is required before a child is
baptized , ' said dan irwin , associate pastor of the cornerstone baptist
church.

church officials did not tell parents their children would be baptized
because 'they did n't ask , ' irwin said.

many other parents also felt they were simply sending their children
to a carnival at the invitation of their children 's friends who were
members of the cornerstone church.

police said chhurch officials had broken on laws in baptizing the
children , but indicated the parents could pursue civil action.


are n't these the same behaviors we condemn
in the hari krishnas and other cults \?

i think the issues are more complex than the newspaper account
mentions. first , i'm not entirely sure that parental consent is
absolutely required. this would be extremely difficult , because of
the clear commandment to obey parents. but if an older child insisted
on being baptized without their parents' consent , i might be willing
to do it. however this would be a serious step , and would warrant
much careful discussion. the problem i find here is not so much
parental consent as that there was nobody 's consent. whether you
believe in infant baptism or not , baptism is supposed to be the sign
of entry into a christian community. if there is n't a commitment from
somebody , whether parent or child , and no intent to become part of
the church , the baptism appears to be a lie. furthermore , it is
likely to raise serious practical problems. what if the child is from
a baptist tradition \? normally when he reaches the age of decision , he
would be expected to make a decision and be baptized. but he already
has been , by a church claiming to be a baptist church. so does he get
rebaptized \? neither answer is really very good. if not , he 's being
robbed of an experience that should be very significant to his faith.

i am becoming increasingly convinced that most of us take paul 's illustration
about one body many parts far too narrowly. it is easy to say that the one
body represents a particular sect of christianity (generally our own) , and
the parts are clearly the various offices of ministry. there is a place for
that. but having met people who are walking closeely with god in a wide
variety of doctine catholic , protestant , liberal , conservative , orthodox ,
etc. i am willing to encompass a wide spectrum of views within the
context of the 'body of christ.' and i am equally sure that one day , after
we shug off this mortal coil , when we no longer see through a glass darkly
but see clearly , face to face , we will all be ashamed at some of the things
we held as truth. we ought all fellowship , worship , and serve where we are
called , and understand that where we are called may not be where everyone
else is called.

one of the fathers of the reformation (help me out ca n't recall the name)
put it quite succiently

in essentials , unity.
in nonessentials , liberty.
in all things , charity.

while i agree with lewis (mere christianity) that calling oneself a christian
implies some basic , fundamental standards of belief if the word is to mean
anything at all , i think most of us define the bounds of essentials a bit
too broadly , deny the place for liberty in questionable issues near those
bounds , and ignore the requirements of charity all together.

pre mill , and evangelical. but , i'm not ready to damn those who use icons ,
say mass in latin , uphold the virgin mary (though i really do n't believe
that she was sinless) , vote on church membership , or insist on baptism for
salvation. of course , i think my doctine is pretty close to the truth
why would i follow it if i believed something else was closer to the truth \?
but my understanding of the reality of a walk with christ is continually
evolving as i spend more and more time walking with him , studying his word ,
and fellowshiping with others in the (often extended) family.

in history seems to imply some pretty serious sin. the one of the
pastors in the church i attend , christchurch city elim , considers
that a prophesy of a natural disaster as a judgement from the lord
is a clear sign that the prophesy is not from the lord.

i would like to see his reasoning behind this. you may have gotten

if i get a chance i will ask them this weekend.

burned by natural disaster prophecies down there , but that
does not mean that every natural disaster judgement prophecy is
false. take a quick look at the book of jeremiah and it is obvious

that judgement prophecies can be valid. here in the us , it seems like
we might have more of a problem with positive prophecies , though i
am sure there may be a few people who are too into judgement.

the words i have underlined are at the heart of the problem. a quick
look does n't do justice to the depth of the book of jeremiah. having
studied the jeremiah ezekial period solidly for over a year at one
stage of my life , i have to say that there is a great deal of underlying
theological meaning in the judgement prophesies. let me make one point.
the clash between jeremiah and the false prophets was primarily in
the theological realm. the false prophets understood their relatioship
to god to be based on the covenant that the lord made with david. it is
possible to trace within the pages of the old testament who this covenant ,
which was initially conditional on the continued obedience of david 's
descendants , came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part
of the lord to keep a descendant of david 's upon the throne and to never
allow jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. jeremiah was not a
judahite prophet. he was from anathoth , across the border in what had formerly
been israelite territory. when he came to prophesy , he came from the
theological background of the covenant the lord had made with israel
through moses. the northern kingdom had rejected the davidic covenant
after the death of solomon. his theology clashed with the theology of the
local prophets. it was out of a very deep understanding of the mosaic
covenant and an actute awareness of international events that jeremiah
spoke his prophesies. the judgement prophesies were deeply loaded with
theological meaning.

in my opinion , both the portland earthquake prophesy and the david wilkerson
new york will burn prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic
theological depths of the jeremiah prophesies.

alan 2. we can also analyze to whom the lord is addressing marvel
alan not that i said unto thee , ye must be born again (john 3 7).
alan here jesus is clearly directing his remarks to nicodemus a
alan ruler of the jews (not a child).

yes , but jesus also made a very general and doctrinal statement
in the same conversation

flesh gives birth to flesh , but the spirit gives birth to spirit.
(john 3 6)

clearly infants are not born of the spirit. thus , without baptism
they are unspiritual. they are not born with the image of god , but in
adam 's fallen image (cf. gen 5 3). they have no righteousness of
their own , just as adults have no righteousness of their own. there
is only the imputed righteousness of christ , which believers receive
through faith.

alan 3. we can ask ourselves why the lord would even introduce the
alan concept of spiritual re birth through baptism if newborn babies
alan were n't free from sin \?

your point is a little obscure here , but i think you are saying
that christ used the innocence of newborn babes as a metaphor
for spiritual re birth. but this is not what he did.
if you look at the text , he did not speak
of spiritual re birth but of spiritual birth. we are
born of the spirit once , not twice or several times.
we are also born of the flesh once. the lord makes it
clear that these are separate and different events.
it is true that other scriptures refer to spiritual
birth as re birth because it is a second birth
(for example , titus 3 5). but it is not a second
spiritual birth.

the only thing the two births have in common is the concept of birth ,
which is used as a symbol of `new life' not of innocence. when an
infant is born (or conceived) a new life is begun but it is neither
innocent nor righteous. similarly when that same individual is
baptized , or perhaps when they believe prior to baptism , they begin a
new life in christ (romans 6 3 , colossians 2 12 , titus 3 5 , ephesians
2 5). then the believer has god 's assurance of the forgiveness of
their sins , and of christ 's imputed righteousness.

seeing as how the two babylons has been brought up again ,
its scholarship is phony and its assertions spurious.

c. wingate

maybe you should dig a little further charles. hislop 's scholarship was
accepted by the bristish oriental institute which , at the time , was the premere
institute for oriental studies. as i 've stated over and over , i 've checked
out about 25 of his references (most are now out of print or in private
libraries) and the likes of wilkerson and layard hold their own merit. they
too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself , you will
find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed. both were
highly honored by the british oriental museum. wilkerson is known as one of
the leading archeologist in the history of egyptiology and layard is still
being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the mesopotamian regions. he
was recently refered to in a time article on babylonian archeology.

phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have
misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions. hislop did not. his conclusions
do not tickle the ears , that much is self evident. but to assert that his
conclusions are spurious is without merit. he gave references to all his
conclusions and as i have stated , for the last 25 years i have used his
conclusions in debates at rc seminaries and brotherhoods , not to mention the
individual priests and bishops that i have talked to one on one. no counter to
hislops scholarship was made. the only rebuttals were against his conclusions
because they do totally undermined the claims of the rcc. he was showing that
the intitution of the rcc was based on the mysteries (which others have shown
even to this day in various articles and topics). the tongues movement in
corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church. if it
was so in corinth , why could they not have an influence in rome , the city of
seven hills \?

also , you do not have to listen to his conclusions , you can draw your own
conclusions by looking at the customs , artifacts , the cerimonial dress , the
docrine of purgatory , etc from the vantage of the mysteries. you do n't even
have to be a believer to see the parallels. just one example. the mitre.
where did it come from \? why is it shaped the way it is \? what are the two
tails that hang down the back represent \? was this an ancient head dress from
an earlier culture and why was it in rome at the time of the beginnings of the
church of the state of rome \? does it have pagan history behind it , and if so ,
why did the rcc chose regardless \?

any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions. even the
scriptures themselves refer to it. all hislop did was collect the information
from all the various sources and put them in one binding. there is no lack of
scholorship in that.

please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation , yet present no
evidence supporting it.

bible verses ag. used ag. homosexuality deleted

anyone who thinks being gay and christianity are not compatible should
check out dignity , integrity , more light presbyterian churches , affirmation ,
mcc churches , etc. meet some gay christians , find out who they are , pray
with them , discuss scripture with them , and only then form your opinion.

also check out the episcopal church although by no means all
episcopalians are sympathetic to homosexual men and women , there
certainly is a fairly large percentage (in my experience) who are. i
am good friends with an episcopalian minister who is ordained and
living in a monogamous homosexual relationship. this in no way
diminishes his ability to minister in fact he has a very
significant ministry with the gay and lesbian association of his
community , as well as a very significant aids ministry.

my uncle is gay and when i found this out i had a good long think
about what the bible has to say about this and what i feel god thinks
about this. obviously my conclusions may be wrong nonetheless they
are my own and they feel right to me. i believe that the one
important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament
passages cited above did not know was that there is scientific
evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent
rather than completely learned. this means that to a certain extent
or to a great extent homosexuals cannot choose how to feel about
other people which is why reports of curing homosexuals always
chill me and make me feel ill. please not that , although i ca n't cite
sources where you can find this information , there is homosexual
behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals , which is in itself
suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned , or at least that
the word unnatural should n't really apply....

please remember that whatever you believe , gays and lesbians shoul not
be excluded from your love and acceptance. christ loved us all , and
we all sin. and he himself never said anything against homosexuals
rather it is paul (who also came out with such wonderful wisdom as
women should n't speak in church and women should keep their heads
covered in church not exact quotations as i do n't have my bible
handy) who says these things. i have a tendency to take some of the
things paul says with a grain of salt....

well , i was certainly turned off by that first paragraph of oft used
platitudes. i ca n't count the times i 've heard those common tactics
anymore...'you may not believe it but that does n't change the fact
that it 's true'...the old analogy about trusting your parents...sheesh.
need i point out how parents can show children that they are right \?
that difference in capability alone crushes that analogy , as any 'facts'
about christianity i have seen turned out to be beliefs. what i seek is
fact knowledge if i can get it , and evidence for a belief if i ca n't.
so far from christians i have received neither...

before becoming a christian i too had problems when i asked one to explain
it to me...the actual evidence is not always what you see on a person 's
outside. it should be but is not always.
a very specific , somewhat miraculous example of the truth of god
working to help his followers is soemthing that happened to me. for nearly
4 years after an accident i had severe complications from a triple
fracture in my left leg and surgery pins put in , then removed. the bone
itself was perfectly healed. no infectoin that could be detected. yet i
was in constant pain and it my ankle and foot were always swollen and
bluish. more complicatios developed in my other leg , none of which could
be explained by the best specialists and most sophisticated tests in te
northern illinois region. we went everywhere no one could explain it.
durin gthat summer (june 19 , 1991 to be exact) i gave my life and heart
to christ and vowed to relinquish control over my life (which i never
really had anyway) because of what he did for me on the cross and the
fact that my whole life was screwed up by me trying to fix it. i was facing
the possibility of a lifetime in a wheelchair (i was confined to one in
order to save my legs from any further damage since the cause of my problems
were unknown , had been in it for about 2 1 2 months before that day).
i found it ore than coincidental that less than 2 weeks after
i put my faith where my mouth was , one more in the long line of doctors
and not even an orthopeodic specialist , diagnosed my problems with no
difficulty , set me on the path to an effective cure , and i was walking
and running again without the pain that had stopped me from that for
4 years. the diagnosis was something he felt the other doctors must have
overlooked because it was perfectly obvious from my test results.
maybe this does n't hit you as miraculous. but to me it really
is. imagine an active 17 year old being told she may not be able to
walk mcuh longer...and is now a happy 18 year old who can dance and run
knowing that the problem was there all along and was revealed just
after she did what she knew was right. as the song says...
our god is an awesome god....

the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free
will in any way. since god knows everything , he therefore knows
everything that is going to happen to us. we have free will , and
are able to change what happens to us. however , since god knows
everything , he knows all the choices we will make in advance (god
is not subject to time). too often arguments pit predestination
against free will. we believe in both.

that last sentence of steve 's is an important one to remember.

there are certain things in the catholic religion that cannot be
completely comprehended by a human being. were this not the case , it
would be good evidence that the religion was man made.

in the case of predestination , you have to reconcile two things that
would at first appear to be irreconcilable the sovereignty of god 's
will over all things , and man 's free will in deciding his own fate.
catholics believe in both ! but that does n't mean that anyone has come
up with a pat reconciliation...

i have often thought that goedel 's famous theorem has applicability to
catholic dogma , at least in an analogous sense there are things that
are true that cannot be proved. god 's intellect is far above ours.
there are many truths that we will never be able to understand.

regarding the new draft of the universal catechism

in procuring the common good of society the need could arise
that the aggressor be placed in the position where he cannot

public authorities to punish with proportionate penalties ,
including the death penalty , is acknowledged. ...
... to the degree that means other than the death
penalty and military operations are sufficient to keep the
peace , then these non violent provisions are to be preferred
because they are more in proportion and in keeping with the
final goal of protection of peace and human dignity.

exactly ! ! read that one sentence in there... to the degree
that means other than the death penalty and military operations are
sufficient to keep the peace , then these non violent provisions are to
be preferred...

i do n't believe that it is necessary for us to murder criminals to keep
the peace the church in the united states feels the same way , thus the
reason that the catholic church has opposed every execution in this
country in recent memory.

as is clearly shown by this excerpt , the church 's teaching on capital
punishment remains today as it has always been in the past in total
accord with my sentiment that i do not disagree with the use of deadly
force in those cases for which this option is justifiable.

so what is justifiable \? as you stated very explicitly from the new
catechism , the only justifiable case is when it is necessary to keep
the peace. since that does not apply at all to this country , the
logical conclusion (based on your own premises) is that one must be
opposed to any form of capital punishment in america.

dear fellow christians ,

i had a dinner last night with a bible study group which
i am in. we had a discussion about the difference between christianity
and islam. and i was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher
said that mohammad was indeed a prophet but of satan. i said , what \? \?
i did not believe that , because i have some moslem friends who are
so kind and nice , even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them
(in my point of view , they do n't sin as much as i do). how come if they
were under satan , they could have such personalities.

to tell you the truth , i do n't know much about islam.
but i know that they believe in god , they believe in the day of
judgement.

now i'm asking you what your opinions about islam and
its teaching.

important i do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not.
i do not want to discuss about politic related to islam.

p.s i post this in bit.listserv.christia , soc.religion.christian ,
and bit.listserv.catholic.

tabut torsina
torsina@enuxhb.eas.asu.edu

let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a
discussion of islam , since there 's a group for that. but i suspect
the point your teacher was making was not specifically about islam.
indeed it 's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at
within your groundrules , since the question of whether non christians
are saved is at the heart of it.

the classic christian view , which i think most people believed until
the last century or so , was that christianity (and of course judaism)
was the only religion founded by god , and that all other religions
worshipped false gods , and came from satan. this is more or less a
corollary of another traditional view that no one but christians (and
possibly jews) will be saved. this need not mean that there 's no
truth in any other religion , nor that all of their members are
intentionally satanic. after all , in order to be an effective snare ,
satanic alternatives would have to be attractive. thus they might
contain all kinds of truth , wisdom and spiritual insights. they would
be missing only one thing knowledge of salvation through christ.
if this is the background of your teacher 's remarks and i suspect
it is that means that a discussion of islam is not necessarily
relevant. the point is not that there 's anything intrinsically wrong
with it. it may teach a fine code of behavior , and its practitioners
may all be wonderful people. but if salvation requires being a
follower of christ , it could still be a satanic invention.

this is a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position.
christianity says that salvation is n't a matter of being kind and
nice. those are good things , and we should encourage them. but no
one is able to do them enough to be saved. salvation requires christ.
(please forgive me for doing this in protestant terms. there 's a
catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications , but in
different terms.) a religion may be quite attractive in all visible
ways. but if it does n't have christ , it 's like a diet that consists
of food that looks wonderful , tastes great , but is missing some
essential food element so that you end up dying.

let me be clear that i am not specifically advocating this position.
what i'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues. indeed it is
now relatively uncommon for christians to believe that all other
religions are satanic. most christians regard such beliefs as an
unfortunate vestige of the past. this is part of a general move
within christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental
god. christians now find it hard to believe that god would allow
anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell , and they
find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at
work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive
alternatives to christianity. whether there is actually a sound basis
for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.

organization panix public access unix , nyc
lines 58

this might be better directed to s.r.c.bible study , which i have begun
reading , but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum , i will
conclude here as well. a week ago , i managed to find time to consult
a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatus at the library ,
and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek words for love as
used in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the
jewish scriptures.

the principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal
noun from erao , eraste s meaning lover. this cluster occurs just
where one might most expect it , in the propethic image (and accusation)
of israel as faithless spouse to yhwh. the verses in question are hosea
2 5 , 7 10 jeremiah 4 30 , 22 20 22 lamentations 1 19 and ezekiel
16 33 , 36 37 and 23 5 , 9 22.

hosea seems to have originated this usage , which jeremiah and
ezekiel picked up lamentations is dependent on , though not
likely written by , jeremiah.

the erotic meaning (in its allegorical use , not at all literally) is
evident. so too in english , unless you complement it with a phrase like
of the arts the word lover is going to have an overtone of sexual
relationship. there is no surprise here , but it is worthwhile to see
that standard greek usage does show up in the translations from the
hebrew ! )

more interestingly , and some confirmation of my guess that later koine
usage avoided the verb erao because of its homonymy to ero (say) ,
eromai (ask) , there is an error in codex vaticanus (normally , a very
valuable witness) where a form of erao is used in a completely absurd
context 2 samuel 20 18 , where the meaning must be say.

in addition to the above (and the uses i have already mentioned in proverbs) ,
esther 2 17 uses the verb in its most natural application ,

kai e rasthe ho basileus esthe r and the king loved esther

and , rather more interestingly , 1 samuel 19 2 supplies a modest degree of
support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan

kai io nathan huios saoul e i reito ton dauid sphodra
and jonathan , saul 's son , loved david intensely

i'm using the bracketed i for io ta subscript , which i
do n't yet have a reasonable ascii convention for.

(the relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about
the historical facts , but just that a quasi official translation of
the hebrew text in the hellenistic period makes no bones about using the
erotic verb in this context. given the quite general usage of agapao
for erotic senses , this need not mean anything more than agapao alone
would mean , but it does disambiguate the relationship , as far as this
translator goes ! )

poram@ihlpb.att.com wrote
lets talk about principles. if we accept that god sets the
standards for what ought to be included in scripture then we
can ask
1. is it authoritative \?

authoritative is not a quality of the writing itself it is a statement
by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative.

arguably , it is both. since authority is a matter of both
communicator and recepiant we can say that , for example jesus
is lord whether the world at large accepts the authority or
not. thus the bible can be considered for its authoritative
content whether or not it is accepted (this issue is at the
heart of pilate 's pragmatic question what is truth \? to jesus
when our lord was brought before him. jesus' reply was to appeal
to the authority of his father)
you also might like to consider the claimed authority
represented by the statements thus says the lord in the bible ,
which claim to put across the exact words of god.

you fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of
inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the community
of faith does something become truth because it is accepted \?
the main thrust of my argument is that there is a godward
direction as well as a manward (which is where the reference to
rev 22 came in.)

2. is it prophetic \?

how is prophecy to be defined \? if it is speaking forth of god 's message ,
much of the apocrypha must surely qualify.

if we narrowed it down to the predictive elements which will
cut out some of the 39 accepted ot books as well we
nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the
book jesus' standards were that scripture cannot be broken .
can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the apocrapha \?
(ie definitely fulfilled after it has been written)

3. is it authentic \?

again , by what standard \? is authenticity a function of the authors \? the
historical accuracy \?

does it have a subjective 'ring of truth' about it and does
other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the
authenticity \? (archaeological , other textual evidence for
example)

4. is it dynamic \?

what is this supposed to mean \? many of the apocryphal books are highly
dynamic thought provoking , faithful , even exciting.

what this is getting at is the relationship between text and
reader. it is to do with the quality of writing , which should
have the ability to fire the mind , affect our thought life and
cause us to act in a certain way there is something of this
in jesus' quote man does not live by bread alone , but by every
word that proceeds from the mouth of the lord . (matt 4.4)

5. is it received , collected , read and used \?

by whom \? of course the apocryphal books were received (by some) ,
collected (or else we would not have them) , read and used (and they still are ,
in the catholic and orthodox churches).

does the catholic church give the same authority to the
apocrapha as to the accepted 66 books \? certainly it is not as
widely used as the ot and nt.

on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god.

this is demonstrably false.

think about what i have said above. you may want to revise your
conclusion. in addition think about other 'sacred writings' , eg
the koran , the book of mormon and how and why you would
categorise them using the above principles. one word of caution
you may find some 'reflected glory' in some of these books in
that the 'inspired quality' may be derived from the bible.
remember that lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel
of light and quoting scripture.

to quote unger 's bible dictionary on the apocrapha
1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.

so do other books of the bible.

what were you thinking of \?

deletions

how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the
words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to
them , god will add to him the plagues described in this book.
and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy , god will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city (rev 22.18 9)
surely this sets the standard and not just man made traditions.

these words clearly were meant to refer to the book of revelation alone ,
not to the whole body of scripture. revelation itself was accepted very
late into the canon. the church simply did not see it as having a primary
role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.

we 've lost the point and the context here. i am not arguing that
the statement in rev. can be applied indescriminately , just that
the whole acceptance rejection idea does not just follow on from
man made traditions but there is i believe an act of god
involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as
scripture and comes under the definition of 2tim 3.16.

this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a
sharing on the johannine hours as proposed each month by the monks of
the ecumenical community of taize (pronounced te zay) in france.

name of proposed newsgroup


soc.religion.taize (unmoderated)


purpose of the group


the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks
based in france. many young adults come there to search for meaning in
their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a
sharing with others. this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a
monthly johannine hour which will be posted at the beginning of each
month. a johannine hour involves a short commentary on a given bible
passage , followed by some questions for reflection. any thoughts that
may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be
posted here. we are not interested in theological debate , and even less
in polemics. no expertise is required ! the idea is to help one another
to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own
life journey.

the idea of johannine hours was born in taize as a simple response
to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible 's message in the
midst of their daily life. because of work or studies , it is often
impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection , but
everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church , sit
quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods. there , in silence ,
we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of
christ.

during the time of silence , it is important to concentrate on what we
understand and not waste time worrying if , in some biblical expressions ,
we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ. the idea is to
communicate to others what we have understood of christ , not burdening
them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought
us joy , what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply.

perhaps those who read and think about the johannine hours in this
newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others.

the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects , the
personal aspect of silent , personal reflection and the communal aspect
of sharing , which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network.

background of the taize community


the following provides some background information on the life and
vocation of the taize (pronounced te zay) community.

a parable of communion august 1940 , with europe in the grip of
world war ii , brother roger , aged 25 , set up home in the almost
abandoned village of taize , in eastern france. his dream to bring
together a monastic community which would live out a parable of
community , a sign of reconciliation in the midst of the distress of
the time. centering his life on prayer , he used his house to conceal
refugees , especially jews fleeing from the nazi occupation.

an international and ecumenical community taize 's founder spent the
first two years alone. others joined him later and at easter 1949 ,
seven brothers committed themselves together to common life and
celibacy. year by year , still others have entered the community , each
one making a lifelong commitment after several years of preparation.
today , there are 90 brothers , catholics and from various protestant
backgrounds , from over twenty different countries. some of them are
living in small groups in poor neighbourhoods in asia , africa , north
and south america. the brothers accept no donations or gifts for
themselves , not even family inheritances , and the community holds no
capital. the brothers earn their living and share with others
entirely through their own work. in 1966 , sisters of saint andrew , an
international catholic community founded 750 years ago , came to live
in the neighbouring village , to share the responsibility of welcoming
people in taize.

taize and the young the intercontinental meetings young adults , and
less young , have been coming to taize in ever greater numbers since
1957. hundreds of thousands of people from europe and far beyond have
thus been brought together in a common search. intercontinental
meetings take place each week , sunday to sunday , throughout the year
and they include youth from between 35 and 60 countries during any
one week. the meetings give each person the opportunity to explore
the roots of their faith and to reflect on how to unite the inner
life and human solidarity. the meetings in summer can have up to
6 , 000 participants a week. three times every day , the brothers and
everybody on the hill come together for common prayer in the church
of reconciliation , built in 1962 when the village church became too
small.

a pilgrimage of trust on earth the community has never wanted to
create a movement around itself. instead , people are called to
commit themselves in their church at home , in their neighbourhood ,
their city or village. to support them in this , taize has created
what it calls a pilgrimage of trust on earth . at the end of each
year , the pilgrimage has a european meeting which brings together
tens of thousands of young adults from every part of europe for
several days in a major city. there have also been meetings in asia
and in the united states. every year , brother roger writes an open
letter to the young. usually completed during a stay in one of the
poor regions of the world , these are translated into thirty languages
and provide themes for reflexion for the following year.

note discussion on the creation of this newsgroup will take place in
news.groups.

gerry palo wrote that there is nothing in christianity that excludes
the theory of a succession of lives.

i wrote that the apostle paul , in romans 9 , speaks of god as
choosing jacob over esau , and adds that this is not as a result of
anything that either child had done , since they had not been born
yet.

clearly , paul does not believe that they had had previous lives , nor
does he suppose that his readers will believe it. for if they had
had previous lives , it would not make sense to say , neither of them
has done anything good or bad as yet , since they are not yet born.

daniel cossack writes to ask whether it is fair for god to hate
easau when esau has done nothing bad \?

i reply that in hebrew it is standard usage to speak of hating when
what is meant is simply putting in second place. as an example ,
consider the saying in matthew 6 24

no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one
and love the other , or....

now , it is obviously false that a man with two masters must hate one
of them. but it is obviously true that he must put one of them in
second place. a dog that always comes when either billy or bobby
calls will have a problem if they stand in different places and call
simultaneously. it cannot give first priority to both. one must take
second place. in our original example , second place means that
jacob , not esau , is chosen to bear the covenant blessing and
obligation , and to be the ancestor of christ.



eugene bigelow mentions matthew 11 14 which says of john the
baptist

and if ye will receive it , this is elijah , who was to come.

i take this to mean that john was an elijah like figure , dressing
and living like elijah , preaching like elijah , and fulfilling the
prediction that elijah would prepare the way for the messiah. i do
not think that he was elijah in a literal sense , and , appareently ,
neither did he (john 1 21).

subject re public private revelation (formerly re question about virgin mary
organization none
lines 44

(marty helgesen) writes

when an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention ,
the church may investigate it. if the investigation indicates a
likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from god ,
it will be approved. that means that it can be preached in the
church. however , it is still true that no one is required to
believe that it came from god. a catholic is free to deny the
authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved
private revelations , such as those at fatima and lourdes. (i
suspect that few if any catholics do reject fatima and lourdes , but
if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not
orthodox catholics in good standing.)

it may be a bit much to say that a catholic is free to deny what
happened at fatima. that 's a bit strong , it is sort of like saying
that a catholic is free to deny that hong kong exists. what a
catholic is free to do is to deny the truth of fatima , without being
called a heretic. you can be labeled other things for such an
offense , but not a heretic.

theologians make a basic distinction as far as the degree of assent
one must give to events like fatima and lourdes. things revealed by
god through jesus christ or his apostles must be given the assent due
to a revelation of god total and unswerving. fatima and lourdes
demand our assent as much as any other well attested event in human
history. perhaps a bit more , given the approval of the church.

approval of an apparition by the church principally means that
whatever happened was in harmony with the catholic faith.

i personally think of private revelations as our lord 's way of telling
us what to do at particular periods in history. he gave us all the
doctrines , etc. , 2000 years ago , but we can always use some help in
knowing how exactly to apply what he gave us.

catholic devotion to the sacred heart was a result of a series of
apparitions to st. margaret mary alacoque , for example. the problem
at the time was extreme moral rigorism that was turning our lord into
someone without a heart.

the fatima apparitions were a warning of an impending crisis in the
church (we are living it) , and what to do to save the most souls
possible in such a situation.

in the hebrew of genesis 3 15 , the gender is clearly masculine.

he shall crush your head , and you shall bruise his heel.

the latin has feminine forms , only by an accident of grammar.

andrew stated that kecharitomene means not just full of grace but
having a plenitude or perfection of grace. the word is used
elsewhere in the new testament only in ephesians 1 6

unto the praise of the glory of his grace , in which he hath
graced us in his beloved son. (rheims douay translation)

i cannot find any indication in my dictionary that the verb implies
anything as strong as andrew suggests , nor does the ephesians
passage suggest that the verb means to preserve from any taint of
original or actual sin from the first moment of existence. i should
like to see a comment on the meaning of the verb , preferably not

what we call today the old testament was being written up to approx
imately 168 bce , according to most modern scholars. aside from the book of
daniel , the whole ot predates alexander (the great). these books were written
(predominantly) in hebrew.
there were also other books being written at about this time and later
by greek speaking , or hellenistic , jews. these books are those which are
reckoned by many denominations as apocrypha .
before the closing of the writings , the third part of what is today
called the canon , all of the books were in use by jews of the day. however ,
there were those who reckoned (based on zech. 13) that prophecy had ceased.
this faction maintained that there were no true prophets in their day. they
also maintained that literature of a prophetic character could not be genuine
teachings from god.
by the time of c.65 ce , another faction had entered the mess. christians
had come in claiming that their writings were also suitable to be read in
synagogues and used for worship. therefore , the palestinian jewish leaders
got together and stated that the books written from the time of ben sira (sirach)
onward were not sacred writings. they justified this from zech. 13. in
particular , they said , the writings of the christians (called heretics) were
not inspired.
at about 90 ce , they codified things further by closing the canon in
somewhat of an official sense at the council of jamnia. a few books (ecclesi
astes , song of songs , esther) made it in after that date , but these were those
which had been written prior to the official cut off point (the time of ben
sira) for inclusion that they had established in order to keep out the christian
and hellenistic writings.
jerome excluded the 'apocrypha' because they were not in use by jews
of his day and because they were (except for sirach) not found in hebrew in his
time. his criterion for separating them from the other pre christian writings
was not based on 'inspiration'.

there is plenty more to say , but i do not have time.
the passage you quote concerns the book (rev.) in which it is found.

easy vs. hard .....easy on who \?

i had a rare very personal talk with my mother last year. she said
that when she and my father were raising we four children , they
did not try to raise us in this world as strictly as they were raised
in their norwegian lutheran community. they felt that we would be
alienated from them and it would create problems.
in other words , my parent did the very tolerant , loving thing. they
raised us without conflict , without what we saw as unreasonable
demands and were always accepting , no matter what the circumstances.
what happened was that i grew up believing in situation ethics and
never absolutes. i believed in a loving god , and my concept of god
never involved justice or punishment , nor was there any concept that
i may someday be held responsible for the things that offended
him...sins that the world told me were ok.
my parents are very good , honest and moral people. they raised
four extremely honest children. yet , before coming to a more
complete knowledge of god (which includes the knowledge of justice
and punishment)i committed what i now believe to be many , many
grave sins. i lived with a partner outside of marriage , was married
and divorced ( only after physical abuse and no apparent hope for
change...but i should n't have married to person in the first place )
and more....
my parents felt they were doing the loving , kind thing by allowing
us to be who we were , by not imposing their standards on us , and by
accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or
counsel.
today , it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they
did accept without a word. it takes courages to dare to help souls
because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and
difficult and what people do not want to hear. you must be able
to say what is hard , and say it as christ would , with love and
compassion. it involves risk....perhaps someone you love may not
want to hear and will stay away from you.
this life is but dust . as long as the comfort of this life
is our highest priority , we will fail god and fail those
with whom we come in contact.
i wonder how many who engage in sex outside of marriage , who
support the right to abortion , who engage in homosexuality ,
or who commit any of the range of sins that are plentiful in
this time have ever heard from a quiet , thoughtful , loving
friend that these things are wrong . no one ever told me that
what i was doing was wrong , and i saw multitudes around me
living the same way i was and they seemed like good , decent
people. (would n't kick dogs or beat the elderly or babies..)
it is more difficult for sinners without a genuine prayer
life to hear the holy spirit than it is to hear a loving friend.
think about this the next time the holy spirit tells you that
a friend is in error , but you do n't want to cause trouble .
righteous prayers is great power , but do n't forget that we are
we are christ 's lips and hands on earth. do n't be afraid to
simply voice truth when the situation calls for it. say a
fervent prayer and ask the holy spirit for love and guidance.
in more ways than we may realize , we are our brother 's
keeper.

as a final note , the oriental orthodox and eastren orthodox did sign

monophysitism.

this is a point that seems to have been overlooked by many. the ending of a
1600 year old schism seems to be in sight.

the theologians said that the differences between them were fundamentally
ones or terminology , and that the christological faith of both groups was
the same.

some parishes have concelebrated the eucharist , and here in southern africa
we are running a joint theological training course for coptic and byzantine
orthodox.

there are still several things to be sorted out , however. as far as the
copts are concerned , there were three ecumenical councils , whily the
byzantine orthodox acknowledge seven.

i look forward to reading it. when i got to the library last week , it

over the last few years , since my previous look at the literature. un
fortunately , they had moved the journal back issues , so i did n't get a

my own judgment on arsenokoitai until i have seen the latest scholarly
work , and i can hope that rexlex 's posting may give some meat to chew on.

however , what i can do now , is to point out the methodological issues
what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.
if the article rexlex posts addresses these issues , so much the better
if not , you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.

james b. deyoung

writes , in abstractu

this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai , deriving it
from the lxx of lev 20 12 (cf. 18 22) and using it for homosexual
orientation and behavior

it is only a minor point , but let me make it anyway de young has
already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that
the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and
not with orientation. i doubt this will have much bearing on the
article as such , but thought i should point it out from the start.

the hypothesis de young is advancing is that paul a) coined the word and
b) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the levitical law. the
questions i wish to raise are

1.) how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis \?
and 2.) what follows if one accepts (or stipulates , for the sake of the
discussion) that it is correct \?

note that b) is independent of a) i consider b) far more plausible than a) ,
which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the
literature contemporary with paul to clarify this word. so far as i know ,
paul does not in general invent words anywhere else in his letters. unless
you have an otherwise established pattern of coinages , it is not sound
methodology to assume it particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi
ate text to fix the coinage 's meaning for his audience.

as yet , the extract presents no evidence at all. what do we need to confirm
or reject the hypothesis \? (which , i should say at the outset , i find somewhat
plausible i certainly know of nothing which makes it an impossible way
of construing this problem passage.) i'm going to set aside for the moment
the question of whether paul might have coined this usage , to look at the
more tractable question of what it means. for this there are , in principle ,
two kinds of evidence that can be adduced , internal and external. that is ,
we can look at the text of paul 's letter for clarification or look outside
that to prior or contemporary writings that paul might have relied on , or to
derivative writings that have some claim of access to paul 's meaning.

the single worst problem with this word in corinthians is that there is no
internal evidence for paul 's meaning. he uses the word totally without an
explanation or hint as to his meaning , save that its inclusion in a list of
negatives implies that it has for him some negative meaning.

we are left , as the only internal clue , with the etymology or formation
of the word which is indeed the reason that de young (and others before
him) have associated it with the leviticus prohibition of men verbing with
other men , where verb is some standard euphemism for having sex ( lie in
leviticus , bed in greek). one problem is that bedders ( koitai ) is
not , as far as i know , used that way in greek. therefore , i offer one
serious test which de young 's hypothesis must pass or be rejected

o find a body of greek texts contemporary with paul (or not much
prior to his day) such that the x koitai formation implies
men who have sex with x obviously , the best case is to
find such usages of arsenokoitai itself.

such texts would be confirmation that the word can be read that way.
it is worth emphasizing that compound words are not in general under
standable by projecting what the reader may imagine by the juxtaposition
of the roots. existence of such parallels does n't prove the hypothesis
correct but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or
not original with paul in the specific case of x arse n ) possible
of comprehension by his readers.

my test moves in the direction of external evidence. if paul does not
in his text explain his word (and he does not) , then he has to expect his
readers to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)
or to expect that it mimics word formations that they do know , such that
they can guess his meaning without too much floundering.

external evidence , that is , texts other than paul 's own and lexicographic
or social historical considerations that might be adduced , then come into
the picture. if there are other uses of the word , not dependent on paul ,
which have sufficient internal (contextual) evidence or some gloss by
a contemporary scribe to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu
ality , or similar koitai formations used in similar ways , then one
has grounds for

o denying that paul coined the word
and o assuming that his readers might understand his meaning

do you see the problem \? if paul coined the word , then he requires his
readers to share enough context with him to comprehend his coinage and
its intent in this case that they would (stipulating de young 's guess)
understand him to be referring to the levitical universal prohibition
of male male sex (this , mind you , in a context where paul has emphasized
at least to other congregations (and so one assumes to the corinthians
how else to explain 1 cor. 6 12 , and the corinthians having to be pulled
back from overinterpreting their freedom \? ) the non applicability of torah
law to his gentile converts ! )

among the considerations that make it implausible for paul to have coined
the word , its first element is archaic arse n is an old attic or
ionic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be
assimilated as arre n . to me , this implies that we are even more than
usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage. what
is paul doing inventing a word in obsolete attic formation \?

and if he did n't coin the word , but picked it up like the others in
his list as common terms of derogation , then his meaning will be for
his readers constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no
other.)

i cannot emphasize enough that paul does not tell us what he means by
this word. we (and his original readers) are guessing. they , at least ,
had a contemporary context and maybe paul had used this very word and
explained it in great detail to them in person. but we have no trace of
evidence of that , and to suppose it is mere fantasy.

so we are desperately in need of external evidence about this word.
and it seems to be exceptionally meagre. that is precisely the problem.
i can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about
the word

a) it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all , maybe
very specific , maybe very general) homosexual male activities

b) it was a term of abuse used by jews about the awful homosexual
greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their
part with the leviticus passage)

c) paul invented the term and again there may or may not be an
association with leviticus in his doing so. he may or may not
intend the word to have an explicit and universal application
with absolute and clear boundaries. since none of his other
words in that list have such character , this last seems to me
about the least plausible of the hypotheses i'm advancing.

of these , i 'd say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible but
i still have reservations about that , too.

if the word never appears before paul , and in later uses has some evidence
of depending on paul , then one can opt for paul 's coining it. if it does
appear before him , he might still have coined it being unaware of prior
use (in which case , his coinage is inherently confusing ! ) but one should
normally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they
can be shown to have been at all common in the places paul traveled.) in
either of the a) or b) cases , one has to take into account paul 's relation
to the community of usage he picked the word up from and whether it be
from the greek or jewish communities , paul 's relations are hardly straight
forward !

there is , so far as i have yet seen , little or no external evidence to aid
us in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis. your guess is as
good as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better , depending on a lot of things).
but it remains so far guesswork. and i do n't know about you , but i
for one will not equate human guesswork with the will of god. by all means
be convinced in your own conscience about what paul is getting at as he
says elsewhere on what was in his day a major controversy of somewhat this
same character (romans 14 22 23)

hold on to your own belief , as between yourself and god and
consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going
against his conscience. but anybody who eats in a state of doubt
is condemned , because he is not in good faith , and every act done
in bad faith is a sin.

for my part , i cannot see any way to resolve paul 's meaning in the use of
arsenokoitai without directly applicable external evidence and by
the nature of such external evidence , it will never reach to certainty
of constraining paul 's own intent. paul , like humpty dumpty (and me , and
all the rest of us) will use words in ways that are personal choices
and sometimes leave his readers puzzled. if that puzzlement leads you
to god , it may be blessed if it should lead away (as some of paul 's
words have led some people) , then paul 's intense communicative effort to
contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.
i have always found paul to be a fantastically reliable guide if i
read him in the large , if i can see him lay out his position in detail
and hammer it home time and time again. i am much less certain about his
meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)

in my usual discursive way , i have gone on at great length about the first
of my intended meta exegetical points what would be needed to confirm
that paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as
the leviticus prohibition. my second point is to stipulate this hypo
thesis , and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and
for later christians. given my verbosity , this will be tomorrow night 's
meditation )

yes , but no more than he is worth. ). seriously jerome is merely

a greater polarization and dichotomy between catholic and protestant
thought than seems to me , from a historical perspective , to be valid.
to be sure , rome rejects (some significant aspects of) protestant
thought just as vehemently as protestants reject (some significant
aspects of) roman thought. other than some peoplw who apparently try
to embody the greatest extreme of this rejection , on either side , there
is not quite so vast a gulf fixed as casual observers seem to assume.

ecumenical consultations between rome and the lutherans , as well as
those between rome and the anglican communion (to which i belong) show
very nearly complete convergence on understanding the basic theological
issues the sticking points tend to be ecclesiology and church polity.
thus , for example , as you go on to say

they should
remeber that after the decree of pope st. damsus i ,

many of us do not regard a papal decretal as having any necessary (as
opposed to political) significance. sometimes it will , sometimes it
wo n't. you misread me if you think that my communion , at least , throws
out the deuterocanonical books. nor do i think you should overstress
the sense in which the more reformed may do so.

again , why must the church of jesus christ adopt the canon of the
unbelieving jews , drawn up in jamnia in 90 ad , in countering the
christian use of the septuagint.

i seriously suggest you rethink what you are saying here. it verges on ,
and could be taken as , anti semitic in the worst sense. the unbelieving
jews were , according to what i understand as a christian , the chosen
people of god , and the recipients of his pre incarnational revelation.
i think they have some say in the matter. the javneh meeting should not
be over interpreted. a recent magisterial study titled mikra (i do n't
have more citation information on hand , sorry) produced primarily from
the background of christian (rather than specifically jewish) scholarship
suggests strongly that the javneh meeting mostly resolved a lingering
question , where in practice the canon had long been fixed on the basis
of the scrolls that were kept in the temple , and thereby made the hands
unclean when used. the list of sacred books that may be drawn up from
josephus and other pre yavneh sources correspond (plus or minus one book ,
if i rememeber the chapter correctly) to the current jewish canon of tanakh.

all of this is not to throw out the deuterocanonicals (what , by the way ,
is your position about the books the greeks accept and rome does not \? ))
just to observe that the issue is complex and simply binary judgment
does not do it justice.

the next passage i thought of was from ecclesiastes 9 4

a living dog is better than a dead lion.

on the other hand , there is one notion firmly embedded in
christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.
the idea that the human being consists essentially of soul
only , and that the soul is created at birth , was consciously
adopted from aristotle , whose ideas dominated christian thought
for fifteen hundred years and still does today....

mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at

bernadette was 14 years old when she had her visions , in 1858 ,
four years after the dogma had been officially proclaimed by the
pope.

i forgot exactly what her age was but i remember clearly
that she was born in a family of poverty and she did not
have any education , whatsoever , at the age of the apparitions.
she suffered from asthma at that age and she and her family were
living in an abandoned prison cell of some sort.

she had to ask the 'lady' several times in her apparitions about
what her name was since her confessor priest asked her to do so.
for several instances , the priest did not get an answer since
bernadette did not receive any. one time , after several apparitions
passed , the lady finally said , i am the immaculate conception .
so , bernadette , was so happy and repeated these words over and
over in her mind so as not to forget it before she told the
priest who was asking. so , when she told the priest , the
priest was shocked and asked bernadette , do you know what
you are talking about \? . bernadette did not know what exactly
it meant but she was just too happy to have the answer for
the priest. the priest continued with , how did you remember
this if you do not know \? . bernadette answered honestly that
she had to repeat it over and over in her mind while on her
way to the priest...

the priest knew about the dogma being four years old then.
but bernadette did not know and yet she had the answer which
the priest finally observed and took as proof of an authentic
personal revelation of our lady to bernadette.

(note this lady of lourdes shrine has a spring of water which
our lady requested bernadette to dig up herself with her
bare hands in front of pilgrims. at the start little
water flowed but after several years there is more water
flowing.)

subject re the doctrine of original sin
organization none
lines 42

regarding the consequences of the original sin

catholics believe that what adam primarily lost by his sin , for
himself and the human race , was sanctifying grace. this is basically
a share in the divine life. take a rock and make it able to talk
what god does to a human being through sanctifying grace is similar.
it makes such a one able to live on a plane that is above the powers
of any possible creature. this is the everlasting life that the new
testament speaks of.

what christ did when he came was to restore this life of sanctifying
grace to the human race. he instituted the sacraments as the means by
which this life is given to people , and its increase fostered.

the absence of sanctifying grace at death means automatic exclusion
from heaven. the nature of heaven is such that it 's impossible for a
human being to have any part in it without the gift of sanctifying
grace. to use my example , it would be like taking that rock and
attempting to hold a conversation with it rocks cannot talk. neither
can human beings live in heaven without sanctifying grace.

this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults , since
both have souls. infants must be baptized , therefore , or they cannot
enter into heaven. they too need this form of life in them , or they
cannot enter into heaven.

turning it around , infant baptism is good supporting evidence for the
catholic belief in sanctifying grace. unless baptism causes some
change in an infant 's soul , there is no particular reason to insist on
the practice. yet infant baptism was probably practiced by the
apostles themselves , and was certainly part of the church shortly
thereafter.

there is evidence for infant baptism in the new testament itself 1
cor 1 16 , acts 16 15 , 16 33 , 18 8 , also acts 11 14. it is known for
sure that at least one disciple of the apostle john was baptized as an
infant st. polycarp (because of a remark he makes in the acts of his
martyrdom). st. justin martyr mentions men and women baptized as
infants. there is direct evidence in st. irenaeus 's against
heresies , and in tertullian 's on baptism . all these so far
mentioned are in the first 170 years after our lord 's death. after
that , there starts to be tons of evidence for the practice.

thanks for posting the exact wording which i had not seen

i 'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents \?
in normal dreams , you ca n't control anything , so obviously
you are n't morally responsible for your actions. but if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an oobe , it seems like a morality applies.


well i am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes
control their dreams. for example , i might decide before going to
sleep that i want to repeat a favourite dream , or dream about a
specific place. or if i am having an unpleasant dream , i can often
(not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.

i guess i think that the same standards apply in these directed
dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref jesus teaching
about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing
adultary).

when my normal dreams display themes that i would not conciously chose
to dream about , i take that as a sign that all is not well with my
inner life maybe i have underlying tenstions fears that need to be
resolved , or maybe its straightforward sin. in either case , the cause
needs to be resolved.

in fact , either case is pretty rare. i do n't
often remember dreams that i do n't chose to have. when i do , they
almost always tell me something important.
i also almost never dream in pictures , and especially not in colour
(in fact i 've had precisely one full colour picture dream that i can
remember , and it was definately spiritually important)
i tend to dream in sound , with the odd blurred image , in black and
white.

organization panix public access internet unix , nyc

meta exegesis conviction of sin , part ii

let me return to the question , stipulating that paul meant his use of
arseonkoitai to refer more or less exactly to the levitical prohibition
of male male sex. in order to bring out the problems most clearly , i 'll
also stipulate (what i think is far less plausible) that paul coined the
term for this usage. the question i want to turn to is what that would
mean for paul 's readers and for later christians. this should be shorter
than my last note , as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us
with some of the major divisions within christ 's body , and i am not trying
to open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that
separate any of us from our fellow christians. my own biases (loosely
characterizable as liberal ) will be evident , but i am not grinding an
axe here , so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be hard
to reach closure when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we
each , in our own different ways , see as crucial to the gospel of christ.

so stipulating paul 's intent , the immediate question is how can his
readers understand this intent \? and following on that question , there is
a second one what is our proper action if we do manage to understand him \?

since paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st
corinthians , there are two positive answers and one negative to this
question

a. paul (or apollos , or someone) in the apostolic community has
conveyed to the corinthians the then traditional jewish condem
nation of homosexual behavior , and paul expects them to be
sufficiently well tutored by this tradition that he needs no
futher explanation. i should note that there is no evidence
in the letter , or in 2 corinthians for such a supposition )

b. the spirit will teach us what paul means (or , if not paul ,
what god means behind paul 's inspired word choice.)

c. we do n't know , and cannot guess to within any better pre
cision here than , for comparison , in the parallel use by paul ,
in the same passage of the word pleonektai ( those who have
more if you think that areseonkoitai is obvious from
its roots , try cutting your teeth on this word ! the neb
translates it as grabbers ) or even methusoi ( drunkards
at least this has the advantage of being a common insult ,
so that at least there is some hint as to its meaning ! )

the three positions more or less if i can be allowed some exaggeration
for the sake of argument define a classical catholic attitude towards
tradition , one form of protestant sola scriptura , and a liberal critical
demand for evidence. all three positions have strengths and weaknesses.

ad a it is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the
community of christ 's disciples and their successors , and that
our nt scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.
but it 's also the case that we know little or nothing about this
tradition until almost a century after paul , which is to say that
we have access to the tradition only after several generations of
possibly confused transmission. the scripture is itself our only
documentation of the tradition in the critical era.

ad b if we are not born of water and spirit to revert to john in an
attempt to explain paul ) , then we have no more hope of under
standing the gospel than nicodemus had neither the traditions of
men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the spirit
from blowing where it will the paraclete is a kamikaze. but
the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit
as our guide in scripture is that the wing of protestantism that
takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent
understanding supposedly derived from the clear word of god.

note classical lutheran , calvinist and anglican thought
constrains scripture to be read within tradition , even
while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture
the more bizarre forms of i will read scripture my way
are primarily a fringe aspect of cultic protestantism.

the main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no
means for one person to convey to another what that one may feel
is teaching received from the spirit and history shows incredible
conflict between christians on this point , each in his own mind
convinced that he is led by the spirit. no one can seriously
urge point b without some sense of its potential for setting christian
against christian. to what purpose \?

ad c the critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can
reach a conclusion , it can lay out the data in a way which is open
to all. the weakness is an obvious corollary this is not usually
possible. )

if i may say a word here , out of my own already acknowledged bias
one complaint against critical methodology is that it dissolves
faith but surely a faith that cannot honestly face the evalu
ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to
address.

anyway , there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between
liberal and conservative positions , mostly on the basis of extreme
zealots of positions b and c. a catholic sense of authority and tradition
tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position , so that
despite horrendous strains rome is not as likely to find these issues as
ultimately divisive as the protestant world will. and anglicans will (i
predict) muddle through on the via media , attempting to give each position
its due , but no more than its due.

second question. suppose tradition tells us , and lots of spiritual
christians tell us , and critical thought at least admits as possible ,
that paul is refering to a flat , universal levitical prohibition against
male male sex. what then \? again , we can abdicate our personal responsi
bility to tradition , and let it dictate the answer. but it 's precisely
where inherited traditions are not questioned that they 're most dangerous.

we have examples of christ questioning the pharisees and their use of
tradition (despite his urging , in matthew 23 2 that we are to heed them).
we have examples of peter , and more radically still paul , jettisoning the
traditions that they were led by the spirit to call into question. jesus
and peter and paul do not so much throw out tradition as subject it to
radical criticism , on a couple of very basic grounds

the weightier demands of the law justice and mercy and good faith
(matthew 23 23)
and on these two commandments love god neighbor hand the whole law ,
and the prophets , also.
(matthew 22 40)

if there is a fundamental (because derived from christ) validity in the
challenge to some traditions , a validity that led the first generation
to go so far as to waive application of the torah to gentile converts
(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from jesus' reported
words and deeds) , it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination
to postulate that only the traditions that we have specific challenges
against are in fact open to challenge.

all traditions passed through men are traditions of men. that god may
lead us even so , that these traditions are a source of our spiritual
instruction i will freely grant. but tradition is inherently human , and
inherently corruptible (and given the fall , corrupt). nothing in it is
immune to challenge , when the spirit shows us a failure in justice , mercy
and good faith. nothing may ultimately stand unless it does follow from
love of god and love of neighbor.

i am perfectly willing to grant that i could be blind to my own sin. that
the spirit may have taught another what she refuses to teach me (or i am
too dense to learn). that tradition might have value here. but what i
know of tradition is that on one occasion , some superstitious christians
appealed to justinian after an earthquake in asia minor , and scapegoated
sodomites as the cause of the earthquake , so that legislation was
passed making homosexual behavior a capital offense. if that is in
accord with the gospel of christ , then i am no christian. that is human
tradition at its most hateful and vicious. and i see nothing all that much
different in all the unbidden eruptions onto usenet of people who are quick
to condemn but slow to understand. if that is the leading of the spirit ,
then i want no part of it. but what i have found in obedience to the lord
is that i am , myself , totally dependent on the witness of other christians ,
for the truth that lives in the body of christ.

and i say to all who doubt that gay christianity is from god what gamaliel
said to doubting pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest church

be careful how you deal with these people... if this enterprise ,
this movement of theirs , is of human origin it will break up of
its own accord but if it does in fact come from god you will not
only be unable to destroy them , but you might find yourselves
fighting against god.
acts 5 36...39

all i ask is that you listen to your traditions , and read your scriptures
with a mind and soul open to the spirit , and to the past history of our
first christian witnesses' willingness to challenge tradition and other
readings of scripture though read with all the authority of scribes and
rabbis and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the
love of god and neighbor. then , study the evidence learn the history of
christians oppressing christians out of their traditions and eagerness to
judge where jesus and paul tell us not to judge. and let the witness of
the spirit in the lives of your fellow christians including those who
are not of your preference in theology guide you towards god 's truth.

there 's a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a) , as to
whether you 're speaking of tradition in paul 's time or ours. i think
there are two ways to use tradition. one is to say that when paul and
his readers share a tradition , it makes sense to interpret his words
in the context of that shared tradition. that 's what makes me think
that these arguments over words turn out to be silly. we know that
paul came out of a background that was rather puritanical on sex.
everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.
the tone of his remarks on homosexuality in rom 1 is consistent with
that background. even if the words in the sin lists are n't the most
general terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there 's
some evidence that they are not) , they are just one more piece of
evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no
evidence at all that paul shares the common jewish rejection of
homosexuality.

but when you identify (a) with the catholic position , that 's rather a
horse of a different color. the catholic position involves a
continuing church tradition. arguments specific to that tradition
might be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret paul 's original
meaning from tradition , e.g. the way the church fathers interpreted
him , and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in
our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his
time and ours. i think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.
a radical protestant might be willing to use known 1st cent.
tradition to illuminate paul 's original meaning , but not use the
catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to
homosexuality should be.

this happens , but i donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so.

why can we not hate with a perfect hatred \?

in the summary of the law , christ commands us to love god and to love our
neighbors. he does n't say anything about hate. in fact , if anything , he
commands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. so , how are christians
supposed to deal with the sin of others \? i suppose that there is only one
way to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. we

certainly we should love even our enemies. amos 5 15 says to hate the evil
and love the good. this ca n't contradict christ 's teaching. i think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude , when it really should be
considered more objectively. surely i do n't fly into a rage at every sin
i see , but why can i not hate it \?

in article may.6.00.35.55.1993.15474@geneva.rutgers.edu joe moore writes ,
speaking of the immaculate conception of the blessed virgin

it was a gift from god. i think basically the reasoning was that the
tradition in the church held that mary was also without sin as was jesus.

yes. for examples of this in the writings of the early fathers , consider

you alone and your mother
are more beautiful than any others
for there is no blemish in you ,
nor any stains upon your mother.
who of my children
can compare in beauty to these \?
st. ephrem the syrian , nisibene hymns , 27 8 , around
a.d. 370

lift me up not from sara but from mary , a virgin not only undefiled
but a virgin whom grace has made inviolate , free of every stain of sin.
st. ambrose , commentary on psalm 118 , 22 30 , ca. a.d. 388

there are many others.

as the tenets of faith developed , particularly with augustine , sin was
more and more equated with sex , and thus mary was assumed to be a virgin
for life (since she never sinned , and since she was the spouse of god , etc.)

no. we have , for instance

was there ever anyone of any breeding who dared to speak the name of
holy mary , and being questioned , did not immediately add , the virgin \?
... and to holy mary , virgin is invariably added , for that holy woman
remains undefiled.
st. epiphanus of salamis , panacea against all heresies ,
between a.d. 374 377.

we surely cannot deny that you were right in correcting the doctrine
about children of mary ... for the lord jesus would not have chosen
to be born of a virgin if he had judged that she would be so incontinent
as to taint the birthplace of the body of the lord , home of the eternal
king , with the seed of human intercourse. anyone who proposes this is
merely proposing ... that christ could not be born of a virgin.
pope st. siricius , letter to anysius , bishop of
thessalonica , a.d. 392

note that st. augustine 's conversion to christianity was in a.d. 387. i
do n't know offhand when his election as bishop of hippo was , but i'm quite
sure it was after 392. the belief in mary 's perpetual virginity originated
long before augustine 's time. we hold that it originated with the
apostles.

strictly speaking , however , mary 's perpetual virginity is independent
of her immaculate conception. mary could have been immaculately
conceived and not remained a virgin she could have remained a virgin
and not been immaculately conceived.

since we also had this notion of original sin , ie. that man is born with
a predisposition to sin , and since mary did not have this predisposition
because she did not ever sin , she did n't have original sin. when science
discovered the process of conception , the next step was to assume that
mary was conceived without original sin , the immaculate conception.

no. it has been held in the church since ancient times that original
sin was transmitted at conception , when a person 's life begins.
biology had nothing to do with it. prayerfully reflecting on the
truth of mary 's sinlessness , and the means by which god could have
achieved this , the church arrived at the truth of the immaculate
conception. thus , the immaculate conception is not a new doctrine ,
but the logical result of our understanding of two old ones.

the celebration of the feast of the immaculate conception itself was
given by pope sixtus iv (1471 84) and the feast was made a precept
feast of the church by pope clement xi (1700 21).

mary at that time appeared to a girl named bernadette at lourdes. she
refered to herself as the immaculate conception. since a nine year old
would have no way of knowing about the doctrine , the apparition was deemed
to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.

no. first of all , lourdes is private revelation , and doctrine is not
based on private revelation. the most that private revelation can do
is enhance and deepen our understanding of existing public revelation ,
which ended with the death of st. john the apostle.

second , the case for the doctrine was irreformably sealed in 1854
with the ex cathedra promulgation of the bull ineffabilis deus by
pope pius ix. this meant that the doctrine was formally recognized as
a dogma a dogma , by definition , cannot change and is required to be
believed by the faithful.

the apparition at lourdes happened in 1858 , four years later. the most
that might be claimed is that lourdes gave the infallible proclamation
of 1854 a sort of heavenly stamp of approval , but the church has never
claimed that , nor shall she.

in christ 's peace ,

brad kaiser
(bradk@isdgsm.eurpd.csg.mot.com)

colossians 2 11 12 in him you were also circumcised , in the putting off of
the sinful nature , not with a circumcision done by christ , having been
buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the
power of god , who raised him from the dead.

in baptism , we are raised to a new life in christ (romans 6 4) through a
personal faith in the power of god. our parent 's faith cannot do this. do
infants have faith \? let 's look at what the bible has to say about it.

i do n't think the issue of whether infants have faith is relevant or not.
certainly they can , as the example of john in utero proves. i find the
translation of col 2 above odd in terms of the circumcision of christ ,
which the kjv and rsv put in terms of christ 's cricumcision which we , in
union with him participate in putting off the body of sins of the flesh.

also , perhaps cor 2 12 is dividing the act of burial with him in baptism ,
which can be independant of faith , from the experience of rising with
christ by faith. who says both are by faith \? this interpretation has the
advantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized , for whom their
baptisim is not benefit , but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.

like the israelites (all of them , children included) who were baptized in
the cloud and in the sea , it was of no advantage because they did not add
to their baptism faith and obedience.

baptism does not impart faith , nor is it done strictly speaking on the
basis of the faith of the parent , but because of the covcenant promise of
god. it imparts grace , the grace of the kingdom , which can be a
punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.



romans 10 16 17 but not all the israelites accepted the good news. for
isaiah says , 'lord , who has believed our message \? ' consequently , faith
comes from hearing the message , and the message is heard through the word
of christ.

so then we receive god 's gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the
gospel. faith is a possible response to hearing god 's word preached. kids
are not yet spiritually , intellectually , or emotionally mature enough to
respond to god 's word. hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot
be raised in baptism to a new life.

do you teach a child to pray the lord 's prayer \? do you expect them to not
steal \? they can have faith appropriate to their condition. and in the
new covenant , we shall no longer say know the lord , for they shall all
know him from the least unto the greatest heb 8 11.

if you read all of ezekiel 18 , you will see that god does n't hold us guilty
for anyone else 's sins. so we can have no original guilt from adam.

but also according to ezekiel 18 , god will not hold innocent anyone on the
basis of anyone elses innocense. thus jesus could not be our federal head
any more than adam , if that 's what ezekiel is talking about. shall you
make ezekiel 18 contradict the second commandemnt as well \?



ezekiel 18 31 32 rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted ,
and get a new heart and a new spirit. why will you die , o house of israel \?
for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone , declares the sovereign lord.
repent and live !

the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit. kids
cannot do this. acts 2 38 39 says that when we repent and are baptized , we
will then receive a new spirit , the holy spirit. then we shall live.

ezekiel 36 25 26 indicates that this new heart will be given by god ,
in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism. it is the action of
god puting them into his new order , and not a question of personal
faith as such.


romans 5 12 therefore , just as sin entered the world through one man , and
death through sin , and in this way death came to all men , because all
sinned

sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned. death came to
each man because each man sinned. note that it 's good to read through all
of romans 5 12 21. some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than
others , but if we read them in context we will see that they are all
saying basically the same thing. let 's look at one such.

but the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal
death , but the dead state (originbal sin). we are in a covenant of death ,
because adam , our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death.


psalm 51 5 surely i was sinful at birth , sinful from the time my mother
conceived me.

this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves
before god in repentance for sinning. david himself was a man after god 's
own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and
murdering her husband. all that david is saying here is that he ca n't
remember a time when he was n't sinful. he is humbling himself before god
by confessing his sinfulness. his saying that he was sinful at birth is
a hyperbole. the bible , being inspired by god , is n't limited to a literal
interpetation , but also uses figures of speech as did jesus (john 16 25).
for another example of hyperbole , see luke 14 26.

while this psalm is figurative in it 's language , it is not hyperbolic , and
the one does not necessarily imply the other. there is not other
hyperbolic language in this psalm. what v 5 is likely refering to is
what is symbolized by the ot cleanliness laws (which make intercourse and
childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from god). the
whole psalm is in the language of ot ritual (hyssop , cleansing , burnt
offering , etc) david 's sin with bathsheba included this element , as he
did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have.

but what was symbolized by the ot ritual was the truth that sin was
passed generationally. that 's why the organ of generation had to be
cut. that 's why brith was unclean. uncleanness was death , and all babies
were born dead , and needed to be washed to newness of life , which we have in
baptism today.

...there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of
repeated lives on earth.

does n't it say somewhere it is appointed to man once to die ,
and then judgement \? i do n't have a concordance here but i have
some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the bible.
given a fairly specific context for what judgement is , i 'd say
that more or less decides the issue.
heb 9 27 clh

that depends on how this verse is read. there are at least two
meanings of the word once . 1) only one time , and 2) at some
other time (i.e. once upon a time). note that in the previous
verse , the word once is used with the second meaning , and also
in the following verse , once is again used with the second meaning.
the greek , i am sure , uses different words for each of the two meanings
for the english word once . i am not a greek scholar , but i'm sure
someone here can verify which greek word is used here for this meaning.
if the second meaning is being used , that verse can be interpreted as

for it was once given for men to die (beginning with adam) , but
after this gift of atonement offered by jesus christ the judgement
is made available , for now there is no longer death , but life
with christ.

i have enrolled in the history of christianity at a college here in

closed minded and bigotted on the subject of what the definition of
christianity is. his definition is tied directly to that of the
trinity and the catholic church 's definition of it and belief in
jesus christ is not sufficient to call one 's self a christian.

while his saying it does n't make it so , i nevertheless feel insulted
(or am i just neurotic \? ) ). i would like to be able to respond to
him with some sense of literacy while maintaining an amiable
student teacher relationship.

so , is there common definition of what christianity is \? as the
previous discussion of the trinity did not lend itself to an exchange
of flames , i am hopeful that this will also not produce major
flames.

regards ,

larry autry
silicon graphics , st. louis
autry@sgi.com



often we get into discussions about who is christian. unfortunately
there are a number of possible definitions. starting from the
broadest , commonly used definitions are

a historical definition
people who accept christ as lord and savior
a broad doctrinal definition
narrow doctrinal definitions

1) by a historical definition i mean the sort of definition a secular
historian would likely use. this would include any group that
developed out of the christian church , and continues within the same
broad culture. e.g. some unitarians would fail just about any
doctrinal test you could come up with. yet it 's clear that that group
developed from christianity , and people from very different
backgrounds (e.g. hindus) would likely see them as part of
christianity. this is not a definition most christians like , but it 's
relevant in some political and ethnic contexts.

2) accepting christ as lord and savior is a test used by many
christian groups for membership , e.g. the southern baptists and
presbyterian church (usa). i would qualify it by saying that what
most people have in mind is an exclusive commitment to christ , so that
someone who accepted christ as one of many gods would not fit. it 's
an attempt to formulate a criterion that is religious but is not based
on technical doctrine. by this definition , groups such as arians
would be viewed as heretical christians , but still christians. in the
modern context this would include mormons , jw 's , and oneness
pentecostals . they would be viewed as heretical christians , but
still christian. in practice i believe just about everyone who falls
into this category would accept the apostle 's creed.

3) the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition ,
which includes all of the major strands of christianity , but excludes
groups that are felt to be outside historic christianity. this is
of course a slippery enterprise , since catholics could argue that
protestants are outside historic christianity , etc. but i think the
most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the
nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon. the attempt is to
characterize doctrines that all major strands of christianity agree
are key. obviously this is to some extent a matter of judgement. a
mormon will regard the lds church as a major strand , and thus will not
want to include anything that contradicts their beliefs. but i think
this definition would have fairly broad acceptance.

4) finally , some people use definitions that i would say are limited
to a specific christian tradition. e.g. some evangelicals only
consider someone christian if he has had an evangelical style
conversion experience , and some i 've even heard of groups that limit
it to their specific church.

i think you can find contexts where each of these definitions is used.
a lot is going to depend upon the purpose you 're using it for. if
you 're using it descriptively , e.g. in history or anthropology , you 'll
probably use definition 1 or 2. if you 're using it normatively , i.e.
to say what you believe the christian message is , you 'll probably use
a definition like 3 or even 4.

any way. since god knows everything , he therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us. we have free will , and are able to change
what happens to us. however , since god knows everything , he knows all
the choices we will make in advance (god is not subject to time). too
often arguments pit predestination against free will. we believe in
both.

surprise , surprise. i sure did n't lose any sleep over it , and i live there.

mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous. for me , my greatest fears
in this area would be the following ..
4 were god to call me to be a prophet and i were to misrepresent god 's word ,
my calling would be lost forever. god 's word would command the people
never to listen to or fear my words as i would be a false prophet. my
bridges would be burnt forever. perhaps i could repent and be saved , but
i could never again be a prophet of god.

suppose someone said that he was sure that he would return from death ,
in glory and power , flying in the clouds with the host of heaven , soon , within
the lifetimes of those then standing with him and 2000 years went by without
any such event. he also asserted , so they say , himself to be god.

2 questions

1) is that one of those false prophecies you were talking about \?
2) does that make the speaker a false prophet \?

speak directly. if the lord has given you something to say , say it.
but , before i declare thus sayeth the lord , i 'd better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that i am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain , again , without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.

uhh , has it occurred to you that there is no way to know any of these
things , for certain , without the tiniest shadow of a doubt \? that people
who thought they did have also been deluded \?

those of us who believe in actually being able to check our opinions
have an out we can check against some external reality. those who
assert that beliefs entertained without evidence , or even despite evidence
have a special virtue (ie. faith ) are out of luck and this is the
result.

it 's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood. when we say , thus sayeth the
lord , it happens. when we pray , prayer is answered because we prayed right.
when we say we 're christians , we really mean it.

why is it that open biggotry like this is practiced and encouraged by the

perhaps because there is a connection here that is not there in the mexican

that is , many (not all) extreme fundamentalist christians use the excuse of
teaching their children biblical morality to justify this sort of mistreatment.
i do not see many mexicans using their mexican heritage as an excuse for abuse.

it is indeed this judgemental , controlling legalism of many fundamentalist
christians that has led me to reject that branch of our faith as not true
to the gospel of christ , the gospel of love.

i have seen this sort of thing too often , even amoung my own relatives , to
believe there is no relationship. judgementalism often leads to overly
strict , and thus abusive , discipline of children.
this is not restricted to just christian fundamentalism , it is found in
many extreme sects of other legalistic religions .

can a good christian continue to purchase newspapers and buy advertising in
this kind of a newspaper \? this is really bad journalism.

i , too , am a christian. but i do not condone the use of the bible to justify
this sort of abuse. i believe that it is only by exposing the horrors of
the misapplication of the biblical concept of discipline that such abuses
can be stopped.

just because someone is also a christian does not mean we must identify

lines 49

joe moore writes

paul repeatedly talks about the thorn in his side. some think
it refers to lust , others pride , but who knows \? whatever the
thorn was , apparently it was not compatible with christianity ,
yet does that make his epistles any less \?

paul mentions his thorn (skolops , actually a sharp stake) in 2
corinthians 12 7 9

and to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of
revelations , a thorn was given me in the flesh , a messenger of
satan , to harass me , to keep me from being too elated. three
times i besought the lord about this , that it should leave me
but he said to me , my grace is sufficient for you , for my
power is made perfectr in weakness.

he does not explain what it was , but it need not have been a moral
problem. one guess is that paul had a disorder of the eyes. he
ordinarily dictated his letters , and then added a personal note and
his signature. at the end of the letter to the galatians , he says ,
see , i am writing in large letters with my own hand , or else , see
what a long letter i have written with my own hand. if the former
translation is adopted , it seems that paul could not write in the
small script of a practiced writer , but needed to make his letters
larger , and this suggests eye problems. again , he says to the
galatians (4 13 15) ,

you know that it was because of a bodily ailment that i preached
the gospel to you at first and although my condition was a trial
to you , you did not scorn or despise me , but received me as an
angel of god.... for i bear you witness that , if possible , you
would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.

perhaps this last line means simply , you would have done anything
for me , not withholding your most precious possessions (your eyes).
but in that case , we would expect some wording like , if i had
needed them. if it were possible sounds as though the bodily
ailment was connected with his eyes.

william barclay , in his volume on acts , makes a more specific
suggestion. before paul preached in the highlands of galatia , he
had been preaching in the coastal areas of asia minor. if he had had
a malarial attack while there , a doctor would have advised him to
leave the low country and head for the hills. malaria might well
have given him both severe headaches and blurred vision.

i'm fairly new to these groups , tho' some have heard from me before.
welcome.

i 'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents \?
in normal dreams , you ca n't control anything , so obviously
you are n't morally responsible for your actions.

hm. i get a little queasy around the phrase are n't morally
responsible , perhaps because i 've heard it misused so many times.
(i remember in college some folk trying to argue that a person who
was drunk was not morally responsible for his actions.) in general ,
most folk ca n't control their dreams , but perhaps what you do all day
and think about has some impact on them , hm \? and i'm not sure what
actions are in a dream. but i will note that jesus does seem adamant
about the fact that our thought life is at least as important as
our actions. go lightly with this argument we are all morally
responsible for who we are and dreams might well be an important
part of that.

now , there seem to be 3 alternatives
1) dreams and oobes are totally mental phenomena. in this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene' , that is , not trying
to think about anything evil , or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts.
i do n't know a thing about out of body experiences. i 've had dreams , some
fairly vivid ones is an oobe just a very vivid dream \? i would argue that
extreme interest in this sort of phenomena is a tad risky it is probably
much better to think about who jesus is , and who we are in relation to that ,
than to cultivate a strong interest in dreams. unless you feel plagued by
dreams that are painful and out of control then pray about it and or get help.

2) dreams and oobes have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')
evidence for this is that often dreams and oobes are sometimes done in
common by more than one person.
what on earth is your definition of often \? i know exactly one case of
two people who had substantially the same dream at the same time , and
as they were brothers who had spent the day doing the same things i could
see why their dreams might be similiar. anyway , the only other plane i
know of is the spiritual realm. i do n't think anyone 's dreams ,
perhaps outside the occasional prophet 's , represent actual actions on an
alternate plane. if they were real actions , or conscious thoughts , then
yes they would have direct moral significance.

3) like (2) , but here we assume that garbled text because the dream occurs
in a different environment , then different moral laws apply is my guess of
what you said.
i do n't see the slightest hint in christian writings that ones environment
changes the way a person determines what is moral. for a christian wo n't
it always come down to what jesus would have us do \?

so... there it is. is one of these cases the truth , or does anyone know
of another alternative \? respond by post or email.
truth \? i do n't claim to be an expert in dreams. i 'll note that the bible
does n't talk much about dreams outside of the realm of god using them to speak
to us , with the caveat that such messages are not always very clear , as it
warns somewhere in the ot. given that , i would not give them a lot of
attention unless you feel your dreams are trying to tell you something.

i would discount talk of alternate planes , though. the only places such
concepts are commonly bandied about are for the most part hostile to
christianity , though i 've run into the occasional exception. if you are ,
or want to be , a christian , you want to be very careful about ideas like
this.

on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god.
to quote unger 's bible dictionary on the apocrapha
1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.

so do other parts of the bible when taken literally i.e. the psalms
saying the earth does not move , or the implication the earth is flat
with four corners , etc. the bible was written to teach salvation , not
history or science.

2. they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred scripture.

what ones \? paryers for the dead or the intercession of saints \? (which
are taught in 2 maccabees , sirach , and tobit)

3. they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture.

by your own subjective judgement. this falling short is your judgement ,
and you are not infallible rather the church of jesus christ is (see 1
timothy 3.15).

4. they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling.

more subjective feelings. this is not a proof of anything more than
one persons feelings.

but the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
the hebrew canon included the apocrapha in the first place , and
it was n't until the sixteenth century that luther and co. threw
them out. the jewish council you mentioned previously did n't
accept them , so the reformation protestants had good historical
precedence for their actions. jerome only translated the
apocrapha under protest , and it was literally 'over his dead
body' that it was included in the catholic canon.

as i have written time and again , the hebrew canon was fixed in jamnia ,
palestine , in 90 ad. 60 years after the foundation of the one , holy ,
catholic , and apostolic church. furthermore , the opinons of jerome do
not count. he was neither the church , or the pope , or an ecumenical
council , or a council in general , or an insturment of the magisterium of
the church. he was a private individual , learned admittedly , but
subject to erro of opinion. and in exlcuding the deuterocanon , he
erred , as pope damsus , and the council of carthage , and the tradition of
the fathers , clearly shows , as i pointed out in my previous post.

how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the
words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to
them , god will add to him the plagues described in this book.
and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy , god will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city (rev 22.18 9)

i suggest you take heed of the last part of the statement , if you want
to take it in the sense you are taking it , that taking away from the
book will cause you to lose heaven.

it is also noteworthy to consider jesus' attitude. he had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon (john
10.31 6) , and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus
that in the law , prophets and psalms which referred to him the
ot division of scripture (luke 24.44) , as well as in luke 11.51
taking genesis to chronicles (the jewish order we would say
genesis to malachi) as scripture.

the order of the canon is unimportant , it is the content that matters.
none of jesus' statments exlcude the deuterocanon , which were
interspersed throughout the canon. and remeber , there are some
completely undisputed books , ezra , nehemiah , esther , ecclesiatses , song
of songs , job , etc. that are not quoted in the new testament , which is
not taken as prejudicial to their being inspired.

bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu writes
one last point an ex catholic attempted to explain catholic doctrine
on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that mary
did not die. this is not a correct summary of what catholics believe.
the dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying
whether mary did or did not die. in fact , the consensus among catholic
theologians seems to be that mary in fact did die. this would make
sense christ died , and his mother , who waited at the foot of the
cross , would want to share in his death.

the above article is a good short summary of traditional christian
teaching concerning the death of mary.
also very good is re question about the virgin mary by micheal d.
walker. he tells the story very well.
i would like to add that in the eastern orthodox church we celebrate the
dormition (or falling asleep) of the theotokos (the mother of god) . the
icon for this day shows mary lying on a bed surrounded by the apostles
who are weeping. christ , in his resurrected glory , is there holding what
seems to be a small child. this is , in fact , mary 's soul already with
christ in heaven. the assumption of mary is one more confirmation for us
as christians that christ did indeed conquer death. it forshadows the
general resurrection on the last day. the disciples were not surprised
to find mary 's body missing from the grave. she was the mother of the
savior. she was the first of all christians. she gave birth to the word
of god. if it were not for her we would not be saved. this is why we
pray in the orthodox church , through the prayers of the theotokos ,
savior save us.

5. both families agree that he who wills and acts is always the one hypostasis
of the logos incarnate.

marhaba nabil ,

if we posit two minds in christ , the mind of the logos and the mind of the
human jesus , then we must admit two wills. a mind is not a mind without a
will. i know this has been dealt with in past church prnouncements , but there
is a philosophical problem here that should examined.

t. v. morris argued that the incarnation can be seen like this


(mind of logos)
( )
( ( ) ) here , the mind of jesus is circumsribed by god the
( ( human ) ) son. god the son has complete access to the human
( ( mind ) ) mind but the human mind only has access to the mind
( ( ) ) of god the son when the son allows access. this
( ( ) ) explains why jesus said even he did not know the
( ) time of the kingdom.

the human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free
human decision. but if the human will would have decided differently than
what was intended the divine will would have interceded , but this was never
the case.

he employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person two mind
theory. the ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from
the field of psychology , and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream , seeing
yourself acting , knowing that is you , but also being omniscient.

the one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds. agreed. but i am
still waiting for morris and others to respond to the lingering problem of two
minds making two persons. christian analytic philosophers are breaking new
ground in explicating the rationality of theism and the incarnation.

i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues ,
however , a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly
perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.

would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god \? how does this apply
to homosexuals \? i understand fornication to be sex outside of
marriage. is this an accurate definition \? is there any such thing as
same sex marriage in the bible \? my understanding has always been that
the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife. i am , however , willing to listen to scriptural evidence
to the contrary.
remainder of my post deleted the moderator then made some comments i would
like to address

there 's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote. both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals , but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute. that does n't meant that i
think all the biblical evidence vanishes , but the nature of the
evidence is such that you ca n't just quote one verse and solve things.

if you are referring to the terms effeminate and homosexuals in
the above passage , i agree that the accuracy of the translation has
been challenged. however , i was simply commenting on the charge that
it is an incredibly perverse interpretation to read this as a
condemnation of homosexuality. such a charge seems to imply that no
reasonable person would ever conclude from the verse that paul
intended to condemn homosexuality however , i think i can see how a
reasonable person might very well take this view of the verse.
therefore i do not believe it is incredibly perverse to read it in
this way.

i think your argument from fornication is circular. why is
homosexuality wrong \? because it 's fornication. why is it
fornication \? because they 're not married. why are n't they married \?
because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony. why does the
church refuse to do a marriage ceremony \? because homosexuality is
wrong. in order to break the circle there 's got to be some other
reason to think homosexuality is wrong.

clh

actually , i was n't thinking of the church at all. after all , a couple
does n't have to be married by a minister. a secular justice of the
peace could do the job , and the two people would be married. my point
was that it is easy to find a biblical basis for heterosexual
marriage , but where in the bible would one get a christian marriage
between two people of the same sex \? and if you do see a biblical
basis for same sex marriages , how willing would gay christians be to
save themselves for such a marriage and to never have sexual
intercourse with anyone outside of that marriage relationship \? please
note that i am not trying to imply that gay christians would not be
willing to be so monogamous , i am genuinely interested in hearing
opinions on the subject. i have heard comments from gays in the past
that lead me to believe they regard promiscuity as one of the main
points of being homosexual , yet i tend to doubt that gays who want to
be christian would advocate such a position. so what is the gay view \?

mark

yes , i agree that a reasonable person might conclude that paul is
condemning homosexuality. i was responding to certain details of
your posting. that does n't mean i agree with michael in all
respects. clh

when the protestant reformers opposed and subsequently separated from the
church of rome , the battle cry of the new protesting religion was the
bible , the whole bible , and nothing but the bible . underlying that cry
was a theory that if people could read the bible for themselves in their
native tongue they would discover the truth about god and his purpose.
they would shed their old errors and be united by a common faith.

this idea , that the reformers somehow were the first to bring the
bible to the people in their own language , is a myth. many vernacular
translations of the bible existed long before the reformation. the
vulgate bible , which is still the official version of the bible for the
catholic church , was itself a translation in the common (i.e. vulgar
vulgate) tongue of its day , latin , and had existed for about a millenium
before the reformation.

it might also be noted that the printing press was not even invented
until the same century as that in which the reformation occurred.

recently an e mail to me mentioned

(technically , the messengers are n't even human so
it ca n't be a case of homosexuality even of rape.) ...

the jude reference to sodom is also meaningful only in the context of
the sodomites' lust for the other flesh of angels. again ,
application to homosexual behavior in general , or to the position of
gay christians is largeely specious.

are angels flesh \? no. i feel that this is saying that it was because
of their lust after other men , who are flesh( or of this world).

what are other opinons on this \? i have n't heard much about this verse
at all.

bo reike in the anchor bible volume on james , peter , and jude points
out that all the examples given in this section of jude are distinguishing
the elect from apostates , not just the wicked in general. hence , those
who were delivered from egypt , but did not follow moses (and , by extension ,
god) the apostate angels and sodom and gomorrah. quoting reike

fornication may here , as often in the new testament ,
refer to idolatry , while flesh (as in i pet 1 24)
denotes human society and its violent attempts at self
exaltation. sodom and gommorrah represent the leaders
of apostasy , and the surrounding cities correspond to
their followers. p. 199


there is no inherent reason to read this verse (7) as literally referring
to actual sexual lust for alien flesh . nor is it inherently necessary
to understand it as referring to homosexuality , outside of the circular
reasoning that has already concluded that the sin of sodom is the sin
of homosexuality. the only place that the sin of sodom is specified , and
not merely inferred , is in ezekiel 16 49 this was the guilt of your sister
sodom she and her daughters had pride , excess of food , and prosperous ease ,
bit did not aid the poor and needy. they were haughty , and did abominable
things before me therefore i removed them when i saw it.

for the same reason (overliteralizing the text) your correspondent 's
suggestion that the reason the passage does n't deal with homosexuality
is because the guests were angels and not men is just silly. there
are much more solid reasons for pointing out the irrelevance of the
sodom passages for dealing with homosexuality per se.

the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia
in this. i think we can all agree (with paul) that there are some kinds of
activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or
reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation. we may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories , however and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest
in making them clear , leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions ,
with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated
christian discussion of all these areas.


what is fornication \? (sex outside of marriage , abuse of sex)

is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage \?
is n't it an unatural use of what god has given us \?

why is it that homosexuals are using the grace of god as a license to
practice sin \?

for certain persons have crept in unnoticed , those who were long
beforehand marked out for this condemnation , ungodly persons who
turn the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only
master and lord , jesus christ.

jude 4 (nasb)

what is defined by god as a legitimate marriage \?

for this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother , and
shall cleave to his wife and the shall become one flesh.

gen 2 24 (nasb)

and he answer and said , have you not read , that he who created them
from the beginning made them male and female , and said , 'for this
cause a man shall leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife
and the two shall become one flesh' \? consequently they are no longer
two , but one flesh. what therefore god has joined together , let no
man separate.

there are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus , most of
which christians ignore completely. they never even bother to examine
them. they just assume that they know which ones are moral and
which ones are ritual. well , i have news for you. any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too , but buried pretty deep).
and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus
from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us.

i disagree... every law that is written in leviticus should be looked at
as sin. that is why we have a need for a savior. i can understand
someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the levitcal law , but
i would hope that they would repent when confronted with it.

i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

well , la ti da. so what \? this is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality rape. i know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in defense of bestiality. it is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed , consensual human
adult realtionships) , so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut. if you cannot address the actual issues , you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world. if you want to address bestiality , that is your business , not
mine. and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings. you want to dismiss us , and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

also i noticed that the preceeding verses say.

also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her
menstrual impurity. and you shall not have intercourse with your
neighbors wife , to be defiled with her.


leviticus 18 19 , 20 (nasb)

these verses are just as relevant as

you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an
abomination.

leviticus 18 22 (nasb)

why was god telling the israelites not to practice such things \?

do not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these
the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled.
for the land has become defiled , therefore i have visited its
punishment upon it , so the land has spewed out its inhabitants.
but as for you , you are to keep my statutes and judgments , and
shall not do any of these abominations , neither the native , nor
the alien who sojourns among you

leviticus 18 24 26 (nasb)

he is the lord... listen to what he has to say...

nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals. we do love you , but we do n't
agree that what you practice is not sin. you have not truly repented
of your sin. we hate the sin that is within your lives. i hate sin
that is in my life. all christians should hate the sin that is within
their own lives. confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance.
yes i agree with john 3 17 , but i also know that jesus said , repent for
the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt 3 17. if you do n't agree that
homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it \? this means that
you remain in bondage to it. repent from it and god will set you free.

i'm trying to find my way to god , but find it difficult as i ca n't hear
god talking to me , letting me know that he exists and is with me and
that he knows me , and i feel that i ca n't possibly get to know him until
he does. maybe he is talking to me but i just do n't know or understand
how to listen.

some christians tell me that (in their opinion) the only way to find god
is to take a plunge and commit your life to him , and you will discover.
this idea of diving into the totally unknown is a little bit
frightening , but i have a few questions.

1) how do you actually commit yourself \? if i just say , ok god , her you
go , i'm committing my life to you , i would n't really feel that he 'd
listened at least , i could n't be sure that he had. so how does one (or
how did you) commit oneself to god \?

2) in committing myself in this way , what do i have to forfeit of my
current life \? what can i no longer do \? i feel that i'm as 'good' as many
christians , and i try to uphold the idea of 'loving your neighbour' i
do n't go round killing people , stealing , etc. , and i try not to get
jealous of other people in any way and i would say that i keep to the
standards of treating other people as well as many christians. so what
do i have to give up \?

3) when committed , what do i have to do \? what does it involve \? what (if
any) burdens am i taking on \?

4) so then , what 's the general difference before and after \? i assume ,
that (like on your birthday you do n't suddenly feel a year older) it
wo n't suddenly change my life the day i commit myself. so what happens \?

5) how can i be sure that it is the right thing to do \? how can i find
out what the 'it' in the last sentence actually is \? !

thanks very much for all your help in answering these questions. perhaps

heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity , innocence
and modesty , and their importance.



the most beautiful virtues

this story is an excerpt taken from the basket of flowers by
johann christoph von schmid


in a certain little market town , over a hundred years ago , there
lived an upright and intelligent man named jacob rede. he was
married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in
a humble home which was in the midst of a large , beautiful val
ley. after living many , happy years together , jacob 's wife died ,
leaving him alone with only one friend...his daughter mary. even
as a child mary was uncommonly pretty but as she grew in years ,
her piety , her innocence , her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss
towards all she came in contact with , gave to her beauty a rare
and peculiar charm. her face was lighted up with a look of such
indescribable goodness , that it seemed almost as though one
looked upon an angel.

mary 's greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour
ite flowers were the violet , the lily and the rose. jacob loved
to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her
gender. when she once , early in march brought the first violet to
him and joyfully called upon him to admire it , he said

let the modest violet , my dear mary , be to you an image of humil
ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret. it clothes
itself in the tender colours of modesty it prefers to bloom in
retired grots it fills the air with its fragrance while remain
ing hidden beneath the leaves. may you also , my dear mary , be
like the retiring violet , avoiding vain display , not seeking to
attract the public eye , but preferring ever to do good in
quietude and peace.

one morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the
garden appeared in its richest array , jacob said to his daughter ,
as he pointed out a beautiful lily , which was beaming in the
morning sun

let the lily my dear child , be to you the emblem

to preserve pure. easily is the petal of the lily soiled touch
it but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind. in the
same way , a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence !
then pointing to a rose he said

let the rose my dear mary , be to you an emblem of modesty. more
beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to
the cheek of a modest girl. it is a sign that she is still pure
of heart and innocent in thought. happy is the maiden whom the
suggestion of a thought that is indelicate , will cause to blush ,
as she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger.
the cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with
their roseate hue , while those which fail to blush at the least
indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan , and go
before their time to the grave.




among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one
that was prized above all the others. it was an apple tree , not
much larger than a rose bush , and stood by itself in the middle
of the garden. mary 's father had planted it the day that she was
born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples. once it
blossomed earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance. the
tree was one mass of blossom. mary was so delighted with it that
she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at
it. once , when it was in full bloom , she called to her father
and said

look father , how beautiful ! was there ever such a lovely mingling
of red and white \? the whole tree looks like one huge bunch of
flowers !

the next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes
once more upon the tree. but what was her grief to see that the
frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers. they were all
become brown and yellow and when the sun came forth in its
strength they withered and fell to the ground. mary wept bitter
tears at the sight. then said the father

thus , does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth. oh my
child , never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced
from the path of right ! behold in the example of the apple tree
an image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way
if the hopes your conduct hitherto has raised in my heart
should vanish , not merely for a day or year , but for life. ah ,
then how much more bitter would be the tears which i would shed
over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your
cheeks ! life would have no joys for me with tears in my eyes i
should

6







go down sorrowfully to my grave.

as he spoke , the tears stood in his eyes mary was deeply moved ,
and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her
mind that she never forgot them.

under the eyes of a father so loving and wise , and amid the
flowers of her garden , mary grew daily in stature and intelli
gence blooming as a rose , pure as a lily and retiring as a
violet , and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom.

happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the
fruits of his garden rewarded his diligent toil but with how
much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect
produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his
pious teaching and example.

jacob plucked several roses and lilies , tied them together in a
bunch and gave them to mary with the words

the lily and the rose , sister flowers as they are , belong the one
to the other both incomparable in their beauty , they are ren
dered still more lovely by being together. in the same way my
dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and
cannot be separated




the greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the thought
of the presence of god

ezek 22 26 god seems to be upset with the priests who have made no
difference between the holy and the profane. this brought to my mind a
sermon i heard recently in which the speaker said god 's second name does
not begin with a d referring , i believe , to use of god 's holy name and
titles as swear words. i was also reminded of the experience of moses at
the burning bush when god told him take off your sandals , for the place
where you are standing is holy ground.

these and other texts seem to imply that god 's people must treat holy
things differently from other common things , or make a difference
between holy and common things.

the obvious questions are

what makes something holy \? and how are christians (primarily) supposed to
make this difference between holy and common things \? (e.g. god 's name ,

if babies are not supposed to be baptised then why does n't the bible
ever say so. it never comes right and says only people that know
right from wrong or who are taught can be baptised.

this is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. it assumes that
if the bible does n't say specifically that you do n't need to do something ,
then that must mean that you do need to do it. i know there 's a specific
term for this form of logic , but it escapes me right now. however , if it
were sound , then you should be able to apply it this way if the bible
does n't specifically say that something is wrong , then it must be ok ,
which , coincidentally , leads perfectly into a question i 've often pondered.

this is no less logical than the assumption that if something is
not in the bible , then it must not be done. but i do n't really
think that 's what he 's saying anyway. see below.

if slavery is immoral (which i believe it is , can i assume that everyone
else in this group does too \? ) , why does n't jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it \? owning slaves was common practice back then. paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral. he apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. why
does n't anyone mention slavery \? if god 's morals are eternal and do n't
change like the morals of society , then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today.

what about the letter to philemon \? in it paul at least hints that a
certain slave be released. also , slavery in those times was not the
same as the type of slavery we had in the u.s. i think a better
comparison would be to indentured servitude. i do n't really want to get
into a discussion on slavery. anyway , although it does demonstrate your
point , i do n't think it is relevent , because the original poster did not
say that absence of specific condemenation proves something is not
immoral.

back to the original poster 's assertion. he is not in fact making
the logical error of which you accuse him. he stated the fact that the
bible does not say that babies cannot be baptized. also , we know that
the bible says that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven.
everyone includes infants , unless there is other scripture to the
contrary , i.e. an exception. since there is no exception listed in the
bible , we must assume (to be on the safe side) that the bible means what
it says , that everyone must be baptized to enter heaven. and so we
baptize infants.

to summarize , you accused the original poster of saying if something
is not forbidden by the bible , then that proves it is ok i.e. if
something cannot be disproven , it is true. he rather seemed to be
asserting that since the bible does not forbid , you cannot prove ,
using the bible , that it is not ok. there is a difference between
proving whether or not something can be proven or disproven (there are
theories on provability in the field of logic , by the way) and actually
proving or disproving it. the other logical error we must avoid falling
into is the converse that if something cannot be proven , then it is
false. this seems to be the error of many sola scriptura believers.

i think the only thing that can be proven here is that one cannot use
scripture alone to prove something either way about infant baptism ,
although the evidence seems to me to favor it.

how people should be baptized

the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way. since god knows everything , he therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us. we have free will , and are able to change
what happens to us. however , since god knows everything , he knows all

cliff slaughterbeck

people would not be willing to. note that the church was not willing
to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women. the
one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a
presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they do n't accept
ordination of women. the argument is that we ca n't have half the
church not accepting the leaders of the other half. maybe people will
clh

it might be interesting for folk to know that the church of scotland
(also a presbyterian church) managed to agree to disagree over
women 's ordination for 25 years. the reasoning was that congregations
are free to call whoever they wish , and that ministers and sessions
choose elders. if a congregation did not wish to have a woman , they
were not obliged to , and if a session did not wish to , they could not
be forced to. (note that the who issue of freedom to call on the part
of the congregation is very important here this year is the 150th
annivarsary of the disruption , where the church split on that very
issue , they did n't get back together for almost 80 years).

a couple of years ago on the 25 anniversary of the allowing of womens
ordination the position was changed so that , in theory , all
ministers and elders must recognise that women can be ordained. in
theory , a minister who refused to ordain a woman to his session , or
refused to work with a woman minister in presbytery , could be
disciplined. in practice this has not happened , and i believe it is
unlikely to happen. my personal view is that the new legislation was
a mistake , and that the permissive (but not prescriptive) legislation
worked very well.

we are going to start going round the homosexual debate at next years
assembly. at this years , a motion was put to ban the blessing of
same sex couples (after an edinburgh minister did so). our panel on
doctrine is currently looking at marriage , and will report next year
the matter will be considered and debated then.

while this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of
christianity gerry palo has made some comparisons to asian religious
beliefs on this topic which have simplified the asian idea of karma
to the point of misrepresentation.

i realized that my generalizations would probably have problems
under scrutiny from various asian points of view. they need to be
discussed in detail , indeed. but for the purposes of this newsgroup
and thread thus far and in this newsgroup , i risked oversimpli
fication. my main purpose was to emphasize that i was not coming
from a buddhist or hindu point of view. as you observed , the
main context is that of christianity. but by all means , add comments
and corrections as you find them.

i wrote a longer reply addressing some of your points , but decided
to not post it. perhaps it would be more appropriate for soc.religion.
eastern. instead i just add the following couple of items about karma
and reincarnation as i see the matter from an anthroposophical and
a christian point of view.

1. karma is not simple reward and punishment dealt out by a judging
deity .

2. reincarnation is not the same as being born again.

3. reincarnation is not the same as the resurrection of the body.

4. reincarnation and karma do not contradict the fundamental teachings
of christianity about god , the fall , the being. incarnation , death ,
and resurrection of christ , his coming again , sin , grace , forgiveness ,
salvation , and the last judgement.

is n't origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among christian thinkers \? what were his views , and how did he relate them
to the christian scriptures \?

jack carroll

origen 's work was mostly lost. he was not anathematized , to my knowledge ,
but his writing comes down largely in fragments and quotations from enemies.
perhaps someone else can comment on origen. i do n't know if there
is a specific statement about reincarnation from him , but from what i do
know about him he probably did hold to the teaching in one form or another.

i do n't know too much about the history of the idea of reincarnation in
the church. however , i heard an interesting story about pope john paul ii
from an astronomer who teaches at the university of cracow. the pope likes
to go to poland for a scientific conference every couple of years so he
can relax and talk polish to friends and fellow countrymen. my acquaintance ,
an anthroposophist , related the fact that woitila knew about steiner and
anthroposophy from his early days. before he became a priest he was an
actor in a dramatic company in cracow whose leader was a pupil of steiner
and based his acting and directing methods on steiner 's indications. part
of the work was the study of the basic works of anthroposophy. well ,
going to this conference with him a few years ago , the astronomer and another
polish anthroposophist thought they would ask the pope what he thought about
anthroposophy. they chickened out at the last minute , but one of them did ask
him what he thought about reincarnation. the pope smiled and said ,
actually there have been quite a few good catholics who believed in
reincarnation , and he proceeded to name several from the earliest times
to modern times. then he changed the subject. my polish friend did not
say whether origen was among those he mentioned.

gerry palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)

as far as i know origen himself was not anathematized. he was
controversial , but avoided outright condemnation during his lifetime.
however some of his views were condemned at a council in alexandria in
400 and two councils in constantinople in 543 and 553. i am fairly
sure the preexistence of souls is one of the doctrines condemned.

what is the basis of the idea of hell being a place of eternal
suffering \? if it is biblical , please reference.

here 's my train of thought if god is using the earth to manufacture
heavenly beings , then it is logical that there would be a certain
yield , and a certain amount of waste. the yield goes to heaven , and
the waste is burned (destroyed) in hell. why is it necessary to
punish the waste , rather than just destroy it \?

luke 16 talks about the rich man and lazarus. matthew 25 talks about
the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. revelations
20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are
thrown. matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and
the fire of hell. it seems quite clear that there is this place where
a fire burns forever. from the revelations passages it is clear that
the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. from the
matthew 25 passage it does n't seem abundantly clear whether the
punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or
in the sense of continual.

from dale 's question , i come away with the suggestion that hell ,
if it were short , might be an acceptable alternative to living
forever with the source of life , peace and joy i.e. the
unbeliever ceases to exist. whereas , if punishment goes on
continually , then one should have a greater motivation to avoid it.
it definately seems to me that hell is something we want to avoid
regardless of its exact nature.

there seem to be two main questions in dale 's thought
what is god 's main plan on earth \?
why is continual punishment a necessary part of hell as opposed
to simply destroying completely those who refuse god \?

i believe that god 's main plan is to have a genuine relationship
with people.

the nature of hell and the reasons for its nature seem a lot more
difficult to ascertain. it does seem clear that hell is something
to avoid. at a minimum , hell is the state one is in when one has
nothing to do with god.

in the bible , i am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of
hell beyond the general of hot , unpleasant and torment. for instance ,
it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can
continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or
whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is
burned up. if you can forgive the graphicalness , if you throw a
physical body into a fire , assuming the person starts out alive ,
at some fairly quick point , the nerves are destroyed and pain is
no longer sensed. it is not stated what occurs when at the judgement ,
the unbelievers , (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell
i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they ca n't feel physical
pain. what could be sensed continually is that those in hell are
to be forever without god.

the lazarus rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener
think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people
wo n't listen to god even after he rises from the dead. the point of
the parable is to reach the hard hearted here who are not listening
to the fact of the resurrection nor the gospel about jesus christ.
it seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is
not even remotely pleasant.

this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults , since
both have souls. infants must be baptized , therefore , or they cannot
enter into heaven. they too need this form of life in them , or they
cannot enter into heaven.

are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking jesus to come into
your heart and accepting him as your savior , but is just a ritual that we
must go through to enable us to enter heaven \?

i do n't think joe was saying any such thing. however , your question
on asking jesus to come into your heart seems to imply that infants
are not allowed to have christ in theirs. why must baptism always be
viewed by some people as a sort of prodigal son type of thing i.e. a
sudden change of heart , going from not accepting christ to suddenly
accepting christ \? why ca n't people start out with christ from shortly
after birth , and build their relationship from there \? after all , does
a man suddenly meet a woman , and then marry her that same day \? from my
experiences , i 've learned that all relationships must be built ,
including one 's relationship with god.

also joe is speaking from the standpoint that baptism is not just a

recipient. certainly for those with the mental faculties to know christ
it is necessary to believe in him. however , the sacrament itself
bestows grace on the recipient , and makes a permanent mark of adoption

just a quick comment. as a baptist clergyperson , i find the idea
of such a baptism (if the news report is in fact accurate , and
they seldom are regarding religion) offensive. the pastor here seems
to have a most unbaptist view of baptism one that seems to demand the
ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.

we do baptize converts , but no one who has been deceived into hearing
the word is likely to be a convert. if in fact the grace of god might
work in such a situation , there is no harm done in waiting a day or
two.

baptist believe in regenerate membership. did this church include these
half baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship \? or do they
somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose \?

this kind of evangelism is certainly not baptist , and probably not
very christian , either.

ofm writes

this is an issue throughout the presbyterian church. on the other
side , one of the major churches in cincinnati has been ordaining
homosexual elders , and has ignored presbytery instructions not to do
so. and the church in rochester where the judicial commission said
they could n't install a homosexual pastor has made her an
evangelist . these situations , as well as the one you describe , do
not appear to be stable. this will certainly be a major topic for the
general assembly next month. if the church ca n't come up with a
solution that will let people live with each other , i think we 're end
up with a split. clearly neither side wants that , but i think we 'll
get pushed into it by actions of both sides.

clh

the moderator of the general assembly , the rev. john fife , visited our
church about a week ago (just 4 days after rev. spahr it 's been a busy
week for our small church ! ! ). he was asked specifically about the issue
of homosexuality and what he thinks will happen at the ga meeting next
month. evidently , there are 15 20 known resolutions pending that range
the gamut from outlawing homosexuality altogether to legalizing it
completely. he will readily admit that this is probabaly the most difficult
issue that the church has had to deal with since the presbyterian church
split in two over the issue of slavery more than 100 years ago. without
question , the issue may split the church again after we 've been reunited
for all of a dozen years or so. he is hopeful that it will not and is
pushing the same attitude that helped the church deal with the abortion
issue last year as a solution.

he is hoping to pass a resolution that more or less states that we , the
members of the church agree to disagree on the issue , admitting that
both sides have honestly studied the scriptures and had the spirit lead
them to different conclusions. it worked last year when the abortion
issue threatened to do more or less the same thing , and he is hopeful that
the ga can foster a loving and caring attitude about people who disagree
with their own view.

it 's going to be hard to agree to disagree. if we allow
disagreement , then some presbyteries and churches are going to ordain
people that others will not recognize. that 's a difficult situation
in a connectional church. i could live with it , but i think a lot of
people would not be willing to. note that the church was not willing
to live with this kind of compromise with ordination of women. the
one thing that will definitely prevent a person from becoming a
presbyterian minister is if they indicate that they do n't accept
ordination of women. the argument is that we ca n't have half the
church not accepting the leaders of the other half. maybe people will
decide to live with it in this case when they did n't in the other , but
i wonder. i admit that my own presbytery submitted an overture to the
ga that would have exactly this effect , and we considered the
ambiguity better than the current situation. clh

there are other interpretations to christian history in this matter.
one must recall that most of what we know about the gnostics was
written by their enemies. eusebius claims that jesus imparted secret
information to peter , james , and john after his resurrection , and that
those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the twelve
(eusebius , historia ecclesiastica ii 1 3 4).

this is curious. i read in eh ...

the lord imparted the gift of knowledge to james the just , to john
and peter after his resurrection , these delivered it to the rest of
the apostles , and they to the seventy , of whom barnabas was one.

eusebius , ecclesiastical history

it seems that the lord imparted the gift of knowledge , not that the
lord imparted secret information.

...

apostles. interestingly enough , eusebius refers to the groups which
we today call gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (eusebius ,
op. cit. , iii , 32 7 8). his gripe was not that thay professed a
gnosis , but that they had the wrong one.

i'm afraid that i cannot find this portrayal in eh .
i do n't see anywhere in 3 32 7 8 where eusebius mentions that certain
gnostics had the wrong gnosis.

the closest is when eusebius summarizes hegesippus' statements ,
...whilst if there were any at all , that attempted to pervert
the sound doctrine of the saving gospel , they were yet skulking
in dark retreats...

now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways. i
do n't intend that everyone interpret christian history as i do , but i
believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted , of course) of
early christian rites analogous to those practiced by mormons today.

favorably interpreted \? just in looking at two of the four
references that you gave (i have the eh handy , irenaeus and the
clemetine recognitions i will have to look for) i see no room for
such 'interpretations.'

and any such 'interpretation' still falls short of an equivalence to
the temple ceremonies.

the links for jay 's using eh for support are imparting the gift
of knowledge imparted secret information being given secret
signs and tokens to gain entrance to heaven. but there is not
enough equivalence between the the ideas for us to be able to call
this favorable interpretation. it appears to be closer to
fabrication.

some years ago possibly as many as five there was a discussion on
numerology. (that 's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add
up the letters in words , in an effort to prove something or another. i can
never make any sense of how it 's supposed to work or what it 's supposed to
prove.)

somebody posted a long article about numerology in the bible , saying
things like this proves the intricate planning of the scriptures , else
these patterns would not appear .

then there was a brilliant followup , which was about numerology in all the
other numerology posts. stuff like the word `numerology' adds up to 28 ,
and the word appears 28 times in the posting ! such elegant planning !
further , the word `truth' also adds up to 28 the writer is using these
numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology !
(these examples are made up by me just as examples.)

i really liked that reply , because it did such an excellent job of showing
that these patterns can be found in just about anything. however , i did
not save a copy of it. i do not remember the author. i'm only 90 sure
that it was posted to this newsgroup.

there is a paragraph in the new testament which in my opinion , clearly makes
a positive inference to reincarnation. i do n't remember which one it is off of
the top of my head , but it basically goes like this jesus is talking with the
apostles and they ask him why the pharisees say that before the messiah can
come elijah must first come. jesus replies that elijah has come , but they did
not recognize him. it then says that the apostles perceived that he was refering
to john the baptist. this seems to me to clearly imply reincarnation.

this was a popular belief in the judaism of jesus` time , that elijah
would return again (as he had been taken in to heaven in a chariot and
did not actually die). however jesus was referring to john the
baptist not in the sense that elijah was reincarnated as john
(remember elijah didn`t die) but that john was a similar prophet to
elijah. john was a fiery preacher , he wore sackcloth and wandered
rough through israel preaching the coming kingdom. the verses that
describe him (in mark`s gospel) can be linked to ot references about
elijah. hence john was similar to elijah and jesus was drawing the
parallels between the two just as he drew parallels with the suffering
servant in isaiah (and other messianic figures) and himself.

a brief reply but i don`t have time to look up all the relevant stuff.

suffice to say there is a very strong explanation.

subject re the arrogance of christians
organization representing my own views and not that of my company here.
lines 122

news@cbnewsk.att.com writes
arrogance is arrogance. it is not the result of religion , it is the result
of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one 's desire to show
others of one 's rightness. i assume that god decided to be judge for our
sake as much as his own , if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the
judge , we 'll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged
ourselves.

i'm not sure i agree with this 100 . i agree that arrogance is not the result
of religion and that god is a far better judge than we are. i also agree if
you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one 's
superior knowledge , rightness , or holiness over another person 's beliefs.

i need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that i do not fall
into the mistake of misrepresenting your views. if i fall down in this area
i hope you will forgive me.

arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that
one 's god is greater than the god 's of others or of believing that one 's
religion is better than other religions. these are all naturally self implied
beliefs.

it is self contradictory to say that i believe my current beliefs to be wrong.
were i to find myself in error , my beliefs would naturally change and follow
what i believe to be right. therefore , i must always consider my beliefs
correct. that 's not arrogance. that 's unavoidable behavior.

it is nonsense to say that i believe another person 's god to be greater than
my god. were his or her god greater , would n't i be obligated to change so
that their god would become my god \? we are naturally obligated to worship
that god which we deem to be the greatest. why should we feel obligated to
worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble \?

arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more
intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person. no
doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile. were passive observation
of one 's superior points arrogance , then god would be most arrogant of all.

humility does not rest in slandering or belittling god 's work of creation in
our lives. people often go around trying to be humble saying to one another ,
i'm not very smart. i'm poor. i'm not good looking. i'm just a worm in
the ground. i'm such a weak person and although i do n't want to sin , i
really cannot help it. were this person truely humble , he would take a
different approach. god , thank you for making me the way you did. i know
that you never do anything second best. yet with all that you have given me ,
i have been so unthankful. you 've given me power to resist the devil. i
have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said
not to do. i have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself
with humility for doing so. lord , with all you 've given me , i have been
completely unfaithful and i do not deserve your forgiveness. and , yet your
love for me is so boundless that you would give yourself to die for me to
save me. as terribly evil as i am , i deserve to go straight to hell , yet it
pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life i 've led. lord ,
please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that i can bring
glory to your name instead of insult. lord i'm so sorry for my wrongs. please
help me to change.


i think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because
they do n't want to be wrong. if i find someone arrogant , i typically
do n't have anything to do with them.

for me , i 've often found it hard to tell the difference. often times , the
most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most
proud worm in the ground false humility type person has been found to be
most comfortable company.

when i'm wrong and arrogant about my wrongness , i certainly do n't feel like
being confronted by my wrongness. were someone to confront me verbally with
my wrongness , i 'd be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for
all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.
at the root , my desire would be to make them shut up so that i can go about
living my life arrogantly as i wish. however , were someone to confront me
silently by their example , earn my respect , and perhaps mention it to me in
humility in private , i 'd feel broken down and challenged to seek god for help
in changing from the error of my ways.

the hard part is getting to the point to where i can be humble before anyone
regardless of their humility or pride regardless of their hypocricy or
sincerity regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.
it is n't easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity
to improve in one 's ability to serve god. it 's easier to cast aside any hope
of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering god 's creation
in our lives instead.

but we should examine ourselves i hope i typed this back in right
and why we react to certain situations with such emotions. for instance ,
many of us feel justified to be insulted by an arrogant person. as if
we needed a reason to feel insulted. but after being insulted over and
over again by the words of others , you 'd think we 'd either toughen up
or decide not to be insulted , or ignore the insult. just because you
can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage , that does n't make that
reaction the appropriate one. it is in this light of self examination
that we can change our emotional reactions.


sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between
what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous
statement of our character. the devil is the accuser of the bretheren. he
would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant
and self righteous where we are indeed wrong. the devil 's aim is to get us
into as much misery as he can. just think of the devil as a cruel and merci
less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with
hot irons. the way the devil gets under the father 's skin is by hurting
those that the father loves so much.




i deplore the horrible crime of child murder...
we want prevention , not merely punishment.
we must reach the root of the evil...
it is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt
from the dreadful deed...
no mater what the motive , love of ease ,
or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent ,
the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed...
but oh ! thrice guilty is he who drove her
to the desperation which impelled her to the crime.

i am interested in finding out why people become
atheists after having believed in some god god.
in conversing with them on other groups , i 've
often sensed anger or hostility. though i do n't
mean to imply that all atheists are angry or hostile ,
it does seem to be one motivation for giving up
faith. thus , some atheism might result from
broken ness.

i 'd like to field this one , if i may. although i am a believer in and follower
of christ , my experiences with religion have n't been all that positive. in
fact , there was one point in my life when , for about three days , i simply
could n't believe in the existence of god. anyway , when i look back upon the
troubles i 've had , they seem to fall into two categories impulses to
unbelief that resulted from logical contradictions , and impulses to unbelief
that resulted from frustration with god.

the first category does n't occur to me much anymore , as i have worked through
most of the arguments for the non existence of god. but way back when , these
would cause me some problems , and i would have to struggle with my faith to
continue to believe. i can see where others less stubborn than i (and i do
mean stubborn. stubborness has often been the only thing standing between
me an atheism from time to time) would fail.

the second category arises out of some long term personal difficulties and
the struggle to live my life as god would have me live it without living my
life as others would tell me how god would have me live it. a good example of
this is my struggle with the more radical christians i meet. i am not , nor
have i ever been , on fire for chirst , and i do n't think i ever want to be.
nevertheless , i am not lukewarm about my faith , so i do n't really
fit in with the mainstream either. quite naturally , i feel a lot of anxiety
about my dislocation within christian society , and it can lead to a lot of
internal tension , when i want to do what i know is right ,
but when another part of me believes that what i want to do is wrong because
all the other christians think so to. quite naturally , this tension has a
destructive effect on my relationship with god , and during all of this internal
strife , there 's atheism sitting there like the promised land no rules , no
responsibilities , no need to live up to anyone 's expectations but my own.
complete freedom. of course , it 's all an illusion , but nevertheless , it 's a
very appealing illusion , especially when the so called people of god are
behaving like total twits. i can easily understand why someone would go
that route , and would be hostile to ever coming back.

imho , many of the former christians turned atheists who are now actively
hostile to christianity are so because their experience with christ and god
was n't a very peaceful one , but one of mind control and shut up and do what
you 're told because we know what 's best for you because it 's god 's will and
you 're to young to know what god 's will is yet courtesy of some of christ 's
more overzealous followers.

a final reason why people become atheists is because christians do not have a
very good reputation right now. one of the things that attracted people to
christianity in the ancient days was the love that christians obviously had
for one another and the world around them. unlike the rest of the world ,
christian communities actively cared for their poor , and the christian rich
did not trod on the backs of their poorer brothers , but bent down to help
them. christians were known for living exemplary lives , even if they were
thought to be traitors to the state because they would n't sacrifice to the
emporer. nowadays , courtesy of the media and some christian leaders who lost
christ on their way to power , people see christians as sexually repressed
hippocritical busibodies who want to remake society into a facist version of
their own moral view.

there are a lot more reasons why people become atheists , but i do n't have time
to go into them right now.

eze 3 18. if ezekiel failed to do his duty and warn the wicked ,
not only would the wicked die in his sins but the lord would hold
ezekiel responsible ! similarly parents are responsible to teach
their children right from wrong. i suspect most christians (and
jews etc.) would agree that parents have this responsibility.

not exactly correct , but nice try. the catholic doctrine of infallibility

ok , a few days back , the below included message was posted stating

i believe with everything in my heart that on may 3 , 1993 , the city of
portland , oregon in the country of the united states of america will be hit
with a catastrophic and disastrous earthquake...

by now , we know that this did not come to pass....

...i do n't think it 's particularly
glorifying to god to say things like well , i think the lord is telling me... ,
..such statements seem to me to be an attempt to get a spiritual thrill should
the guess happen to come true , without risking the guilt of false prophecy
should it fail to come to pass. i do not believe genuine prophecy was ever
like this. comments \?


i agree. people should not be misled to believe thus sayeth the lord by
innuendo or opinion or speculation.

speak directly. if the lord has given you something to say , say it.
but , before i declare thus sayeth the lord , i 'd better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that i am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain , again , without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.

mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous. for me , my greatest fears
in this area would be the following

1 that the people would be misled
2 that people would lose respect for christianity
3 that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies
4 were god to call me to be a prophet and i were to misrepresent god 's word ,
my calling would be lost forever. god 's word would command the people
never to listen to or fear my words as i would be a false prophet. my
bridges would be burnt forever. perhaps i could repent and be saved , but
i could never again be a prophet of god.

in the light of this , it is critical that we speak when the lord says speak
and that we be silent when the lord says to be silent lest we deprive the
world of god 's word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate ,
cowardly silence or by our false statements. and because of this , it
is critically important that we remain close to the lord , in his word , and
in prayer , and filled with the spirit of god so that we know the difference.

in this day and age , sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging
one another , claiming rights that are not theirs , denying rights that do
indeed belong to others , demanding equal respect for all the gods of this
world , and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel
good.

it 's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood. when we say , thus sayeth the
lord , it happens. when we pray , prayer is answered because we prayed right.
when we say we 're christians , we really mean it.

should any system of belief or practice to which people are

hey folks ,

i'm fairly new to these groups , tho' some have heard from me before.

i 'd like to get your comments on a question that has been on my mind a
lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents \?
in normal dreams , you ca n't control anything , so obviously
you are n't morally responsible for your actions. but if you can contrive
to control the action in dreams or do an oobe , it seems like a morality applies.

now , there seem to be 3 alternatives

1) dreams and oobes are totally mental phenomena. in this case no morality
applies beyond what might be called 'mental hygiene' , that is , not trying
to think about anything evil , or indulgining in overly sexy or violent
thoughts.

2) dreams and oobes have a reality of their own (i.e. are 'another plane')
evidence for this is that often dreams and oobes are sometimes done in
common by more than one person. a
mark of objective fact is that 1 people report the same objective experience.
in this case , the same interpersonal morality ethics applies in dreams and
oobes as does in waking life.

3) like (2) , but here we assume that though the dreeam and oobe environs have a
real existence , a different moral ethics apply there , and no (or maybe
different) moral laws apply there.

so... there it is. is one of these cases the truth , or does anyone know
of another alternative \? respond by post or email.

thanks very much

the source and nt meaning
of arsenokoitai , with implications
for christian ethics and ministry


james b. deyoung
professor of new testament
western conservative baptist seminary
portland , oregon

traditional interpretation of arsenokoitai ( homosexuals ) in 1 cor 6 9
and 1 tim 1 10 refers to sexual vice between people of the same sex ,
specifically homosexualitiy. some restrict the term 's meaning to active male
prostititute , but stronger evidence supports a more general translation ,
namely homosexuals. more recently the definition homosexual has been
opposed on clutural and linguistic grounds , the claim being that the term
homosexuals is anachronistic. in addition , criticism of the traditional
rendering says the term today includes celibate homophiles , excludes
heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts , and includes female homosexuals.
a concern for acts instead of the modern attention to desires was the only
factor in the ancient world. the foregoing oppositition to the translation of
arsenokoitai by homosexuals has a number of debilitating weaknesses.
finally , this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai , deriving it
from the lxx of lev 20 12 (cf. 18 22) and using it for homosexual orientation
and behavior , the latter of which should be an occasion for church discipline
(i cor 5 6) and legislation in society (1 tim 1 8 11).



introduction

coincident with the rise of the gay rights movement in recent years has
been an increasing focus on the biblical statements regarding homosexuality or
sodomy. as part of this focus , the meaning of the term arsenokoitai , used
twice by the apostle paul (1 cor 6 9 , i tim 1 10) , has received vigorous
scrutiny. this issue is particularly crucial to contemporary society since
so much of modern ethics is shaped by biblical statements. more particularly ,
the concern over gay rights and the place of gays or homosexuals in the church
and in society require the resolution of biblical interpretation.

this study of historical , linguistic , and literary matters will survey and
evalutate recent proposals for the meaning of arsenokoitai and present evidence
to point to a resolution. several writers and their positions represent the
modern debate on this word. three authors , bailey , boswell , and scroggs , have
provoked considerable discussion and significantly encouraged the wider
acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle in society , in the church , and in the
ministry.


footnotes

1. for convenience sake , the term homosexual is used to encompass both
same sex orientation and same sex behavior. the meaning of this term is one of
the main considerations of this study.
2. these times are differnt from just over a century ago. then p fairbairn
(pastoral epistles edinburg , 1874) 891) could write of arsenokoitai thit it
is a term for which fortunately our language has no proper equivalent.
unknowingly he thereby touched upon the basis for the contemporary debate and
study. the present writer endorses the pauline authorship of the pastoral
epistles on the basis of internal and external evidence (see donald guthrie ,
new testament introduction , 4th ed 1990 621 649 , for an extensive
discussion and citation of supporters of the pauline authorship).

catholics view the effects of baptism slightly differently , and that 's
one primary reason why they baptize babies. they believe that baptism
produces a change in the soul of the baby , quite independently of any
volitional act on the part of the baby. this change in the baby 's soul
gives the infant certain capabilities that he would not have
without baptism. since the infant does not have the use of his
intellect and will yet , these new faculties are dormant. but as the
child gets older , the gifts of baptism come more and more into play.

i guess i would react rather strongly to this line of thinking carried
out ! when you think your army is stronger than mine , you would
righteously take my children and baptize them , doing what you know is
really best for them.
you cannot possibly put this kind of action , nor the crusades into the
context of the teachings of jesus god. i think he advocated a different
approach that was by design made to be appealing , to those called by him ,
not chosen by a church practice.
it seems to me you have the cause and effect switched , the change comes
and then you get baptized.

i , not dave davis , wrote

the deutero canonical books were added much later in the church 's
history. they do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of
scripture. i do not believe the church that added these books was
guided by the spirit in so doing. and that is where this sort of
discussion ultimately ends.

sorry , i put my foot in my mouth , concerning the church 's history.
it is correct to say that the council of hippo 393 listed the
deuterocanonical books among those accepted for use in the
church , and that this was ratified by the council of carthage ,
and by pope innoent i and gelasius i (414 ad).

yet eerdman 's history of the church says

at the end of the fourth century views still differed in regard to
the extent of the canon , or the number of the books which should
be acknowledged as divine and authoritative.

the jewish canon , or the hebrew bible , was universally
received , while the apocrypha added to the greek version
of the septuagint were only in a general way accounted as books
suitable for church reading , and thus as a middle class between
canonical and strictly apocryphal (pseudonymous) writings.
and justly for those books , while they have great historical
value , and fill the gap between the old testament and the new ,
all originated after the cessation of prophecy , and the cannot
be therefore regarded as inspired , nor are they ever cited
by christ or the aposteles.

in the western church the canon of both testaments was closed
at the end of the fourth century through the authority of
jerome (who wavered , however , between critical doubts and the
principle of tradition) , and more especially of augustine ,
who firmly followed the alexandrian canon of the septuagint ,
and the preponderant tradition in reference to the catholic
epistles and the revelation though he himself , in some
places , inclines to consider the old testament apocrypha
as deutero canonical , bearing a subordinate authority.

this history goes on to say that augustine attended both the
council of hippo and of carthage.

it is interesting to note , however , the following footnote to
the fourth session of the council of trent. the footnote
lists various synods which endorsed lists of canonical
books , but then says the tridentine list or decree was the
first infallible and effectually promulgated declaration
on the canon of the holy scriptures.

which leads one to think that the rc canon was not official
until trent. thus my previous erroneous statement was
not entirely groundless.

it is also interesting to note that the council of trent
went on to uphold the old latin vulgate edition of
the scriptures as authentic. which , i would suppose ,
today 's catholic scholars wish the council had never said.
also the council made no distinction between deutero canonical
and canonical books in contrast to (eerdman 's statement of) the
fourth century views.

while this is essentially a discussion of reincarnation in the context of
christianity gerry palo has made some comparisons to asian religious
beliefs on this topic which have simplified the asian idea of karma
to the point of misrepresentation.

there are significant differences in the idea of karma among hindus ,
jains , buddhists (and even among the various buddhist traditions.)

to refer to karma as a system of reward for past deeds is totally
incorrect in the buddhist and jain traditions. karma is considered to
be a moral process in which intentions (either good or evil) shape
a person 's predilections for future intention and action and
produce a person who is more prone to good than evil , or the opposite
reward has nothing to do with it. both jainism and buddhism are atheistic
so there is no deity to dispense rewards or punishments. karma is usually
described in terms of seeds and reaping the fruit thereof. in fact as you
sow , so shall you reap is found in the pali canon as i recall , the metaphor
of natural growth is explicit.

hinduism , or some sects in that tradition , are i believe much more
deterministic and involve concepts closer to reward and punishment being
theistically inclined.

in point of fact , the theravadin buddhist tradition of southeast asia
considers karma as only one of five influences in human life , and in
fact from their point of view they would be unable to explain the mechanics
of karma without the element of free will.

also in eastern religions there is a difference between reincarnation and
rebirth , which is essentially absent in western considerations.

is n't origen usually cited as the most prestigious proponent of reincarnation
among christian thinkers \? what were his views , and how did he relate them
to the christian scriptures \?

any attempts to make homosexuals
feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible
with christianity. is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone
try to become closer to jesus , we need to keep them away.

this is too often true. many people try to place this as a higher
sin. however...

does jesus need
us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin. do we really mistrust
jesus when he says he can forgive any sin \?

a big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people
advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider
(active) homosexuality a sin. i do n't often see the attitude of
forgive me and i will try to change . instead i see there 's nothing
wrong with my life and i can be a good christian , so it must be you who
have an illness because you do n't accept me . christians can and will
accept homosexuals , just as they will accept any sinner.

sure , it may be natural to some people to be homosexual but it
is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin ! i was born with
a desire to sin , but i work to prevent myself from sinning. it 's
much less common now , but i still have urges to lash out in
anger. there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful
desires (or ever ! ) , so it is sad to see people leave the church
when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after
several years.

this all obviously applies equally well to infants or adults , since
both have souls. infants must be baptized , therefore , or they cannot

cannot enter into heaven.

are you saying that baptism has nothing to do with asking jesus to come into
your heart and accepting him as your savior , but is just a ritual that we
must go through to enable us to enter heaven \?


my feeling on baptism is this parents baptize their baby so that the
baby has the sanctifying grace of baptism (and thus removal of original
sin) on its soul in the event of an unexpected death.

that is , the parents speak on behalf of the child which is too young
to speak on its own. this should not surprise anyone do n't parents
always do what they believe is the best for their baby \? why would
that apply to the baby 's physical needs only but not his her spiritual
needs to have god 's grace \?

the purpose of confirmation is for the baby (now young adult) to
decide to re affirm for himself herself the promises that his her
parents made at baptism. that is where accepting jesus into your
heart comes in. in baptism , the parents ask jesus to come into their
baby 's heart at confirmation the child repeats that request
independently.

(by the way , these are my personal feelings , though i believe they are
pretty close to what the doctrinal position of the catholic church on
this issue. can anyone out there back me up or correct me \?

i have been studying the bible now for about a year. i love it ,
but i am not very familiar with the different denominations , or
traditions , or common beliefs of various christian groups.
i have heard various people (outside this news group)
describe idols such as power , money , material
possessions etc. these things are worshiped in some sense i
suppose , but i never really gave idols much thought. until now...

i have been reading the postings in this news group (which i
just found a few days ago) , and i have a question... first , i'm
not trying to question anyone 's belief or try to push my views
on anyone else (i have n't been at this long enough to have
any views other than i cannot get to heaven by being good ,
i must understand that christ bore my sins on the cross so that
i could be saved and i need to repent , i.e. realize that
every time i sin , i might as well stick a sharp stick in
christ 's side because he took the punishment for my sins ,
when he died on the cross).

in my studies , mary never really comes up. i know who she is ,
but that 's about it. it seems to me that a statue of mary
could be considered an idol \? do people pray to statues of mary \?

it sounds like educated christians (more educated than myself
i'm sure) believe mary was sinless \? wow... i hoped to spend
the summer convincing myself (one way or the other) about
tongues (i'm reading charismatic chaos ). i guess i 'll study
tongues in parallel with reading this news group. any help you can
give me will be appreciated.



i do n't think the issue is so much that people are more educated than
you (though it may well be that they are) , as that they come from a
different tradition than yours.

this is a discussion between catholics and protestants. catholics
generally believe that mary was sinless. protestants do not. the
issue comes down to different sources of authority. protestants
generally limit themselves to the bible as a source of doctrine.
since this is n't in the bible (except in passages that no one would
understand in this way if they did n't already believe it) , protestants
do n't accept it. catholics see continuing revelation through the
church , though they believe the results are consistent with the bible.

i interpret your posting , not as a call for yet another argument about
whether the catholic marian devotions are idolatry (an argument i am
not prepared to see newed here) , but as a sign of being interested in
learning about traditions other than your own. catholics are of
course a major one , but by no means the only one. i generally
consider the major traditions to be catholic , orthodox , and
various subsets of protestantism. within protestantism , it 's a matter
of how finely you want to cut things. these days i think the major
division is between those who accept biblical inerrancy and those
who do n't. there are also a number of major historical traditions ,
but in recent decades distinctions are tending to blur. i 'd
identify the major protestant traditions as

lutheran , reformed , anglican (they 're sort of halfway between
catholic and protestant) , wesleyan , baptist , holiness , pentecostal ,
church of christ

but there are a number of others. historical distinctions tend not to
be so important among the liberal churches anymore , and i think
current trends in society and the church are also tending to make
conservatives seen themselves as allies from a general evangelical
perspective. but differences among these various traditions are still
quite marked.

i think the best introduction to these issues is to read a good book
on church history. anyone who wants to understand the church really
needs to understand how we got where we are now. a church history
will normally show you where each of these traditions came from , and
give a feeling for their nature. unfortunately i'm away from my
library at the moment , so i do n't have anything specific to recommend.

there are various explanations for her reaction to the angel 's
greeting. one is that she grasped what the angel was getting at , that
she was to be the mother of the messiah. and knew what this entailed ,
all the suffering. this gave her a moment 's pause.

a priest i know gave me an interesting explanation. he said that the
words of mary point not to doubt or troubled thoughts , but rather to
complete humbleness. those who are humble and do not revel in
themselves frequently are confused when given high praise about
themselves , as mary would rightly be.

i hesitate to comment on the validity of this , because i do not know
what your friend meant by it. if he meant that whatever exists must
have been created , then he is open to the obvious retort that god
exists , and so god must have been created.

perhaps your friend meant that we exist now but that there was a
time when we did not exist , and therefore something other than
ourselves must have brought us into existence. this seems plausible ,
but an atheist might reply , so my parents engendered me. so what \?
here your friend would have to explain why an infinite regress of
causes is not a satisfactory explanation. he would have some support
from philosophers who are not ordinarily considered religious (ayn
rand , and some others who are in the tradition of aristotle). having
argued for a first cause , he would have to bridge the gap between
said entity and the god of abraham. if he merely asserts that the
things we observe are ultimately dependent on things radically
unlike them , few physicists would disagree.

subject traveling fatima (was re consecration and anniversary)
lines 48

hello.
i just like to share this rosary and other prayer propagation
practice we do in my country. i am not sure if it is going on
also here in the us or any other country. in all these 4 1 2
yrs. i 've been here in illinois , usa , i have not encountered
it. may i just call it traveling fatima since i do n't know
of an exact translation of what we call it in my native language.

for certain regions in a district in a town or city , an image
statue of our lady of fatima is moved from one home (originating
from owner) to another. this will stay with that family for
one (1) week and this family is required to pray the rosary and
other prayers (prayer sheets accompany the image) to our lady
of fatima. the move will be like a simple procession of folks
picking up the image from its current 'home' after 'departing'
prayers and proceeds to move it to the next home which has the
prior notification about the move. there will be the 'receiving'
prayers at the next home to welcome our lady of fatima image
there. it does not have to be that only members of the family
in that home who must pray to the image. they may invite others
(or others friends can invite themselves in )) to participate
during prayer time in that 'new' home everyday for one week.
this image is moved from one family to the next within the
bounded region of that district , until it goes back to the owner
of the image.

this is probably going on around there (philippines) right now
(or somebody correct me when exactly since i forgot) and every
year , this is part of our devotion to our lady of fatima.

it has been easy to facilitate this back home because it is more
likely that your next door neighbor is a catholic and the image
then is just moved next door.

i am thinking of starting something like it in the village where
my sister and her family lives. most of our friends and neighbors
there are catholics and practicing ones.

i 'd like to know if there are any state community laws that this
practice will violate , whatsoever , before i go for it. thank you
for any comments or help about this matter.

(this is a continuation of an earlier post)

mls@panix.com (michael siemon) writes
for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can
be law for christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you in every case , handled on its own merits to
determine why you pick one and ignore another. i frankly think the
whole effort misguided. reread paul no doubt i am free to do anything.
but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this ,
the great commandment of love for god and neighbor. if you cannot go
through leviticus and decide each command there on that basis , then
your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy. in this
context , it is remarkably offensive to say

i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

(i am sorry you found this offensive. it was not my intent to offend. i was
leading up to another point , which i discuss in more detail below.)

well , la ti da. so what \? this is almost as slimey an argument as the
one that homosexuality rape. i know of no one who argues seriously
(though one can always find jokers) in defense of bestiality. it is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed , consensual human
adult realtionships) , so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut. if you cannot address the actual issues , you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world. if you want to address bestiality , that is your business , not
mine. and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in
our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing
us as human beings. you want to dismiss us , and use the sleaziest means
you can think of to do so.

i can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for
homosexuality. certainly if i spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of
bestiality , nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe. let me ask
this gently why are you so judgemental of other people 's sexual preferences \?
what happened to no doubt i am free to do anything \? i think you have a
serious double standard here. when you describe a comparison between
homosexuality and bestiality as slimey and sleazy , you are making an
implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted , sinful , disgusting ,
unnatural in short , all the things that society once thought about
homosexuality. not all people share your view. you claim not to know any
sincere zoophiles , but this does not mean that they do not exist. they even
have their own newsgroup alt.sex.bestiality. are you going to accuse them
all of being mere jokers \?

i notice you deleted the main point of my comment the fact that the only
biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the levitical
prohibitions against homosexuality. while there are some new testament
passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality , there are none
that condemn bestiality. one of your main points seems to be that christian
homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any clear new testament
statements against it if this is a valid argument , then should not christian
zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the new testament
makes no reference , clear or unclear , to the subject at all \?

i am quite serious here. if i am going to accept homosexuality as biblically
acceptable on the basis of your arguments , then i am going to be fair and apply
the same standards to everyone else 's declared sexual preferences as well. if
the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual
preferences as well , i'm going to apply them and see what comes up. i'm not
trying to torpedo a serious issue by using what you label a ridiculous
joke . i posted a question about how we should interpret biblical guidelines
for christian sexuality , and i do n't think such a question is irrelevant in a
group called soc.religion.christian . the bible discusses homosexuality and
bestiality together in the same context , and therefore i feel i have a good
precedent for doing the same.

jesus and paul both expound , very explictly and in considerable length ,
the central linch pin of christian moral thought we are required to
love one another , and all else depends on that. gay and lesbian christ
ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get
in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues.

i do n't know whether it makes any difference , but for the record , this is not a
side issue for me. i believe loving one another includes not encouraging
people to defile themselves , therefore it is of high importance to determine
whether god regards certain sexual acts as defiling. i can read in the new
testament that god has joined together heterosexual couples , and that the
marriage bed is undefiled. i can read in the old testament that homosexual
intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under
the law. if gay christians can validly put aside the old testament standards
of defilement , then i want to know so that i can fairly apply it to all the
sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days. i do n't think it 's
right to take just bits and pieces of the law and try and apply them to
christians today , e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality does n't.
that was pretty much what you said earlier , right \? you used different
examples , but i think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong
to apply only certain parts of the law to christians.

christians , no doubt very sincere ones , keep showing up here and in every
corner of usenet and the world , and all they ever do is spout these same
old verses (which they obviously have never thought about , maybe never
even read) , in total ignorance of the issues raised , slandering us with
the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can
manage to conjure up , tossing out red herrings with (they suppose) great
emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even
taking the trouble to find out what it is.

it was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction. i personally do n't
get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual
orientation i'm afraid i naively assumed that others would have a similar
attitude. please note that i have never intended to equate homosexuality with
child abuse. i have merely noted that , for all the lack of clear nt
condemnation of homosexuality , there is an even greater lack of nt condemnation
(or even mention) of bestiality , a practice which a number of people (e.g. on
alt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.

such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ.
why , for god 's precious sake , do you people quote irrelevant verses to
condemn people you do n't know and wo n't even take the trouble to listen
to before you start your condemnations \? is that loving your neighbor \?
god forbid ! is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or
condemn others \? christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in
insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in paul that you are
so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do.

why , for god 's sake \?
quote from john 3 17ff omitted for brevity

this is an excellent question , and i pray that you will not treat it as a mere
rhetorical question , but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the
answer. i recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you
yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia. why do you find
bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in
connection with other alternative sexual orientations \? why do you not apply
all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply
them to homosexuals \?

is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at
the thought \? a lot of people have the same experience at the thought of
homosexual intercourse. is it because you regard the practice as socially
unacceptable \? a lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.
do you feel that it violates the traditional judeo christian standard of sexual
morality \? many people feel that homosexuality does. do you feel the bible
condemns it \? many people think the bible says more to condemn homosexuality
than it does to condemn bestiality. why then do you think comparing bestiality
with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality \? if you can honestly answer
this question , you will have come a long way towards understanding why many
people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.

also please note that i am not in any sense condemning people . i am merely
pointing out that when i read the bible i see certain sexual practices that
the bible appears to condemn , e.g. sex outside of marriage. when i say i think
adultery and pre marital sex are sinful , do you take that as me failing to love
my neighbor \? when you treat bestiality as something disgusting and
unmentionable , are you disobeying repeated orders not to judge or condemn
others \? when you say other christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you
and judging you , are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same
offense \? or are you and i both simply taking note about practices the bible
brands as sinful , and leaving the judgement of the people up to god \?

for long ages , we (many of us) have been confused by evil counsel from
evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and
rejected. some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do
show a sinful shunning of god 's light. blessed are those whose spirits
have been crushed by the self righteous they shall be justified.

however , we have seen the truth , and the truth is the light of humanity
and we now know that it is not we who fear the light , but our enemies who
fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow
it with the darkness of false witness against us.

mls@panix.com most high , all of you nevertheless
or you shall die like men , and fall
mls@ulysses.att..com like any prince. psalm 82 6 7

i'm not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs. if you mean that jesus
is the truth , and that he accepts sinners , and does not reject them , then i
agree. if we were not sinners , then we would not need a savior. our
salvation in christ , however , does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us ,
and we can now do whatever we want. nor does christ 's grace mean that those
who refer to sin as sin are being judgemental or intolerant. i am speaking
in general terms here , not specifically about homosexuality. if the bible
calls something sin , then it is not unreasonable for christians to call it
sin too.

as applied to christian homosexuality , i think the only definitive authority on
christian sexuality is the bible. if you make a list of everything the bible
says on the subject of homosexual intercourse , i think you will find that every
verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst , and unclear at best.
the most pro gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some
dispute about the new testament verses which many people interpret as
condemning homosexual intercourse. that is , from a gay perspective , the most
positive thing you can say about the bible 's treatment of homosexuality is that
some verses fail to clearly condemn it. that 's it. jesus declared all foods
clean , the council at jerusalem declared that gentiles were not required to
keep the ritual law , but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from
being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted christian
practice. you have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination
that defiles both jews under the law and gentiles not under the law , and you
have some verses which are at best not clear but which some people believe
are clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior , and that 's the sum
total of what the bible says about same sex intercourse.

i can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything
simple , cut and dried , black and white , what i want is ok , and
those who oppose me are wicked. however , i do not think the bible makes your
case as definitively as you would like it to. in fact , i do n't believe it says
anything positive about your case at all. yes , i know the verses about loving
one another , and not judging one another , but that 's not really the issue , is
it \? you know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for
christians to do , since you say it is wrong for christians to condemn you.
therefore , the issue is whether the bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.
even if you do challenge the clarity of the new testament verses , you are still
left with the fact that the only thing the bible does say clearly about
homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who
are under the law and those who are not.

mark


actually i do n't think the reaction to the comparision with
bestiality is based on bestialophobia. i think what he regards as
slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and
bestiality. most people who accept homosexuality take a radical
approach to the law. they regard all of lev as not binding on
christians. the argument is that there 's no way in the text to
separate bestiality , homosexuality , and wearing mixed fabrics. this
does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct , nor
does it mean that they accept bestiality. it simply means that their
sexual ethics does not come from the law , and particularly not from
lev. clh

deyoung published it in the masters seminary journal in fall of '92. to read

edgar pearlstein asks (fri 7 may 1993) whether the supreme court , or
any other government authority , has attempted a legal definition of
religion.

the universal military training and service act of 1958 exempted
from the draft those whose religious training and belief was
opposed to participation in war in any form. it defined r t b as
an individual 's belief in a relation to a supreme being involving
duties superior to those arising from any human relation , but not
including essentially political , sociological , or philosophical
views or a merely personal moral code.

in the 1965 case of united states v. seeger , the supreme court
broadened the definition so as not to restrict it to explicit
theists. justice tom clark , delivering the court 's opinion , said

we have concluded that congress , in using the expression supreme
being rather than the designation god , .... the test of belief
in a relation to a superme being is whether a given belief that
is sincere and meaningful occupies a place in the life of its
possessor parallel to that filled by the orthodox belief in god
of one who clearly qualifies for the exemption. where such
beliefs have parallel positions in the lives of their respective
holders we cannot say that one is in a relation to a supreme

the catholic doctrine of predestination does not exclude free will in
any way. since god knows everything , he therefore knows everything that
is going to happen to us. we have free will , and are able to change
what happens to us. however , since god knows everything , he knows all
the choices we will make in advance (god is not subject to time). too
often arguments pit predestination against free will. we believe in
both.

curiously enough , this subject has occupied a good bit of my prayer life
recently. god 's experience of time is so completely different from our own ,
since he is both within and without it. using words like foreknowledge
and predestination are semantically incorrect when it comes to describing
god 's perception of our action , because , for god , the beginning , living , and
ending of our lives are all the same. sort of. for god , there is no before
when he did not know , so he could not have foreknowledge of our lives or
a time when he could have predestined our actions. in fact , since our
understanding of things is so tied to our linear experience of time , i
would say that it is impossible for us to understand completely how our
free will interacts with god 's control of the universe.

of this are either platonic or sound like special pleading (sort of ,
they appear to be three seperate beings in all ways , but really they are
one , trust me ).

neither of these is acceptible to me.

the fact is , so far the only descriptions of the trinity that makes any
sense to me are the modalistic ones , such as modalistic monarchianism
or economic trinitarianism . i can accept that the three aspects are
intrinsic to the nature of god , so i perhaps lean more towards the latter .

the 3 are different parts of the 1. father , son , and holy spirit
are n't exactly parts of god , because parts are things distinguished by
physical separation. all three persons are omnipresent , so they are
obviously are n't physically separate. but they 're in some way
different aspects , modes , or whatever , of one god. if you accept
economic trinitarianism , it 's possible that you do n't have any

lot what morals ethics apply to dreams and out of body incidents \?

dave you might like to read a book by florence bulle god
wants you rich other enticing doctrines , which discusses
oobes in one of her chapters.

in the bible we have examples of men caught up in the spirit (eg
ezekiel , paul). i believe that also this experience is
counterfeited by satan so that for example yoga and other
eastern medatitive techniques can be used to induce the soul to
leave the body and float off. someone tried to sell me a book in
los angeles airport entitled easy journeys to other planets
which uses such techniques.

the occultic trance of a medium sometimes involves such body
departure the book the challanging counterfeit , about a
former medium who gets saved , tells how the author , on his last
trance , was attacked by evil spirits who tried to kill him
while returning to his body at the end of the seance
because of his interest in christianity and how he was supernaturally
protected by the lord.

there may be some similarities in mind altering drugs and the
phenomena of 'tripping'.

as regards the connection between body and soul , there is an
interesting verse in ecclesiastes. in a passage talking about
old age , the preacher writes then man goes to his eternal home
and mourners go about the streets. remember him before the
silver cord is severed. (12.5 6) my understanding of this
silver cord is that it is something that attaches body and soul
in a manner somewhat similar to an umbilical cord or an
astronaut 's air line to his spaceship.
when a person goes out of body this silver cord still attaches
the soul whereever it goes and is vulnerable to being broken
astral projection can be dangerous ! bulle , i think , reports a
case of a yogi off on an oobe who was found dead in his
apartment , with no apparent external cause.

i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse.

it is
absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do
raise (which concern sexual activity within committed , consensual human
adult realtionships) , so that your bringing it up is no more relevant
than the laws of kashrut. if you cannot address the actual issues , you
are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the
world.

no. it is very relevant. homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are
topically aranged together in the law. this is very important.
anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality
deals with temple prostitution (and i think you would agree that there
is no proof for this.) if the law reveals the character of god , and
is holy , just , and good as is written in the new testament , then
those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts
to be biggots have to address this passage of scripture.

why must we only discuss scriptures that involve consensual human
adult relationships \? is n't that bordering on sophistry \? the point
we are making is that god did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts.
not everyone who brings up these scriptures is just trying to use and emotional
argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors.
the issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly.

i do not have problem with a loving , nonlustful relationship with a member
of the same sex. i have them , and we all do. the issue at hand is
the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex , or lusting after.
so other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation.

and the idea that these relationships may be emotional relationships
between adult humans is red herring. we all agree that it is okay
for adults to have caring relationships with one another.

often we get into discussions about who is christian. unfortunately
there are a number of possible definitions. starting from the
broadest , commonly used definitions are

3) the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition ,
which includes all of the major strands of christianity , but excludes
groups that are felt to be outside historic christianity. this is
of course a slippery enterprise , since catholics could argue that
protestants are outside historic christianity , etc. but i think the
most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the
nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon.

are you sure you want to include chalcedon here \? i presume that you
mean the description of jesus as fully human and fully devine. almost
everyone would consider the majority of copts and armenians , and the
jacobites , as christians , yet for 15 centuries it has been maintained
that they disagree with the formula of chalcedon. those that would n't
consider them christians are most likely to object that these communities
do n't require a personal commitment to jesus , which is only tangentially
related to the formula of chalcedon.

thanks , john kolassa , kolassa@bio1.bst.rochester.edu

as i understand the recent discussion here , the copts for all
practical purposes accept chalcedon. they talk about one nature
rather than two , but the issue seems to be one of terminology rather
than substance. clh

frank , first of all , thanks for all of the great scripture verses. it
was a pleasure to read them.

my reply...
you are welcome , zane.

zane...
i am sure nothing that i will say will change your mind about it... but i
would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you.
i mean , were you all caught up in the word faith thing , but now that you
have read the book you 've been rescued from all of the error and pain that
will result in your christian life \?

my reply...
(1) when i first became a christian , i entered into the word faith
movement. it was easy. i was n't grounded in the word of god and sound
doctrine. when i visited christian book stores , the cheapest books i
could find to buy were the .50 and 1.00 books by hagin and others.
consequently , i began receiving hagin 's monthly magazine (and they
still send it to me) , and also copeland 's (also , still sent to me).
it was n't until i read a booklet by jimmy swaggart called hyper faith
the new gnosticism that i began to realize the teachings i were
partaking of were error. i started reading the bible more and studying
more. sure enough , jimmy was right in many points. as part of my
experience , i am alerting christians , particularly new christians , that
these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the bereans did in
acts 17 11 check these teachings out with scripture !

(2) my brother in law was involved in a word faith cult in my area it 's
leader is real good friends with benny hinn. rather then going into
much detail about this , suffice it to say he was deceived , mistreated , and
has now fallen into atheism. i'm still praying for him (phil. 1 6).

(3) the assistant pastor at the church i teach adult sunday school in has been
a `follower' of copeland for 15 years. he has thousands of tapes by the
faith teachers. in the class recently , i quoted several of the teachers'
heretical statements to his surprise. since then , i 've been able to talk
to him at length about these issues.

(4) the leader of the women 's group at my church is a benny hinn `fan'.
recently , i found that she has been lending good morning , holy spirit to
women in the church. that prompted my quotes in sunday school , as well as
my lending cic to people in the church.

i'm well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and
have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies.
what heresies \?
a. jesus became sin took on the very nature of the devil , and became
one with him.
b. jesus' death on the cross was n't enough to atone.
c. jesus was dragged to hell after his death , was beat and abused by
satan and demons , thus finishing our atonement. satan was ruling
over him there.
d. jesus was `born again' in hell.
e. jesus died spiritually , lost his divinity , and reassumed it after
the resurrection.
f. we are gods.

these are heresies. documentation will be provided re these teachings
upon request.

zane...
or what does it do for you \? is it preventing you from going out and
joining up with the word faith movement which you 'd been contemplating
joining for so long , but now that you 've read the book , you 've been saved
from all of that \?

my reply...
it was n't christianity in crisis that helped me it was a booklet by
swaggart that i mentioned above. but cic is much , much better tremendous
documentation and insights.

zane...
i do n't have a nice scriptural answer for why i believe it is at best un
profitable for christians to engage in this type of activity heresy hunting.

my reply...
why do you call it heresy hunting \? hunting implies it is n't readily
accessible or available. this movement is the fastest growing movement in
christendom. hagin has sold over 40 million books and booklets. hinn has sold
more books in the last couple of years than swindoll and dobson combined. fred
price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the usa. does n't
sound like much hunting is needed.

it is scriptural to expose doctrinal error. i gave some verses to you before.
more can be given. most of the epistles were written due to error (doctrinal ,
practical) in the churches. the early church had numerous councils to expose
error and heresy. it 's not a new thing. remember luther \?

zane...
i would like to point out though , that historically those who hunt heretics
often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics... but this is my un
documented opinion.

my reply...
(1) if you can provide documentation , it would be appreciated.
(2) read ephesians 4 11 16 , esp. vss. 13 and 14 and tell me what causes
disunity and immaturity in the body.

eph 4 13 14 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the son of god , to a perfect man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness
of christ that we should no longer be children , tossed to and fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in the cunning
craftiness of deceitful plotting....

disunity , contrary to popular opinion , is n't caused by exposing error it 's
caused by error.

zane...
there are many who probably give no place for seeing the scriptures as
documenting a spiritual development or growth in its writers but i would
suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatians mellows and
matures into the one who loses all for the sake of love in the end.

my reply...
most scholars believe paul wrote 2 timothy last. let 's examine his admonitions
to tim to ascertain how mellow he had become...

2ti 1 13 15 hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me ,
in faith and love which are in christ jesus. that good thing which was
committed to you , keep by the holy spirit who dwells in us. this you know , that
all those in asia have turned away from me , among whom are phygellus and
hermogenes.

2ti 2 15 18 be diligent to present yourself approved to god , a worker who does
not need to be ashamed , rightly dividing the word of truth. but shun profane
and idle babblings , for they will increase to more ungodliness. and their
message will spread like cancer. hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort , who
have strayed concerning the truth , saying that the resurrection is already
past and they overthrow the faith of some.

2ti 2 24 26 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all ,
able to teach , patient , in humility correcting those who are in opposition , if
god perhaps will grant them repentance , so that they may know the truth , and
that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil , having
been taken captive by him to do his will.

2ti 3 6 9 for of this sort are those who creep into households and make
captives of gullible women loaded down with sins , led away by various lusts ,
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. now as
jannes and jambres resisted moses , so do these also resist the truth men of
corrupt minds , disapproved concerning the faith but they will progress no
further , for their folly will be manifest to all , as theirs also was.

2ti 3 12 17 yes , and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer
persecution. but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse , deceiving
and being deceived. but you must continue in the things which you have learned
and been assured of , knowing from whom you have learned them , and that from
childhood you have known the holy scriptures , which are able to make you wise
for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus. all scripture is given by
inspiration of god , and is profitable for doctrine , for reproof , for
correction , for instruction in righteousness , that the man of god may be
complete , thoroughly equipped for every good work.

2ti 4 2 5 preach the word ! be ready in season and out of season. convince ,
rebuke , exhort , with all longsuffering and teaching. for the time will come
when they will not endure sound doctrine , but according to their own desires ,
because they have itching ears , they will heap up for themselves teachers and
they will turn their ears away from the truth , and be turned aside to fables.
but you be watchful in all things , endure afflictions , do the work of an
evangelist , fulfill your ministry.

2ti 4 14 15 alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. may the lord repay him
according to his works. you also must beware of him , for he has greatly
resisted our words.

zane...
the picture i have of paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy
the ministry of wolves... but of one who teaches the sheep , with many tears ,
the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into
wolves to protect themselves.

my reply...
act 20 26 31 therefore i testify to you this day that i am innocent of the
blood of all men. for i have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel
of god. therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock , among which
the holy spirit has made you overseers , to shepherd the church of god which he
purchased with his own blood. for i know this , that after my departure savage
wolves will come in among you , not sparing the flock. also from among
yourselves men will rise up , speaking perverse things , to draw away the
disciples after themselves. therefore watch , and remember that for three years
i did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.

zane...
for all the warning paul does , it is of note that he never once drops a name
of a wolf.... but i will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those
who have abandoned him everyone in asia was n't it \?

my reply...
paul mentioned names...

1ti 1 18 20 this charge i commit to you , son timothy , according to the
prophecies previously made concerning you , that by them you may wage the good
warfare , having faith and a good conscience , which some having rejected ,
concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck , of whom are hymenaeus and
alexander , whom i delivered to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.

2ti 1 15 this you know , that all those in asia have turned away from me , among
whom are phygellus and hermogenes.

2ti 2 16 18 but shun profane and idle babblings , for they will increase to more
ungodliness. and their message will spread like cancer. hymenaeus and philetus
are of this sort , who have strayed concerning the truth , saying that the
resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some.

2ti 4 10 for demas has forsaken me , having loved this present world , and has
departed for thessalonica crescens for galatia , titus for dalmatia.

2ti 4 14 15 alexander the coppersmith did me much harm. may the lord repay him
according to his works. you also must beware of him , for he has greatly
resisted our words.

so did john...

3jo 1 9 10 i wrote to the church , but diotrephes , who loves to have the
preeminence among them , does not receive us. therefore , if i come , i will call
to mind his deeds which he does , prating against us with malicious words. and
not content with that , he himself does not receive the brethren , and forbids
those who wish to , putting them out of the church.

jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines...

rev 2 14 16 but i have a few things against you , because you have there those
who hold the doctrine of balaam , who taught balak to put a stumbling block
before the children of israel , to eat things sacrificed to idols , and to commit
sexual immorality. thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the
nicolaitans , which thing i hate. 'repent , or else i will come to you quickly
and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

rev 2 20 23 nevertheless i have a few things against you , because you allow
that woman jezebel , who calls herself a prophetess , to teach and seduce my
servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols. and i
gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality , and she did not repent.
indeed i will cast her into a sickbed , and those who commit adultery with her
into great tribulation , unless they repent of their deeds. i will kill her
children with death , and all the churches shall know that i am he who searches
the minds and hearts. and i will give to each one of you according to your
works.

zane...
i question too , the purposes of those who write books and build ministries
on the faults deliberate or otherwise of others. maybe if they would
wander around in the desert eating locust and honey , or barely cakes...with
no worldly goods at stake , money to be made , or no reputations to maintain...
i would question their motives conscious or otherwise less.

my reply...
i wo n't comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others.
but even if they had bad motives , remember what paul said...

phi 1 15 18 some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife , and some also
from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition , not sincerely ,
supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love , knowing
that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel. what then \? only that in
every way , whether in pretense or in truth , christ is preached and in this i
rejoice , yes , and will rejoice.

zane...
if we want to be true to the admonitions of scripture many of which you
list about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of
doctrines , i suggest we start by allowing the wolf program in our own noetic
pasture to be nailed to the cross.

my reply...
please explain.

zane...
secondly , i suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships
which in the strict scriptural sense is the local city church.

my reply...
if heresy was not being propagated over the mass media , then it may not be
needed to go mass media with the exposure. unfortunately , heresy is being
taught not just in copeland 's church or hagin 's or hinn 's or price 's , but all
over the radio , in print , etc. no pastor or church leader knows what materials
the sheep are feeding on outside the church. it 's imperative that leadership
be made aware of this , and cic does just that.

also , let 's examine a passage of scripture...
eph 4 11 and he himself gave some to be apostles , some prophets , some
evangelists , and some pastors and teachers ,
eph 4 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry , for the
edifying of the body of christ ,

these ministry gifts that the lord installs in the church are not just for one
individual church , but for the body of christ .
paul was an apostle he traveled all over distilling his message. he was also
a teacher
1co 4 17 for this reason i have sent timothy to you , who is my beloved and
faithful son in the lord , who will remind you of my ways in christ , as i teach
everywhere in every church.
1co 7 17 but as god has distributed to each one , as the lord has called each
one , so let him walk. and so i ordain in all the churches.

also
1co 12 28 and god has appointed these in the church first apostles , second
prophets , third teachers , after that miracles , then gifts of healings , helps ,
administrations , varieties of tongues.

eph 4 13 till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of
the son of god , to a perfect man , to the measure of the stature of the fullness
of christ

notice that the five fold ministries are going to be around till the church
is in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect
man . this , i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus returns (see
1cor. 13 9 12). but god wants the body to continue on maturing. what hinders
maturity and unity of the body \?

eph 4 14 that we should no longer be children , tossed to and fro and carried
about with every wind of doctrine , by the trickery of men , in the cunning
craftiness of deceitful plotting ,

it 's clear that false doctrine , integrated into the church by the trickery of
men causes (1) disunity the thing we are striving for and (2) spiritual
immaturity the church continues in spiritual childhood when christians are
tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine .

the five fold ministry , of which there does not appear to be clear
scriptural denominational boundaries ( pastors appear responsible for their
individual flock) , is to deal with these doctrines (when necessary) in their
struggle to equip the body.

all believers are called to do this to a degree...
jud 1 3 4 beloved , while i was very diligent to write to you concerning our
common salvation , i found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend
earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints. for
certain men have crept in unnoticed , who long ago were marked out for this
condemnation , ungodly men , who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny
the only lord god and our lord jesus christ.

zane...
if you 'll notice , in scripture the heresy hunters that went from church to
church and area to area , were the bad guys and they went after the good guy
namely paul who they considered to be the arch heretic.

my reply...
they were themselves heretics trying to discredit paul who was preaching
contrary to what they taught !

zane...
let 's face it , the wolves are here for a reason. and we are here for the
reason. and let 's hope the wolves become sheep , and the sheep , lambs.

my reply...
yes !
2ti 2 24 26 and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all ,

able to teach , patient , in humility correcting those who are in opposition , if

god perhaps will grant them repentance , so that they may know the truth , and

that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil , having
been taken captive by him to do his will.

lots deleted , with which i generally agree there is no inherently
defensible argument for the inclusion or exclusion of the deuterocanonical
books

i think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be
consistently applied are not very useful as principles.
so , if we are to exclude them (not accord them the authority of
scripture) we would appear to require other reasons. what might these
reasons be \?

lets talk about principles. if we accept that god sets the
standards for what ought to be included in scripture then we
can ask
1. is it authoritative \?
2. is it prophetic \?
3. is it authentic \?
4. is it dynamic \?
5. is it received , collected , read and used \?

on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god.
to quote unger 's bible dictionary on the apocrapha
1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.
2. they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred scripture.
3. they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture.
4. they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling.


my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of
(at least one of) these writings is one of those 'traditions
of men' one hears of so often. they were excluded during the
reformation , and that appears to be the reason many people
continue to exclude them.

but the problem with this argument lies in the assumption that
the hebrew canon included the apocrapha in the first place , and
it was n't until the sixteenth century that luther and co. threw
them out. the jewish council you mentioned previously did n't
accept them , so the reformation protestants had good historical
precedence for their actions. jerome only translated the
apocrapha under protest , and it was literally 'over his dead
body' that it was included in the catholic canon.

the simple fact is that protestant exclusion , roman inclusion , orthodox
inclusion of still other books , or any other definition of a closed canon
is the decision of a community of faith about what the standard collection
of scripture shall be for that community. they all are traditions of
men. whether one considers that to be a problem or not depends on which
community happens to be yours , and how you accept define authority within
it. i personally believe that the concept of a closed canon , whether
catholic , protestant , or orthodox is one that developed rather late in the
history of the church , and which has not served the church well.

how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the
words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to
them , god will add to him the plagues described in this book.
and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy , god will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city (rev 22.18 9)
surely this sets the standard and not just man made traditions.

it is also noteworthy to consider jesus' attitude. he had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon (john
10.31 6) , and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus
that in the law , prophets and psalms which referred to him the
ot division of scripture (luke 24.44) , as well as in luke 11.51
taking genesis to chronicles (the jewish order we would say
genesis to malachi) as scripture.

see dr. lee macdonald 's the formation of the christian biblical canon
(abingdon , 1988) for a clear and faithful examination of the origins and
issues of the canon.

i am not familiar with the book.
some other arguments you might like to consider are found in
chapter 3 of josh mcdowell 's evidence that demands a verdict.

db7n @andrew.cmu.edu (d. andrew byler) writes ,

and i must point out that
the jews only drew up their canon in 90 ad , 60 years after the founding
of the christian religion upon the cross. why should we adhere to a
canon that was drawn up by the faithless , in reaction to the chrsitian
use of the greek septuagint , which includes the deutero canon \?

i was simply observing that as a non jew , i am not in that community
which might be bound by such a decision (i do n't know much about
the council of jamnia , but i have heard that it is not well attested
historically). 'faithless' has nothing to do with it , and i prefer
not to speculate about motives.

as early
as 150 ad , st. justin had already accused the jews of mutilating the
canon of scripture by their removal of certain books.

i wish the dialogue with trypho were a real transcript of a real
dialogue , , but i think it a fictional effect on justin 's part.
putting that to one side , justin 's point may be evidential one
would want to know 'which books \? '

protestants apparently prefer to think that god 's revelation was limited
by a decree of the jews ...

perhaps the reformers were traveling in all the light (ms evidence)
they had. let 's stick to the issues. again , i prefer not to speculate
about motives. one would need quotes from luther , calvin , etc. to
evidence this 'preference'.

that is not quite accurate. otherwise we would have the book
of enoch in the canon (as dave noted). one can say that the
apocrypha are not quoted by christ.

is this the principle 'any (bc) text not quoted by christ cannot
be counted as scripture' \? think well about this job , ruth... \?

i wrote
these is a logically invalid a priori .
besides , we are talking about ot texts
which in many parts are superceded by the nt
(in the xtian view). would not this same
principle exclude ecclesiastes \?
this principle cannot be consistently applied.

dave w. answers

i have to reject your argument here. the spirit speaks with one
voice , and he does not contradict himself.

meaning what \? do you affirm the principle (that the d.c 's can be
excluded since they contain 'false doctrine') or do you deny it \?
if affirmed (as is implied in your statement) how does one determine
that doctrine x is false \? do you affirm every teaching in ecclesiastes \?

the ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired
by the spirit , i.e. , god breathed. it is a test which is more
guided by faith than by reason or logic.

if so , it may be a test that cannot be applied. the orthodox
faithfully believe that psalm 151 is canonical. how can my
faith say 'not ! ' \? all i hear here is the a priori i mentioned
before.

the deutero canonical books were added much later in the church 's
history.

this is contrary to fact.

they do not have the same spiritual quality as the
rest of scripture.

christianity is not a doctrine , not , i mean , a theory about what has
happened and will happen to the human soul , but a description of something
that actually takes place in a human life. for `consciousness of sin' is a
real event , and so are despair and salvation through faith. those who speak
of such things (bunyan , for instance) are simply describing what has happened
to them , whatever anyone may want to say about it. ludwig wittgenstein

lets talk about principles. if we accept that god sets the
standards for what ought to be included in scripture then we
can ask
1. is it authoritative \?

authoritative is not a quality of the writing itself it is a statement
by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative.

2. is it prophetic \?

how is prophecy to be defined \? if it is speaking forth of god 's message ,
much of the apocrypha must surely qualify.

3. is it authentic \?

again , by what standard \? is authenticity a function of the authors \? the
historical accuracy \?

4. is it dynamic \?

what is this supposed to mean \? many of the apocryphal books are highly
dynamic thought provoking , faithful , even exciting.

5. is it received , collected , read and used \?

by whom \? of course the apocryphal books were received (by some) ,
collected (or else we would not have them) , read and used (and they still are ,
in the catholic and orthodox churches).

on these counts , the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god.

this is demonstrably false.

to quote unger 's bible dictionary on the apocrapha
1. they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and
anachronisms.

so do other books of the bible.

2. they teach doctrines which are false and foster practices
which are at variance with sacred scripture.

false by whose interpretation \? those churches that accept them find no
contradiction with the rest of scripture.

3. they resort to literary types and display an artificiality of
subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred scripture.

this is a purely subjective evaluation. the apocryphal books demonstrate
the same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.
(in fact , one could argue that the apocryphal additions to the book of
esther act rather to bring the unscripturelike book of esther more into
line with other books.)

4. they lack the distinctive elements which give genuine
scripture their divine character , such as prophetic power and
poetic and religious feeling.

have you ever read the wisdom of ben sira or the wisdom of solomon \? they
exhibit every bit as much poetic and religious feeling as psalms or
proverbs.

how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the
words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to
them , god will add to him the plagues described in this book.
and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy , god will
take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the
holy city (rev 22.18 9)
surely this sets the standard and not just man made traditions.

these words clearly were meant to refer to the book of revelation alone ,
not to the whole body of scripture. revelation itself was accepted very
late into the canon. the church simply did not see it as having a primary
role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.

it is also noteworthy to consider jesus' attitude. he had no
argument with the pharisees over any of the ot canon (john
10.31 6) , and explained to his followers on the road to emmaus
that in the law , prophets and psalms which referred to him the
ot division of scripture (luke 24.44) , as well as in luke 11.51
taking genesis to chronicles (the jewish order we would say
genesis to malachi) as scripture.

jesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day ,
the canon had not been established as a closed collection. the books
of the apocrypha were part of the septuagint (which was the bible of
the early church). the hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.
the torah (pentateuch law ) was established in jesus' day , as were
the prophets (with the exclusion of daniel). the writings , however ,
were still in flux. jesus does not refer to the writings , only to the
psalms , which were part of them. the books of the apocrypha were all
part of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.

to argue that jesus is referring to the jewish canonical order in luke 11 51
is weak at best he is not quoting scripture , but telling a chronological
story. and , as mentioned above , the hebrew canon (especially in the
present order) did not exist as such in jesus' day.

there seem to be many points to the speaking in tongues thing which
are problematic. it 's use as prayer language seems especially troubling
to me. i understand that when you pray in tongues , the spirit is doing
the talking. and when you pray , you pray to god. and the spirit is
god. so , the spirit is talking to himself. which is why i only go
by the pentecost use where it 's an actual language.

what is wrong with the spirit talking to himself. jesus intercedes
for us , and romans 8 26 27 tell of how the spirit intercedes for
us before god. that is no theological problem. tounges as a prayer
language finds support in i corinthians 14 14 18.


moreover , the phrase though i speak with the tongues of men and angels
used by paul in i cor. is misleading out of context. some would then
assume that there is some angelic tongue , and if when they speak , it
is no known language , then it is an angelic tongue.

its true that this could be (and has been) used as a rug to sweep
any difficulties under. but it is a valid point. paul does mention
angelic tounges in the verse.


hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of babel , we see how
god punished by giving us different language. can we assume then that
if angels have their own language at all , that they have the same one
amongst other angels \? after all , they were not punished in any manner.

if the languages we sepak are the result of babel , then it stands to
reason that angels would speak a different language from us. you do
have a valid point about multiple angelic languages. but angelic
beings maybe of different species so to speak. maybe different species
communicate differently.

trouble is , while such stories abound , any and all attempts at
verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that
the witness had no real idea of the circumstances , or that outright
fabrication was involved. the brother puka story in a previous post
seems like a friend of a friend thing. and linguistically , a two
syllable word hardly qualifies as language , inflection or no.

i have heard an eyewitness account , myself. such things are hard to prove.
they do n't lend themselves to a laboratory thing very well. i don' t
know if it is a very holy thing to take gifts into a laboratory anyway.

much as many faith healers have trouble proving their victories (since
most ailments cured are just plain unprovable) and modern day
ressurrections have never been validated , so is it true that no
modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy or lay.

that 's an unprovable statement. how can you prove if somethings been proved \?
there is no way to know that you 've seen all the evidence. once i
saw an orthodontists records complete with photographs showing how one of
his patients severe underbite was cured by constant prayer.

john g. lakes once prayed for someone and saw them healed in a laboratory ,

homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses. some of
them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations.
others simply do not address the issues.

i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues ,

there are exactly zero verses that clearly address the issues.

i agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights
activists. but if there are zero verses that 'clearly' address the issues ,
does n't that mean that there are also no verses that clearly support your
case \? are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly
address the issues \?

however , a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly
perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality.

the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is that applied
to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual
behavior and rape. since christians citing the bible in such a context
should be presumed to have at least read the story , it amounts to slander
a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against us.

the story in genesis 19 tells of the citizens of sodom demanding an opportunity
to know the two men who were lot 's guests the fact that the sodomites became
angry when lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they
were interested only in homosexual intercourse. yes , what they wanted was
rape , homosexual rape , and everybody agrees that that is wrong. some
christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as
sinful as the rape aspect of their desire. the passage does not say what it
was that so offended god , whether it was the homosexuality , or the intended
rape , or both , but i believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible
alternatives in the light of related scriptures. i do not believe that those
who believe god was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying
to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.

you seems to take the view that the only sin described in gen. 19 is in the
fact that the sodomites wanted to commit rape , and that it is unfair to
stigmatize their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape. i can
see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion
that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality , but then again we 're not
supposed to start from our conclusions because that 's circular reasoning. if
god is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general , then the more
probably interpretation is that he was at least as offended by the sodomites'
blatant homosexuality as he was by their intent to commit rape. later on i
will document why i believe the old testament portrays god as one who despises
any homosexual intercourse , even if both partners are consenting adults.

... do not be deceived neither fornicators , nor idolators , nor adulterers ,
nor effeminate , nor homosexuals , nor thieves , nor the covetous , nor
drunkards ,
nor revilers , nor swindlers , shall inherit the kingdom of god. and such
were
some of you... i cor. 6 9 11.

the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia
in this.

the moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church
as the proper authority for determining what kinds of marriages would be
legitimate , and thus the church 's refusal to recognize perverted marriages
was circular reasoning. my questions , however , had nothing to do with the
church ordaining new kinds of marriages , and so his argument was something of a
straw man. in terms of my original question , the precise
definition translation of porneia is n't really important , unless you are
trying to argue that the bible does n't really condemn extramarital sex. i'm
not sure the moderator was trying to do that.

in any case , i think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.
when jesus was asked about divorce , he replied , have you not read , that he who
created them from the beginning made them male and female , and said , 'for this
cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and
the two shall become one flesh' \? consequently they are no longer two , but one
flesh. what therefore god has joined together , let no man separate. (mt.
19 4 6). i read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife
(female) is a divinely ordained union. in other words , the institution of
heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by god not by men ,
and not by the church , but by god. men are not supposed to dissolve this
union , in jesus' words , because it is not something created by men.

this is not circular reasoning , this is just reading god 's word. i read in the
bible that god ordained the union of male and female. i do not read of any
similar divinely ordained union of two males or two females. granted , there
have been uninspired men who have ordained alternative unions (is n't caligula
reported to have married his horse \? ) , but the only union that jesus refers to
as what god has joined together is the heterosexual union of a man and his
wife.

(pardon me for mentioning caligula. i know that 's probably inflammatory , and i
should save it for the discussion on bestiality , in part 2 of this post.
please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of
my reply.)

anyway , my original question was not whether we should translate porneia in a
way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex , my question was
given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the bible as
divinely ordained , and given a biblical prohibition against sex outside of
marriage , is homosexual intercourse sinful \? of course , i see now that first we
need to ask whether the bible really condemns sex outside of marriage. you
seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and
other sins) are really wrong

i think we can all agree (with paul) that there are some kinds of
activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or
reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation. we may
or may not agree to the bounds of those categories , however and the very
fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at
all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest
in making them clear , leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions ,
with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated
christian discussion of all these areas.

alternatively , it may be that the definition of such terms as porneia and all
the rest was , in paul 's day , what we would call a faq i.e. the law , as the
tutor appointed by god to lead us to christ , had just spent some sixteen
centuries drumming into the heads of god 's people the idea that things like
homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.
perhaps paul did n't go into detail on what porneia c were because after 1600
years he considered the question to have been dealt with already. perhaps the
reason god 's apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining
a distinct , new testament sexuality was because he did not intend any
significant changes in the sexuality he had already established by the law.
i 'll discuss the law and homosexuality in greater detail below , but i just
wanted to point out that the new testament 's failure to develop a detailed new
standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that god does not care about
sexual conduct especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for
practicing homosexuality !

homosexual behavior is no different. i (and the other gay christians i
know) are adamant in condemning rape heterosexual or homosexual and
child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly
harmless but obsessive kinds of sex heterosexual or homosexual
that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter
you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul does in his letter that
you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning \?

'i am free to do anything , ' you say. yes , but not everything
is for my good. no doubt i am free to do anything , but i for one
will not let anything make free with me. 1 cor. 6 12

which is a restatement that we must have no other god before god. a
commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break. some
people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.
it is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary , so it 's a secondary
argument from the 'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such
behavior as to equate it with the rape of god 's messengers.

and how do you define an obsessively driven mode of sexual behavior \? how do
you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex
drives \? is the desire to have sinful sex an obsessively driven mode of
behavior \? i think you see that this is circular reasoning why is it defined
as sinful \? because it is obsessive. what makes it obsessive \? the fact that
the person is driven to seek it even though it 's sinful. or is it obsessive
because it is a desire for that which society condemns \? once again , that 's
circular why is it defined as obsessive \? because the person wants it even
though society condemns it. why does society condemn it \? because it is
obsessive.

you seem to be trying to limit the bible 's condemnation of porneia to only
perverted sex acts , but i do n't think you can really define perverted
without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of. what ,
then , is paul condemning when he declares that fornicators...shall not enter
the kindgom of heaven \?

i wo n't deal with the exegesis of leviticus , except very tangentially.
fundamentally , you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your
assumption that you know what porneia means.

i think you misunderstood me i was not trying to make an argument on some
technical definition of porneia , i was raising the issues of the sinfulness
of extramarital sex and the lack of any scriptural evidence of a homosexual
counterpart to the divinely ordained union of heterosexual couples.

there are plenty of
laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus , most of
which christians ignore completely. they never even bother to examine
them. they just assume that they know which ones are moral and
which ones are ritual. well , i have news for you. any anthropology
course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories
in an awful lot of societies (we have them too , but buried pretty deep).
and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus
from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us.

i'm dead serious here. when people start going on (as they do in this
matter) about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are and what
do they know about it , huh \? it is a solid clue to the same sort of
arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating
insects.

please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality , in part
2.

on what basis , other than assuming your conclusion , can you
say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus is not a part
of the ritual law \?

i am glad you asked. would you agree that if god condemns homosexual
intercourse even among those who are not under the law of moses , then this
would show that god 's condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual
law \? if i can show you from scripture that god punished the homosexual
behavior of people who were not under the law of moses , would you agree that
god 's definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to
just the ritual law and those who are under the law \?

i 've been having a private email discussion with a 7th day adventist on the
subject of the sabbath , and my main point against a christian sabbath keeping
requirement has been that nowhere in scripture does god command gentiles to
rest on the sabbath , nor does he ever condemn gentiles for failing to rest on
the sabbath. this illustrates the difference between universal requirements
such as thou shalt not kill , and requirements that are merely part of the
(temporary , jews only) law of moses , such as the sabbath.

the point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of
homosexual intercourse as an abomination is just a part of the temporary ,
jews only law of moses. i on the other hand believe that it was labelled by
god as an abomination for gentiles as well as jews , and that he punished those
guilty of this behavior by death or exile. here 's why

back in genesis 15 , god promises to give abraham all the land that was then in
the possession of the amorite kinda hard on the amorite , do n't you think \?
but in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds
it seems god is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while , because the
iniquity of the amorite is not yet complete .

remember , this is all long before there was a ritual law. what then was the
iniquity the amorite was committing that , when complete , would justify his
being cast out of his own land and or killed \? go back and look at lev. 18
again. verses 1 23 list a variety of sins , including child sacrifice , incest ,
homosexuality , and bestiality. beginning in verse 24 , god starts saying , do
not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these things the
nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled . for the
land has become defiled , therefore i have visited its punishment upon it , so
the land has spewed out its inhabitants... for whoever does any of these
abominations , those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their
people.

notice that god says the gentile nations (who are not under the ritual law of
moses) are about to be punished because they have defiled themselves and
their land by committing abominations that include incest , bestiality , and
homosexuality. flip ahead two chapters to lev. 20 , and you will find these
same abominations listed , and this time god decrees the death penalty on
anyone involved in any of these things , including , specifically , a man lying
with another man as one lies with a woman (lv. 20 13). their
bloodguiltiness was upon them , meaning that in god 's eyes , they deserved to
die for having done such things. according to lev. 18 26 29 , even the alien
non jew who sojourns among you was to refrain from these practices , on
penalty of being cut off by god \? from among their people.

under the circumstances , i believe it would be very difficult to support the
claim that in the old testament god objected only to the intended rape , and not
the homosexuality , in sodom. since god took the trouble to specifically list
sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the
canaanite nations , (not homosexual rape , mind you , but plain , voluntary gay
sex) , i 'd say god was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior , even
by those who had nothing to do with the mosaic covenant.

for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can
be law for christians (while others are not even to be thought about)
it is incumbent on you in every case , handled on its own merits to
determine why you pick one and ignore another.

according to ii tim. 3 16 , all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable
for teaching , reproof , correction , and training in righteousness thus , i
believe that even though we gentile christians are not under the law , we can
learn from studying it. if a certain action is defined as a sin because it is
a violation of the law , then it is a sin only for those who are under the law
(for example , in the case of sabbath keeping). where god reveals that certain
actions are abominations even for those who are not under the law , then i
conclude that god 's objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a
person is under the law , but on the sinfulness of the act itself. in the case
of homosexuality , homosexual intercourse is defined by god as a defiling
abomination for gentiles as well as jews , i.e. for those who are not under the
law as well as for those who are. thus , i am not at all trying to say that
gentile christians have any obligation to keep any part of the law , i am simply
saying that god referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not
obligated to keep the law. if this is so , then i do not think we can appeal to
our exemption from the law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice god has
declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both jew and gentile.

i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues ,

would someone care to comment on the fact that the above seems to say
fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of god \? how does this apply
to homosexuals \? i understand fornication to be sex outside of
marriage. is this an accurate definition \? is there any such thing as
same sex marriage in the bible \? my understanding has always been that
the new testament blesses sexual intercourse only between a husband
and his wife. i am , however , willing to listen to scriptural evidence
to the contrary.

you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an
abomination. also you shall not have intercourse with any animal to
be defiled with it , nor shall any woman stand before an animal to mate
with it it is a perversion. lev. 18 22 23.

i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the
verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse. i know
of no new testament passages that clearly condemn , or even mention ,
intercourse with animals. do those who argue for the legitimacy of
homosexual intercourse believe that the bible condemns bestiality as a
perversion , and if so , why \? that is , what verses would you cite to
prove that bestiality was perverted and sinful \? could the verses you
cite be refuted by interpreting them differently \? can one be a
christian zoophile \?

by the way , i myself am subject to sexual desires that i did not
choose to have and that many people would regard as perverted and
sinful , so please understand that i am not asking these questions out
of an antipathy towards my fellow people of alternative
orientations . i do believe , however , that one should read the bible
with an attitude of what is the bible trying to say and not what do
i want the bible to say. i choose not to give in to my perverted
sexual desires because i believe the bible tries to tell me , whether i
like it or not , that such things are sin. it is frustrating at times ,
and i have had days where it really got me down , but i do n't blame god
for this , i blame the sin itself.

mark

there 's some ambiguity about the meaning of the words in the passage
you quote. both liberal and conservative sources seem to agree that
homosexual is not the general term for homosexuals , but is likely to
have a meaning like homosexual prostitute. that does n't meant that i
think all the biblical evidence vanishes , but the nature of the
evidence is such that you ca n't just quote one verse and solve things.

i think your argument from fornication is circular. why is
homosexuality wrong \? because it 's fornication. why is it
fornication \? because they 're not married. why are n't they married \?
because the church refuses to do a marriage ceremony. why does the
church refuse to do a marriage ceremony \? because homosexuality is
wrong. in order to break the circle there 's got to be some other
reason to think homosexuality is wrong.

chalcedon was a compromise between two groups , the alexandrians and
antiochenes. it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable
to moderates in both camps , while ruling out the extremes. i agree
that there were extremes that were heretical. however in the course
of the complex politics of the time , it appears that some people got
rejected who did n't intend heresy , but simply used language that was
not understood or even was mispresented. and some seem not to have
jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine. there are

groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps. this

posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians. there are also
a remaining nestorians. like some of the current so called
monophysites , there is reason to believe that the current so called
nestorians are not heretical either. they sheltered nestorius from
what they saw as unfair treatment , but claim they did not adopt his
heresies , and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of
the antiochene tradition.

there is a big difference between the status of what you refer to as
alexandrians (actually , this includes all oriental orthodox churches
and not only copts) and that of nestorians. the oriental orthodox
churches never even shelter eutyches (the advocator of monophysitism)
but on the contrary , it condemned (and still does condemn) him and his
heresy. that is why the eastren (chalcedonian) orthodox church held
talks with the oriental (non chalcedonian) that started 30 years ago
and still continueing till today , but they have converged on many
issues the most imporatant of which is christology (i have more
details of the inter orthodox dialogue , in case anyone is interested).
so i do not see how the alexandrians and the nestorians are in a
similar position.

(larry l. overacker) writes
q if you knew beyond all doubt that hell did not exist and that
unbelievers simply remained dead , would you remain a christian \?

my contention is that if you answer this question with no. i would
not then remain a christian then you really are not one now.
... i follow christ because it 's a great way
to live life. and i could care less what really happens after
i die. i believe that there will be a resurrection , but that
wo n't have any effect on how i live this life. ...

ouch , this is a good question. to me , not existing is worse
than existing no matter what , so i will modify this question to be
would i be a christian if it made no eternal difference in my
reward or punishment \? i hope this is in the same spirit you want.

i personally am very goal oriented. it is hard for me to do things
that do not achieve some goal. however , to relate this to sports ,
only after i learned to not care about the score did i become
a good basketball player. i had to learn to go all out no matter
the situation. perhaps this lesson is relevent. after all ,
only if i can give up my life can i keep it , only if i am
humble can i achieve glory. only if i concentrate on living
my life now the best i can will i be afforded life eternal.
i think you have illuminated the true meaning of saved by faith.

but what is my answer \? right now i would remain a christian.
however , was that always my answer \? that 's the problem. heaven
and hell are good motivators at certain stages of maturity.
and i admit there are certain times when perhaps i bite my
tongue and put up with something in the hope of a better day ,
i.e. i mentally trade present happiness for future happiness.
i hope the cynics and skeptics do not read more into that
than appropriate , but i am trying to be honest.

(scott a mayo) writes
of course. but it is a pointless question , because you cannot know
beyond all doubt that hell does not exist , anymore than you can know
it does , short of taking jesus 's word for it. what if questions are
fun and entertaining , but probably fruitless.

i think these kinds of questions are extremely fruitful. i guess it
depends on how one views knowledge and learning. by stripping
ideas to simple , straightforward , opposing concepts we can
determine levels of importance. by analyzing the theoretically
absurd we can gain a better understanding of the actually absurd.

the christian reformed church does not allow people to belong to lodges ,
the reformed church in america does. the conservatives in both churches
are very similar , as are the progressives . the rca currently ordains

i do n't necessarily object to the secrecy but i do question it , since i see no
biblical reason why any aspect of christian worship should involve secrecy.

early in church history , the catechumens were dismissed prior to the celebration
of the eucharist. it was secret , giving rise to the rumors that christians
were cannibals and all sorts of perverse claims. the actions were considered
too holy to be observed by non christians , as well as potentially dangerous
for the individual christian who might be identified.

(to name a few of the verses that pertain to homosexuality)

but would n't that go for any sin. my father told me when he was growing
up catholics were not allowed to associate with anyone who was divorced.
there are a few verses prohibitting divorce. somehow , divorce became
acceptable (even in catholicism anullments). certainly it is no longer
a sin to associate with a divorced person. the point is that each person
has their own temptations to deal with. paul repeatedly talks about the
thorn in his side , some think it refers to lust , others pride , but
who knows. whatever the thorn was , apparently it was not compatible
with christianity , yet does that make his epistles any less \? the bible
warns us against judging , greed , anxiety , impure thoughts , bearing grudges ,
etc. , etc. i suppose we should seek out all the so called christians
who have entertained impure thoughts and oust them. all those who have
given in to greed , get 'em outta here. jesus pointed out that he
was the physician for the sinners. any attempts to make homosexuals
feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible
with christianity. is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone
try to become closer to jesus , we need to keep them away. does jesus need
us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin. do we really mistrust
jesus when he says he can forgive any sin \?

think about it. among the people jesus encountered were sinners and
the pharisees. the sinners he embraced and forgave. the pharisees ,
hypocritcal , unmerciful , self righteous , pointed out others sins and
did not seek and thus did not gain forgiveness of their own sins. what
i take from this and other verses is that if we do not admit our sins ,
those sins will not be forgiven. and since those guilty of even one sin
are guilty of the whole law , those not repenting the judging of others
are guilty , as guilty as if they committed the same sin they judged others
of.

the poor in spirit , meek , humble , merciful , pure of heart , peacemakers ,
those who thirst for justice , those who suffer for his sake are blessed.

luke 16 talks about the rich man and lazarus. matthew 25 talks about
the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. revelations
20 and 21 reference this fire as the place where unbelievers are
thrown. matthew 18 talks about being thrown into the eternal fire and
the fire of hell. it seems quite clear that there is this place where
a fire burns forever. from the revelations passages it is clear that
the devil and his angels will be tormented there forever. from the
matthew 25 passage it does n't seem abundantly clear whether the
punishment of unbelievers is everlasting in the sense of final or
in the sense of continual.

you 've missed on very important passage.

2 thess. 1 6 10
for after all it is only just for god to repay with affliction those who
afflict you , and to give relief to you who are afflicted and to us as well when
the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming
fire , dealing out retribution to those who do not know god and to those who do
not obey the gospel of our lord jesus. and these will pay the penalty of
eternal destruction , away from the presence of the lord and from the glory of
his power , when he comes to be glorified in his saints on that day , and to be
marveled at among all who have believed for our testimony to you was
believed.

things to note from this passage. unbelievers are both those who openly reject
the gospel , and those who do not know god. the eternal destruction is the same
as the eternal hope in 2 16. this distructions primarily emphasize that it is
separation from the presence of god. the context is speaking of the 2nd advent
while 2 1 is speaking of the rapture. do n't confuse the two.

in the bible , i am not aware of any discussion about the specifics of
hell beyond the general of hot , unpleasant and torment.

yet we have a far greater discription of hell that we do heaven.

for instance ,
it is not discussed how (if at all) the rich man can
continually stay in the fire and still feel discomfort or pain or
whether there is some point at which the pain sensing ability is
burned up. if you can forgive the graphicalness , if you throw a
physical body into a fire , assuming the person starts out alive ,
at some fairly quick point , the nerves are destroyed and pain is
no longer sensed.

if this was like earthly fire that requires a gas producing substance to
ignite.
however , there seems to be a different type of fire as expressed in the burning
bush that was not consumed. also , the daniel acct. shows that the laws of
nature can be interupted even with earthly fire.

it is not stated what occurs when at the judgement ,
the unbelievers , (who are already physically dead) are cast into hell

maybe you do n't understand. there will be those who are alive at the end of
the millenium , who will walk straight into the gwtj. even those who have died
in their sin will be resurrected , i.e. reunited with their physical body , to
receive condemnation.

i.e. they no longer have a physical body so they ca n't feel physical pain.

this is contrary to the teaching of scripture.

what could be sensed continually is that those in hell are
to be forever without god.

the lazarus rich man parable is told with the idea of having the listener
think in physical terms in order to get the point that some people
wo n't listen to god even after he rises from the dead.

this is conjecture at best if you are using it to support the no physical
body thesis.

the point of
the parable is to reach the hard hearted here who are not listening
to the fact of the resurrection nor the gospel about jesus christ.
it seems reasonable to also draw from the parable that hell is
not even remotely pleasant.

the true awlfulness of hell , is that it is eternal separation from god , after
having seen the glory of his presence at the gwtj. but whether it was open
rebellion against the revealed gospel of christ or if it is not having known
god (not saught him as he is) , then as paul says , they are without excuss and
that every mouth will be stopped. there will be no defense at the judgment
seat of god. therefore we understand it is appointed unto man once to die , and
then comes judgment literally.

just because it is horrific , does n't make it less of a reality.
it should compel those of us who have the riches of christ to share it with
others
