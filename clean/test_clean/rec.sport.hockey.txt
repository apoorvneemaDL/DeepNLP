okay , the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
do , does anyone have the history of the washington capitals' futility
record in the playoffs \? i remember that terry 's first year was the first

do n't give up so soon. a lot of burgh fans did n't give up at 3 1 last year.
you gotta believe ! (hard as that may seem) with the caps with the 1 power
play in the playoffs and 1 penalty killing (according to mike lange) all
the caps have to do is make sure it does n't go ot...as that was boston 's and
chicago 's demise. ot can be a curse.

paul@fugu.data io.com (paul brownlow) writes

wood played most of his junior career in seattle. he was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
1992. he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the whl.

wood is fairly small for an enforcer type. i mean , fleury does a pretty good
job and is n't that large , but dody is no fleury.

having been witness to three or four of his fights closeup , he simply is n't
ready to fight at an nhl level (assuming that it 's his role , which is all he
really showed us in his few games up from k.c. if he can pass , shoot or
skate , i never saw much of it). all he has is a right fist , which is n't bad ,
but at the nhl level , the other players are smart enough to grab the thing
before he can land anything significant. once you control that hand , he 's a
fish flopping on the beach and the other player can do just about anything
he wants to him. his entire strategy seemed to be keep the hand out of reach
until he found an opening and i never once saw him find an opening worth
talking about. he got neutralized quickly , and stomped on a couple of times.

unless he shows some new tricks in camp , he 'll be on my career minor
leaguer list. since this was his first taste of the nhl , i expect the
sharks gave it to him so he 'd know what he 'd have to work on off season. he
needs to get stronger , he needs to get more speed and he needs to show some
versatility as something else than a simply goond , because he was n't
particularly good as a goon.

i am sorry to tell you this , but

a game against pittsburg , the
penguins have so many scoring threats
that you shut down one and another
will kill you
it 's too bad but i must conclude that the penguins will

i do n't think the sharks should dig into the free agent market. most of
the good free agents will require quite a bit of compensation , and set the
sharks back as far as player development goes remember , the sharks were
unwilling to give up player(s) in addition to the 2 million they offered for
joe murphy , and i think that 's a good approach. they tried to sign sergei
makarov before this season because makarov would n't have required compensation.

matching the makarov offer was the only real mistake dave king has made this
year. i have to wonder about the intelligence of signing a 33 year old who
is obviously on the downside of his career to a 4 year 2 million contract.
risebrough matched the offer on king 's request and makarov has spent the last
quarter of the season in the press box because his work ethic just plain
stinks. not to mention that he 's lost a step and can no longer get himself
into position to make the nifty passes.

i think makarov will be available for free this offseason to anybody who agrees
to pay his contract. he 's ineffective in calgary , but he might be able to help
a team like san jose , with their shortage of talent. if there 's no takers , and
makarov does n't show improvement in training camp , i think the flames will just
bite the bullet and buy out makarov 's contract and release him. with his
current attitude , he is a detriment to the team.

quebec dominated habs for first 2 periods and only roy kept
this one from being rout , although he did blow 2nd goal.
canadians showed up in third but nords were playing dump
pull back most of the time.

do you notice that nobody on the team is willing to take charge \?
a dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad schneider got hurt.
he reminds me of chris chelios sometimes. speaking of chelios , i
wonder if serge savard feels like a moron for making that trade.
i also wish we still had corson.

rob ramage on the ice is less useful than a gatorade bottle on the
bench.

vincent damphousse has decided to take a vacation , apparently. i have
no idea why demers is playing denis savard on the checking line with
carbonneau. savard is skating well , and is one of the only dangerous
canadiens in quebec 's zone with the puck. too bad nobody is in front
most of the time.

do you also notice that in the defensive zone , not a single nordique
gets knocked down \? it 's disgusting. we also have lebeau (5'10 , 172)
getting pasted at centre ice by wolaninn (6'3 , 205) with no reply
from the team , except to yell for a penalty. dammit , denis savard
threw the best (only \? ) montreal hit of the night when he knocked
sundin off balance. when denis savard is your team 's enforcer , there 's
big trouble someplace...

hextall made some good saves but
really this one was lost in first period when nords scored 3
could have had 5 , plus another 4 in 2nd.

aside from that second goal , roy did stand on his head. the third
period at least provided something to look forward to. habs won the
period , imo , and i guess somebody finally came along to smack them a
couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game
had started at 7 30. hopefully they play that way at home. roy made
the saves (we 'll ignore that second goal) , so now it 's up to the team.

buffalo is up 2 0 is the series with boston , and the reason....grant fuhr \?
fuhr is playoff hungry , and he 's proving once again why they call him
money goaltender. fuhr might not be one of the best goaltenders in the
league anymore (statistically at least) , but he 's proving that he can
make the big save at the right time.
the leafs should have kept fuhr , and probably would have had a chance
against powerhouse detroit. but again.......where was andreychoke in game 1 \?

i applauded the sabres for making the deal to get fuhr , specifically because i
thought it would help them win at least one playoff series. however , i do n't
think the leafs can be faulted either...there is nothing to say that felix
wo n't be winning playoff series by himself in years to come.

anyway , does anybody else find it ironic that fuhr is up against moog \? (or at
least he was until a guy named alex showed up.... ) )

ok , buffalo fans. i am a red wings fan , but am amazed at how the sabres are
beating up on the bruins. is there any reason for this \? is it grant fuhr or
mogilny and lafontaine \? i would like to hear from you since i do not know much

okay... here 's some gripe ing ( \? griping \? ... whatever).

(i live in santa barbara... for reference... i think)

okay , abc showed the kings flames... fine... yawn.

espn (through a fortunate rainout of a baseball game) showed the
red wings toronto game... cool.

but i swear that the advertisements all week long had said that
espn would show pitt nj on tuesday and bos buff on thursday.

i raced home from work early (4 30 pacific) to catch the game , but
alas , it was the boston buffalo game and then they promised that they would
show the pitt nj game on thursday. overnight they changed their mind.

i did n't mind that much. i watched the game (hockey is much better
than no hockey). during the game their were no video highlights from the
patrick division. what the hell was going on \? at least they should show
video highlights of the other games (especially the nyi caps game that was
so close). my father (lives in bowling green , kentucky bumbf ck , egypt )
got to watch the pens game on espn. i just do n't get it.

the biggest problem is that buffalo or boston fans who did n't want
to see the pittsburgh new jersey game 2 , will turn on their tvs on thursday
and see the pittsburgh new jersey game 3 instead of the buffalo boston game
3. at least , in my case , i just had to wait 2 more days to see my game.

if i were a big boston or buffalo fan and i missed the game on
tuesday due to false advertising on the part of espn , i 'd be mad as
hell.

oh well... hopefully we 'll get better coverage next year or
something.

matt coohill

p.s. the announcers for the buffalo boston were the worst that i have
ever heard (as far emotion goes). they had the enthusiasm of
droopy dog . i hope for better on thursday.

reading through most of these hockey news i do n't see many ranger fans writing.

we 're here , talking about hockey. we do n't go away like some team 's fans
when the rangers bite the big one.

yeah i think we 're used to it by now. (even if some of us do change our
.sigs to root for our second favorite teams )


i'm new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering(1940)
ranger fan. but remember suffering builds character ! !

i do n't care ! i want my f cking stanley cup ! ! ! ! ! before i die ! aargh ! ! !

i 'll be happy if they win it before i get out of school. (the way it 's going
i may be here saying piled higher and deeper before long)



ranger fans may be suffering but we 're some of the most loyal , unlike islander
fans who only show up when the team wins.
this has been observed many times. it 's true , definitely.

i have a feeling that alot of people out there may not like this statement
but......
by far the worst band wagon fans are the pit fans (at least at the present).
case in point i know a guy who just came to hockey hell(tm) from pitt u.
him how 'bout the pens \? the 're f ing awesome
me yeah but beating up on the devils does n't mean alot. wait until
they meet boston and or detroit in the playoffs start.
him when do the playoffs start \?
me uhhhh. they started a week ago.

i'm not saying that this is true of all the waddlers fans but there seems to
be alot of them floating around who really know nothing about hockey except
that they 're newly beloved waddlers are the best team in the game right now
and when they 're not the best team those fans will disappear into the woodwork.

as far as the stanley cup goes i think there 's only one team that can test
pittsburgh and that 's detroit. this would be the most entertaining and hard
fought series. mario is amazing !

i am sure some bashers of pens fans are pretty confused about the lack
of any kind of posts about the recent pens massacre of the devils. actually ,
i am bit puzzled too and a bit relieved. however , i am going to put an end
to non pittsburghers' relief with a bit of praise for the pens. man , they
are killing those devils worse than i thought. jagr just showed you why
he is much better than his regular season stats. he is also a lot
fo fun to watch in the playoffs. bowman should let jagr have a lot of
fun in the next couple of games since the pens are going to beat the pulp out of jersey anyway. i was very disappointed not to see the islanders lose the final
regular season game. pens rule ! ! !

subject canucks 3 2 over winnipeg
organization simon fraser university , burnaby , b.c. , canada
lines 51

the jets gave the canucks another run for their money in an almost
identical game to the first of the series but once again came up short as
vancouver outscored winnipeg 3 2.
the pattern of the first game was repeated tonight , with the canucks
scoring quickly and then going to sleep in the second period , only to stave
off a jet comeback with opportune goals from their greater talent. the jets
looked more dangerous in this one but it did n't make a difference in the
numbers that counted goals.
vancouver 's big line produced again , with centre cliff ronning and
left winger geoff courtnall scoring in the first and in the second to
boost the canucks to a 2 0 lead on giveaways by the suspect jet defence of
bautin and ulanov. mental lapses by the defence and goal scoring talent
in opportune areas made the difference in all three canuck goals.
however , as in the first game , the jets worked hard to take the
game to the canucks in the second period. the jets dominated the second ,
checking hard and penetrating the vancouver zone without being challenged
by a canuck team that wanted to pack it in early.
the hard work paid off late in the second , when tie domi caught
vancouver goalie kirk mclean by surprise with a sharp angle shot to make
the score 2 1.
domi 's goal gave the jets new life as they began to take the rush
to the canuck 's collapsing defence. the canucks were unwilling to do
anything but let mclean take shots and clear the rebounds. the jets were
allowed to set up and make plays.
both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.
mclean made three great saves in the second off a dancing teammu selanne
while essensa was rocked by a pavel bure drive. selanne looked dangerous
on the rush as the jets pressed a series of attacks into the canuck
zone. the canucks , on the other hand , looked like they were offering four
checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.
a series of minor penalties at the end of the second period
resulted in a one man advantage for the jets in the early third. the
jet 's tempo numminen drove a puck from the point through mclean 's
legs and into the net to tie the game at 2 2.
the canuck 's discordant play picked up where it left off.
this was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected
or were picked off by the jets and individual rushes into a tight
winnipeg defence that were never supported.
however , as in the first and second canuck goals , a jet defensive
lapse (re bonehead play) stalled the winnipeg comeback. with the faceoff
in the winnipeg zone , pavel bure was left to stand in the crease with
no jet defender anywhere near him. bure , who had been invisible in the
game up to that point , took a rebound and managed to roof it with a
backhand even though he was off balance.
by then it was too late for the jets to come back. essensa made it
to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing
for their attack. canucks 3 , winnipeg 2.
next game is friday at winnipeg with the jets in the hole by two games.

go pens !

that would be clint malarchuck. it was speculated at the time , that
the injury was so serious that had he been playing at the other end
of the rink at the time (he was playing in the same end as the
ambulence is parked) , he never would have survived. ditto , if he
were playing anything other than a league with an ambulance on
standby.

if you 've seen video tape of the incident , it is amazing how much blood
there was. it was literally spurting out all over the ice , as clint
grabbed his neck and watched the puddle in horror.

amazingly enough , he made a full recovery , and played again in the
nhl. he was getting on in years at the time of the incident anyway ,
and did n't play for too long afterward. some people speculated that
he just could n't get himself back together after the incident , and i
think he had a bunch of other personal problems dogging him afterward.
he did eventually get back to form , and played another year or so after
that , and then i believe he retired.

anyone else \?

were you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day
contracts were explained \? aspn has a piece of paper saying it must
show that baseball game if it happens. many businesses payedd money to
have their commercials run during a baseball game. this is a business ,
not your own personal video servant.


my wife says i should n't go to bed angry , but last nite.........grrrrrrr !


maybe you should put that anger into something positive. for example , i saw
ads for the new dodge both on the espn and kbl broadcasts. why not write to
dodge saying that thanks to the ads run during the stanley cup playoffs ,
you will now concider their products in the future. they love to hear stuff
like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time
for hockey games , giving espn (and other networks) more incentive to carry
games (just one example)

in last nights game toronto received five penalties , detroit none. if



which game were you watching \? did n't you see the third period when
the wings had 2 penalties called on them and then a delayed penalty \?
the leafs had a 2 man advantage for about a minute and a 1 man advantage
for another minute or two and the leafs still could n't score.
and i wonder how the leafs scored a powerplay goal if , according
to you , they never had a powerplay.
in the detroit paper today , it said there were 40 penalties called in
last night 's game. and you 're saying detroit had none of those penalties \?
i'm guessing you only watched the first period. i have to admitt the leafs
did get alot of penalties in that period where as the wings did n't get
many if any at all (have n't looked at the box scores yet). but , the
ref more than made up for it in the third period.

go wings ! ! !

my apologies for the typo i meant the wings had 5 power plays in the
first period and the leafs none.

as well , my point is n't that the refs were biased , just that they were
calling a lot of penalties , which works to the benefit of the wings.

having the ref call a whole bunch of penalties against one team then
calling a bunch against the other to make up for it takes a lot away
from what could have been a great game.

of course , ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal
contributions before he was fired , so it 's not clear that this would have
been different. besides , they were marginal contributors.

let 's also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly
kisio , which , if the rumors i 've heard are true , was over the strong
objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the three headed , consensus oriented gm.

imagine , for a second , where the sharks would be today if that fax machine
had n't jammed.

on the other hand , i'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
fereirra made. imagine indeed , but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight.

let 's say that in the view of the sharks' upper management , the attempt
to trade kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire feirerra.
i'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view they should have kept
him...he 's obviously the luckiest man in hockey ! (wonder what
sacrifice he made to the muse of fax \? (his job , i guess.))

go pens !

i remember reading an article in reader 's digest many moons ago
about a similar incident. during a minor leaque game a player neck was
cut when the opponent he was back checking tripped and his skakes
flew up. in this case the victim 's mask proved a hinderance since
his face was protected and so he did n't bother with the
usually instinctive reaction to protect his face neck. a quick
thinking coach saved his life by applying direct pressure and using
snow to contract the blood vessels (from what i can remember).

like many others i too was watching the caps isles game when the went
to the baseball game. i too was pissed. how could they interupt such
an important game. i understand about contracts , but you would think they
would have a clause in the contract concerning important games !
anyway , us blues (and hawks) fans got shafted worse ! while everyone
in the u.s. and watched the game on abc. however those of us who live in
the central illinois area were subjected to watching the arthritus( \? )
telethon. the area that was most affected by the telecast did not get
to see the game except through hawk vision. this game , had it been
televised , would have been the first home hawks game shown in the area
since 1980. this television bull has got to stop. we are not only
being deprived of seeing games , due to skyrocketing ticket prices , but
we are also being deprived of watching them on tv.

45 dody wood season 1st
acquired 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
grade i (d d , although perhaps i should n't give a grade at all)

i have been accused of knocking on wood too much.

you \? nah...

he was seriously unimpressive , even as a tough guy (his rep). however , as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless , i hate
to judge the talent too quickly. butn in dody 's case , i m tempted to make an
exception.

but i wo n't.

wood played most of his junior career in seattle. he was one
of the leading scorers on a mediocre team when he was traded away in
1992. he rarely lost a fight and was one of the toughest players in
the whl.

however , i was extremely surprised when he was drafted , especially in
the third round. he certainly did n't look like nhl material...

while watching the penguins devils game last night , i saw the slash that
barrasso took on the neck. this brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate. i think he was a sabre , but i'm not positive.
does anyone remember know his name \? what has happened to him since \? what
about the player whose skate cut the goalie \? name \? info \?

that was clint malarchuk. that was a very dangerous accident. he could he
died right there on the ice. however , he has played since
but i do n't know where he is now. i think he is still playing but i'm
not positive. he was a sabre at the time.
i do n't know who skated into him though.

has this ever happened before in a hockey game \?


i remember a couple of seasons before the malarchuk incident borje
salming of toronto fell down in the crease and someone skated into
his face. that took a lot of stiches to fix.

thanks ,

go off on this at all in coach 's corner.

and that was the only infraction of this type in the game.
come on ! wake up ! geez he 's not the only player who does this

i said gund will have to open his checkbook , i did n't say give up
any draft picks or promising talent. if we could have gotten
murphy for the 2m great , but i agree the sharks should n't give
up young talent or early round draft picks. i listed chelios et al
only to indicate the type of player i think the sharks need to pick
up. the rules on signing free agents less than 30 years old puts
a big restriction on what the sharks can pick up. however , i do
believer they need to pick up some players who will add toughness
to the team.

but you have to remember that you 're unlikely to get any real quality free
agents who do not require compensation. the sharks tried , with makarov , who
was probably the top of the class among non compensation free agents , but even
he probably would n't have helped too much.

do n't expect to get top quality , just some toughness. i do n't
view makarov as a player who would add toughness.

size hopefully wo n't be much of a worry next year. alexander cherbayev and
michal sykora have agreed to multi year contracts , and it appears that mike
rathje will also sign soon. all three are pretty big.

size alone is n't enough. we all know how much fear kolstad (6 6)
struck in the eyes of opponents not !

well , rathje and sykora are both highly touted prospects , unlike kolstad...
and cherbayev was initially supposed to play for the russian wc team. (anybody
know what happened there \? ) that means that he 's likely to be good enough.


nelson , you 're confusing skill and toughness.


mcgill hammond johan garpenlov. would you really rather have those two
instead of johan \?

by your logic then you enjoy having falloon and ozolinsh on
injured reserve \?

by your logic then you think that if the sharks had kept mcgill and hammond
that you can guarantee that falloon and ozolinsh would n't have gotten hurt \?
(think again there was a chance that mcgill would have caused ozolinsh to get
stuck at kc , and as you know , hammond is worthless , and mcgill is almost
worthless.)

well , wilson , maybe , but i do n't think falloon and ozolinsh were really
injured on cheapshots.

who said they were \?

if they were n't then , i do n't see any justification that having mcgill and
hammond around would prevent their injuries. if the injuries of falloon and
ozolinsh were purely accidental , then what could mcgill and hammond have done
to prevent them \?

hey , get off the mcgill hammond thing. i'm no fan of either. my
point is that last year the sharks had toughness that was missing
this year. this year we had more skill , i'm all for that , but
if your skill players keep getting beat up and injured they
ca n't do you much good. whether it 's a cheap shot or not you
ca n't let the other teams push you around. the 1992 93 sharks
simply got pushed around to much. other teams knew this.
they knew they could aggressively check the sharks and not
pay for it. adding some players in the off season who will
add some toughness to the team will help insure that next
season other teams will be more hesistant to vigorously
check our skill players , or to take cheap shots. it does n't
guarantee no injuries (nothing does) , but it 's something the
sharks can do to reduce the number of injuries.

hi guys....

what happened \?
1. potvin did n't let six goals by.
2. wendel and andreychuk woke up.
3. home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs
the emotional edge.
4. refs calls (especially last night) tended to favour leafs.

a couple of comments

1. on gilmour just because the guy is n't one of the three
stars does n't mean he was not leading the team. someone posted
the playoff point total and he 's in something like fifth or sixth
place....plus , he walked away with the molson cup (given for
accumulating points from the three star selection) during the
regular season.

2. on the officiating i 've heard gripes from both ends on this
one. emotions are very high in this series the rivalry is
one of the stronger ones i know of. i do have to agree that the
officiating last night was pro leaf in general (except for whoever
missed that slash on gilmour 's hand).

3. in general i still think detroit has one of the better
chances vs. pittsburgh (though i think the leafs would do better
against the blues....but not as well if they made it out of the
division). problem is , i like both these teams , though i'm
supporting the leafs on the underdog principle. d

by the way...gilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not
playing aggressive hockey....
by the way....i'm not any sort of expert , nor do i claim to be.
i just like watching a good matchup.

the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the

two games were dominated by pitt. , you would think that they would show a
different game. this is in addition to the fact that they should show other
games just for the sake of fair exposure.

also , some of you should know that (as far as i can tell) espn is not going
to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds. i
believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two
rounds as those series wear on (games 6 7 , or perhaps games 5 , 6 , 7).

i 'd like to echo these sentiments. this is the worst coverage i can

and by that time , they 've signed off the air. no post game interviews ,
no updating of late scores , nothin'. tsn is really putting cbc to
shame. i only hope the later round coverage improves , i mean , who
really wants to see cbc primetime news instead of hockey.

my .02 ,
darren

this was a concession to mansbridge and cbc news , they argued that if you 're
going to play havoc with the schedule , you should at least make sure that
prime time is aired as soon as possible. news got a commitment that the
post game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to ptn within
one minute or so of the game ending.

as for the earlier comments about cbc being ontariocentric frankly
the no doubleheader decison goes both ways , people in the west cant see
the leafs and people in central canada ca n't see the jets game. the
reason for the decision was cbc 's feeling they could n't sell advertising
for six hours of hockey in one night.

as for who wants to see news over hockey , a lot of people. cbc always gets
plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.

here 's a summary of don cherry 's coach 's corner from april 21 , 1993.
the game being broadcast in my region was la and calgary , although
i think it was filmed during the toronto detroit game that night.

(warning... anti fighting people may want to skip this post.)

topics


don 's tie , grant fuhr , penalties , wings vs leafs , fighting , dale hunter.

episode summary


this episode began with the camera zoomed in on don 's tie. don was
pointing out the characters on the tie... bugs bunny , foghorn leghorn ,
and yosemite sam (who don called lanny macdonald.)

ron maclean began by mentioning that don was almost evicted from a
hotel where he was watching the previous night 's games , because of
all the yelling and cheering he was doing over the play of hunter
and fuhr.

don began to praise fuhr , calling him the greatest goalie , and
said that he 's winning the series against boston all by himself.
he then showed clips from earlier episodes (nov. 14 , jan. 16) when
fuhr was still with the leafs , and don advised do n't trade fuhr !

don went on to predict that if buffalo gets by boston , it would
be fuhr who wins the series. muckler took a lot of heat for the
trade , but don feels muckler 's been vindicated.

the next topic involved how playoff games are being ruined by
too many penalty calls. he showed a clip from a winnipeg vancouver
game , where domi hit a vancouver player , and was given a 2 min. penalty.
ron said that it was called a penalty because his stick was involved ,
but don stuck with the opinion that it was a good hit , with domi
hitting the vancouver player with his shoulder. don its sad what
they 're doing for hockey... a 5 minute penalty for a nosebleed.

next , they went to the playoff series between detroit and toronto.
people in detroit were calling wendel clarke wendy for not fighting.
however , don pointed out that probert was not fighting either.

this lead don into a tirad about fighting and stickwork , and how
banning fighting leads to more high sticking it 's like college
hockey... the little wee guy with the visor is brave as anybody.
that 's why you 're seeing so much stickwork. because they know you
wo n't drop your gloves and give them a shot. the rules are made
by people who do n't know what 's going on in hockey .

the final topic don discussed was dale hunter. don pointed out
that he was leading the league in goals , and showed a clip
of hunter from a previous game. when he was younger , hunter was
taught to play to win , which differs from today 's idea of
just letting kids have fun.

at then end of the episode , they showed a clip from a coach 's
corner , with the tape on fast forward , so that don sounded like
one of the chipmunks.

rating

typical anti fighting posturing , not too much humour , but some
good quotes.

i 'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

allan@cs.ualberta.ca (allan sullivan) writes


i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton.
oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference
next week. while the exact details are not known , it is believed
to concern the oiler 's future.

rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
with copps collesium in hamilton. during the press conference ,
pocklington may announce the deal. it is quite possible that
the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to
renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium.

northlands has offered to buy the oilers for 65 million earlier ,
but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington.

as for me , my opinion is divided... edmonton has been fairly
supportive of the oilers. even though they 're a small market
team , they had many sellouts in the 80s. even with the problems
that the team had this year , they still brought in more fans
than many teams in larger cities did. on the other hand , if
the team does move , there is no place more deserving than
hamilton. of course , how would that affect the grand
realignment scheme of bettman \?


following up on this , the provincial government has been asked by the
opposition to block any deal that pocklington is offering to hamilton. the
government said that pock is going nowhere !

why do n't i believe the government \? was n't it pocklington who wanted to be
tory leader 9 years ago \?

doing a good job , so he got off a weak shot , but then he decided to fall
to the ice. then the fucking ref(van helloamend \? ) called the guy for
holding. they replayed the play , and my roomate(who is clueless about
hockey) wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call , because it was so fucking obvious the nj player
had both hands on his stick , and no , he did not trip him. it is simple ,
mario gets touched , he falls to the ice , automatic 2. but the thing that
really pissed me off is , pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal , i do n't remember ,
on the resulting pp and
eventually won 4 3. his diving calls makes a huge difference in the
outcome of a game.

all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.

we must have been watching two different games. the devil had one hand on
mario 's elbow and pulling the elbow caused mario to fall so the call was
appropriate.

using clueless people to substantiate your claims does n't give me a lot of
confidence in your call either. next time consider getting a second opinion
from a clueful observer. or maybe all those available disagreed.

espn has been trying various things to get away from the
follow the puck concept of televising hockey games. one of the main
problems with hockey is that it is very difficult to show everything
that is going on more happens away from the puck than in any other
sport except maybe football and they can do iso 's on football players
to be shown between plays.

the problem of course is that sometimes you get something worthwhile ,
other times you get burned.

i'm not even going to bother to reply to your ranting post the letter is
addressed to gary bettman , not you. he can reply as he wishes.

not so. your post is addressed to all. i quote

as she said , the letter is addressed to bettman. the post (which , though
having pretty much the same content , is an entirely different entity) was
addressed to all. when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will
say to all . i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it
since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here. that 's an entirely
different purpose than sending the letter to bettman.

unfortunately...

and i guess i let you know did n't i \?

you do not represent a large body of hockey fans by any standard you care
to use to define large . 65 people constitutes nothing more than a tiny
group of fanatics and is in no way representative of a large body of hockey
fans on the internet let alone of one of the largest computer networks in
the world.

the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of
the internet , not a group as a whole that she claims to represent. as
for the business of whether or not it is large , it is large compared
to say , the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank
him for changing the names , at least to this point. and just for my
own curiosity i thought i 'd look up the official definition of large
in the dictionary. it reads

large 1. having more than usual power , capacity , or scope.
2. exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.

now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue
or how many people may have signed them. 65 people may be up there ,
thereby validating definition 2. i would also wager that the geographical
range of signatures is quite large , which would give it a large scope.

he might be impressed by the size of the list of names.

why would he be impressed with this unless it were large \?

i am of course assuming that you actually agree with what you are writing
and are not simply trying to be a pain about the whole issue to hear
yourself speak.

i personally do n't know whether or not i agree with the letter. i have
very mixed emotions about it. i like the names as they are , and do n't
think they make it that difficult to learn the game , but there might be
a shred of validity to the change.

well i think whenever espn covers the game they do a wonderful job. but
what i do n't understand is that they cut the ot just show some stupid
baseball news which is not important at all. then i waited for the scores
to comeon sportscenter , but they talk about baseball , basketball and
football. then they showed penguine highlight and went back to stupid
basketball. finally they showed a highlight of the ot goal but that
was like 30 sec. i think they should give more attention to nhl during
the playoffs then talking about boring basketball games..

i guess it is nhl 's fault too for leaving espn. hope things improve

disaster ! finland was beaten by czech 1 3 (0 0 , 1 1 , 0 2).
finland will be 4th of pool b and will most certainly meet canada in the
quarter final on wednesday 28th. lack of scoring skills has
been the major problem of team finland throughout the tournament.
briza (goalie) was the mvp of the czech team and tikkanen was the

scored a rare jets shorthanded goal as the jets held on to beat the
canucks 5 4 , and close the series to 2 1. trevor linden and pavel
bure had two goals each for the canucks in a losing cause.

selanne came out of a two game goal scoring slump , scoring two powerplay
goals , and one on a nice breakaway pass from darrin shannon.

hard work paid off tonight for the jets , and if the jets continue to
exhibit this strong work effort , they can make a series of it. (i woofed

again just further evidence as to what kind of an expert you are. truly a
stupid statement. mario is definately one of the best players to play the game.
i'm not saying he is the best to ever play the game , but he should come to
mind when that question is asked. let 's face it , he just returns from
radiation therapy with around a dozen games left , overtakes lafontaine for the
scoring lead and then buries him ! ! ! ! no , i guess he just got lucky.
speaking of lafontaine , now there 's a guy who should be considered for the

the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the
penguins and devils again on thursday night. being that both of the first
two games were dominated by pitt. , you would think that they would show a
different game. this is in addition to the fact that they should show other
games just for the sake of fair exposure.

espn must have some very poor marketing people. they are only concerned with
featuring players (i.e. mario) than featuring good competitive hockey.

also , some of you should know that (as far as i can tell) espn is not going
to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds. i
believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two
rounds as those series wear on (games 6 7 , or perhaps games 5 , 6 , 7).

i 've heard that this is because most of their market is east coast and hence
would prefer the wales stuff. also , do n't expect canadian teams on espn.

in summary , if you want to see a network that provides good hockey coverage ,
watch cbc from canada. they may be biased toward canadian teams , but they
do n't treat the viewers like idiots , they provide nice updates , and don cherry
will always provide a few laughs.

the usa today says late this year . the question is , will hockey be moved to
espn2 permenantly , or will it be where they have a game of the week on
espn , and have a bunch of other games on espn2 \?


yes and no. espn2 will be launched as early in september. cap cities
are currently working with cable companies to ensure a good start up
base needed for a launch for any brand new cable service.

the problem espn2 faces is the tci cablevision connection in the
merger of their prime and sportschannel networks. prime sportschannel
will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the off season. also , tci
and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of 15 million subscribers. tci cablevision will
do their best that espn2 never gets off the ground successfully. and the
nhl 's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc
and espn. nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime
sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local nhl nba mlb sports teams.

when quinn took over vancouver several years ago , not last year , they
regularily missed the playoffs. i ca n't recall if they missed the playoffs
the year before his hiring but they probably did. quinn has improved the
team from non playoff calibre to a serious contender.

when murray took over in detroit , the were about a .500 team that was a
contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup
contender.

the last year before bryan murray took over , the wings did not make the
playoffs. while they had been considered a possible contender when jacques
demers first arrived , in his last two years they were , respectively ,
embarrassed in the first round by chicago , and then failed to make the
playoffs (at a time , a might add , when there were only five teams in the
norris).

it 's true that vancouver did not make the playoffs for many a year before
quinn came , but in those years the smythe division was a lot i mean a lot
tougher division than the norris , also known as the snorris , division.
vancouver had to play edmonton and calgary , both very legitimate stanley
cup contenders , eight times a year , while detroit got to play such
powerhouses as toronto and minnesota. now , edmonton is hardly even a force
in the league , and the smythe even has the mighty san jose sharks , while
over this same period of time in which vancouver was improving , so was
everybody in the norris (except st. louis). detroit had to improve just
to keep up with the competition in their division. they had to improve a
lot to get better than their competition in the norris.

bryan murray inherited a team with very little talent. for really good
players , they had yzerman , burr , and probert , and that was about it. (and
no doubt some will dispute whether burr and probert were that good). the
rest were either very green rookies or washed up veterans. the only reason
they got as far as they did in the years before murray came was due to the
coaching of demers , who , at least at first , got every last ounce of effort
possible out of his team. then , even his coaching began to degrade.

so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm.
quinn is one example of a better gm than murray.

there are a number of reasons why detroit was n't in as bad a shape standings
wise when murray took over as vanc. was when quinn took over , some of which
i outlined above , but murray did not have any better personnel to work with
at the outset than did quinn , with the exception of yzerman. and one player
cannot alone make a team into a stanley cup contender , as i'm sure everyone
reading this will agree.

we 'll be able to see better which team is really the most improved when they
face each other in the conference final (assuming they do n't get knocked out ,
like last year).

i for one am happy about the ranger 's hiring of keenan. it 's too bad
that they
did n't hire him when smith fired nielsen , maybe he could of staightened
out the
babies on this team and made the playoffs. what this team needs is a
little
fire under their butts ! !

reading through most of these hockey news i do n't see many ranger fans
writing.
i'm new to this system and a big hockey fan and a long suffering(1940)
ranger
fan. but remember suffering builds character ! !

i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that
last
dreadful stretch.

1. knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline , why did n't we
see mike
hurlbut , who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first
went
down \?

2. why \? \? \? \? ! ! ! ! ! is joe kocur playing every night \? he is not bob probert
who is
tough but also can play.

3. how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of
the
season. at least he plays with some heart and character , draws
penalties and
plays 110 when he 's on the ice. was he in the doghouse for some
reason \?

4. joe cirella \? \? \? \? \? ! ! ! ! enough said !

ranger fans may be suffering but we 're some of the most loyal , unlike
islander
fans who only show up when the team wins.

as far as the stanley cup goes i think there 's only one team that can
test
pittsburgh and that 's detroit. this would be the most entertaining and
hard
fought series. mario is amazing !

kurt

i think joe kocus should play every night. he is a big physical guy , and
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits. (both checks and
fists) its a big advantage to get the crowd going. plus , he helps
protect the other players. notice there are very few fights when kocur is
on the ice unless he is it. i have seen people start to go after essa
tikkanen , only to go slinking away when kocur steps in. i think he is big
asset , but should be third line , and special situation only play.



this is fast becoming a game without the goons. i admit kocur may get the
fans into the game but surely they would rather see broten taking a pass from
kovalev and scoring a breakaway goal to put the rangers up 3 (magic ) goals in
the third period , rather than seeing kocur take another stupid penalty and the
rangers giving up another powerplay goal !

the rangers need another top flight center who can take the pressure off
messier and the first line. nemchinov is a perfect third line center.

so who goes beezer or richter \?

the baseball game was scheduled to air and advertisers money was paid so

well , partly because i , as an ardent fan of both sports , would rather
see game 3 of the nhl playoffs than game 3 of 162 of the mlb
season (even if the bb game involves the red sox).

espn may have had contractual obligations. i understand that part.
but it 's a bit inaccurate to call us selfish just because we want
to watch the watch the game we love. am i , as a baseball fan , selfish

organization ub

nntp posting host lictor.acsu.buffalo.edu



it was unlikely , improbable. for the bruins , it was the stuff of
nightmares for the sabres , it was a taste of heaven.
for the first time since 1983 , the sabres have won the first three
games of a series. last time was a three games to none victory in a
best of five against the canadiens. it takes a little more work this
time. the sabres seem ready to put in the extra work.
on the heels of a shutout , one that took away boston 's home ice
advantage , the sabres came back with a four to three overtime win. it
was n't easy. it was n't always pretty. it still worked.
john blue got the nod for boston , supplanting andy moog as starting
goaltender. moog was pulled midway through game 2 on tuesday.
buffalo started with a goal by mogilny , his fourth of the playoffs , on
the powerplay , with boston 's don sweeney and gord roberts in the box.
lafontaine and hawerchuk had the assists. goal number two was
khmylev 's first of the playoffs , a pretty goal scored when the sabres
stole the puck and passed to an open and waiting khmylev. smehlik and
hannan assisted. determined not to be shut out , boston tallied on a
shot by ray bourque on the powerplay , with colin patterson and bob
sweeney both in the box. period two was scoreless , a split of
penalties between the two clubs. the third saw boston 's smolinski get
his first , courtesy of oates. buffalo resecured the lead two minutes
later , from former bruin bob sweeney (khmylev and carney). neely tied
the game 3 4 of the way through the third , sending it into overtime.
last year overtime meant a bruin win. last night , it spelled sweet
revenge , as buffalo scored with ray bourque in the penalty box , on a
tip in by khmylev (hawerchuk and lafontaine) a minute into overtime.
both teams finished with 34 shots.
power play conversions boston 5 1. buffalo 7 2.
referee rob shick.

comments shick pocketed the whistle in the third , allowing a lot of
clutching and grabbing. buffalo 's penalty killing unit was fantastic
again. mogilny was checking. granted he missed once and instead
flung his body into the boards , but checking like this is a novel idea
to mogilny. the crowd was unbelievable. i do n't think i 've ever
heard a crowd that loud in the aud for a sabres game (remember , i was
only five when they played for the cup. i do n't remember it and no
one took me to the games). doug bodger , in a postgame interview ,
noted that he tried to say something to hawerchuk , but the crowd was
too loud , even though he was shouting. it did n't seem to matter , as
most of the sabres and even muckler said it was great. yuri khmylev
did n't seem to realize that he was the game 's third star and did n't
skate out when his name was called. sweeney (2) and fuhr (1) each
were out before yuri made his appearance , sans jersey. when asked in
an interview later whether he knew how big a goal that was , he
responed yes (ok , it was through an interpreter and he said more than
that , even more than the interpreter said , but i digress). the
interviewer seemed to think just because he does n't speak english , he
must not understand playoffs. uh huh.


valerie hammerl john sr. would lift pat over the boards , grab
hammerl@acsu.buffalo.edu his hand , and start running around the outside ,
v085pwpz@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu faster and faster. i wanted to learn how to

here 's a summary of don cherry 's coach 's corner from april 23 , 1993.
it was taken from a tape delay of a vancouver winnipeg game , but
it was filmed during the toronto detroit game that night. i think
it was also shown during the calgary la game.

(warning... anti fighting people may want to skip this post.)

topics


don 's tie , doug gilmour , wings leafs , quebec montreal , boston buffalo ,
wendel clark , fighting and stickwork.

episode summary


once again , the episode started with a shot of don 's tie... this
was a different tie than last time. don pointed out some of the
characters on the tie , but gave them different names... felix the
cat (sylverster) , maclean (daffy duck) , etc.

ron maclean asked don what he thought of the current wings leafs
game. don thought it was good. burns told the leaf players they
won in their building , we 're going to win in ours .

don then began to praise gilmour again. don pointed out that gilmour
has never got less than 2 points or a goal in any game since he
got 5 points in a game against st. louis. (don also claims that
he gave a lot of encouragement to gilmour , which was partly responsible
for his good play.) several clips were then shown of gilmour
from the series... a hit on constantinov , and a pass to andrewchuk
resulting in a goal.

on the game itself , the wings were taking a lot of penalties in
the first period. the wings have enough talent to score short handed
however , and when the leafs get a power play , coach burns tells
the leaf players do n't let them score on you .

ron brought up the previous quebec montreal game. note montreal
won that game in overtime , despite having a possible game winner
disqualified because it was batted in with a high stick. don
thought the high stick was obvious , even without the use of
instant replay.

on the buffalo boston series note buffalo is currently winning
the series 3 0 , don gave full credit to goaltender grant fuhr.
fuhr should be getting 1 2 the team 's playoff checks for his
play.

wendel clarke has recently been criticized for his performance
during the detroit toronto series. don defended him , by saying
that he ca n't play the way he should , because of the league 's
new rules. this used to be a rough and tough league... now its
all hack and slash. don lays the blame on gil stien for the
problems.

don 's opinions on fighting and stickwork are shared by wings
gm and coach bryan murray. a clip from a news conference by murray
was shown , in which murray made statements claiming the elimination
of fighting increases stickwork. don also read a newspaper article
in which murray makes the following statements players do n't fight
because they 're afraid of getting thrown out of the game as instigator.
instead , they settle grudges by getting their sticks and slicing
each other. is this what the fans want to see \? i guarantee there
would n't be as many slashes if fighting were kept in the game.

don warned league commisioner gary bettman to smarten up with
fighting in hockey. he went on to say that before , there used
to be one guy cut with a high stick in a series. now , with no fights ,
someone gets cut every period.

rating

typical anti fighting posturing , but here don 's opinion is supported
by murray.

i 'd give it a 7.0 out of 10.

speaks for itself. the blues really have a chance to advance to the
second round this year...

in article randolin.6.735770247@polisci.umn.edu randolin@polisci.umn.edu (robert andolina) writes
many people have suggested that fuhr 's play is the only reason that the
sabres beat the bruins. while fuhr was a critical factor , i would not
overlook the fact that the sabres finally got some scoring from people other
than mogilny and lafontaine (khmylev , sweeney , hawerchuck , etc.). indeed ,
lafontaine played hurt and did n't score many goals. also , the team played
better defense (although not great) than in the regular season. fuhr
deserves a lot of credit , but not all of it.

robert a.

i agree with this. i also think fuhr 's contribution for sabres 's win is just
the same as many palyers in the team. mogilny had six goals in four games
including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after fuhr had
left. the key for sabres 's win over boston is whole team 's strong commitment
as an underdog and all their talent players including mogilny and fuhr.


i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that !
while it 's true that the entire sabres team played very well , i
still believe that if it was n't for grant fuhr , the series would
now be tied 2 2. he virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the sabres.
in both of these games , fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres
the chance to win. especially in game 3 , fuhr made a series of
huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2 2.
even in game 2 when the sabres won 4 0 , the score seemed to
indicate that the sabres dominated. however , if it had n't been
for fuhr , the sabres would n't have been up (2 0 i think it was)
through the 2nd period and the bruins would n't have had to open
up the game (thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on
a breakaway to salt away the game). there
is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the
victory.

in my opinion , neely , oates and juneau played as well as
lafontaine , mogilny and hawerchuk. the sabres did get
extraordinary efforts from hannan , sweeney , wood , and khmylev
(compared to that of the bruins checkers). however , the bruins defense
, imo , played better than the sabres defense (the sabres have ken sutton
playing a regular shift afterall )
the difference in the series was fuhr , who outplayed andy moog.

gary

go sabres !

i for one am happy about the ranger 's hiring of keenan. it 's too bad that they


i agree that keenan is an excellent choice. did you see mike
lupica 's column in sunday 's news \? my sentiments exactly. i
think he just may be the one to instill some hunger and fire
into their hearts next season. either that or he 's going to
be kicking alot of butt !

reading through most of these hockey news i do n't see many ranger fans writing.

i'm here , but am new to this group and have been keeping fairly
quiet (you know , doing the lurking thing). i do n't have a
sense how many rangers fans there are on the list either. i
am a die hard ranger fan (i guess i have to be i sat in the
garden throughout the penguins' led by mario 's 5 goals decimation
of them on 4 9) , but am sick at the abundance of talent that has
been totally untapped , and the lack of heart displayed this
season.


i have some final questions about the way the team was handled in that last
dreadful stretch.

1. knowing they needed offensive help from the blueline , why did n't we see mike
hurlbut , who played pretty well when he was called up when leetch first went
down \?


hurlbut was injured for quite a while. i'm not sure , but i
think he may have recovered in time for the playoff run , and
if so , like you , question why he was n't used.


2. why \? \? \? \? ! ! ! ! ! is joe kocur playing every night \? he is not bob probert who is
tough but also can play.


i believe kocur was used , in many instances , for his intimidation
factor. granted , he seemed to get an awful lot of ice time for
that reason alone , but you have to realize that when a team is
not doing any real physical intimidation (i 'd like to have a nickel
for every time j.d. said 'they 've got to take the body more') ,
you 've got to at least have some illusions (

3. how come paul broten is relegated to street clothes for the end of the
season. at least he plays with some heart and character , draws penalties and
plays 110 when he 's on the ice. was he in the doghouse for some reason \?

i agree and i do n't know.

4. joe cirella \? \? \? \? \? ! ! ! ! enough said !


sorry , i do n't agree with you here. i think joey c. did a good
job filling in when he was asked to. i ca n't imagine that it 's
easy going from near 0 ice time to being a full timer. i do n't
seem to remember him turning the puck over at the blue line too
much , or failing to clear the zone. he worked hard , and at
least did n't make any rookie mistakes. as he said himself in an
interview , he can only give what he has. and he did.


ranger fans may be suffering but we 're some of the most loyal , unlike islander
fans who only show up when the team wins.


absolutely. i think attendance at the garden was better on the
last day of the season , than any average night for the
islanders.


fought series. mario is amazing !


the man is awesome. in a way , i'm enjoying the playoffs more ,
now that the rangers are n't in them. i can really appreciate
all the glory mario is getting without 'hating' him because he 's
on the opposing team. he deserves it all , as far as i'm
concerned.

the problem espn2 faces is the tci cablevision connection in the
merger of their prime and sportschannel networks. prime sportschannel
will try to wrestle away nhl from espn in the off season. also , tci
and cablevision have control a large number of cable systems around the
country with a total of 15 million subscribers. tci cablevision will
do their best that espn2 never gets off the ground successfully. and the
nhl 's value will suddenly skyrocket in this cable war between prime sc
and espn. nhl is more vital to the survival of a regionalized prime
sportschannel since they virtually have no national major league sports
contracts and only cover local nhl nba mlb sports teams.

note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various sc
and prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local nhl owners.
when if cablevision vp chuck dolan 's purchase of the islanders goes
through , the islanders will be back solidly in the scny fold (their
original owners were , and they 've remained due to a lucrative tv
contract). the flyer snyders own the philadelphia sc as well as the
prism pay channel. there are six teams affiliated with regional sc 's ,
another half dozen affiliated with prime outlets , and other locals
like hts and nesn who have barter arrangements. with all this
cross ownership , i was surprised that espn got the deal this
season ! !

here is something crossposted from the ahl mailing list

in a discussion between me and chris lerch , the subject of springfield 's
1st round upset of the providence bruins
came up. chris basically raised the possibility that the ahl
hierarchy is biased in favor of the indians. he noted that the offices
for the league are in spring. and many ex indians are working for the ahl.
furthermore , he also informed me that back a few years ago in the cup
finals between roch and spring , that the amerks charged favoritism by the office
and that

...there were little questionable things liket he ahl president and
staff attending all games with the springfield brass , including sitting
in their box for the game in springfield and , according to the rochester
media , openly cheering for springfield.

certainly this is something that is quite serious if any of this
is true. i do n't know if this is anything more than whining on the
part of the amerks (they have pulled this sort of crap against the
wings before) but if true , this is somthing that seriously raises
questions about president jack butterfield 's leadership.

as a hockey fan i can sympathize with thefrustration that you feel. the
problem is that other americans do n't give a shit about hockey. they view
it as a bunch of canadians with bad accents and missing teeth beating the

two thirds of the us to see the stuff naturally. on the other hand
baseball is the gasp swoon sigh national pasttime . baseball is so
romanticized in the us that you are supposed to forget that other sport

baseball games a week they should be able to show an ot hockey game instead
of the opening innings of a baseball game. hell , the game is going to last

as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and does n't know

he 's a canadian thing altogether. seriously , what is he all about \? i
know he was a coach at one time , and from the volume of posts about him ,
someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow , but my question

seriously \? i gotta tell you , from what i see , he really sounds like an
ass. let me know maybe i'm missing something.


for those of you who complain about don cherry , and wonder why he is
popular...

the reply is dick vitale and john madden and bobby knight and
joe garagiola and howard cosell.

john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his all madden team
a lot , over much better receivers...for much the same reasons cherry
sings the praises of doug gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one
does n't see a string of american posts saying that john madden has
lost his marbles.

dick vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
that college with outrageous statements.

why should americans expect that canada would not have such characters
in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey \? canadians
are very similar to americans...culturally our sports are just hockey
and curling , whereas with americans it is football basketball baseball
and bowling.

gerald

i 'd like to add that i think canadian hockey fans like don because his kind of hockey (the hockey he promotes in his tv appearances) is the kind that they think used to get played in the old 6 team nhl. so there 's a kind of nostagia for the old days , before expansion , the soviet series , gretzky and even bobby orr , when guys were n't afraid to take a hit , nobody floated and defensemen played defence. who cares that that probably never really existed , the myth is still around in canada and all the european in



fluence on the game has diminished it in some people 's eyes.

personally , i 'd like to add before i get flamed , i love the fast paced european game and think don cherry is a bit of an idiot. i have to say that i missed him when i was living in the states , though. he is entertaining , even if you end up throwing your popcorn at the screen when he 's on.

bleep ! bleep ! bleep ! the bruins lost again in o.t. i ca n't stand it !

aside from frustrated ravings , i must give buffalo credit they are making good
on most of their scoring opportunities , and are playing great defense. boston
players ca n't seem to get control of the puck anywhere near the buffalo net
except for on rare occasions. the buffalo defense is also doing an excellent
job clearing away rebounds. fuhr is playing great when the big save is needed
but he 's also getting plenty of help.
boston has been playing rather well (better than would be indicated by the
series score of 3 0) but is lacking that extra drive in the earlier part of the
game. as a result , boston keeps leaving the ice at the end of the 1st period
2 goals down. this must stop if boston is to have any hope of winning a single
game (the outlook for the bruin 's advancement to the second round are quite
bleak). imho , the bruins need to score first. if they can do that , they have
an excellent chance of winning , since they have outplayed the sabres in the
2nd and 3rd periods.

(the scary thing is that i 'll be going to grad school in buffalo next year.
i 'll never cheer for the sabres... you ca n't convert me... )

scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot. i do n't care if he 's
in the crease or not , get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball !
(yes , roller hockey , remember) and if there was nobody around to clear
the slot , then i 'd do it myself by pushing the offending player hard .
i hate people in my way when i'm the goalie , and i am sure felix does
too. i should say that i did n't see the incident , so if potvin really

i have to agree wholeheartedly with this view. i do n't like to see stickwork ,
but you have to clear players away from in front. my personal favorite move
(i'm a goalie too) is to give the offeding player a good whack on the back
of their skates when the ref is n't looking. makes 'em go down like a ton of
bricks , but does n't cause injuries unless they do n't know how to fall (i'm
talking about hitting the blades here , not the foot). it also makes the
player you hit and anyone who sees really mad and apt to take a stupid
retaliation penalty. unfortunately , it also leaves your blocker out of
position for a short time...i do n't do this if a shot is likely on the short
side. hmm....maybe i should mail potvin this method (in french and with
helpful diagrams , of course). it sure would be nice to see ciccerelli (who
i have a great deal of respect for , btw , he 's not a big guy , but he plays
huge ! ) fall on his back a few times ! )

just some thoughts

i do n't usually like to post simply to make fun of a player ,
but this time i could n't resist. during the pens devils game
last night , second period , i think kevin stevens was in the
penalty box , nicholls punched kjell samuellson in the face ,
then raised his stick like a two handed sword to defend
himself ! all kjell could do , at 8'7 and 355 pounds , was laugh !

and speaking of swedish penguins defensemen , ulf is getting a
little out of hand lately. his cheap shots are getting more
frequent and more violent. as everybody in the meadowlands
except for the officials could see last night , he rammed the
butt of his stick down one of the devil 's throat. i 've always
supported the argument he does his job by being irritating ,
but he 's starting to push it over the edge imho. of course ,
holik 's chop to barrasso 's neck was n't too sportsmanlike either.
it seems that he was following the the only way to beat the
penguins is to injure them philosophy.

as my modern drama professor pointed out to me the other day ,
jagr was stoned pretty well tuesday night , and last night as
well , although the 30 seconds he danced around the devils end
was pretty exciting.

just a side note , squid octopi made their way to the ice in buffalo.
i still do n't understand why buffalo , but maybe it 's lucky. ) btw ,
they shovel them up from the ice here , using the shovel used to scoop
up the snow the zamboni leaves as it leaves the ice. although blue

he 's a canadian thing altogether. seriously , what is he all about \? i

he 's a canadian thing . former coach of the boston bruins and colorado
rockies. from the summaries that get posted i gather that his ongoing beef
this year has been the conventional wisdom that canadian hockey is doomed
to be second or third rate behind the perceived emergence of the u.s.
and european programs.

know he was a coach at one time , and from the volume of posts about him ,
someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow , but my question
is , what is the deal with him \? secondly , are the comments of his that i

after he left the rockies , he got a job with cbc 's hockey night in canada
and has n't looked back since. actually , he did work for cbc at least
on playoff season after the rockies were eliminated.

seriously \? i gotta tell you , from what i see , he really sounds like an

i 'd say it 's a combination of flame bait and serious journalism. the closest
thing you 'll find to cherry in the u.s. is stan fischler , a self described
hockey maven. the similarities are that they both say things that get
people upset. the difference is that cherry knows the game and fischler
does n't.

ass. let me know maybe i'm missing something.

don 's a character. if he were completely rational and noncontroversial
he would n't have a job. by some definitions , he could be called an ass.
but then some people feel the same about mike lang , another character that
i wish would get wider exposure (only one national telecast last year).

john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his all madden team
a lot , over much better receivers...for much the same reasons cherry
sings the praises of doug gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one
does n't see a string of american posts saying that john madden has
lost his marbles.

maybe because john madden does n't pretend that his all madden team is the
team of the best players. maybe because john madden does n't feel the need
to denigrate players he does n't choose for his all madden team. maybe
because madden actually demonstrates some knowledge about football when he
broadcasts a game.


don cherry does n't denigrate players except those who dive , showboat ,
wield their sticks as weapons while hiding behind visors , or
deliberating attempt to injure or aggravate the injuries of others.

not always true. in fact , in the case of doug gilmour , he actually praises them.

europeans that do those things are scum in cherry 's opinion. canadian kids
that do them are tough , just like a real canadian .

ulf samuelsson cheap shots mark messier 's ribs and don wants ulf 's head. doug
gilmour breaks tomas sandstrom 's arm and don says sandstrom had it coming.
methinks don is either very confused or just a bigot. most likely the latter.

i used to like don cherry. i thought he was great. but i'm starting to see
his true colors (redneck) and the more i see of them , the more i think he 's
just an asshole.

get off espn's back and stop posting articles on this subject ! ! !
there have been to many f n complainers about this game that it 's making me
sick.

generally i agree with you. however , (1) last night espn cut away to baseball
tonite , which looks like sportscenter tailored to baseball , and they cut
away at 7 40 pacific. that 's quite a contract they have there. (2) if
espn could n't deliver , they should have had a transistion plan to
let sportschannel pick up the slack.

nonetheless , it is ultimately the fault of the us american public that regular
season baseball has precedence over playoff hockey in the u.s.
support your team support your game.

somebody in r.s.h. had an excellent idea that we should write chrysler
to thank them for supporting hockey with their ads and that we would
consider their products. here 's an equally excellent idea , watch
baseball for 10 minutes (i know i'm asking a lot , but that 's what spew
bags are for) , write down who is advertising , and write them letters
complaining that they are supporting baseball to your displeasure and
that you wo n't consider buying their products because of it.

acquired c marcus thuresson , from n. y. islanders
for rw brian mullen
grade i (b c )

it is not known yet what the impact , overall , of this trade would be , as
thuresson is not yet under contract to the sharks , and does not appear to be
ready to become so anytime soon. mullen , meanwhile , has had a productive
(somewhat) season with the islanders. thuresson , however , does not appear to
be a big scorer at all if my memory is right , he had just 2 points in just
11 games in the swedish elite league in '91 92. this season , i did n't notice
his name frequently at all in staffan 's reports , and he did n't make the
national team either it does not appear to be a good sign.

marcus thuresson had 6 goals , 10 assists , 16 points and 22 pim in 31 games
this season for leksand in the swedish elite league. this was only 10th
in point scoring for leksand.

marcus (born may 31 1971 , ht 185 cm , wt 85 kg) is relatively young so he
might still start producing , but i think the sharks may have done a bad
trade here.

organization university of illinois at urbana

while i will first congratulate the blues for their victory , i think it must
be realized that the primary reason the blues were able to win was curtis
joseph. when a goalkeeper gets hot , there is little an opposing team can do.
joseph should be given the entire city of st. louis , because otherwise there
would probably be a game 6 scheduled.

as for the game on sunday. the blues caught a few breaks , without a doubt.
one was the referee constantly watching the blackhawks , looking for reasons to
give them penalties. second , the blues first goal resulted because the puck
hit the linesman as the blackhawks attempted to clear. no linesman , no shot
for brett(i can redirect anything)hull to redirect. on another of st. louis'
goals , belfour was tripped from behind as he went to make the save by someone
who did n't belong in the crease , which means it was a st. louis player.
finally , the overtime goal was caused because someone kept belfour from getting back to the crease. no goalie , no way to stop the shot.

i congratulate st. louis for beating the hawks. it will be a shame to see
bryan murray finally advance to the campbell conference finals because joseph
wo n't be able to stop the powerful red wing attack.

that could have been the best series of the playoffs ,
i think boston will come out smoking in the next
two games and that buffalo will end the series in
game six back in buffalo , and say , how about those islanders \?
they are up 2 1 on the capitals and will probably
win the series , only to be clobbered by the penguins who
should eliminate the devils in the next game.
i cannot see (i'm sad to say) anyone beating the
penguins this year (again) and they will take cup 3

bowman is the genius...johnson is n't. bowman is a great coach...johnson ,
a very good one. however , bowman is really not a modern coach , and
patrick 's solution of having him only run the team on game days , and
delegate most of the day to day responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on patrick 's part.

imho bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at
this time. johnson was the perfect coach two years ago for his
group of players. i would say we have been very lucky here in
pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one.
(excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the
change.) with the immense talent on the penguins roster this
year , a tougher bowman keeps the egos in check. johnson on the
other hand , was able to inspire the younger , inexperienced players
to new heights. both coaches have had different strengths. both
of which came at exactly the right time.

another person also mentioned that bowman is the perfect coach
for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. how can
you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway \?
playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also
keeps the egos in check.

in every possible sport (remember the european champs in stockholm in soccer)
it really pisses me off !
i do not mean that every single german has this attitude that sucks , but
most of them seem to do...

i can understand your anger about the german audience. i mean , it was the
finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous
penalties the canadien ref called in the last period. the germans got a
match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and
seconds after that the german goalie got two minutes for delay of game
for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. the resulting 5 3
skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point , when the germans
were starting to come up strong.
i am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in german sports events.
if you watch for example a tennis davis cup match the players are often not
able to play for minutes , because the crowd is so obnoxious. but i have to
admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most
other countries (you should go to the us and watch the way they present the
olympics on television or the soccer crowds in england or the finnish
spectators at nordic skiing events.....). i mean it makes me sick to see
all this nationalism all over the world and i would rather see the best
team player win and get cheared at. i do not mind if my favorite team
looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and i have to
admit that in most sports the german national site is not my favorite team
to watch (the german soccer team is boring to watch , for example).
but , reading the above posting , i think that you are on the same level as
these crowds you are criticizing. it is easy to talk of (nearly all)
germans as nazis and nationalists thats the kind of propaganda that all
ultraconservative people use against germany. it is true that there is a
great danger of re arising nationalism in germany but from my experience
most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as
a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. why ca n't we
just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers
corresponding to their nationality (eg. all russians are communists all
americans are capitalists all germans are nazis , all fins are hanging
around beeing drunk on ferries...).
in my opinion , your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you
do n't seem to be different from the nazis you are talking about.

game 3 report deleted
it (bad ref'ing) wo n't affect this
series , which should only go two more games , all things being equal.

wrong.

the kings just put on an exibition of hustle , team play and consistent
pounding and took it back to calgary with the series tied at 2 games each.
the final score was 3 1 , with the third goal an empty netter at 19 54 of
the third (conacher).

this is not an official game report , just my observations from the stands.

1. melrose made a wise decision and put stauber back in goal. robb had
something to prove , and he did in stopping 28 of 29 while facing a
fierce calgary attack. there were numerous 'highlight film' saves.

2. kings third and fourth lines rose to the occasion , playing rough while
avoiding bad penalties. warren rychel scored the game winner early in the
second period. (rookie defenseman alexi zhitnik scored the first from the
blue line late in the first.)


3. dave taylor is awesome. he suffered a broken nose partway through the
second pariod , checked from behind into the boards by roberts , who got
5 and a game. he came back late in the third , and was on the ice when
conacher scored the empty netter.

actually it was in the third period , his return did bring a spark to the
crowd , and to the players , who played awesome defense in the third.


4. the kings go to guys still are not producing. no goals from kurri , granato ,
sandstrom or robitaille , who have a total of 10 points between them.

you forgot about gretzky. if any of these guys start scoring , the kings
will be unstoppable , if they continue the great defensive work as well.


5. mccreary sucks. he called mcsorely for high sticking someone who was already
on the ice , and sandstrom for high sticking when he himself was already on
the ice. he missed many flagrant stick penalties , including one from flame
goalie jeff reese who followed granato out to almost the blue line where he
cross checked him. he called the game very inconsistently , with a series of
ticky tack penalties in the first and almost none in the third. ca n't the
nhl supply decent officiating \?

6. i was sitting directly across the ice from ron and nancy reagan. when the
empty netter was scored , nancy leapt out of her seat with both fists high
in the air. way to go nancy !


this series is still too close to call. tuesday 's game may be the deciding
one. i expect king might put vernon back in , even though reese had two good
games in la. reese has historically been good in la. this was only the second
time he lost there. this move would be good for the kings , since vernon is
such a sieve. i am sure that stauber will get the call for the kings.

stauber will be in net on tuesday. hopefully he will provide another
stellar performance and earn the name robb stopper stauber.


the firswt two lines of the kings have to wake up. while it is great to see ,
you cannot depend on pat conacher and warren rychel for all of your offense.
i expect sandstrom , granato and gretzky might be put back together on a line
like they were early in the season. this would leave kurri , carson and luc
as the second. on paper , these two lines look powerful. let 's see if they
can make it real.

i believe this is how they are...i know it is gretzky and sandstrom , but he
has been putting a number of people on left. also the carson , robataille
kurri line once ignited , will light the fire of the other lines.
(hopefully ! )

go kings !

dvb




it is evident that the scoring drought is getting to luc , after his slight
breakaway in the third (i think) he was steamed on the bench , this emotion
might help him break his streak. also , i have noticed blake has had a few
really good chances to score , but has fanned , or shot wide. is the injury
still affecting him \?

okay , the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they
do , does anyone have the history of the washington capitals' futility
record in the playoffs \? i remember that terry 's first year was the first
year that the caps finally made it to the third round but before under
brian , i noticed that every other year the caps got to the second round
and the years in between they did n't make it past the first round. is this
trend continuning \?
this is not a trend. the caps were done. goneso in five games , and it saves
us caps fans a lot of pain.

i mean , it would be more painful if the caps were up 3 1 , watching them
tumbled when they need one more win to clinch the series. how many times
have they done that in their history \?

1985 up 2 0 in a five game series against the isles , lost 3 straight
1987 up 3 1 against the isles , lost 3 straight
1992 up 3 1 against the pens , lost 3 straight

in other words , when they were about to clinch with 3 games to go , they
were a pitiful 2 9 , the lone wins being

1) a sweep of philly in 1984
2) the 1990 win against the rangers in the patrick finals , the only time
they managed to get out of the division.

actually , saturday 's blown lead was n't anything new. we all know the caps
are famous lead blowers in crucial playoff games. examples

1) game 4 against the isles , 1985 , led 4 2 after two , lead series 2 1 ,
gave up 4 goals in the 3rd period , including the game winning goal in the
last minute. after that goal , bobby carpenter botched a penalty shot.
series tied 2 2 , lost game 5 a few days later.

2) game 4 against the rangers , 1986 , led series 2 1 , led by 2 in the 3rd
period , blew it. lost game in ot and three consecutive games.

3) game 6 against pittsurgh , 1992 , led series 3 2 , led by 2 in 2nd period.
blew it and the series.

4) game 3 against isles , 1993 , series tied 1 1 , led by 2 after 2. blew it.

5) game 4 against isles , 1993 , trailed series 2 1 , led by 3 in 2nd period.
blew it again.

when they were leading by 3 in game 4 , i said to myself if they blew this
lead , the series is over . they have lost all the momemtum. the islanders
believe they can come back no matter what the score is.

i am still waiting for a cap goalie who can carry the team , who can
completely shut down the opposition when they are hanging on their dear
lives in a crucial game.

the admiral , a hopeless caps fan.
p.s. we still remember that 3 ot loss to the islanders ! aurggghhhhhhhhh !
well , some teams such have it and some teams just do n't. when the caps
were frustrated year in year out by the islanders , i was thinking wait
until potvin bossy trottier smith retire . well , they retired (even though
trottier was still able to haunt the caps on a pens uniform) , yet another
generation of islanders were still doing the same thing. well , i guess
it has nothing to do with the players.

i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev , zubov , and andersson for
binghamton , but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play
for springfield , while nylander wanted to play for sweden. the whalers allowed
the nhl to decide , and the nhl chose the wcs. how does this differ from the
rangers and oilers \? did the whalers have to go through the league , or could
they have forced nylander to play in springfield \?

as long as a player is under contract to an organization , he is obligated to
play only where that organization tells him to play or gives him permission
to play. the rangers are certainly within their rights to force zubov and
andersson to report to binghampton.

it certainly does reflect a lack of class on the part of the ranger
organization , however. is having binghampton win the calder cup really more
important to them than keeping their players happy \?

jugular vein cut by a skate. i think he was a sabre , but i'm not positive.
does anyone remember know his name \? what has happened to him since \? what
about the player whose skate cut the goalie \? name \? info \? has this ever
happened before in a hockey game \?

thanks ,

go pens !

it was clint malarchuk

whatever happened to him , anyway \?

okay , the caps again are about to break out the golf clubs but before they

during the first three games of the pens devils series , i have been
impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens. jagr ,
maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch. but , one
element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman.


bowman is in the hockey hall of fame as a coach already...and unlike
gil stein...he did n't get their by stacking the board of directors ! )


while no one can replace the genius and optimism of badger bob johnson ,
bowman , in his own way , has made himself a permanent , though not clearly
seen , mark in pittsburgh.

bowman is the genius...johnson is n't. bowman is a great coach...johnson ,
a very good one. however , bowman is really not a modern coach , and
patrick 's solution of having him only run the team on game days , and
delegate most of the day to day responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on patrick 's part.

did anyone see the montreal quebec game yesterday \? it was tight right down
to the last second of the third period. in the overtime roy and hextall played
like they were gods.
ok , so montreal won ! they deserved it after getting their first goal in
overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick. their second
goal in overtime was also replayed , but i could not tell if it was the montreal
player who kicked it in. the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.
anyways , montreal is back into the series.

the replay clearly showed that the winning goal for montreal went off the
skate of the quebec defenceman who was checking kirk muller in front of
hextall.

switzerland beat sweden in a wc for the first time since 1950 , and the swiss
now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals (if austria beats
italy tonight).

the swiss took the lead after hakan ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop
pass at his own blue line , and celio came in alone with soderstrom and beat
tommy to the stick side. the swedes continued to make mistakes as howald
was allowed to skate in between the swedish d and put the puck past tommy
to make it 0 2. 0 3 was a nice one , howald entered the swedish zone , slammed
on the breaks , and his shot went in by tommy 's far post. one of the lousiest
periods i 've seen sweden play this year.
second period saw a new swedish team , and the swiss had to ice the puck many
times. on a pp , nylander skated in from the boards , pavoni made the initial
save , but peter andersson scored on the rebound. then a power play goal
from the swiss , a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way
to the goal and past soderstrom also. jonas bergqvist made it 2 4 after a
nice pass from naslund behind the goal. jan larsson reduced the lead to 3 4
just before the end of 2nd period , on a pp skated in unattacked in front of
the goal , and put the puck through pavoni 's 5 hole.
third period , sweden equalized on a slap shot from renberg that trickled
through pavoni 's 5 hole. then , another defensive mistake by the swedes ,
waeger was allowed to skate around the swedish goal unattacked and from close
range could make it 4 5. hollenstein then scored 4 6 on a 2 on 1 break away ,
and put it top shelf with no chance for soderstrom.

russia probably made their best game of the tourney , but yet there was n't
enough to win against the effective canadians.

galley took a slap shot that found dineen by the far post , and dineen just
deflected the puck past trefilov in the russian goal. then a power play
goal , after a couple of deflections eric lindros found kariya alone by the
far post , and kariya put the puck high over a sliding trefilov.
russia won the shots in the first period 12 5 , and they had the most of
the scoring opportunities , but they just could n't score.
second period saw lindros scoring his 10th ( ! ! ) goal of the wc. kariya
entered the russian zone , slammed on the break to get past his defenseman ,
then made a nice pass to corson who just got the stick on the puck to
deflect it to lindros who one timed the puck.
the russians then finally got their goal , karpov broke in from the side
and made a slap shot in tugnutt 's top right hand corner.

player of the game in canada was voted paul kariya , and for russia valeri
karpov. i agree , the difference in this game was lindros and kariya , and
in part also tugnutt. kariya had a far better game now than vs the swedes ,
and he was very impressive. kariya got the place in the line with lindros
after mike gartner went out with a rib injury early in the first period.

lindros , btw , lead the point scoring with 14 pts (9 5) before this game ,
7 pts ahead of the next player ! i.e. double as much as the next player
(among those kariya with 1 6). amazing !

4 23 93 blues shutout hawks again , lead series 3 0

it was a great atmosphere last night at the st. louis arena as joseph and
the blues shutout the hawks for the second consecutive game. people were
cheering the blues long before face off time , and they kept going for the
entire game. my friends and i went out celebrating until the early morning
hours with some of the players. here 's a game summary from the st. louis
post disptach. enjoy...

by dave luecking
of the post dispatch staff

at 10 24 p.m. friday night , the arena crowd of 17 , 965 paid homage to blues
goalie curtis joseph. the fans began bowing , their arms extended , taking the
the lead from a fan who held a sign that read ``only god saves more than
joseph. it was a fitting tribute to joseph , who has brought the blues to
the verge of a surprising sweep.

joseph recorded his second successive shutout friday , blanking the blackhawks
3 0 in game 3 of the norris division semifinals and giving the blues a 3 0
lead in the best of seven series.

the blackhawks have n't scored against joseph since the 8 51 mark of the second
period of game 1. joseph has shut out the blackhawks for 151 minutes 9 seconds ,
a blues record. jacques plante held the previous record of 146 28 , set in the
first round of the 1969 playoffs against the philadelphia flyers , one of only
two series the blues have sweeped in their history.

the blues can wrap up their first sweep since 1969 with a victory in game 4 ,
a nationally televised game that begins at noon sunday. the blues have had
only two sweeps in franchise history , both in 1969 , when they swept
philadelphia and los angeles en route to the stanley cup finals.

the shutout friday was easier than on wednesday in game 2 when joseph had to
make 47 saves. this time , the blues held the shots down to 34 , and the
blackhawks could n't touch joseph.

well , they touched joseph , numerous times , shoving him and pushing him at
every opportunity to try to get him off his game. but joseph and the blues
were unfazed , dishing out their own punishment along the way.

the blues' grinders bob bassen , rich sutter , kevin miller and dave lowry
wore down the blackhawks , taking the visitors from chicago off their game.
the grinders set the stage for the glamour boys , the gifted playmakers and
scorers , who made the most of their opportunities.

craig janney , brett hull and nelson emerson scored , getting one goal in each
period. hull assisted on janney 's first period power play goal after two unwise
chicago penalties. checker miller set up hull 's goal in the second period , and
rookie denny felsner assisted for emerson , who scored at 16 44 of the final
period.

blues fans jumped to their feet in celebration of that goal and began yelling
``sweep. sweep. sweep. they also taunted chicago goalie ed belfour
``bell four. bell four. they also chanted ``na , na na na , hey hey good bye.

such talk is a tad premature. there 's still one game left , but the blues are
on a roll. they have the blackhawks on their heels.

the blues set the tone early on friday with two crunching hits in the first
minute of play. rich sutter leveled bryan marchment , and brendan shanahan
dumped steve smith at center ice.

chicago tried to retaliate , but troy murray 's decision to run into joseph
backfired. referee dan marouelli gave him a roughing penalty.

the blues did n't get a shot on goal on the power play , and they survived a
scare after chicago killed the penalty when rick zombo gave the puck away to
steve larmer. joseph stopped larmer 's shot and everything else chicago threw
at him in the first period. the 'hawks ignored the scouting report on joseph
about shooting high and continued to shoot low , where joseph 's butterfly
style is deadly.

rookie bret hedican picked up three consecutive penalties midway through the
period two for hooking and one for holding but chicago got only two
shots on goal , as many as miller. the blues' penalty killer twice stole the
puck and just missed on good scoring chances against belfour.

marouelli began calling penalties on the blackhawks to even things up.
he caught brent sutter hooking shanahan four seconds after hedican 's third
penalty. he called marchment for elbowing janney along the boards at 14 58 ,
and gave the blues a two man advantage 1 07 later when christian ruuttu
slashed shanahan.

the blues worked around the puck on the ensuing power play , and hull got it
where he likes it in the high slot. hull 's shot hit belfour 's right
shoulder , and the puck bounced precariously close to the goal line. belfour
dived back to cover , but the puck squirted loose to janney , who poked it into
the net at 16 53 for his first goal of the playoffs.

the blues continued their relentless hitting as the period ended , and the
blackhawks lost their composure. joe murphy tripped ron wilson with two seconds
remaining in the period , and after time had expired smith upset the blues by
shooting the puck into the blues' bench.

chris chelios made a move toward joseph as the teams left the ice , and
marouelli slapped him with a 10 minute misconduct. chicago survived the blues'
power play , but the loss of chelios hurt. he did n't return until the midway
point of the period , and within three minutes of his return , hull had increased
the blues' lead to 2 0 , deflecting in miller 's crisp pass.

try as they might , the blackhawks could n't get to joseph , who stopped
everything they could throw at him. he stopped 12 shots in the second period
and 13 more in the third. chicago also hit the goalpost twice.

emerson 's goal put the game away. he went hard to the net and redirected
felsner 's pass.

yes , yes , i can see it now all those sabre fans finally taking
their sabre sweaters out of the moth balls and proudly wearing them.
after 9 years of playoff frustration and being up 3 games to nil
i guess it is a pretty good bet. but there has not been a team
that has come back from an 0 3 deficit since 1975 could this be

as for the picks
ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that alexander daigle will
go 1. he 'll either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec.

i dunno about hat. i have friends up there on genie who are now saying that
ottawa 's gone soft on daigle and is thinking hard about pronger. daigle has
shown an attitude the latter part of this season many folks havne't liked ,
and after coming back from his (second) multi game suspension for being
stupid , he 's really tanked in his performance. his stock is dropping like a
rock.

also remember that a lot of teh draft 1st stuff comes from the assumption
he 'll be traded to quebec for lots of prospects. it 's not clear that
quebec would really be willing to pay a lot for him given his current
status. he 's still first round , but i do n't consider him a first pick lock
by any means at this point.

it 's also possible that the senators are posturing to try to bring down his
signing price , since daigle has been taking some lindros lessons during thos
suspensions.

imo i would
take kariya. he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in
the world championships. daigle did n't show this for his junior team.

san jose will then get kariya.

no. kariya wo n't go in the first three , for a very simple reason he 's not
leaving college , and i do n't believe any of the expansion teams are going to
use a first for someone who wo n't be around for another year or two , not
when there is equally good (or almost as good) stuff available that can make
an immediate impact. san jose seems to be leaning heavily towards
niedermayer for that reason. kariya could go 6th or 7th , unless a team can
convince him to leave school early (which i doubt).


my cut on things as they stand today

draft order

1) ottawa (60 daigle , if not , 40 pronger)
2) san jose 80 niedermayer , unless ottawa skips daigle. then it 's open.
(it depends on if the sharks can get a deal for him. i do n't
believe they draft him to keep him).
3) tampa bay (whoever ottawa does n't take , or maybe koslov)

i would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me , so i can put these stats on the archive
site. contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

here are the individual goalie stats as of wed apr 21 09 09 38 cst 1993

these stats include games up to and including the sunday previous to the date
listed above. they have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every tuesday. they do n't print shots and save percentage numbers , so those

again i assume this is not just flame bait by roger , but actually a
truly held opinion.

in article 1993apr26.004705.24794@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (roger maynard) writes
i would say that the letter clearly implies representation of the views of
a group that i belong to. and i do n't share those views. and i do n't
believe that the majority of posters on r.s.hockey share those views.
and so i have no intention of allowing them to simply go ahead without
making my feelings on the subject clear.

thanks. for speaking for all those who did n't feel it was important
enough to say something themselves.

i would n't say that the letter clearly implies representation of the
views of a group that you belong to. it represents a subset (that you
do n't belong to) of a larger group (which you do , if only because this
is n't a moderated group).

look , there are several ways to state an opposing viewpoint. three
that come to mind are as follows

1) say it subtly. result it may not be clear.
2) say it directly yet politely. result probably it will spark some
interesting conversation.
3) say it directly and obnoxiously. result validity goes right out
the window.

i would agree that unwarranted use of said term is entirely immature.

you realize that anything you say can , and most certainly will , be
used against you.

hi all ,

due to living in the bay area , i as unable to see vancouver 's victory over
the jets last night. i know the score , but that rarely describes the game.
could someone please post a brief sonapsis (sp \? ) of waht happened. how well
did each team play \? were the cannucks deserving of the victory \?


well , in my opinion the canucks played a really strong game. i was
especially pleased by a very strong game from linden i think he
could be a key to success for them this year. defensively , they
really had a strong game. hardly heard selanne 's name all night.
craven also played one of his best games since coming over. with a
few exceptions , they really did n't let the high flying jets do much
high flying. i thought the jets defence looked overmatched by the
canucks forwards they will have to improve on that if they want to
make this a series.

in short , it was a great start !

the blues , led by the best goalie in the nhl this season , curtis
joseph , shut out the hawks 2 0. the blues are playing like they did in
'86 clutch 'n grab , shoot the puck out. it 's incredibly boring to
watch , but if it works...

finally a non blues fan agrees that joseph is a great goalie. i think he
should win the vezina this year or at least share it with barrasso who also
has been shadowed by mario 's amazing performance.


i too think that joseph has had a great year and should be considered for the
vezina. i think barrasso and joseph should be the two strongest candidates
this year. i do n't believe all of the hype that roy , belfour and now potvin
receive for their goaltending. i do think that they are great in the nets ,
but i would rather have curtis , tommy or fuhr in the nets during this years
playoffs. the big name tenders always seem to have a strong defense in front
of them and the goaltenders get the most credit. i would rather face 25 shots
a game , than have to rely on joseph saving 35 , but if the goalie is going to
face 35 shots , i would rather have joseph or barrasso facing them.

jay

ps go quebec ! ! ! and i know that mclean and several others should be mentioned
as candidates for this years vezina , but i am partial to joseph and barrasso

the thing that confuses me most about espn is that they decided to show the
penguins and devils again on thursday night. being that both of the first
two games were dominated by pitt. , you would think that they would show a
different game. this is in addition to the fact that they should show other
games just for the sake of fair exposure.

nesn owns the rights to bruin telecasts. i suspect that nesn was only
going to sell one telecast to espn (remember , espn only owns exclusive
rights to the finals , not the entire playoffs). since espn bought the
sca contract , there are less wrangles to untie with showing the devils
and penguins.


also , some of you should know that (as far as i can tell) espn is not going
to show campbell conference games regularly in the first two rounds. i
believe that they are only going to show campbell games in the first two
rounds as those series wear on (games 6 7 , or perhaps games 5 , 6 , 7).


i think the same broadcast rights factor comes into it. plus they
have no way of fitting western game times into their current schedule
unless the nhl was willing to make a western club move up their game.
i think the nhl got as much as it could when it shuffled the deck for abc.

also , does anyone have info on abc coverage for this sunday (4 25) \?



same exact coverage as last week pit nj game 4 in the east , chi stl

confirmation. it was clear from my talks with the sharks doctors that he
was n't going to make it for a while , and the sharks would have to sign him

if the oilers move to hamilton what division will they play in .

and wo n't they have to change their name to the steelers or something.
the only significant deposits of oil around hamilton are those caused by
the tire fire a few years back.

then again if the nba can have the utah jazz or the l.a. lakers (think about
it , what lakes are in l.a.) then i guess the nhl can have the hamilton oilers.

amongst penguins' fans there seems to be an inner calm that i 've never
experienced before this year with the pens. the players and the fans have so
much confidence in the team this year. we 're savoring every game and saving
our energy for the stanley cup.

that 's a good way to put it. it 's a quiet confidence. i do n't feel like
i have to defend this team anymore.

the devils are a puzzle to me. they have long been one of the few teams
i always dreaded playing. their d is n't quite what it used to be but they
still usually play us pretty tough. i just ca n't figure it out. at least
last night they mounted an attack.

2. watching some of the devils players being interviewed , i could
see in their faces and eyes , that they really do n't have any
confidence. they are left speechless when asked what more they
can to do to beat the pens. they act as though they know it 's
a hopeless task.

bernie nichols was interviewed after game 2 on the late news. he was
shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso , saying that tommy is like
another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.
then he got this far away look on his face , his voice started trailing
off and he said , it just is n't right...it just is n't fair... and he
tried to muster a smile.

i'm really impressed with bowman 's coaching tactics he 's had an answer for
every move that brooks has thrown at the pens.

as far as coaching goes , a pens islanders match up should be pretty good.

one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri. i'm sure
tom barrasso knows how he feels. for so long tommy would look up and not
have a teammate in sight. terreri 's teammates really left him out in the
cold in the first two games.

wood played most of his junior career in seattle. he was one

wood is fairly small for an enforcer type. i mean , fleury does a pretty good

and fleury is no enforcer. an agitator for sure , but fleury never has and never

the closest fleury ever came to fighting was a game two years ago against
los angeles. there was a scrum and mcsorley pinched fleury 's head under his
arm. fleury dropped his gloves and gave mcsorley a weak shot to the side of the
head. mcsorely , knowing a good thing when he saw one , popped fleury one right
between the eyes. end of fight. fleury got ten stitches for his trouble.

the only player i can ever see theo fighting is cliff ronning , and even then
he 'd be giving up two inches and 10 15 pounds. )

nearly survived pilon 's blunder in regulation , it was the most inopportune time
for a 5 minute major penalty. instead of confronting cote as he came across the

it 's about time the boys got it together ! !
they were outworked and outplayed by the wings in the first two games.
but burns must have kicked their behinds cause they sure came out in full
gear (or is that high gear \? ) in game 3. except for a 10 15 minute stretch
in the 2nd period , they outskated and outworked the wings. please do n't
flame this statement 'cos you know it 's true ! i have to admit that
goaltending was the key. potvin kept the leafs ahead during the sleepy
stretch the leafs went through in the 2nd. he also kept the rebounds to a
minimum , something that cost cheveldae 2 goals. clark even looked like
he had stopped moping (first star ! ) , although i still do n't know why he
was so flat in games 1 and 2.

if the leafs play the same style and can keep the pace they had in game
3 , they may actually have a chance of winning this series (a slim chance ,
but a chance....i'm no rm.....where is he anyways \? haha).

these moronic posts that have continued throughout the year about how
the jets will cremeate the canucks and selanne will smash bure into the
boards is so full of it. why do n't you take a cue fromm daryl and just
wait 'till its over before you make more of a fool of yourself \? \? \?

i'm not going to predict anything about the canucks. they are up 3 1 and
are coming back home , but i'm not going swing any it around until the
series is wrapped up.

tony

bravo tony ,

i too am sick of all the mindless , fanatical , blind faith jets fans who could
prpbably predict the end of the world more accurately than the coutcome of a
playoff series.

now i will admit that i am a mindless , fanatica , blind faith canucks fan.
but unlike those from winterpeg , i do not need to vent my spleen upon the
world as to how great my team is. i know , i have confidence in them , and
that 's enough.

granted , the jets finished the season hot , and the canucks were having trouble ,
but vancouver has built themselves a reputation for being a playoff team.
just ask any flames fan. they may not win every series , but they alway fight
to the end. i 'll admit that last year was not great , but if they combine
the work ethic of the past with the new tallent of the present , they will
be tough to beat (note i did not say they would pummel every team they meet
and destroy the greatest player playing today).

now , like any canucks fan , i would love to see them take the cup. i feel
they have a good chance to make it out of the smythe , and a 50 50 shot at
detroit (i ca n't see them losing to st. louis). if pittsburgh makes it to
the cup , i 'd have to put my money on them (yes even if they 're facing the
canucks). if buffalo , montreal , or quebec beat pittsburgh , i 'd choose the
winner of vancuover and detroit to take the cup.

oh , and one parting note for the jets fans just how many times has
winnepeg made it to the finals \? 8')

go canucks

greg

devorski unfortunately helped to taint an otherwise brilliant display
by maclean. the canucks tied up the jets so tightly that i thought that
they were mailing them.

btw , greg...next time , do n't fall asleep in geography class , it 's pretty
sad when a fellow in norway can spell winnipeg properly and a guy in
north america ca n't.

one more thing...how long has vancouver been in the nhl \? how many
championships do they have \?

oh yeah...and i can go to the arena and see not one , not two , but
six championship banners hanging from the rafters. 3 stanley cup
banners , and 3 avco cup banners. my nhl guide says that vancouver has
won the cup once (as many times as the rockin' town of kenora has won it ! )

now , my only complaint about lemieux is that he dives too much...
but last year patrick convinced him twice to accept bowman and hockey
destiny , rather than his ego.

the real purpose of diving is not merely an attempt to draw a penalty. what
the player is trying to do is make the checkers keep their distance so the
ref wo n't be fooled. i ca n't imagine why anyone would expect someone like
lemieux to change his game. why do n't you pick on 1 dimensional over rated

i think game three in buffalo will be the most important of the
series. if the sabres lose that game , the party will be over. it will
be hello next year.

the key for the remaining games in the series will be whether fuhr can
keep up his brillliant goaltending and if mogilny can continue skate by
the bruins. he has shown demonstrated excellent speed.

canada. this network is for expressing what you feel are your thoughts. just
because someone does n't agree with you , this does not give you the right to
call them assholes. anyways , the north stars are shit ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

c'mon leafs...


whoa there ! lighten up , andrew ! when i was referring to you dorks at
the western business school , i was specifically referring to those
assholes writing obnoxious comments insulting the state and people of
minnesota for no apparent reason. being canadian , and one who has
friends who attended uwo , i personally do n't want to be associated with
the idiots who wrote those messages. one more thing , andrew...until

i'm personally expecting moog. blue played fairly decent (alright
spectacular at times) in his 1 2 a game but moog has the experience.
what did blue have going for him , nothing , what would happen in a tie
game , the prssure is then on the goal tender to insure that you keep the
puck out (at the very least until your team scores) blue did n't face that
kind of pressure on tuesday. the bruins will come out storming that
is for sure. i really think that this series is up to buffalo , boston
(except for two bad passes in game one) really has n't played that bad
, as a believer is statistics , you know that your going to get the
puck by fuhr sooner or later , just keep shooting. there game plan is
sound but they need to take the lead first , and control the tempo.....

as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and does n't know
anything about him , i do n't know whether it is just this area
(pittsburgh) of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether
he 's a canadian thing altogether. seriously , what is he all about \? i
know he was a coach at one time , and from the volume of posts about him ,
someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow , but my question
is , what is the deal with him \? secondly , are the comments of his that i
read about on the net merely flame bait , or do people actually take him
seriously \? i gotta tell you , from what i see , he really sounds like an
ass. let me know maybe i'm missing something.


for those of you who complain about don cherry , and wonder why he is
popular...

the reply is dick vitale and john madden and bobby knight and
joe garagiola and howard cosell.

john madden picks gary clark of the redskins for his all madden team
a lot , over much better receivers...for much the same reasons cherry
sings the praises of doug gilmour...a little guy with heart...yet one
does n't see a string of american posts saying that john madden has
lost his marbles.

dick vitale is always promoting this kid from this high school or
that college with outrageous statements.

why should americans expect that canada would not have such characters
in relation to our greatest passion...which is hockey \? canadians
are very similar to americans...culturally our sports are just hockey
and curling , whereas with americans it is football basketball baseball
and bowling.

finns had to do their best last night when they played against norway
in world champs. after two periods the score was still 0 0. this game was
quite much similar to the first game finland played (against france).
the norwegian goalie was very good and a bit lucky , too. in the third period
juha riihij rvi scored 1 0 from a rebound , the time was around 5 mins or so.
the second goal was scored by kari harila , who shot straight from a faceoff
behind the nowwegian goalie. saku koivu , the 18 year old center got his first
point of this tournament. saku koivu played very well througout the game and he
was awarded the best player of the game prize. despite the fact that he is
quite small in size he handles the puck very well and is a fast skater.
i think that we will hear from this guy in the future.

however , bowman is really not a modern coach , and
patrick 's solution of having him only run the team on game days , and
delegate most of the day to day responsibity to the assistants is
a shrewd managerial decision on patrick 's part.

i would argue gerald , that bowman is the first modern coach.
bowman 's canadiens were the first nhl team to have a weight room
in the 70s. he is the first coach i have seen , that manipulates
the press into spreading false game plan rumours. (during important games
listen to the pre game interview will bowman and compare that to
what is on the ice ! ) i agree bowman is a master of the lineups.
remember last year in the sc when he benched jagr only to set him free
in ot. when jagr banged in the winning goal i thought this was
trademark bowman and also a sign of a modern coach !

i am left asking what is a modern coach if not bowman \?

it 's over the sabres came back to beat the bruins in ot 6 5 tonight
to sweep the series. a beautiful goal by brad may (lafontaine set him
up while lying down on the ice) ended it. fuhr left the game game with
an injured shoulder and lafontaine was banged up as well however , the
sabres will get a week 's rest so injuries should not be a problem.

montreal edged quebec 3 2 to square their series , which seems to be
headed for game 7. the habs dominated the first two periods and were
unlucky to only have a 2 2 tie after 40 minutes. however , an early
goal by brunet in the 3rd won it.

the islanders won their 3rd ot game of the series on a goal by ray
ferraro 4 3 the caps simply collapsed after taking a 3 0 lead in the
2nd. the isles' all time playoff ot record is now 28 7.

wow , this guy seems to be out to prove something to his old team , boston.
which sweeney you ask...well , of course bob sweeney , the one that boston
let buffalo get a hold of (they still have 2 sweeneys which makes things
slightly confusing). game winner in ot in game 1 , and another
big goal (seconds after fuhr made 3 point blank saves this is why
grant has 5 rings ! ! ! ) to put buffalo ahead in the 3rd. yes , neely countered
a minute later , but had n't this course of buffalo going ahead after being
tied and shutting down another few great scoring opportunities , i
think boston would have notched their first win of the series.

well , the sabres have n't made it to the end of this series yet , but
i certainly feel they 've got boston right were they want them...actually ,
they 've got them in a position that neither buffalo nor boston felt
that would come about. one more astronomical game by fuhr , a few more
heroics by the rest of the team (this is a team sport afterall) and i
think borque , neely , jouneau (sp \? ) , and company are gonna be swinging
a new stick (weather is perfect for golf season) real soon. i'm not
gonna waiger anything on this , because i 've seen some really strange
things happen in both pro and college hockey.

talking about golf...was that a hockey swing , golf swing or baseball
swing that hawerchuck used in the last shot of the game that khmylev
deflected in for the big one \? the whole ot (all 1 minute of it ! ) was a
tesiment to buffalo 's ability to really be persistent and grind it out
in the end (something they were n't necessarily in the regular season). the
sabres pushed hard and forced borque to blatently take down bodger in
the opening seconds. i do n't normally like penalties being called in
such ultra critical points , but this was blatent. finally , the sabres
won a faceoff (they were n't that hot in this dept the rest of the game)
when lafontaine scooped at the puck 3 times. when hawerchuck took his
shot (quite a boomer , but blue stopped this one) he took a few steps
over to get his own rebound and slapped at it again , without setting
it up. i did n't realize it went in until the announcer started screaming ,
they score , they score ! ! ! . the best was seeing lafontaine jumping
up and down , skating a little bit , jumping some more , and then skating
over to brad may who he jumped on.

if my powerplay was as bad as montreal 's , i 'd be thanking stewart for calling
as few penalties as possible. quebec 's powerplay is lethal and it is to their
advantage to have a penalty filled game where they can clean up with their
superior powerplay.

montreal really lost that game (and game 2) because patrick roy is well on
his way to having another one of his trademark awful playoffs. the man is
truly overrated. quebec has scored six goals on roy and four , perhaps five ,
were quite stoppable.

i will also be happy will a good performance. we played ok in
vancouver , but much better last night , as the 'big' guys were going
for the jets.

yep , though my reasons for being relatively quiet are simple...last year
i woofed when we went up 3 1 on the canucks...and look where it got me. )

by the way , did domi play last night \? i did n't notice him
on the ice.

domi got tossed in the 2nd with a high sticking major. he had been
playing with kris king and stu barnes...and it was this line that was
arguably the best in the first two games.


i am very glad to have found some places in champaign ,
illinois that have satillite dishes to pick up the cbc vancouver feed.
and i'm also glad to have found some other hockey fans , some jets and
some canucks fans , to watch the game with.

definitely a good thing...every little cheer helps , evan. )
good thing the net does n't need a voice to operate...i wo n't have one
sunday night when i get home , i hope. white noise here we come ! )


one thing , i will say though...vancouver can keep steve armitage and
john garrett as a broadcast team...those two are bad , especially when
you are spoiled by don wittman. (at least four or five times , steve called
barnes selanne. whoops ! )

the tv coverage of the playoffs is fucking ridicules. overtime time games
that are not shown \? what the hell kind of shit is this \? if that would
have happened to the flyers(if they were in the damn playoffs to begin
with) while i was watching , i would have gone throught the roof !

however , everybody is getting pissed off at espn , but they are not the
ones to blame. they have prior contracts that they just ca n't simply break
whenever they want to. the n.h.l. is to blame. when they signed the
deal with espn , they had to know of this. they had to know shit like this
would happen since they would n't have complete priority. the n.h.l.
should be feeling the heat that is being thrown at espn. how can the
n.h.l. do this to its fans \? how dare they. we are the ones that make the
damn league exist and they ca n't even televise complete playoff games for us to
watch ! they more i write about this , the more pissed off i get. we must
let the n.h.l. know that we expect a little better than this. if anybody
out there knows how to go about doing this , let me and everybody else know.

well i had to get that off my chest and while i'm at it....

mario is the michael jordan of hockey. all that fucker has to do is fall
on the ice and the closet guy to him gets at least 2. last night in the
3rd game between nj and pitt , he was being pushed while skating across the
front of the goal while trying to get a shot off. the guy on him was
doing a good job , so he got off a weak shot , but then he decided to fall
to the ice. then the fucking ref(van helloamend \? ) called the guy for
holding. they replayed the play , and my roomate(who is clueless about
hockey) wanted to know what the nj guy did to get a call , because it was so fucking obvious the nj player
had both hands on his stick , and no , he did not trip him. it is simple ,
mario gets touched , he falls to the ice , automatic 2. but the thing that
really pissed me off is , pitt scored the 3rd or 4th goal , i do n't remember ,
on the resulting pp and
eventually won 4 3. his diving calls makes a huge difference in the
outcome of a game.

they gotta stop the damn holding and interference that is so fucking
obvious. that is not hockey. it allows inferior players to bring down the
level of the better players , and allows inferior teams to beat better ones.
this has pissed me off for many years now , and it has improved somewhat.
however , during the playoffs and 3rd periods , the damn refs must misplace
their balls , because they sure do n't make any calls that show that they got
any.

all agreeing or disagreeing replies are welcomed.

3. is it just me , or does anyone out there also think that this year

have you ever noticed that after a hockey player has been interviewed
in between periods on a tv game. that they usually get a goal or
an assist. can you explain this or is it that they usually talk
to stars more than regular players which explains the hight
percentage of results after.

just wondering how everybody else thinks about this or if they dont
care about this trivial nonsense.

the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team , not to the best
player in the league. so your above arguement is really worthless.

personally , i always thought that most valuable to his team was silly.
why should the best player in the league be penalized because he plays on a
team with other good players \? why should a lesser player be picked solely
because he 's the best player on a weak team \? would n't the weaker team be
helped even more by the best player in the league \? does n't the presence of
the best player in the league make the other players on the team look
better , too \?

the hart trophy was orginally awarded in a time where people did not think
in terms of who was the best player , rather in terms of who was the most
valuable to the team. and valuable to his team was not , and should not
be , considered synonymous with best . we are talking about a time when
honour and attitude , not measurable skills , were the most important assets
a player brought to his team , his league and his sport. this was before
the onslaught of professionalism which has clearly denigrated what was
formerly the foremost peacetime pursuit of glory.

the hart trophy is not a prize. it is an honour.

as far as cheveldae is concerned , he is a decent goalie. the most logical
trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers. i'm sure
if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his
roots in detroit. he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the
rangers could get a zombo in return \? beezer got a few good years in him and
the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.


only problem is that zombo was traded to st. louis last year for goalie
vincent riendeau.

i think that while chevy is not among the elite class of goalies , he is
adequate given the offensive firepower of the wings.

to the last second of the third period. in the overtime roy and hextall played
like they were gods.
ok , so montreal won ! they deserved it after getting their first goal in
overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick. their second
goal in overtime was also replayed , but i could not tell if it was the montreal
player who kicked it in. the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.

broadcast partner. this would mean paul stiegerwald would be fired

in reply to c62xpu.md3@constellation.ecn.uoknor.edu

i 've been under the impression that minnesota was one of , or possibly ,
the hockey state in the u.s. so why is the team moving to a city in
texas \? is it that the owner is a greedy , self serving profiteer , or
were the stars really not making a profit \? or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging \?


norman green claims that he has lost money over the last three years
that he has owned the team. when he bought the team , it seemed kind of
obvious that he was going to have to deal with a few years in the red ,
before the team started making a profit again. he gave the impression
that he was willing to do so. he claimed two years ago that the team
needed to average only 8000 fans per game in order to pull a profit ,
but this season the team averaged 12000 fans , despite increasd ticket
prices. i think the team 's attendence and play was clearly in an upward
trend , which leaves me dumbfounded as to how he could ignore that in
deciding to move. he was even offered the many concessions he rudely
demanded , such as guaranteed season ticket sales , cheap rent at the
other two arenas in town , etc.

oh well , i guess the bottom line is . green wanted immediate huge
returns in dallas , and was n't willing to wait another year or so in mn.
dallas gave green a pretty stellar deal to play there (although i feel
minnesota 's was quite reasonable) , and he also has some cronies down
there as well. all this means , is that minnesota is without an nhl team
for a year or two. too bad for the nhl.

add boston 's weei 590am as the bruins' flagship station. you probably wo n't
pick it up anywhere outside of boston since it 's only a 5 , 000 watt
station. the bruins also have network stations in all 6 new england
states.

this could be the bruins' last year on 'eei which also happens to be an
all sports radio station. the problem is that the bruins are not too happy
being moved over to a different station(wmex 1150am) whenever there
is a the same night conflict with the nba 's boston celtics. this happened
28 times during the course of the regular season.(the celtics own financially
troubled weei). the bruins might resurface on whdh 850 next year. stay
tuned.

they 're real and they 're spectacular , the blues shutout the blackhawks in
consecutive playoff games.

if the blues sweep the hawks on sunday , i will launch a broom onto the ice
in the last seconds of the game. not that there 's anything wrong with that.

curtis joseph has been the master of his own domain , and the hawks have
been shooting the puck like a bunch of chuckers . not even superman could
play any better in goal. joseph must have been eating his cereal.

it 's like a sauna in here said a spectator about the hot atmosphere and
the wild crowd at the arena.

it was very refreshing to see the blues double dip the hawks.

the hawks goons tried to pick on hull , janney , and joseph but the blues
checking line nipped those hawks real well.

the fat yoyoma will sing on sunday , and the hawks will head to the beach .
the hawks' trip back to chicago will feel like a long journey from milan
to minsk

enjoy sunday 's game with some junior mints and wash them down with a snapple.

just a little fun.

i knew , despite the lack of a full game telecast last week , it was still
too much hockey for atlanta. atlanta 's abc has declined to pick up any
playoff games till may9. and even when they show the games on may9 and may16 ,
they will continue to skip the first half hour of the telecast. i know this
is still a better situation compared to rest of georgia , alabama , etc. , but
it is still pretty annoying. at least in pittsburgh , we had a network preemptionchannel which showed all netwoork shows prempted by the local affiliate.


i asked them what their problem was. i told them that a local 1.9 rating was
not that bad considering it was the first nhl game shown after a long time
without much promotion. besides , their syndicated programming in the afternoon
is usually low rated. so what did they have to lose by showing nhl playoffs.
she told me that they had contractual obligations. i asked her if golf
was shown oin abc , would contractual obligations come in the way. and how come
contractual obligations did n't come in the way of last week 's telecast \? she
then could n't give me a coherent answer.


also , i added that atlanta had one of the highest neutral site game
attendances and that the demographics were good. i think abc and other networks
should begin to tie their high rated programs like roseanne in with
thier sports programming.
i hope that everyone in atlanta who reads this bboard calls wsb 2 and complain
bitterlyt about this. tell them you will stop watching their news telecasts
since they seem to be very unprofessional in handling this situation.

the lady did not seem to settle on a single reason. sometimes , the reason
is low ratings. then another time , she says contractual obligations.

dino getting shots in front of the net , he should expect it. this is playoff
hockey where anything goes. you lose one game in the regular season , and it 's
not so bad. you lose a game in the playoffs and it 's a difficult thing to
overcome. i 've watched hockey (and played it too) for a number of years and
i have n't seen one post season game where the forward in front of the net
has not finished without any bruises on the back of his leg. the leafs are
not doing a good job in clearing the net and potvin has been forced to take
matters into his own hands. i remember when cicarelli used to play for the
london knights (ohl) , he always was a nuisance in front of the net and the
goalies took exception to this. he also complained (in this morning 's paper)
about what happened last night , but to me , it 's a lot of bellyaching. his
team is up 2 0 and he complains about being whacked...i wonder what would
happen if he tried to do the same thing in front of billy smith or a younger
ron hextall \? seems dino would need two artifical legs. dino should take it
as part of the game and thank his lucky stars that he 's in the playoffs and
has a good chance to go the finals.


well , i agree that if you 're going to stand in front of the net ,
that you should expect to get hit and hacked at. in general , you
should expect to finish the game with some bruises. however ,
there is a fine line between hacking at a guy (causing some pain
and discomfort) and blatantly attempting to injure another
player. felix potvin , imo , crossed that line on wednesday. that
two hander on ciccarelli was way out of line. i lost a lot of
respect for potvin because of that. it showed an immaturity. he
did not slash at ciccarelli to simply try to remove him from the
slot area (a legal position for dino to be in). instead , he
slashed in an attempt to injure. it was out of shear frustration. as a
leaf supporter (just a supporter , i'm not a leaf fan really) , i
was very disappointed.

you 're right in mentioning billy smith and ron hextall (at least
in his philly days). they both crossed that same line at times and
for that reason , many fans (and players) disliked them (that 's
why their names always comes up as examples when we talk about
these issues). let 's hope that felix does n't do that again. i 'd
hate to see anyone (even dino although i admit i do n't like
him very much) get seriously hurt from such careless (but
intentional) use of the stick.

first of all i think when espn covers the game they do a wonderful job , but
last night i felt the same way. i really hate watching devils pens game.
everyone knows that devils are going to get their ass kicked , why even
bother showing them. i was so bored and these espn people do n't seem to have
any brain. after the sundays and last night games , they are still going to
show devils pens on thu and sun. what the hell are they thinking about \? i
think if they keep it up like this nhl will never get a major network contract.

ok , so montreal won ! they deserved it after getting their first goal in
overtime waved off because the puck was hit in with a high stick. their second
goal in overtime was also replayed , but i could not tell if it was the montreal
player who kicked it in. the puck definitely was not directed in by a stick.
anyways , montreal is back into the series.


the overhead replay pretty clearly showed that it was the quebec
defender who deflected the puck. the re play officials did not
take nearly as much time to make this call as they did for the first
non goal , so it seemed pretty non controversial.

i agree that it was a great game good to see roy and damphousse back

lets face it , a cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
method... it is easier to hide from the refs , has a better chance of
causing injury , and you can draw people into fights that way. i do n't
like it , but that 's the way the league is going.

by the way , there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin devil

disaster ! finland was beaten by czech 1 3 (0 0 , 1 1 , 0 2).
finland will be 4th of pool b and will most certainly meet canada in the
quarter final on wednesday 28th. lack of scoring skills has
been the major problem of team finland throughout the tournament.
briza (goalie) was the mvp of the czech team and tikkanen was the

mvp of the finnish team.

in four of the five games finns have played , the goalie has been chosen
the best player of the opposing team. (in the fifth , the finnish goalie ,
ketterer was elected the best finn) has this to do with the goalies
having good days in these games , or are the finnish players just lousy
scorers \? \? \?

anyway , quite few goals have been scored in these games in generally
(the exception of course being canada vs. italy). it looks like the
goalies are getting too good. is this due to their equipment getting
bigger , so they cover more (their gloves , e.g. seem to be much bigger
now than they were some years ago).

anybody know if the rules on goalie equipment has changed this way \? \? \? \?

hey man !

having spent the past season learning to skate and having played a
couple of sessions of mock hockey , i'm ready to invest in hockey
equipment (particularly since i will be taking summer 'hockey
lessons'). however , i am completely and profoundly ignorant when it
comes to hockey equipment. i 've checked out local stores and looked
at catalogs , but i was hoping to solicit opinions suggestions before
actually plunking down any money. having played football in high
school and college i at least have that equipment as a basis for
comparison. but for example what are the advantages disadvantages to
different kinds of shoulder pads and pants girdles \? are there any
notoriously bad or unsafe brands or styles \? etc. so any suggestions
or comments would be greatly appreciated.

i am in need of all of the players wearing 77 in the nhl. i know now only
of one , ray borque for the bruins. any help would be greatly appreciated.

i believe that phil esposito was the first to wear 77 when he played
with the rangers in the '70s. this was the season that they put the
rangers crest and modern style numbers on the jerseys instead of the
new york or rangers block letters and two colour numbers. he took 77
because the rangers already had a 7.

(hockey night in canada made a big thing out of it , saying it was the
biggest uniform style change in a long time. this was before pittsburgh
and vancouver changed their colours.)

well , dave , i would have to disagree with you there. satan himself could

i am an ulf (and pgh) fan , and what pisses me off about the whole adam graves
ulf samuesson debate is that ulf plays hard hitting hockey (nothing wrong with
that) while graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to
intentionally hurt someone (which bites ! ).

jeesus... i never thought i 'd see the day when i defended a ranger....

you obviously do n't watch much hockey if you think that graves is a
goon. he is one of the hardest working rangers (check that the
hardest working ranger). he had 36 goals this year (not bad for a
checking type of player) , and showed up for every single game this
season (unlike that stiff messier). he is fearless , and throws clean
checks. he will also stand up to someone after he hits them , not like
that pussy oaf.

exactly my point. if you 'd watch games more closely , you 'd see a lot
of goons going after him. ulf is one of the main reasons why less physical
players for pgh are left alone. ulf plays rough hockey , but only when
other players are putting the rush on mario or jagr. if you want to say anyone
on the penguins is a cheap shot or a goon , say it 's jennings or caufield. do n'tslander a good defenseman because your favorite players ca n't beat the pens
even when they take dives (like gartner) to try for the cheap penalties.

as for his slash of lemieux , fine. it was a cheap shot. it is the
exception , not the rule. i bet you think mike gartner is a goon
because of the time that he slashed the hell out of oaf 's arm last
year , right \? after all , he did get a suspension for it...

hey , that 's fine ! if a player does something stupid , he should be penalized
including ulf. or mario (you 're not likely to see that happen) or anyone else for that matter. it 's pointless to say any one person is a cheap shot goon , because you 'll see everyone take a cheap shot now and then , especially if you 'resomeone who is shadowed as much as ulf is.

i would appreciate it if someone could volunteer to verify the shots on goal
and save percentage numbers for me , so i can put these stats on the archive
site. contact me by mail if you want to volunteer.

here are the individual goalie stats as of wed apr 21 09 09 38 cst 1993

these stats include games up to and including the sunday previous to the date
listed above. they have been verified against what is printed in my newspaper
every tuesday. they do n't print shots and save percentage numbers , so those
are not verified. these stats are available by mail every weekday and
sometimes on weekends , if i'm in town and i can get late game results. just
send me a note if you would like to receive these stats by mail.

if you have any questions , comments or suggestions , let me know.

i feel the jury is still out on tim cheveldae as a playoff goalie.
he was average in his first playoffs. last year , he had a horrible
start , but played great the last ten games after he was benched.
his gaa , even with the horrible start , was 2.5 last year. this year ,
i think he 's going to play very well (he has to if detroit is going
to win the cup). he was n't sharp in game 1 , but he did n't have to be.
i thought he looked pretty good yesterday.

charles hubbert writes...
great write up of the wings toronto series thus far. i agree with just
about everything that you said , but chevy should n't have let the shot from
the right point in. first goal , mikorov , i think. other than that , the
wings are looking good , and chevy is holding his own. not great , but maybe

chevy has let in 2 or 3 soft goals so far , but they all did n't matter.
however , his recent history has been inconsistant play but comes up
big when it counts. the score was 4 0 i think when the goal you mentioned
was scored. in the third period when it looked like toronto was coming
back , chevy was exceptional. i can see him as a barraso style playoff
goalie inconsistant when there 's nothing on the line ,
but comes up big when really needed. i guess we 'll both find out.

amongst penguins' fans there seems to be an inner calm that i 've never
experienced before this year with the pens. the players and the fans have so
much confidence in the team this year. we 're savoring every game and saving
our energy for the stanley cup.

that 's not inner calm. it 's boredom , and it 's being spoiled. the arena 's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted. it 's been seemingly forever since the team
lost , and we 've forgotten what it 's like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory.

while i'm glad to have the pens doing so well , in some ways it was a better
high back when the pens beat the bruins two years ago , and the rangers last
year. too much of a good thing is not always good for you.

so what 's stopping pocklington from going to a bank and borrowing 41
million dollars to pay off his treasury branch loans...i was reading

according to the recent tsn report peter puck is not paying any interest
on the treasury branch loans. that 's a lot of green.

somewhere than pocklington business have gross revenues of about
500 million per year...i do n't think he would have much problem
borrowing from his visa to pay off his mastercard if he wanted to.

again , according to tsn , virtually everything that peter puck has already
has liens against it. of course we ca n't really be sure of this.

pocklington is at the point of maximum advantage right now...and
he is basically right in that northlands (which is a creature of the
city of edmonton) must give him a better deal in the era of escalating
salaries. northlands and the city benefitted as much as he did during
the eighties from the oilers...and wealth generated by the oilers
success was shared...but the finanical viability of small market teams
has radically changed in the space of a couple of years , and for
the oilers to remain viable and competitive , they need much more of
the revenue stream from concessions , parking , and building advertising
as most every other professional sports franchise in north america
has. what was once a fair agreement that shared the wealth is now
northlands sucking the blood out of the oilers franchise.

the oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal. sather has spouted this repeatedly. pocklinton
has a contract with northlands until 1999. a deal is a deal. perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players
such as gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he would n't be losing money. he has admitted pulling this
money out of the oiler franchise to put into his other businesses.

the oilers have paid several times over what the coliseum cost to
build , and bring edmonton prestige and recognition throughout the
world that is essentially priceless...to nickel and dime the oilers
just so northlands can use revenue sucked out of the oilers to
subsidize their horse racing operations is insanity.

i think that pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.
i ca n't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but
he is certainly not entitled to it. pocklington has sucked revenue
out of the oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.
pocklington is not to be trusted. i doubt very much that any oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under pocklington 's stewardship.
as soon as a player shows himself to be a competent nhl'er and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or
draft picks.

as she said , the letter is addressed to bettman. the post (which , though
having pretty much the same content , is an entirely different entity) was
addressed to all. when she puts the letter in the mail i doubt it will
say to all . i figure she wanted to let people here see what was in it
since it is a topic that interests a lot of folks here. that 's an entirely
different purpose than sending the letter to bettman.

and it is a damn good thing that she did post it since she claims to represent
people in rec.sport.hockey.

unfortunately...

the largest computer networks in the world phrase is a definition of
the internet , not a group as a whole that she claims to represent. as

her sole purpose in mentioning the net , as steve gallichio has already
pointed out , is to lend weight to her points through association with the
internet. there is no other reason to mention the internet. this is
misrepresentation and if the internet was a private corporation alison
would be leaving herself wide open to all kinds of civil suits.

for the business of whether or not it is large , it is large compared
to say , the number of folks on r.s.h. who are sending a letter to thank
him for changing the names , at least to this point. and just for my

this is not a letter. it is a petition claiming to represent a large
proportion of rec.sport.hockey users , and by implication , a significant
number of internet users. 65 names can in no way be considered a
large proportion of rec.sport.hockey which , while we have no way of
counting actual readership , is accessible to hundreds of thousands of
people. 65 persons is no more than a fly 's fart in a windstorm.

own curiosity i thought i 'd look up the official definition of large
in the dictionary. it reads

large 1. having more than usual power , capacity , or scope.
2. exceeding most other things of like kind in quantity or size.

gee. you looked up large in the dictionary \? what next \? two syllable
words \?

now i have no idea how many letters bettman may have gotten on the issue
or how many people may have signed them. 65 people may be up there ,
thereby validating definition 2. i would also wager that the geographical
range of signatures is quite large , which would give it a large scope.

let me suggest that the only place you are likely to envy the magnitude of
65 is when you are looking for ways to beef up your iq scores.

he might be impressed by the size of the list of names.

why would he be impressed with this unless it were large \?

as i said , he might be impressed by the size of the list of names. but
it would have to be considerably larger. but even this definition does
not account for the original context from which you lifted this sentence.

i personally do n't know whether or not i agree with the letter. i have
very mixed emotions about it. i like the names as they are , and do n't
think they make it that difficult to learn the game , but there might be
a shred of validity to the change.

well then what the hell is your point \? you do n't really know if you have
an opinion about the hockey issue but you do know that you do n't like me.
is that it \?

i really do n't see this happening. if they did n't think cheveldae could do the
job they would of traded for somebody this year , after all why wait until next
year when there were goalies available this year.

hey , i may be wrong , but after watching him kick rebound after rebound into
the high slot , i do n't think he can carry them in the tough games (i.e.
those not against toronto).

better to kick out rebounds than to let goals in.

if st. louis gets past chicago , watch for joseph to carry the blues past
an otherwise vastly superior red wings club.

joseph is hot , but so are the wings. they have scored six goals in both of
their games so far with toronto , supposively one of the leagues best defenses.
i guess if they end up playing for the norris title we 'll see what happens.

wings in '93 , or hopefully by '94.


as far as cheveldae is concerned , he is a decent goalie. the most logical
trade in the offseason to me would be between detroit and ny rangers. i'm sure
if beezer would be traded he would enjoy the opportunity to go back to his
roots in detroit. he would be a valuable asset to the wings and perhaps the
rangers could get a zombo in return \? beezer got a few good years in him and
the opportunity to get a fresh start would energize his play.

i agree with 2 but you are wrong about 3. in fact , the only
point where the hawks in any way matched the blues was when
they quit trying to outmuscle and instead tried to outskate
the blues. they scored and took the lead. too bad it was
game 4 and they then took some stupid penalties. when the
hawks skated , they outskated the blues and took control.

on the other hand , i'm hard pressed to think of any other real mistakes
fereirra made. imagine indeed , but then again we have the benefit of
hindsight.

well , the jettison for youth fast strategy was his. also in hindsight , it
did n't work all that well , but i think it was more because it left the
sharks on a tightrope without a net , not that it was inherently flawed. it
was the injuries that caused us to fall.

let 's say that in the view of the sharks' upper management , the attempt
to trade kisio was a major factor in the decision to fire feirerra.

from all indications , it was n't the major factor , but the last straw .
there were personality conflicts among shark management , and disagreements
over how personnel were going to be handled (not just who was being traded
vs. kept , but who was being sent to kc. what ferriera did , if rumors are
right , was not always what the folks behind the bench wanted or needed).

i'm inclined to take exactly the opposite view they should have kept
him...he 's obviously the luckiest man in hockey !

i think if they 'd kept ferriera , they would have lost some of their other
management staff. depending on which sources you trust , we might have lost
grillo and lombardi and murdoch over the summer. frankly , i want to keep
those three. (we may well ahve also lost kingston , which , of course , is now
a moot point).

the sharks have been building an organizational staff that is highly
consensual and cooperative. ferriera wanted to run things his way. there
were conflicts. ferriera lost. that says nothing about his skills or
accomplishments at that level , a lot is personality and politics.

i think he did some good things for the sharks , but that he never fit in as
a shark person . i hope he succeeds beyond his wildest dreams down in
anaheim , too , because it 'll be good for hockey. (but i want the ducks to be
doormats for a couple of years , so the sharks succeeed first).

the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere.

gerald , look at what happened to the stars they are off to dallas.


pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial
government is months away from a provincial election...it is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...
and it is before the nhl 's new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenue sharing.

gerald , the alberta election is slated fou 7 june , unless something re \? ally goes
wrong this time ! ! pocklington could end up being the embarassment of klein
if he goes ahead with his 'ultimatum'.


pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.

gerald , people still have an axe to grind with this guy. i cannot see him staying for long.

he can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his
price if edmonton does n't.

but the people in edmonton wo n't budge , trust me on this one.

edmonton has already up its international airport , and
surrendered supremacy to calgary , and over the next few years
edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.
it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team too...because northlands wants
to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing.

northlands wo n't budge ccording to one of the board members , bruce campbell.

however , in this case , about the long term financial
viability of the oilers , the fact is that pocklington is basically
right , regardless of who owns the team , and it is right to provoke
the crisis now , before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses , or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money.

i have n't heard anything , but attendance at the coliseum was the lowest this
year. hint ! ! hint ! ! remeber what i said about a personal vendetta \?

sather has done his job...the oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon (al strachan , one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in canada in a post mortem of the oilers season in
the globe and mail recently agrees with me.)

gerald , do n't blame sather. this battle between the peole and pocklington
started in 1986 and got worst when pocklington sold gretzky.

there were days when you can shake the hand of pocklington when he was
respectalbe( i use to do so in 1982 1983 season) , but those days are goe ! !

that 's not inner calm. it 's boredom , and it 's being spoiled. the arena 's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted. it 's been seemingly forever since the team
lost , and we 've forgotten what it 's like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory.

i do n't really agree with this. but it is an entirely different high ,
at any rate. the first cup the pens won , i did n't think about anything
else i just watched mario and all skate the thing around the ice. now
it seems to be more of a question whether or not , thirty years from now ,
young hockey fans (may there be millions ! ) will still ask us what it was
like to watch this team. that 's what they are playing for now. but i
was still as nervous as ever when the devils were blasting shots at
barrasso in the final seconds of game three , so the fun is far from over
yet.

i'm not bored either. most people i know say that winning the second cup
was better than the first but to me nothing will ever top that first one.
but i'm every bit as excited this year and i am experiencing that inner calm
to which susan originally referred. inner calm is not boredom.

as far as the arena in general being boring , well richard 's got that right.
it 's been that way all season. i attribute it to a lot of new fans who
just do n't have the same spirit and knowledge as long time fans. at
last tuesday 's game , i overheard a man express surprise that a
goaltender can get an
assist.

anyone who follows sports with regularity knows that anything can happen
at any time. i'm confident in the pens but i'm also not stupid enough to
think for one minute that it 's impossible for new jersey to blow them out
of this series. i doubt that will happen but it 's possible. bored \? uh uh.
spoiled \? not in the least. forgot what excitement is like \? living through
that amazing streak was n't exciting \? ! i do n't take a darned thing for
granted. god , look at chicago...

and i see no problem with quietly savoring all of this anyway. it is n't gonna
last forever and i intend to enjoy it while i can.

paul kariya 1993 1 pick ! (no. 2 perhaps \? he wo n't last long ! ) )

i do n't know the exact coverage in the states. in canada it is covered
by tsn , so maybe espn will grab their coverage ! i do n't know !

as for the picks
ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that alexander daigle will
go 1. he 'll either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec. imo i would
take kariya. he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in
the world championships. daigle did n't show this for his junior team.

san jose will then get kariya.

tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov (i think that 's it) or a
defenseman rob niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

the sharks appear to be leaning toward picking rob
niedermayer , a center (his brother scott ( \? ) is a defenseman
picked by nj a couple years ago). they brought him in for a
physical tryout a week or so ago. from what i have read
niedermayer is the best skater in the draft , plays both
offense and defense , and is n't afraid of physical play.
defensively the sharks are looking pretty good in terms of
defense prospects (rathje , sykora , ragnarsson) , and our
centers (kisio et al) are getting old.

with all of the small players the sharks have i justs can't
see them picking yet another small player like kariya , he 'd
just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated
shoulder.

buffalo fans

some people in the discussion group , as well as commentator al on espn ,
believe that game 3 is critical for the sabres. helloooo ! ! ! ! ! the sabres
are ahead 2 games to 0 , not behind. as a life long sabres fan , i am well
aware of their ability to choke , but let 's not exaggerate that. as long as
the sabres win one of the next 2 games (be it game 3 or game 4) , they are
still in good shape (ahead 3 games to 1) , with game 6 to be played at
buffalo. if they lose games three and four , then start worrying. game 3 is
critical for boston , not buffalo.

nntp posting host andrew.cmu.edu

during the first three games of the pens devils series , i have been
impressed time and time again by the pure talent of the pens. jagr ,
maceachern and barrasso have been especially fun to watch. but , one
element of this team which goes unnoticed seems to be scotty bowman.

despite brooks' lunatic comments , and despite the devils' line changing
adantage in last night 's game , bowman has been able to keep his cool and
keep the devils in the dark. granted , the hell dwellers had the pens
bottled up for a while last night , but bowman was eventually able to
configure his line up to get the job done. his ability to throw out new
looks and strategies at a moments notice is incredible.

bowman seems to have a terrific ability of reading his players on an
individual basis. last night , for instance , he realized that the speed
of jagr , straka , and maceachern was throwing the devils off balance. as
a result , straka received many more shifts than average jagr played
almost the entire game (he was always on the puck) , and maceachern
scored a goal , while complementing jagr many times throughout the night.
his ability to commit to one player in crucial situations is
commendable , especially when a coach of such a talented team might
simply rely on the overall talent to dominate , and to bring about
success.

while no one can replace the genius and optimism of badger bob johnson ,
bowman , in his own way , has made himself a permanent , though not clearly
seen , mark in pittsburgh.

i think the three headed gm 's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage.

does n't sound like a bad strategy to me.

no , and in fact , that was ferreira 's original strategy , which the troika
proceeded to simply continue to implement. there was n't exactly a radical
shift in policy when he was ousted (something people seem to forget). the
only real question is whether they did it as well as ferreira could have if
he stayed , or whether the basic strategy was flawed (since ferreira has been
quoated as saying he 's going to do something different in anaheim with the
ducks , my guess is that it was n't as good in practice as it was on paper ,
and he 's tweaking it a bit second time around). one also has to wonder
whether the strategy would have been a lot better if we had n't had those
injuries , and whether we 're complaining about the weather because an
earthquake collapsed the root cellar.

of course , ferreira had also traded a number of veterans with marginal
contributions before he was fired , so it 's not clear that this would have
been different. besides , they were marginal contributors.

let 's also not forget that ferreira came this close to trading kelly
kisio , which , if the rumors i 've heard are true , was over the strong
objections of other aspects of shark management and probably had a lot to do
with both his ouster and the three headed , consensus oriented gm.

imagine , for a second , where the sharks would be today if that fax machine
had n't jammed.

with or without mullen , they were n't going to be a playoff team what good
does it do them to hang onto a player who 'd rather be elsewhere \?

especially an unhappy player that is n't playing as well because of it. not
that i 'd accuse mullen of tanking , but his motivation simply was n't there ,
and that kind of thing can affect the team.

an example from this season , skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept , because of his age. i thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around.

the youth movement has its advantages look at gaudreau who
might still be in kc if more veterans had been kept around. but
you have to find the right balance.

right balance for what \? that 's the issue.

exactly. at the time they let skriko go , we had n't yet had the major injury
bugs that killed us later. i 'd much rather have skriko around than someone
like dean kolstad , but at that point , that was n't the choice. and since the
choice was more one of skriko vs. someone like john carter , i think the
right choice was made for that time period.

as if an aluminum stick being taken to ulf 's head is gonna solve the problem
with violence in the sport of hockey. how the hell can you say the guy is
a goon and justify it , with your back assward mentality \? saying that hurting
a player will solve anyone 's problems is asinine. new rules and a new
referee system need to be instituted. right now , too many of the real goons
get away with too much , because the ref is watching the play (or supposed to be i 've seen koharski and van hellemond , to name a few , with their heads up their asses on a few calls) rather than keeping an eye on the goofballs behind the
play. even if the linesmen were able to call all penalties , it would be an
improvement.

unfortunately , that is the way the league is heading... you ca n't fight ,
so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
the ref is n't looking. ulf has brought this to a high level... players
stuck in the past (like neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots
are at a disadvantage in the new system.

lets face it , a cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
method... it is easier to hide from the refs , has a better chance of
causing injury , and you can draw people into fights that way. i do n't
like it , but that 's the way the league is going.

by the way , there was a rather good hit by ulf in the last penguin devil
game. managed to hit the nj player in the face with a stick. (must have been a
legal hit... after all , ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
things like that.)

here 's one from the mill. the oilers might move to hamilton
where porklington can get a free deal.


the probability is that the oilers are not going anywhere.

pocklington has chosen this moment to make his last stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial
government is months away from a provincial election...it is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...
and it is before the nhl 's new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenue sharing.

pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.

he can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his
price if edmonton does n't.

edmonton has already fucked up its international airport , and
surrendered supremacy to calgary , and over the next few years
edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.
it will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team too...because northlands wants
to continue to use the oilers to subsidize horse racing.

however , in this case , about the long term financial
viability of the oilers , the fact is that pocklington is basically
right , regardless of who owns the team , and it is right to provoke
the crisis now , before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses , or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money.

sather has done his job...the oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon (al strachan , one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in canada in a post mortem of the oilers season in
the globe and mail recently agrees with me.)

as far as the stanley cup goes i think there 's only one team that can
test
pittsburgh and that 's detroit. this would be the most entertaining and

kurt

i think joe kocus should play every night. he is a big physical guy , and
he gets the fans into the game with some big hits. (both checks and
fists) its a big advantage to get the crowd going. plus , he helps
protect the other players. notice there are very few fights when kocur is
on the ice unless he is it. i have seen people start to go after essa
tikkanen , only to go slinking away when kocur steps in. i think he is big
asset , but should be third line , and special situation only play.

yahooooooooo !

the habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for quebec
city to play game 5. btw , final score was habs 3 nords 2.

the score might be a bit misleading. the habs dominated the game
from the 5 00 mark of the first and then on. the score should have
been 8 2 if it were n't for some miraculous save from a ron hextall
(bastard ! ). he 's the reason the score was as close. habs winning
goal was scored by benoit brunet at 1 07 of the 3rd.

roy had an ok game. he made the first save (one way or another)
and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.

this just in , espn radio reports that the bruins lost 6 5 in ot.
yahooooooooooo ! ! ! those suckers got what they deserved.

life is just great ! ! ! ! now if my finals would go just as well !

i'm a hockey fan from way back , and maintain an interest as best i can
here in the hockey hinterlands (oklahoma). i'm hoping i can get a
reading from some of you about the move of the north stars to dallas.

i 've been under the impression that minnesota was one of , or possibly ,
the hockey state in the u.s. so why is the team moving to a city in
texas \? is it that the owner is a greedy , self serving profiteer , or
were the stars really not making a profit \? or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging \?

opinions , please.


well , as a hockey fan , i think it 's terrible. it 's one thing to say , hey ,
let 's give a hockey team to cities that do n't have one ! that 's fine. it 's
entirely another to say , okay , let 's take a team from a thriving hockey town
and move it !

of course , none of us will ever know the real inside story , but
from what i know , a group of minneapolis businessmen told green repeatedly that
they would purchase the remaining 3600 ( \? ) season tickets to get to the 10 , 000
level that green wanted , yet he refused every time. it 's pretty obvious that he
was determined to get out of minneapolis at any cost and use the season tickets
thing as an excuse.

i was fortunate enough to get to the penultimate game , and
the fans were great ! people were tailgating and playing roller hockey in the
parking lot before the game , the attendance was so full as to have sro , and the
whole atmosphere in the centre was terrific. minnesota is hockey , usa. how the
nhl can so blithely let the major league team from there move away is beyond
me. i only hope they get a new team soon.

just my 0.02.

while watching the penguins devils game last night , i saw the slash that
barrasso took on the neck. this brought to mind the goaltender who had his
jugular vein cut by a skate. i think he was a sabre , but i'm not positive.
does anyone remember know his name \? what has happened to him since \? what
about the player whose skate cut the goalie \? name \? info \? has this ever
happened before in a hockey game \?

it was clint malarchuk 's neck cut by uwe krupp 's skate. i know it happened in
buffalo , but i ca n't tell you against whom.

krupp was defending an opposing attacker charging the net.

it was not krupp 's skate. krupp was defending against steve tuttle ,
of the blues. they both sort of tripped and fell toward malarchuk ,
and tuttle 's skate came perilously close to cutting (but actually just
missed) the jugular. malarchuk immediately fell to the ice , hands at
his neck , blood on the ice.

malarchuk became the fourth goalie (behind hasek , puppa and draper) after
suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder. he 's been playing in san diego
for former sabre coach rick dudley.

he 'd been suffering from it for over a decade. he just was n't
diagnosed for it until he did n't sleep for ten days and decided to
have some alcohol to help him sleep. unfortunately , he 'd just been
put on ulcer medicine a few days earlier. it 's amazing he lasted as
long as he did. ocd sufferers stop distinguishing the line between
reality and imagination , or fail to accept that something they 've
checked is ok now. for example , an ocd sufferrer can wash his hands
over and over and still think they 're dirty. he might check the oven
ten times to be sure it 's turned off. he might see a movie about
something and automatically assume the situation is the same for his
own life. malarchuk has dramatically decreased the medicine he takes ,
but still needs it. he went off it this past winter and had a bad ocd
episode and i think was in the hospital for a couple days. (he felt
it slowed his reflexes , so he tried to go without). in any event , he
is alive and well and living in san diego , while playing with the
gulls (ihl).


krupp is now playing for the islanders after the lafontaine turgeon trade.

and tuttle is no longer with the blues , but i do n't know where he is.
possibly in the ihl , but you 'd best ask a blues fan.

news

for the first time all season , the flames are now injury free. the only player
remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who , even when healthy , is not
a major part of the team.

trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season
game against san jose. he potted his first of the year in that game , and has
also scored goals in both game 1 and game 2 against los angeles.

thoughts on game 1


the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with
los angeles 6 3 on sunday afternoon. they seemed more interested in throwing
big hits than in scoring goals. they physically dominated the kings , but that
was the only area they dominated in. the game plan was to rush the net and
try and take advantage of a young , inexperienced l.a. defence and the shaky
kings goaltending , but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames
conducted a steady march to the penalty box. particularily stupid was theoren
fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren
rychel 's face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees.

goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the
loss , despite his well publicized poor record in afternoon games. he got
very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and
sweeping away rebounds. in fact , marty mcsorley 's goal actually went in off
chris dahlquist 's skate in front of the net.

thoughts on game 2


the flames came back strong in the second game , evidently aware of the
potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice.
the first period was fairly even , with the edge going to the kings. but calgary
came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings , scoring
five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a 9 4 win.

the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams. calgary
dominated on faceoffs as they did in game 1 , but they were able to make better
use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one. calgary
also went 3 for 5 on the powerplay while l.a. only went 1 for 8 and gave up
a shorthanded goal to joel otto. l.a. 's powerplay goal also came late in the
game with the outcome already decided. the kings' powerplay failed them when
they needed it most , in the 1st and 2nd periods.

the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he
was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgary 's 7th goal. charlie
huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury.

the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute. first , craig berube of
calgary took a five minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for
instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason. granato
drew a minor for some strange reason. (turtling perhaps). this was followed
30 seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major , minor , and game misconduct
for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a
fight. musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason. hardy and
yawney went toe to toe and both got double minors. (gregson thought that musil
turtling amounted to fighting , but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at
each other was just roughing \? where 's this guy from.....)

as a person who has rarely even seen don cherry and does n't know
anything about him , i do n't know whether it is just this area
(pittsburgh) of the usa that is deprived of his broadcasts or whether
he 's a canadian thing altogether. seriously , what is he all about \? i
know he was a coach at one time , and from the volume of posts about him ,
someone surely is getting a steady diet of him somehow , but my question
is , what is the deal with him \? secondly , are the comments of his that i
read about on the net merely flame bait , or do people actually take him
seriously \? i gotta tell you , from what i see , he really sounds like an
ass. let me know maybe i'm missing something.


well , here in detroit we get to see and hear don cherry quite regularly.
the detroit area picks up hockey night in canada from cbc (ch 9) in
windsor where we see don cherry 's coaches corner between periods. we
also get to see don cherry 's grapevine just before the game. the
grapevine is a hockey talk show where don talks to a player or coach
about what else hockey. it 's actually a pretty good show and don
is n't as annoying as he is on coaches corner. i think this is were
don got his nickname 'grapes' but i'm not sure. don use to coach the
boston bruins. i do n't know exactly when that was. could someone fill
me in on this info \?
a local radio station here in detroit (wllz) talks to don every tuesday
morning. personally , i 've had my fill of donny ! he really pisses me off
sometimes. during the detroit toronto game monday night on cbc , don gave
high praise to doug gilmour , saying he was a two way player and not
just a designated goal scorer and that he is probably the best player
in the game because of that. that 's fine and i agree that gilmour
is a good two way player but he said the exact same thing about yzerman
about a month ago on a local radio talk show. what gives \?
it seems like he just has a set speech that he changes when he goes from
city to city.
don cherry 'i think insert star player name for city that he is in
is the best two way player in the league today.'

there have been other times (ca n't remember exactly what he said) that he
basically changed his opinions to match the audience he was talking to.
someone here on the net said something about how don criticized mario
lemieux but when the time comes for don to broadcast the cup playoffs
from the civic center (yes , i think the pens will make it out of the
wales conference) don will apologize left and right for his remarks about
lemieux. in my opinion , he is an ass. and i wo n't change my opinion
if i'm in a different city.
sorry , if this did n't answer your question better but i just had to get
this off my chest.

don got his nickname 'grapes' but i'm not sure. don use to coach the
boston bruins. i do n't know exactly when that was. could someone fill
me in on this info \?

i think that the name 'grapes' came because as coach (for the bruins \?
or in the minors \? ) he used to chew on grapes to keep from getting
dehydrated during the games. his dog blue may have been named
'cause he liked labatts beer ... anyone know about that \?

according to quotations from chairman cherry , don was playing in
springfield. he and another player had to pay some fines the other
player had his paid off , but not don did n't want to.

don called the other player a teacher 's pet , and the other player
replied ah , that 's just sour grapes .

do n't know how accurate that is , but that 's what 's printed.

this comes indirectly from al morgani who works in the studio
for espn hockey.

the management of espn was reluctant to leave the pitt nj game
(even though the outcome was certain) because of fear of the wash ny game
going to overtime. when the caps scored with 02 left to tie the game , al said
he heard many people say f k . ! .
espn is under contractual obligation to show baseball and could not
broadcast the ot of the hockey game. next year , espn2 will be introduced so
baseball fans can watch baseball and hockey fans can watch hockey.

get off espn's back and stop posting articles on this subject ! ! !

felix potvin deserves to have the sh kicked out of him. if there is anyone
that he should be hitting with his stick , its his pussy defensemen who ca n't
seem to move big dino ciccerelli (5'10 180 lbs) out from in front of the net.

obviously toronto has realized that they are overmatched by the wings and must
rely on trying to antagonize the superior red wings with cheap shots. i prefer
to watch hockey than seeing shots of felix potvin slashing and spearing dino
ciccerelli standing in front of the net. he has every right to stand in
front of the net , just not in the crease !

yes , he does. but , the goalie sure as hell does n't want him there ! when
i played roller hockey (boy do i miss those days) as a goalie , i would
scream at my defense to clear guys out of the slot. i do n't care if he 's
in the crease or not , get him the hell away from me so i can see the ball !
(yes , roller hockey , remember) and if there was nobody around to clear
the slot , then i 'd do it myself by pushing the offending player hard .
i hate people in my way when i'm the goalie , and i am sure felix does
too. i should say that i did n't see the incident , so if potvin really
swung the stick big time , then that 's not right , but he can move people
out of the way. he 's a player on the ice too , you know. )

i do n't think trading kisio was intrinsically a mistake however , trading him
for a 3rd round pick would be he should have been worth a lot more than a
3rd round pick for a playoff team. in fact , i would intimate that the offers
the sharks got this year for kisio were way greater than just a 3rd round pick.

hindsight 's 20 20. nobody expected kisio to have his 2nd best career year.

besides , without kisio , the sharks would have tanked even earlier in
the season , and gund might have gotten a little more serious
about getting joe murphy , a guy who definitely would be around
3 5 years from now when the sharks do make the playoffs.

what else could be done \? the gunds offered 2 million for murphy , but the
oilers wanted prospect(s) , which the sharks declined to give , which i think is
correct.

i did n't mean to imply that gund 's offer was n't enough. gund 's offer
was the right , but too late in the season. 2m offered in november
lets sather buy a replacement for murphy this season and make the
playoffs this year. 2m in march does n't help sather with his
immediate objectives , does n't help with long term objectives (only a
prospect or draft pick does , and no way should the sharks do that).
however , getting back to what if games , had kisio been traded to
chicago last year , then the sharks go 0 for october , and maybe gund
panicks sooner in november. and here 's another what if twist chicago
would have had kisio this season they never go after murphy in the
first place because kelly is having his best season (bigger guys in
chicago). so gund has no competition. so ferriera , sather , and keenan
all look like geniuses.

a broken fax machine , and ferriera , keenan , and maybe kingston
(and maybe even green) lose their jobs. kind of makes you
shiver does n't it. )

bottomline , for every black scenario any of you can concoct for
kisio leaving , i can concoct an equally bright one.

if the kisio fiasco was the cause of ferierra 's down fall , i hope
it was n't because he tried to trade kisio , but because he screwed it
up. nonetheless , i'm sorry ferierra and kingston are gone , and i wish gund
would follow.

and what have the gunds done exactly that caused you to wish that they were
gone \? ...

are you serious \?

actually , that 's based on the nhl 's history of 7 games. the statstical

straight games 12.5 , 4 straight games 6.25 . the odds of the penguins
winning 14 straight games in the playoffs was 0.0061 . of course , this does n't
include weighted average , but the pens beating the devils 3 straight (a weaker
team) along with beating the rangers 3 straight (a much stronger team) has made
the act balanced out. that 's about right. for boston the odds of winning are
probably closer to 10 (with weighted average) since buffalo 's record is n't as
good and boston has a stronger team. enough about my qba probabilities though !
it 's just goes to prove anything is possible , if you integrate that to debbie

they lost 2 ot games with a different bounce , they could easily be up 2 1.

harry and his buttkisser milbury will never admit that they screwed up

there was a discussion about how real fans were ones who respect their teams
no matter ow bad they are. that 's bullshit. anyone who would follow the
pens or the pirates in parts of the early eighties on a devoted basis are
losers. it 's ok to follow and be concerned about your home team. but
to give them respect even when it is clear the management and the players suck
should not be required of a true fan.a true fan would follow the team in
troubled times to the extent that they could discuss how to improve the team.

when i visit pittsburgh , i 'll refuse to go to a pirates game since i think
the management has given pittsburgh a team which could have been much better
even if they could n't sign barry bonds. lert 's say the pens start doing to
their own team what the oilers have done this year and what the whalers have

i think this goes along with a comment you made in an earlier post

plus his team has improved a much greater amount than detroit since
he took over with them.

how do you figure \? both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year
they both won their division , they had close to the same number of points ,
they both went down 3 1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally
escaping in 7 games , and they both got knocked out in the second round by
teams they should have been able to beat , with less talent. (specifically ,
if i remember correctly , third place teams). how does this make vancouver

vancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).

once again the leafs overcame the red wings in what was possibly the
most exciting game played yet in this playoff year.

perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that you have seen. for
most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity ,
it was nowhere near the most exciting game...

paul stewart called the single worst game i 've seen this year.
federov 's major was obvious , and i do n't dispute it. however , chaisson 's
penalty should n't even have been a penalty , let alone a major and a
game misconduct. the 5 minute game misc. call is for high sticking only.
there is no blood penalty. just because chaisson barely touched the
poor sap , and he hit the dasher and bled profusely does n't mean it is a
penalty.

unfortunately , the instant replay is not used on hits. at first , i
immediately thought 5 and a game because the hit looked much more severe
from an intent to injure perspective than it was. after seeing the replay ,
i 'd say it deserved 2 4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you
slice it). if stewart had replay , i do not think chaisson would have gotten
5 and the game.

in the second period , behind potvin , probert had the puck , and was
going to get out front , and was tackled ! i could n't believe the no call.

this no call was bullshit , i agree. i admire stewart for letting them go , but
probert looked up saying where the hell is the penalty \? i 've never
seen probert whine either (he does n't need to). now , if probie
decides to put wendel through the boards , he 's probably gone , right \?

i do n't remember who (on the leafs) touched the puck
on racine 's shot towards the end of the game (43.2 seconds left) , but stewart
called it out of play , last touched by detroit. everybody in the garden ,
including the linesmen knew it. yzerman protested , but stewart just
laughed , and really homered the wings.

this was also bullshit. but once again , no replay. it was rouse , btw. i'm
really pissed that the linesmen did n't correct the call either....it 's b.s.
when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.

but , when it all comes down to it , wings played like shit.....

yes. the calls you describe should not have the difference in a detroit
loss. i picked the leafs to win game 3 on emotion and adrenalin , but the
wings have no excuses for game 4. they should be the superior team.

the call that pissed me off the most was anderson getting 4 for putting his
stick in somebody 's eye. that was the most dangerous stick infraction i
have seen in a long time , and everybody in the damn league knows he 's an
asshole when it comes to stickwork. four lousy minutes. bullshit call.
murray should send the tape in. or a wing should hammer the living shit out
of him.

hi guys....
i'm looking to answe a bit of trivia. what hockeplayers have
appeared on major talk shows on tv (i.e. , letterman , carson leno ,
arsenio , etc.....i.e. shows of a national nature include canadian equivalents
if you can think of any) \? this can include nhl , olympic , and world champion
ship players. i'm pretty sure i 've seen gretzky and lemieux , but i was
wondering if there were any others...

i saw messier and leetch shooting at a camera on letterman( \? ). i
could have been any show though , since i watch none of those late
night shows very regularly.

that 's not inner calm. it 's boredom , and it 's being spoiled. the arena 's
been as quiet as a church on many nights this year too many of us just
take winning for granted. it 's been seemingly forever since the team
lost , and we 've forgotten what it 's like to feel real excitement and
surprise at victory.

at least last night there was some excitement. the pens
did n't have it wrapped up before the game was half over like
the previous two games. i'm not sure if nj just rose up and
played better or if the penguins just started to play down
somewhat. probably it was somewhere in between. new jersey
seemed much more aggressive last night in the pens end. they
did much more swarming around , which at least kept an
element of suspense in the game. no question that billington
helped make it more interesting also. claude lemieux did n't

i do n't even think the selection of the hart deserves serious discussion on

while i agree that lemieux deserves the hart , it is far from a no brainer .
the hart trophy goes to the player most valuable to his team , not to the best
player in the league. so your above arguement is really worthless.

the pens without mario are still a damn good hockey team. the leafs without
gilmour would have been fighting tampa bay for the 3rd pick.

paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the nhl.
we was robbed ! ! ! !

no. patrick roy is the reason the game was lost , and ron hextall is the
reason quebec won.

i do n't buy this at all. roy was the reason the game was tied... and that
would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool.
roy stood on his
head for the first 15 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from
end to end. kamensky 's mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by
young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy. roy outplayed
hextall for most of the game , but roy becomes the villain and hextall
the hero because roy 's team did n't make full use of their opportunities.

whoa. what you are effectively doing is implying that if a player plays
really well , he 'stores up' mistakes that can be used at a later time. ths
is not so. roy is the 'villain' , as you so succinctly put it , because he
allowed a very cheap goal. if you think roy outplayed hextall , perhaps you
should get a tape of the game and watch the first 7 8 minutes of the third
period. nhl goaltenders make some great saves. if they did not , they
would not be in the nhl in the first place. i do not expect any particular
goalie to be able to make the great saves all of the time , even though they
are occasionally required. however , when it comes to a routine shot like
sakic 's , especially at such a crucial time in a game , i do n't think there
are any legitimate excuses.

hextall , on the other hand , had a lot of lucky bounces
description of lucky bounces.....
hextall was n't particularly brilliant on those plays ...

i am not arguing that hextall was brilliant. i am arguing is that a
relatively weak wrist shot from the outside of the circle shold not result
in a goal.

... but it was just the 1 goal. the timing stank , but against
an explosive team like quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.

in a one goal game with less than a minute to go there is no such thing as
'just the 1 goal'. i have not defended dionne for taking the penalty
either...in fact i think it was a boneheaded move. but it led to one goal
only , and montreal had a two goal lead. my main concern is the second
goal.

this most certainly was a team loss... leclair missed his opportunities ,
as did bellows and brunet. dionne took a bad penalty. damphousse and lebeau
were silent . carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night. roy gave
up the bad goal. roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss.

what you say about the skaters is absolutely true. but realize that the
game was effectively won . you could watch any hockey game (in fact , you
could watch any sporting event period) and spend hours discussing the 'what
if 's' w.r.t. missed opportunities. they are not important when the final
result is decided. if i get the time soon , i 'll watch the game again and
email you a list of lucky montreal bounces and a list of quebec offensive
screwups. montreal was leading with a minute to go. the goalie
is the last line of defence , and i will grant that extra attention is
focussed on him , sometimes without justification. but roy gave up a lousy
goal , and a team cannot afford such a goal.

roy looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic 's shot.

and hextall did n't on dionne 's goal \? please.

who cares \? of what value is it to justify one lousy play with a totally
unrelated lousy play \? i could do a hextall critique if you 'd like. but if
you 're going to assess his performance , keep in mind that he made the key
saves at the key times.

roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5

for the record , i did not say that roy was not one of the top goaltenders in
the league. in fact , i agree that he is.

the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the habs. they are no better than uninformed fans.

i assume you are referring to me. however , i have pointed out that i think
the loss can be blamed on roy. i have not said he sucks , nor do i think i 've
made any other 'derogatory comments'. if you regard objective
(and informed , fyi) observations as derogatory , i really ca n't help you.

the hockey state in the u.s. so why is the team moving to a city in
texas \? is it that the owner is a greedy , self serving profiteer , or
were the stars really not making a profit \? or was the city or whoever

i used to work for the stars. minnesota supported the team to an
extent. when i was there , we had quite afew sellouts (this was the
season after the cup run and during the finals). norm 's main bitch was
that there was n't enough luxury suites. and , the ones he had were not
always full. he wanted more boxes and wanted them full. he was just
asking for too much from people that could go and see other hockey games
at high schools for 5 or college for about 10 that would probably be
better.

lots of debate about the virtues of bryan murray vs pat quinn as a gm
deleted. randy graca seems to think murray is the best gm in the league.
i think quinn is one of several who are better.

plus his team (quinn 's) has improved a much greater amount than detroit since
he took over with them.

how do you figure \? both vancouver and detroit did the same thing last year
they both won their division , they had close to the same number of points ,
they both went down 3 1 in the first round of the playoffs before finally
escaping in 7 games , and they both got knocked out in the second round by
teams they should have been able to beat , with less talent. (specifically ,
if i remember correctly , third place teams). how does this make vancouver
more improved \? further , if i'm not mistaken , the wings had more points than
vancouver at the end of this season (albeit not many).

when quinn took over vancouver several years ago , not last year , they
regularily missed the playoffs. i ca n't recall if they missed the playoffs
the year before his hiring but they probably did. quinn has improved the
team from non playoff calibre to a serious contender.

when murray took over in detroit , the were about a .500 team that was a
contender to win the norris division and possibly even a stanley cup
contender.

so quinn has improved his team more than murray has since taking over as a gm.
quinn is one example of a better gm than murray.

there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans. i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages.

i think a compromise would work namely honouring personages in
conference names , and using geographical references in the divisional
names. although i still do not think the move will draw fans to the
game imo it 's a cosmetic change that bettman and the owners hope
will have an effect. and it does n't say much for the mentality of
anybody it works on , either.

another thing that bothers me is the points system. percentages , as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative. when i look at the
nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand (which is almost always the case). some will
object to percentages , claiming perhaps , that it is an americanization
of the sport

surprise , i agree totally. the points system is fine , if everybody at all
times has played the same number of games. since this is almost never the
case , winning percentage is the way to go. i do n't particularly care if it
is an american thing either , if it works.

brad mccrimmon was the captain of the flames when he was traded to detroit

it was nice to see espn show game 1 between the wings and leafs since
the cubs and astros got rained out. instead of showing another baseball
game , they decided on the stanley cup playoffs. a classy move by espn.


it was a classy move. but it looks like espn is going to devote most of
the coverage to the pens. on tuesday night , they continued to broadcast
the pen devil game even though pittsburgh had the game well in control.
granted they did show some bonus coverage of the caps and isles but
they cut away from the close game , which went into double ot , to update
us on the fifth goal of the rout.
thursday was a good game even if it was the second straight game between
the pens and devils. imho they should program some variety into the
telecasts.(yes i know the game shown on saturday is between the b 's and
sabres , probably throwing a bone to us bruin fans.)
and what about the cambell conference \? i 'd like to see a game in the
norris or smythe. why not have back to back nights of national
hockey night \?

just a thought.

this item.....gee both sutters won their divisions and now both have lost
home ice advantage and are getting smoked in their opening series in the
playoffs. kind of makes you wonder.......

bottom line....man it is great to be smoking the warthawks ! ! ! ! !
agreed jim.....this has been damn sweet , so far. about the only thing

good team.


yeh , but

1.biran sutter 's playoff record as the head coach in st.l was n't very
impressive. his blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs.
it does n't look like this trend will change with the bruins.

2. bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2 0 in their
entire 68 year history. it does n't look like buffalo will just lose
their next two games at the aud with the way fuhr has been standing on
his head.

basically , the bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend.
also , it seems like the whole boston area has gone baseball crazy after
an incredibly great start by the red sox(best record in their major
leagues as of now). i would say that 70 of the callers to the bruins'
flagship station(sportsradio 590) are talking about the red sox , about
15 are yapping about the patriots' upcoming draft , 10 are on the celtics
and about 5 are on the bruins.
somehow , no one around here is really schocked the way bruins are folding

the isles picked one hell of a time to get their first win all year after being
down after 2 periods. the caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady
defense and getting great goaltending from tabaracci. the isles power play
philosophy continues to be dump and chase which , except for boardaholics like
flatley , does n't work against the caps. i hope al realizes this ! ! they have too
many talented finesse players , so why not carry the puck in and set up \? \? \? if
last night 's game is any omen , the isles could be on their way to that ole
championship form coming from behind late in a game. my advice to the caps is
to pounce on those healy rebounds. flatley showed alot of heart by playing the
last period and overtime despite an almost swollen shut left eye injury
suffered at the hands of dale hunter. ray ferraro has arrived just in time for
the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us islander fans remember from an
italian from the past john tonelli ! ! ! it was tonelli who won a similar game
against the pens in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. the isles scored two late third
period goals to send the game into ot tied at 3. in ot , tonelli scored the game
winner to send the isles to the next round. the isles have lacked this tenacity
for years , but perhaps its back ! it was good to see the coliseum packed just
like the ole days ! ! ! good luck to the isles the rest of the way ! ! ! ! !

i 'd like to echo these sentiments. this is the worst coverage i can
ever remember seeing on cbc. as soon as the game ends , i can count to 30 ,
and by that time , they 've signed off the air. no post game interviews ,
no updating of late scores , nothin'. tsn is really putting cbc to
shame. i only hope the later round coverage improves , i mean , who

league anymore (statistically at least) , but he 's proving that he can

i heard a story on the local sports news broadcast in edmonton.
oiler owner peter pocklington will be holding a press conference
next week. while the exact details are not known , it is believed
to concern the oiler 's future.

rumour has it that pocklington signed a tentative lease arrangement
with copps collesium in hamilton. during the press conference ,
pocklington may announce the deal. it is quite possible that
the deal may simply be a way to force edmonton northlands to
renegotiate the oiler lease on the stadium.

northlands has offered to buy the oilers for 65 million earlier ,
but the offer was rejected immediately by pocklington.

as for me , my opinion is divided... edmonton has been fairly
supportive of the oilers. even though they 're a small market
team , they had many sellouts in the 80s. even with the problems
that the team had this year , they still brought in more fans
than many teams in larger cities did. on the other hand , if
the team does move , there is no place more deserving than
hamilton. of course , how would that affect the grand
realignment scheme of bettman \?

hi guys....
i'm looking to answe a bit of trivia. what hockeplayers have
appeared on major talk shows on tv (i.e. , letterman , carson leno ,
arsenio , etc.....i.e. shows of a national nature include canadian equivalents
if you can think of any) \? this can include nhl , olympic , and world champion
ship players. i'm pretty sure i 've seen gretzky and lemieux , but i was
wondering if there were any others.....


i am not so sure about the celebrated players of the game , but tod hartje ,
who played for harvard in college and then went on to play in the ahl
(initially for moncton and currently for providence thanks to daryl
turner for the update ! ) appeared on david letterman 's show about two
years ago now.

tod has the distinction of being the first american born player to go
and play in the former soviet union. this was arranged by jets gm mike
smith while tod was playing in moncton at about the time all those
european players were coming over to north america to play in the nhl.

tod spent a year playing in russia and played with or against some of
the russian players who have just entered the nhl in the last two years.
he wrote a book on his experiences called behind the red line (check it
out ! ) and appeared on the letterman show to talk about them.

mike

note i hope i have my facts straight. it has been a year since i
read tod 's book. i wanted to dig the book out to double check , but
realized i lent it to a friend , and he has n't returned the book yet !
(just wait 'til i get a hold of him...)
