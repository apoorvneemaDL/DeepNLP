i have a few the original ibm 10mb harddisks for sale. they are actually
seagate 's st412 , mfm , full height , has the ibm logo and black face plate.

each disk is checked and formatted with dos 5.0. it can be doubled to
20mb or so with dblspace or stacker if you so desire. have the original ibm
foam fitted boxies and anti static bags. i am not sure if they were ever
used , but each drive that is sent out will be quarenteed in good working order.

30 each plus shipping cost , (about 5) ,

if you have one of those old ibm xt or pcs , this is for you ! it 's cheaper
than a floppy drive !

this posting reminded me about a long standing question i 've had.
does it
pay to consider an underwater camera for pictures taken on land but
in
harsh environments (e.g. rain , snow , heat , cold , mud , dust) \? or are
the
lenses , etc. all tuned for the refractive index of water \?

i have had a nikon l35aw since 1988. unfortunately it is no longer
made. it is a p s sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. it
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and
dusty conditions. it takes aa batteries (hooray). it has the solid ,
heavy feel of old style nikons and has taken all the abuse i have
been able to give it. this includes a lot of water (rain , river and
sea) , desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon
against a mugger. shouting and swinging the camera by the strap
did n't scare the mugger away , hitting him with the flying camera
did. this is my , never be without a camera camera. the current
water resistant (sport touch i think is the name) model is nothing
like as solid or well sealed.

hi all

i have a korg dvp 1 for sale for 300.00 shipping. for those who 've not
had the pleasure

it is a midi controlled (no keyboard of it 's own) rackmountable digital voice
processor. what can it do with your voice \? it can pitch shift it (change the
notes you sing). it can add harmonies to your singing (up to 5 parts at one
time). it can change your voice into a synthesizer 's voice but leave what
you say alone and intelligible. this works well for a computerized sounding
singer , or robot voice. for those of you who just thought about that , yes
you can do the voices from robo cop , and the old elo lead ins with it , and yes
i'm a little red faced to say that i tried those specifically. for an input ,
it takes both xlr (3 prong mic) and 1 4 cables. for output , you can have
a combination of the original input only , and your choice of mix between the
original signal and the effect (can be effect only if desired). it has preset
setups , which you can edit and save for your own preferences. it has a couple
of light scratches , but does not look bad , and works flawlessly. even when we
do n't use it in my music , it 's been good for after hours fun in the studio.
the manual is included. i never got around to getting rack ears for it , but
it has only gotten studio use from me no roading , so it 's not beaten.

oooooooo o o steve hitch
oo o oo oo my opinions are my own. nobody would want to
oooo oo oo take responsibility for them anyway. i will
oooooooooooooooooooooooooo eventually hang for them , but i'm happy.

free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up. they 've seen
very little use. if anyone wants these bad enough to ship , they 're yours
for the cost of shipping , the cod charge and a 10 nusiance fee.

i have a lot of serial cables. i have all kinds , ribbon , shielded , long ,
short m m , m f whatever you want. most appear to work well with pc serial
ports , but i will not gaurantee that. tell me what you want and i 'll do
the best i can to match. 1.50 ea or 10 10. shipping included. no cods
under 20. (you want to pay a 5 cod charge for a 1.50 cable \? go buy
the cable at your local computer store instead , it 'll be cheaper.) i believe
these cables were removed from service at a computer center. they appear
to be in good condition and the ones i have used have worked well.

have been used in my studio for mixdown monitoring. i have the original box.
the 340s use both an electret element and a dynamic element in each ear cup
with built in crossovers. they have a very smooth frequency response and
the electrostatic element gives clearer highs. i am asking 200 for the

does anyone know what the jumpers should be set to on the maxtor 2190 \? \?
i have a 2190 that came off of a vs2000 that i would like to use on a pc.

... useful info about the maxtor drive deleted ...

since the 3b1 normally has only one hd , you would jumper betwwwn c1 to
select the first (possible) drive address if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3b1 , then jumper between 2c .

however , thad , you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'pc' , not 'unix pc'. also note the strange cross posting (as he
probably did not) , so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on. if it is a pc (or clone) , then the 2c jumper would be
the correct choice.

i 've left the cross posting in effect , since i'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. )


sorry for any confusion i may have created. the disk did come out of
a vs2000 and i would like to use it in a ibm pc clone. the reason that i
posted to comp.sys.3b1 was because i saw the drive (xt2190) mentioned
in a for slae notice. i had asked for info before but did n't receive
any replies.

thanks once again for the help.

he is a crook. don't deal with him ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !

please help

i am looking for dana weick. a month ago i made a deal with him over the
net. i was to sell him some memory , in exchang for 100 and a 486 66 cpu.
i thought the deal was great , so i went on with it.

i sent him the memory cod for 100. he was then suppose to send me the cpu.
i receive his cod payment on 4 8 93. he send me a message the he sent the
cpu out 4 16 93. it has been two weeks , and i did n't receive the cpu.

i send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship , or
what address he send it to (to make sure it did n't get lost in the mail.)
he never reply my mail.

i finally resorted to calling him in arizona. the first call did n't get
throught , i got an answering machine. i left him my number. he did n't reply.
i call again the next day and he pick up the phone. i asked him if he had
send out the cpu. he said yes , but he does n't know what address he sent it
to.

he said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day.
to my suprise , he never called. i then send him some more email messages , he
never reply again. (strang , when the deal was being made , he reply to every
of my message , now that he got my memory , he wo n't even reply to me.)

now i am still calling him , but he wo n't pick up the phone. i am also still
emailing him , but he wo n't reply my mail.

so if any one know this dana weick , please contact him.
he can be reach at

(602)925 6123 in the day time this is his business number.
(602)842 2145 in the evenings this is his home number.

72 pin simms are n't hot sellers , i pick them up on the upgrade market for
140 160 quite often. best i can do is the 486dx2 66 and 100.



ok you got a deal , i 'll trade you 4 (72pins simms) for an intel 486dx2 66 and
100. i need you address for shippment , i will ship it via cod and i 'll pay
shipping handling. when the simms arrive , there will be a 100 charge on your
part. you can send the cpu to me via cod if possible

my address

by the way , is the cpu under warranty \?

great , you can send the simms to me at

(602) 925 6123 (days) (602) 842 2145 (evenings)

i would prefer us mail , 2nd day priority (it only costs 2.90)

the cpu is brand new , install it correctly (meaning do n't plug it in
backwards or bend any pins) and i 'll warranty it for 6 months.
thanks

on 4 8 i send him and said...
that i got the cod payment.
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet
is the cpu sent out yet \?
he replied.....on 4 9

glad the cod payment got to you ok , the cpu has been sent so keep your eyes out
for it. be very careful when you install it , be careful of static discharge ,
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you
plug the chip in the proper orientation. the chip was checked out prior to
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards i wo n't be real
sympathetic !

if you do n't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed ,
don't guess !


dana weick update

i call him sunday , his wife debbie picked up the phone. she said that he was
busy with his kids , and he would call me back in 10 minuets. half an house
went by , weick did n't called. i called him again , and his phone was discon
nected.

since this post , i have numberous people who mail me saying that this dana
weick have ripped them off. we got do something about this guy. he has
appearrently been doing this for a few years now. and he is getting away
with it.

please refer to 7870 , he is selling 150 for that cpu.

correct. 150 may be high now that amd has started selling 486 clones !


you 're both dreaming. that guy who is selling at 150 is ripping himself off and
once those chips are gone it 'll be a while before you see that price again , amd
or not. a clone is still a clone , if you want the genuine article then you pay
for it. just because one guy decides to sell at a ridiculously low price does n'tmean everyone else has to.

heay bud , get a life in the real world.... do you still play with your atari

i have been quoted a price from a local dealer friend of mine , that i could get a
motherboard (386dx 33 with 64k cache , with 1 meg base ram.) for 285 ! !

here is some friendly advice , go to your favorite book store (walden book 's)
and pick up a computer shoppers guide...

you think that was aa good price wait till you see some of the other goodies they sell

i recently purchased an ibm monochrome vga monitor from mike damico. the
monitor arrived but it was missing it 's power cable. mike 's address is
apparently not a proper address because mail ca n't reach it. if anyone
knows how to contact mike and could help me find him i would appreciate it.
i am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor
but it would be a lot more useful to me if i had the cord as well.

items for sale.....

this package was bought throught a award give away company. i attempted
to cancel my order before i received the package , but i was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund. i know the truth
which i would never get my 697 back , but i wish to get my money back as
close as possible. here is the describtion of the package...

nishika 3d camera it takes very good picture , never been opended
or used. it came with wide angle flesh , carring
case , film , and a instruction video. it has four
lens and created a 3d effect on a regular 35mm
film.

jewelry it came with the package as additional gift.

bahama vacation voucher the voucher is good for two rt airfare to freeport.
the users get a special hotel rate of 27 per person
per night. meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is
not included.

las vegas , reno , orlando the voucher provides one rt airfare , and
hotel accomodation for 3 days 2 nights.
meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is not
included. the voucher is good for all 3
locations , but you ca n't travel to all 3
places at once.

cancun , mexico the voucher provides one rt airfare , and hotel
accomodation for 3 days 2 nights. meals and
ground transfer , hotel tax is not included as
usual.

i paid 697 for the whole package. so try not to be cold blooded when you
make your offer. details would be provided by request. i do wish to sell
the whole package at once. so if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers , i do n't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
if you are interested in the camera , you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift.

if you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards.
trust me , you would get the exactly the same package as i did. there is
only one award which will be given away. so do n't bother even to call them
back , if you are really interested , you could get it from me for a cheaper
price. and you could receive the package within a week ( i waited three
months to get my first and final packages). also , they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit
card company. so why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price.

if you are interested , please reply to me as soon as posible. i really
wish to get this over with. make me an offer , if i am confortable with
your offer , i would send the package by u.p.s. the next day morning.
more details could be given if you wish.

i have a 2190 that came off of a vs2000 that i would like to use on a pc.

since the 3b1 normally has only one hd , you would jumper betwwwn c1 to
select the first (possible) drive address if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3b1 , then jumper between 2c .

however , thad , you should note that he said that he would like to
use it on a 'pc' , not 'unix pc'. also note the strange cross posting (as he
probably did not) , so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends
to mount it on. if it is a pc (or clone) , then the 2c jumper would be
the correct choice.

i 've left the cross posting in effect , since i'm not sure which
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. )

computer equipment garage sale

i 've finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff
that is broken or not being used by me. i 've put together a list and
indicated what i think each item is worth. this is just my estimate , and i
am very open to any offers , including trades. i'm currently looking for
some cd roms that will work with a mac cd rom player cd caddies , hd floppy
disks , any used macintosh software , a 387 33mhz co processor , or basically
anything you have lying around (cans of soup , the neighbor 's cat , etc...)
make me an offer , no offer will be overlooked...
i really want to get rid of this stuff...

ok , here 's the list

52 meg 3.5 scsi hard drive. conner model cp 3150. i bought this from a guy
at a swap meet to use with my macintosh. unfortunately , i ca n't seem
to get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer. the
guy tested it with his pc , and printed out a copy of the norton disk
doctor report which says it has no bad sectors. (i 'll send you a copy)
i was dumb enough not to get his phone number , so i ca n't return it to
him. the drive has many jumpers on it , (which i do n't know how to set)
so maybe that 's the problem. i was quite disappointed that it did n't
work so i'm trying to minimize my losses. 45

52 meg 3.5 scsi hard drive. conner model cp 3150. same situation as above.
i bought both of these drives from the same guy. despite the different
model numbers they are the same exact drive. same report from ndd
(i have one for each drive) will be included. 45

40 meg sony 3.5 scsi hard drive. sony model srd2040a. the drive mechanism
is completely trashed. this hard drive was in my computer (mac se) and
had a stiction problem. well , repeated banging on the side of the
computer resulted in a head crash (yes , metal scraping metal) which
was not too pleasant to listen to. still the scsi controller
card is in good working order , and can be used for parts , or a
project. 20

65 meg seagate 5.25 hh scsi hard drive. model st 277n. i originally bought
this drive , because it had a small stiction problem , and i though that
i could fix it. well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine ,
and that it was a controller problem. (motor controller was n't sending
proper signals.) well , after taking the controller off the drive ,
looking at it , and putting it back together , i realized that i
accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the
drive to the controller. i tried to solder it , but i'm not that good
at soldering so i could n't do it. worked perfectly before i messed
up. i used it as a temporary drive when the sony (above) crashed on
me. also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications ,
worth well over 1000. (claris cad , ms word 5.0 , think c ,
excel , and many others)
i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable. you also get all
the software on the drive. (if you can accept being a pirate) i only
ask that you delete my data files from the drive. i was really angry
when i broke that connection , and then could n't fix it. i just do n't
have time to play with it any more. 65

at t isdn 7500 modem. this is for use on digital phone systems. if you know
what this is or would like technical information on it , let me know. i
have some tech documents on it. is supposed to be the same thing as an
at t digital phone , but without the phone part. it seems to be in
working order (passes self test perfectly ok). i have no idea how
this is worth... let me know if you 're interested.

motorola 68881 coprocessor. i have n't tested this one out yet , but if anyone
is interested i will get it tested out , to make sure that it works. i
had trouble using it with my accelerator board , but then i spoke to the
manufacturer of the board and found out it could n't be used without
another controller chip. when i was looking around to buy one new , the
prices were around 100. i will guarantee this to work. 65

cga card. half length. 8 bit. was n't working last time i checked (although
i think i was using a bad monitor) 5

5.25 360k floppy drive. ibm drive type 1355. guaranteed to work ,
because when i took it out of the pc , it was working ! 25

5.25 360k floppy drive. toshiba model number nd 08de a. guaranteed to
work. came out of same pc as above. 25

5.25 floppy drives. ca n't guarantee that these will work. i do n't
even know if they are low or high density drives. i do n't have
any method of testing them.
panasonic model number ju 455 5 acg. there 's another
number on it 2626 361723.
panasonic model number ju 475 2 agg. there 's also
another number on it h3649 101457
toshiba model number nd 08de. virtually identical to the one
above.
each drive 10

3.5 ps 2 drive. these things are proprietary , so i ca n't test it , but i
think it works. not sure if it 's high density or low density , but i
suppose someone who is looking for one would know. model number
dfl413c04a. i think these things are expensive to replace. 35

mfm hard drive controller cards. i 've got three of these , and i have no way
of testing them. two of them are 8 bit cards , and one is a sixteen bit
card with a floppy controller built in. 10 for the 8 bits 15 for
the 16 bit card w floppy.

interesting cable. seems to convert from a vga plug to an ega plug. that is ,
standard nine pin to vga 15 pin. made by hewlett packard. part no.
d1181 80020 10



i 've sold stuff like this before , and it was a huge success , with many
satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they did n't need anymore. i
usually ship through the u.s. postal service (have n't had any problems yet)
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated.

well , that 's all folks. as i said before , no offer will be refused. if you
can convince me to give ocit to you instead of throwing it out , try ! i hate
to throw away stuff...

cancun , mexico the voucher provides one rt airfare , and hotel

asking for 500 or best offer...

i paid 697 for the whole package. and it is too late for me to get the
refund. i would sell it for 500 for the whole package. details could be
provided by request. i do wish to sell the whole package at once. so if
you are just looking for the vacation vouchers , i do n't care if you
sell the camera to other for a higher price. if you are interested in
the camera , you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.

some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you
are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out
of five awards. trust me , you would get the exactly the same package as
i did. there is only one award which will be given away. so do n't
bother even to call them back , if you are really interested , you could
get it from me for a cheaper price. and you could receive the package
within a week ( i waited three months to get my first and final packages).
also , they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay
for the interest to the credit card company. so why spend more than you
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.

if you are interested , please reply to me as soon as posible. i really
wish to get this over with. make me an offer , if i am confortable with
your offer , i would send the package by u.p.s. the next day morning.
more details could be given if you wish.

agreed. i have yet to run into a problem in deals over the net
and i have bought things from cds (plenty ! ) to a full computer.
the only small problem that i have had was with ups rather than
the seller. besides , complaints are always what get the

car amplifiers for sale

i have 3 high end car amplifiers for sale

(2) old style rockford fosgate 150 's. these are great amps , and i 've never
had a minute 's trouble with either of them. i 've been running them on
high end for quite some time (front rear) and have been very pleased
with them in that setup , but i 've also run them on low end before , and
they perform quite well in that situation as well. i'm trying to sell
them because i'm considering upgrading to a rockford 650. i already
own a power 300 , and i 've always liked the way the 650 300 combo worked
in cars.

i'm asking 200.00 a piece , and list on them when i bought them was
375.00. if you 're interested in both of them , i 'd be willing to come
down on the price a little bit.


(1) precision power 2150. this great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150 ,
and looks brand new. the shroud is unscratched , and it works great.
this is a great low end amp because of it 's high power rating into
2 channels , however , i 've also had it running front or back high end
before where it did very well.

i'm asking 425.00 for this amp , but feel free to make me an offer on
it.

recently i got a case of hot shots '93 cards. unfortunately i had
not planned on keeping all of them. i sort of got stuck with the
case. (i'm not going to mention any names , though.)

so , i am trying to sell off most or all (minus a set for myself).

if you have any interest in a set , a box , or any singles , please let
me know.

the set has 250 cards. each card features a great looking woman in
various stages of dress. some nude , semi nude , lingerie , dressed.
99 percent are gorgeous , i feel.

there are 4 subsets

girl , girl , girls 1 through 9
promo cards 251 through 259 (also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9)
emperor 's all stars 269 through 277
stripping empress 260 through 268

also , i am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well.

oh , and lastly , i have a very few error cards and a few cards
that were originally intended to be used as card 1 , but the
company changed their mind. none of these cards are easy to get.

anyway , if you have some interest in any of these cards , please
drop me a line , as i am most eager to sell a bunch off.

oh , and if you are interested , i also have 1 set of hot shots '92
left , and about 2 sets of california dreaming cards as well.

and lastly , i have promo cards for all of the cards i have
mentioned , and holograms as well. not a lot , though.

i still have about 70 records left on hand , all in pristine condition
(except where noted) , quite a few out of print and more than a few
imports in the bunch.

rather than selling the majority for 3 4 each , i'm looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over usenet. i 'll also
trade for other records in very good condition that you 've replaced
with cd , as well as pre recorded videos on beta or vhs. in the past ,
i 've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list store price
(e.g. , 1 cd 1 movie in beta format ) to get around what you or i
might have originally paid (as if we can even remember ! ( )

at this time , i'm looking for a set of working aa nicad rechargable
batteries ... if you have some lying around , and they 're sound , rsvp !

so if you 're curious , rsvp for my list and if you see anything that
you like , send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff you 're selling ... thanks !

gld

i.e. , the imports and out of prints are also valued at 1 used cd

i once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records (list 81)
anybody got a nice , unused blender for making frozen margaritas \? (

ps there have been no additions since the last posting in february
the list has only shrunk as i 've made a few deals since.

i'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. the group is sanford townsend
the name of the album is 'smoke from a distant fire' (i think). this album
came out somewhere around 1975 76 , and i believe was the first album produced
by kenny loggins after he and jim messina broke up.

if you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it , great. if
you do n't want to part with it , but are willing to copy it onto cassette i 'd
love that too.

three esdi drives). i would consider a trade for a scsi dat tape drive.

this box would make a great bbs system or terminal server. it was originally
designed to service 40 active users , and up to 70 moderately active users.
this is not a pc ! it was designed to be a unix box from the start , and it 's
very fast and exceptionally reliable.

it 's dimensions are approximately 2.5' high (tower) , 8 wide and 2 deep.

i am not a company , thus this is not a commercial sale.

i purchased 256 t shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through.
we did n't have the time to sell the shirts. i have about 175 shirts
left and i am willing to sell them to you for 5.25 a piece (more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts ,
even in bulk) (that 's 918.75 for 175 shirts) these shirts are jim
morris t shirts. they are all 100 cotton and most have more than 4
colors. (they are clean and neatly folded in a box. if any happen to
be damaged i will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it , your option.) you could sell them for at least 8 to 15 a piece
(the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school
event or a organization. i realize it is a big investment , but it could
pay off big.

i would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at 5.50 a
shirt. i will pay shipping , but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power.

please help me. i do not have the time to sell these shirts and i need
the money. i am taking a big loss by selling this cheap. i will give
you jim morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices.

all prices are negotiable.

subject ensoniq sq 80 cross wave synthesizer for sale
originator rob@snoopy.msc.cornell.edu
organization cluttered but in order
lines 71


ensoniq sq 80 cross wave synthesizer
i have an sq 80 for sale. the sq 80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited on board sequencer. i bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more digital .
below are a list of features extracted from the owner 's manual
o eight voice polyphonic poly timbral synthesizer , capable of
playing eight different sounds at once , with dynamic stereo
panning for each voice
o voice section employing cross wave synthesis combine different
attack and sustain wave segments to create complex , dynamic sounds
o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source
o dynamic voice allocation each sequencer track midi channel has
access to all eight voices
o a full featured midi controller keyboard capable of sending eight
midi program and volume changes at once. keyboard is velocity
sensitive , and transmits receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.
o powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of
modulation sources and routings.
o a 3.5 floppy disk drive which writes reads ordinary ds dd disks
allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk. also has a ram cart slot
for patches that is compatible with esq 1 ram carts.
o does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable midi device
o 80 character fluorescent display and user friendly page driven
programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
o stereo line outs , and stereo headphone jack for private listening
o sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the esq 1
so that sounds and sequences created for the esq 1 can be played on
the sq 80.

this sq 80 has been the main midi controller in my studio for quite a while
now. it has performed ably in that role , and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time. the sq 80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind , and it works very well with my software sequencer
(wincake) in its multitimbral mode.

from a synthesis point of view , this machine is a hybrid. it uses looped
short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources , then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated dcf dca arrangement. the sq 80
is capable of great things because of its 4 pole analog lowpass filter.
simply put , it makes fabulous analog synth sounds. but unlike most
good analog synths , it has a very thorough midi implementation so that it
works very well with a midi sequencer. what i really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.
this sq 80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1 21 88). it does have
an 8 track sequencer , but like most on board sequencers , it is a pain
to use so i have avoided it.

reason for sale
i am selling my sq 80 because i recently joined forces with another individual
here in boston , and we have more keyboards than space to put them. i
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard.

pricing and terms
i paid 1300.00 for this synth a few years ago. i am willing to accept
650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is 733.00). i will include a bunch of
patches on sq 80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth , as well as the
original ensoniq sq 80 owner 's manual.

i just received a music software winsong for windows and found that it needs
a midi sound card (sound blaster pro is preferred) to have its fantastic
features show up. as i do n't have the plan to add a sound card now , i am
putting it here for sale. it 's listed 79.95 on april issue of windows
magazine and i paid 84.95 as the total. i am asking around 70 with shipping
included.

winsong for windows

composer , sequencer (tape deck) , and juke box all in one.

it 's a word processor for music you can write and edit (cut , paste , move
and copy , etc) notes and symbols , play and print your composition.

it 's graphical user interface works like a multi track tape recorder.
up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play , record , rewind , fast forward
and stop.

it plays music on any midi compatible instrument piano , guitar , drum set ,
saxophone , clarinet , organ , and many.

you do not need to be a musician to use this software. the on line manual
is handy. for musicians , it 's great as writing music is not a tedious and
stifling aspect.

almost new (one week old) , unregistered
70 (including shipping) obo (please be reasonable)

this is a great little amplifier that i picked up as a demo model at lechmere
last spring , and never got a chance to install. it 's been tested , and it
works great...a perfect amplifier for adding 4 speaker power to a system , or
for powering mids or tweets...whatever. mounted on a board , complete with a
rs 15 amp noise filter , with all connections made to barrier strips for easy
screw type contacts. lists new in crutchfield for 129 , am asking

this to , l is an exceptional unit which i found extremely useful back in the
days when i had a car to put a stereo in. two sets of rca type inputs (f r) , and three sets of outputs (f r sub) each output with seperate level control.
variable low boost control ( 10 db@40 hz) for extending low bass , and seperate high and low pass crossover points make this a great unit for anybody who 's

sounds a little odd but i sold an amiga hand scanner to
an elementary school teacher in south florida (miami , i
think) but i have just recently found that i still have
the scanner manual. the original shipment included the
software manual , disks , packaging , etc.

basically , i have since lost the name address of the
person i sold it to...and i would like to get it to him.

if that person sees this , please send me an email to

dlneal@cbda9.apgea.army.mil

thanx , and sorry for taking up net space.
