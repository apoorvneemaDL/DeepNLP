this was no move fuck up. a helicoptor was thermal imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.

did anyone notice any helicopters equipped with thermal imaging
equipment \? they usually manifest themselves in a turret in the front
of the helo , or a sphere on top of the rotor with optical elements.

i did n't notice any uh 1s or other helos equipped as such. did they
use handheld military thermal scanners \? if so , there is no recording
capability , and hence the credibility of the report is subject to
human error.

i came across the following notice in the denver post classified secctio

this morning (april 26 , 1993)

begin quote

notice

the denver post will no longer knowingly accept any advertisement to buy
or sell assault weapons. the denver post finds that the use of assault
weapons poses a threat to the health , safety , and security of its reader
.

end quote

now i suppose the post is within its rights to refuse such ads. however

the second sentence is so noxious , i feel compelled to bring it to the
attention of the t.p.g c.g readership.

i called the post classified number (825 2525) and expressed my displeas
re.
according to the supervisor i spoke to , the post was reacting to public
complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads. however , she sai

the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy. i
strongly encourage denver post readers to call and make their feelings k
own.

will do ! i appreciate the thoughtfullness of the post to not be an
intermediary for such sales. the right to bear arms is one of the most
misapplied rights in our constitution , and assault weapons go way beyond
what is , or rather should be (imho) , a natural right in america. just
ask the family of that boy shot back in september the papers are full of
stories about a child with an assult weapon with a angelic face (post)
who committed the murder without ever thinking.

this has all got to get under control. i applaud the post for their bravery

from a.p. according to numerous accounts by those in the compound ,
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane
tank , and turning over numerous gas lanterns.

if there was a large propane tank , and it was breached , do n't
you think that there would be an identifiable explosion \?

there was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that i
saw , however propane is interesting stuff. it does n't explode on contact with
air. it is possible for a tank to rupture without exploding. far more
likely , however , is that the compound was equipped with ng outlets running to
the tank. damage from the cev 's could have ruptured the gas lines , allowing
the gas to spread , unnoticed in the cs fumes and general excitement (propane
typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason to smell
leaks) , until reaching a flame or spark , and then whooosh ! fire everywhere ,
and maybe an explosion. use of ng is pretty common in texas , especially
semi rural areas.

further , the bd members have as much reason to lie as the
gov't.

this is true , but so far the fbi batf track record on this incident is very
bad.

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept
the governments story , despite much evidence to the contrary.

the only evidence that exists right now (at least what we know
about) is various claims and counter claims. i'm waiting until
the hard evidence is released. what about you \?

i think it would have disarmed many people if the fbi followed this same
policy. they have not. they are making claims without evidence , and what
evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.

i have heard many opinions on this subject and would like to hear more from
the people on the net.

say you 're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody. you
give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their
action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them. my question is
what do you do \? should you stay and wait for the cops or should you
collect your brass (if you 're using a semi auto) and get out of there
(provided of course you do n't think that you have been seen) \? what kind
of laws are on the books regarding this type of situation \? what would
be the most likely thing to happen to you if you stayed and waited and
it was a first offense \? what would happen if you took off but someone
saw you and you were caught \?

anyone \?


jason u28037@uicvm.cc.uic.edu


if in said situation. i would , reviewing other cases i 've seen reported
on in the articles i 've read etc.. , suggest the safest legal course of action
is as follows. warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a
weapon(yes ! even though it 's blatantly obvious now that you have it out ! )
and that you will shoot him if he advances does not cease whatever hostile
action he is currently involved in.( ie drop the knife or i 'll shoot ! )
repeat this process three times , if you can ! (not if he 's pointing a freaking
gun at you himself ! that 's kinda impractical.) (there are variables here and
i will try to address them in turn) after said warning (considering it 's
ignored) aim center mass and fire until he drops ! this is not sadism , it 's
practicality.if he has n't gone down he 's still a threat ! (why i support .45)
if he turns and runs do not pursue or fire at his back ! shot's fired in anger
will burn you later ! (though in some cases the i can see where that might not
bother me all that much ! ) if you do drop him ! remain where you are ! have a
bystander or witness(or create one by yelling at the top of your lungs ! )
call the police , and wait ! reholster your weapon visibly ! or place it on
the ground nearby. do not attempt to recollect your brass.the police will
use it 's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and
that of any witnesses. mentally mark witnesses ! if the police say that none
came forward let them know who you saw ! attempt to keep your weapon loaded
with the minimum required(how the hell can i phrase this \? ) try to avoid special
purpose ammunition. hollow points and hydrashock rounds give the opposing
lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to sawy the jury that you
fully intended to kill someone ! the only special purpose rounds that i can
think of that would actually help your case (as it has in several) is the
glaser safety slug (oh what a lovely name safety slug) the stated purpose
and stated design parameters of the round are life savers in court.
(ie. attempting to create a bullet which will not overpenetrate , not
ricochette , and which is designed to stop (not kill (gee , to bad the two often
cross , damn i'm real sorry that rapist is dead ! not ! ) an assailant with
one shot. this , again , can be a real life saver in a hostile court.
be as cooperative with the police as possible ! show them where you were.
repeat your information as often as requested. they will often ask you the
same questions over and over to verify facts , and , unfortunately , to see
if your lying. fill out all statements and show all required identification
and weapon permits (booo ! down with registered citizens ! register your
politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated ! ) if they are
required in your state. contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to
hold you or that further questioning is needed. if you cannot afford one ,
contact the nra. they have a legal assistance fund.(or at least they used to)
i do hope your a member ! (not my business either way though..) if i was
vague on anything , or i left some questions unanswered , you can e mail
me or post here. (preferebly e mail. i do n't have a load of time to review
the news)

the reason the fire department could n't fight the fire is that bullets were
whizzing throughout the area. had koresh not had such a frightenly large
arsenal maybe the feds would not have decided that having the firedepartment
on the scene would have been a useless waste of taxes and potentially
dangerous had a different fire broken out in waco

so , how come the fire department had been at the compound area for
49 days , only to be sent away two days before the fbi attack \?

(whatever the above comment has to do with the hazards of fighting a
fire in the midst of ammo cooking off...)
maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about
being diverted from their other duties , and the fbi said fine. go home

the lies of texas

okay , what have we learned \?

for reasons still being kept secret , a federal agency already known
well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative
committees over the years for a longstanding , violent disregard
of the law , invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and
personal habits they abominate , violating his rights under the
first , second , fourth , fifth , ninth , and fourteenth amendments to
the constitution.

the man and his followers fight back , killing four of the outlaw
agency 's minions , wounding many more , and suffering their own
losses in the process. the agency responds by cutting off his
electricity , water , and especially his contact with the outside
world. they are then free to say anything at all about him in
pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency
finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit
eager to gain credit for straightening out the mess and , more
importantly , to script his side of the subsequent negotiations
any way they please.

the impasse lasts almost two months , ironically , at the same time
four l.a. cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a
single individual , sparking one of the ugliest riots in history.
armored vehicles surround the house , already ringed with snipers
using scoped , high powered rifles. loudspeakers playing obnoxious
records at the highest possible volume , and searchlights , deprive
those in the house of sleep (in the aftermath , nobody in authority
will mention the effect this technique , originated by north korean
communists as a battle tactic , may have had on their judgment).

finally another irony on the 50th anniversary of the rising
of the warsaw ghetto , some of the armor punches holes in the house
and gas of some kind is injected. the house bursts into flame and
is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. at least 80 lives ,
including those of more than a dozen children , are snuffed out.

spokesmen for the outlaw agencies , the attorney general , and the
president all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme
blame the victim.

he had illegal weapons as soon as they can be prepared in a
secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being
examined by the agency that created them. he was abusing children
the tapes will be stored with the data on the jfk assassination.
he set the fire our snipers saw him doing it. film at 11 in
3000 a.d. he shot his followers who tried to escape or was that
jim jones \? best of all , he 's dead he ca n't say a damn thing to
embarrass us , any more than when his contact with the world was
severed at the start of the whole travesty.

a leading national paper claims 93 of the american people believe
that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow
responsible for everything that resulted. but when did you ever
know 93 of americans to agree on anything does n't this sound
more like the outcome of a soviet election than an opinion poll \?

very well , what can we infer from the above \? for starters , never
forget that , although democratic careers are on the line (and
rightfully so) over this fiasco , by the outlaw agency 's admission ,
it was planned and rehearsed by a republican administration. which
may explain why paul harvey , who evidently used up all his courage
and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time i did)
about the war in viet nam has been acting as little more than a
mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the bill of rights.

more importantly , when rush limbaugh , who 's been a quivering tower
of jello during the whole thing , takes essentially the same stance
as bill clinton , it 's time for fundamental changes , if not in the
system , then at least within yourself.

on march 5 , back at the beginning , mary gingell , national chair of
the libertarian party , issued a press release condemning the outlaw
agency and calling for its abolition. in fact , the lp has promised
in its platform since 1977 , for at least 16 years , to abolish both
agencies involved in waco. i'm proud to say i was there and helped
to write that plank.

true , the lp is tiny and insignificant (although less so than in
1977 ask the democrats in georgia if you doubt it). but , alone
in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their
behinds with phony polls and big lies , the lp is right about what
happened in waco. and if their advice had been followed in 1977 ,
waco never would have happened.

think about it. and think about the fact that , if you 've had enough
of political parties more interested in collecting and holding
power at whatever cost to the bill of rights , let alone human
life than in defending and expanding individual liberty , maybe
the change it 's time for within yourself is to make the lp less
tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote.

think about it.

flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires. a fire will
start small and in one location and heat the air. the temperature in
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches
fire at once.

this may have occurred in the bd compound , i have heard reports that
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed
by those outside the compound. when the fire got big enough , and
broke through the walls , it appeared to be started in two places but
was really one big fire.

the houston chronicle last thursday (maybe wednesday) said that
the interior of walls had been covered with hay bales to help
protect against bullets. many of you know how fast dry hay
burns.

because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.
when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them
to escape. they were trapped by the flames in their safe room.

in addition , the gas is specifically designed to force eyes
closed and the victim to vomit. how fast could you leave your
burning office or home if your eyes were closed and you were
retching violently \?

i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final
assault. i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show
their agents of the the fbi overcoming the forces of evil , aka
the branch davidians. the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove
that they were not using excessive force.

they did have the proper equipment. the problem is that they went about
things the wrong way. the atf should have served the warrant in a
peacable manner instead of going in there like a bunch of rambos with
guns blazing. i'm not trying to excuse what david koresh did. i'm
just saying that the atf (henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops )
went about the raid in an improper manner.

the batf needs more people , better weapons and more armored
transports. when they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
more force instead of retreating to a stand off. if you are going to
do a job then do it right. the batf is there to protect us and they
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.

let the fbi , customs , and local police officers do the atf 's job. we
don't need them anymore ! ! ! the cigarette cops are just leftovers
from prohibition days. they are an anachronism !

with the wod and the increased crime in the streets the batf is needed
more now then ever. if they blast away a few good fokes then that is
the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. look
at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country
of ours.

including you \? what if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and
cut you in half with a machine gun \? this could actually happen.
maybe they get the wrong address and then raid your home , for example.
it 's happened before and it can happen again . i have heard of more
than one instance of a no knock raid going sour. just recently i
heard about a case in which police raided this guy 's home because they
thought he had dope or something. the guy blew both of the officers
away and he did n't go to jail for it. the judge hearing the case
ruled that the man was acting in self defense.

with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with
mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few
women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn
to death 51 days later.

are you sure that that would have been the way to go \? surely the fbi
and atf could have handled this fiasco better. they did n't have to
massacre all those people. as stimpy said in fake dad , shame , shame ,
double shame ! the fbi and atf should be ashamed of theirselves.

it looks to me as the batf and fbi ca n't handle situations like this.

it looks that way to me , too. but you have to understand that it 's not
the first time they have instigated raids like these. the most recent
one also ended up in a long standoff , but it was n't quite as public
as this one , and they did n't kill quite as many people. maybe this
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more

the way it went reminds me of 'stun' bomb beeing dropped on a house

i do n't remember the figures exactly , but there were about 3500 deaths in texas
in 1991 that was caused by guns.....

that includes suicides. since it has been shown in other countries that
suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for
doing oneself in (studies include some done published in japan , canada ,
austria , norway) , suicides ought not be included in the count.

if this is done , the number of vehicle related deaths greatly exceeds that
of firearms related deaths in texas.

i should not suffer because of others....

certainly not.

we all agree on this one , but we also live in a sociaty and therefor
we 'll have to give up some of our 'freedom' (note the '').

why \? unless it 's doing something that directly hurts someone else , what 's
the point \? (otherwise , you 'd better stop operating all motor vehicles , since
the price of operating them greatly exceeds the cost in lives of firearms.

one state (do n't remember which , texas \? \? ) tried to impose a rule that you could
only buy one gun each month. think you all know what happened.....

well , it 's been done at least twice. south (north \? ) carolina did it a few
years back...and watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country
rise quite a bit.

virginia just passed the law...no word yet on what the results will be , but
i 'd be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates wo n't be one of them.

i respect the right to defend yourself , but that right should not inflict on
other people.

self defense does n't inflict on other people (except perhaps the criminal
who 's tried to do you damage , and maybe indirectly on future potential victims
who might not become victims).

wrong about the whole guns for protection mindset , it ignores the
systemic effects of cumulative individual actions. if you want fire
insurance on your house that 's prudent and it has no effect on me but
if you and a bunch of other paranoids are packing handguns in the
backcountry it makes me , and anyone else who does n't chose to protect
himself in this manner , pretty f king nervous.

why \? if you 're not a threat , you 're not affected at all.


aha. that 's the part that makes me nervous too. who gets to decide if
i am a threat \?

when i might possibly be on the receiving end of a violent gesture ,
then i get to decide for myself. if someone does not like it , too
bad. i would be doing exactly what you or any other living creature
would do in terms of evaluation. what 's the big deal \?

based on appearance \?

sometimes.

would someone feel more threatened when approached by a very dirty , smelly ,
slightly maniacal looking person with a slight glaze to the eyes , muttering
to himself \?

i might.

does n't this describe most backpackers after they 've been out more than a
couple of days \?

not in my experience. and let us not forget that context is often an
important factor in evaluating a situation. seeing disheveled persons
on a hiking trail is not likely to be evaluated equally with meeting
a grimey sort , as described above , on a lonely city street at 3 am.
anyone that cannot properly discriminate between these two different
situations is legitimate fodder for the old survival of the fittest
principle.

or based on something else \? proximity \? no room to pass on the trail
without getting real close to someone. an inner sense \? now i'm really
getting nervous.

sounds like you doubt your own abilities. you sound pretty
typical in this respect. you also seem to think that you 'll
be safe or safer if others are unarmed. this is dangerous
fantasy.

twice when i was hiking the a.t. i came up on a shelter that i was planning
on staying at and saw someone sitting there cleaning his gun. softly i backed
away , and hiked another 5 miles to get out of there . i 'll freely admit it here
i'm not afraid of guns i'm afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry.

then you are in need of some form of therapy. not necessarily that
of an analyst , but maybe you should learn about guns. your fear is
seems to be based in ignorance and false knowledge. you see a person
with a gun and you feel threatened. why is this so \? have you any
legitimate basis for this \? any first hand experience that lends
validity to your fears \? or are your fears based on mediated experience ,
i.e. the anecdotes of others such as network news \? i trust you can
see the lack of legitimacy in such mediated inputs \?

and why are you afraid of the people as mentioned above \? forgive me ,
but you sound afraid to the point of paranoia. perhaps you should talk
to someone about this. i am not saying this to be rude or fascetious ,
but i think anyone with fear as deep and baseless as yours seems to
be needs some sort of help. living in fear really sucks , even if it
is only when around people with guns in the back country.

tell me would you be as fearful of a park ranger who was right in

oh \? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places \?
in particular , three different places where there were no apv 's \?

the crushed remains of a pressurized propane tank were found in the ruins
of the bd compound. the key word is pressurized. when that baby was
crushed , the gas would have gone all over the place. and when ignited ,
would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the tv
news. ammo does n't go up all at once kind of like fireworks going off.
propane gas goes off in a big fireball. gee , that 's kind of consistent
with what the pictorial history shows. hmmmmm...

and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying
to get out of the compound \?

remember , pressurized gas. people all over the building.
conflagration in less than a minute. huge explosion. gas masks being
worn by the inhabitants. makes a lot of sense that very few of those
on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged. if they
thought it was just a normal fire , they would probably be trying to
put it out. then boom the fireball. after that explosion and
concussion , i doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable
of moving.

and besides... oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering.

good question. take an objective look at what happened , listen to the
things that the fbi said ( the bd 's started the fire. the bd 's bodies
were found with gunshot wounds. ) that are now being refuted by the
evidence being recovered. seems that the fbi is deliberately making
statements that have no rational basis in fact , and trying to make
them sound like fact.

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the
contrary. thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under
the bush administration. what would your answer be then \? would you still
prefer to believe the cultists \?

yes , i would still believe that the fbi and the batf were on a non stop
string of lies and half truths. this is consistent with their operations
on numerous occasions.

and as for the bd 's being murderous , they did not cause any problems until
they were assaulted by the batf. so now a thought experiment for you if
the batf had never stormed that farm , would four agents and 90 bd 's be
dead today \?

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge.)

but then
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that
his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected \?

yes. that is how politicians are elected. kind of scary , is n't it. now
if we as a people actually held mr. clinton to his promises instead of
apologizing and denying that he ever made them , and actually expected
accountability by our government , i doubt that debacles like waco would
happen as often as they do.

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
people \? are they , like , just plain evil , or what \? did they just wake up
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states
to figure out who to oppress that day \? i'm eager to know.

acutally , no. the batf has a rather checkered history of staging raids of
this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.
oddly enough , their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after
the initial raid on the bd 's. coincidence \? i think not !

and as for the fire , what happened was caused by the act of knocking over
walls with an armored vehicle of destruction. the fbi tried to convince
the world it was suicide , but all of the facts that are coming out by
the investigation of the texas rangers and medical examiners point to
a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the
building. sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to
cover its ass.

and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader \? how is he
on diabolical laughter \? does he look good in a cape \? these things must be
investigated. you first.

oh , please. if you want to argue , argue. if you merely want to demean those
who see this differently than you , then please go somewhere else.

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under.

from the rkba archive , rkba.004

total firearm deaths for children ( 1 through 14) at 587 (1988) is
one of the smallest causes of deaths in children. cars , falls ,
burns , drowning , food ingestion are all much larger cause of
deaths (7 , 988).

so , firearms are the 6th leading cause , after drowning and choking on
food (at least for 1988).

sorry charles...according to the national safety council , accident facts , 1991
in 1990 , gun accidents were the fifth leading cause of accidental death
for children ages 14 and under.

i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents.
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths \?

the difference is that a rational person would address the leading
cause first , and address the lesser causes later.

that thinking is so screwed up , i do n't even know how to respond to it.
a rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths , and not attempt
to affect childhood falls , drownings , gunshot injuries , etc. \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \? \?
so this so called rational person , (using your definition) , if he or she
were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25
through 64 would only worry about cancer , and would not try to decrease
lesser causes such as heart disease , injuries , stroke , suicide , liver disease ,
chronic lung disease , homicide , hiv infection , or diabetes. oh , okay charles ,
that makes a lot of sense. i tell you what charles , i 'll call the heart
foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational
and that they can all go home because they are addressing the lesser causes
of death. and you call your local police homicide department , liver foundation
and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes.
please , quit wasting my time with this silly shit charles.

i 've got an idea charles , why do n't you start a talk.politics.caraccidents
group or talk.politics.fall group \? this is talk.politics.guns. do n't
confuse the issue. just because a social problem may not claim as many
victims as another , we should not try to address it \? i do n't agree.
i'm not posting to t.p.g to debate the supposed severity of causes of
childhood deaths. i am really getting frigging sick of having to respond
to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who
wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths
is trying to make a political issue out of it.


i assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.

a humane person who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old
would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm
ignorance is our greatest enemy.

again charles , you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context
for your own purposes. the statement that you responded to above is actually
in reference to a previous post by another person who , like you , expressed
concern over making youth gun violence a priority. i guess , maybe humane
person and rational person could be interchangeable huh \? both would be defined
as a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest
number of childhood deaths. if that is the case , i'm extremely glad that i
am inhumane and irrational.

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence

what other sources of information do you have which confirms their
data \? these folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts.
perhaps you can verify their data with the uniform crime report...

sorry charles , the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepresenting
the facts. but if you insist , according to the 1990 ucr , firearm murders
of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990

is the national center for health statistics good enough for you \? they state
that every day , 12 american children ages 19 and under are killed in gun
accidents , suicides , and homicides. many more are wounded .

or how about the national pediatric trauma registry \? they say gunshot
wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas
between 1987 and 1990.

do you also doubt the american academy of pediatrics charles \? \? \? they state
that gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300 from
1986 to 1988.

charles , i hope you do n't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly
victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns. if you do n't
realize this fact , (i do n't care if you go by cdc or fbi data , or if you go
into the homes , schools , and streets where these kids are and take a poll
by yourself) , i'm not going to bother to try to convince you. its obvious
that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion
and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political
discussion. i really do n't want to do that.

or the centers for disease control.

they have firearm statistics \? are firearms a disease \?

charles , it 's obvious that you know nothing about the cdc.
they do n't just study cancer and heart disease. i 've got news for you ,
interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic. in 1984 , surgeon general
c. everett koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health
problem as cancer , heart disease , or auto accidents.

that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.

in the lives of youths or in their schools \? i know a number of
youths who have firearms present in their lives . is is quite
appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms (this is a
presence , right \? ). what are you trying to say \? this innuendo
reminds me of listening to bill clinton.

who the f k said anything about teaching children to safely handle
firearm charles \? \? \? in the future , if you are going to post to t.p.g and jump
into a previous discussion , please read the entire posting , not just 1
sentence that you decide to respond to. what the hell are you saying here \? \? \?
you 're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control
issue out of a discussion that is n't.

the cphv reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year.

i would n't trust their statistics without independent verification.

the cdc estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990.

based on cphv statistics \? based on ucr \? ... based on what \?

the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access
to guns in their home.

therefore \? ... what is the purpose of this claim \?

charles buddy , i'm getting really tired of this. do you live on the planet
mars \? \? \? as a physicist , i realize that you probably do n't come into contact
with many youth , but i really think you need to make a trip to your local
urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools. in addition
spend a few minutes talking to these kids. ask them if they have ever heard
gunshots in their neighborhoods , whether they know anyone who has been shot ,
whether they know anyone who has a gun , whether they have ever held a gun , and
whether they themselves have ever been shot.

believe me charles , that will be your independent verification.

asked at any investigation into the batf 's and fbi 's participation
at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and , hopefully , wake
up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth
from the batf and fbi. my list is up to 13 that are really nagging
at my gut. the list will probably grow.

1. what were the contents of the original warrant , now sealed , that
the batf obtained \?

2. it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and or ammunition
could not be flushed down the toilet. therefore , a no knock
raid could be ruled out. prior to the initial assault on the
complex , did a single batf agent and accompanying witness (without
a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock
on the door of the branch davidian 's complex and serve the warrant
in a manner prescribed by law \?

3. on the day of the initial assault on the complex , batf agents
were aware that several small children were inside the buildings.
in the ensueing gun battle , batf agents fired into a building
known to contain children , killing at least one two year old child.
knowing children were present , why did n't the batf have an
alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to
the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening
fire and jeopardizing the lives of the children in the building \?

4. the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that
david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over
200 , 000 in firearms and ammunition. did david koresh and the
members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms
license , were they actively participating in the legal business
of selling buying firearms and ammunition , and were any of the
weapons they had illegally possessed \? does this paper evidence
consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally
dispossessed weapons.

5. after the original assault on the compound tragically failed ,
a batf spokeswoman stated we were outgunned ! . yet , tv newscasts
of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents
armed with mp 5 and ar 15 m16 rifles. although unclear on the
video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent 's
bodies , they also may have had ak 47 and sks rifles. what type(s)
of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the
scene of the original assault on the complex \?

6. since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the
complex involuntarily , why did the fbi treat it as a hostage
situation \?

7. along the same lines , why did the fbi use psychological warfare
techniques , including sensory overload , sleep deprivation , and
other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any
normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the
complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind \?

8. reports indicate several of the children inside the complex
were accompanied by their mothers. since it is reasonable
to expect these mothers would have their children taken away
from them if they came out , why did the fbi expect the mothers
to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities \?

9. agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch
davidians setting fire to the complex. branch davidian members
who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an
armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a
lantern which was setting on a table. video tape of the incident
does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the
fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location.
was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle
penetrated \?

10. fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and
the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide. yet ,
bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas
within the building complex. this seems to be counter to any
known mass suicides through history. what evidence does the fbi
have that a mass suicide pact existed \?

11. fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on
the video tape was caused by the branch davidian 's ammunition
and or powder cache exploding. yet , the fireball seems to be
more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas
or other highly volatile fuel source explodes. was any evidence
found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition
and or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball \? if so ,
and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were
engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms , was the
amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect
for someone engaged in such a legal business \?

12. it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical
news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to
crush a reporter 's car which had been left at the compound. is
there any factual basis to this rumor and , if so , what charges will
be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act \?

13. fbi director sessions states that , during the final assault on the
complex , over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles. on the video
tape of the incident , you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles
engines. yet , there is no sound of the sharp reports that one
would expect to hear if shots were fired. also , there are no
indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows ,
buildings or other structures in the video. surely , these should be
evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles.
finally , the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter ,
sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be
apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles. do
any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas
into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by
shots from high power rifles \?

14. cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent. the united
states has signed international treaties which prevent the use
of cs gas in warfare. if the united states could not morally use
cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops , why is it morally
acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land \?

15. on april 21 , fbi spokesmen state that at least 3 bodies discovered
in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had
been murdered or had committed suicide. on april 22 , the county
coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet
wounds to the head. were any of the victims bodies found within
the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head \?

law any deaths that occur as a result or during the

during the incident , and whoever committed the crime
establishing the incident is chargable for murder one.

started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall roof to collapse
knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the
burning building \?

assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about
by the tanks pushing on the walls (would shake a building pretty good)
perhaps they did n't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the
fire from the other side \? like they were surrounded by the fire , and
rubble , which finally (combined with teargas , and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them \?

in other words they were trapped by the flames , heat , fumes and rubble \?

a minor technical point unless a cartridge is contained (for example in the
chamber of a gun) when it goes off , very little of interest happens.....


quoting hatcher 's notebook
the sporting arms and ammunition manufactures' institute reported
a demonstration made by taking a large quantity of metallic
cartridges and shotgun shells and burning them in a fire of oil
soaked wood. the cartridges and shells exploded from time to
time , but there was no general explosion or throwing off of
bullets or shot to any distance.
throughout the test the men conducting it remained within 20 ft.
of the fire without being injured in any way..... the material
of which the cartridge and shells are composed will usually not
fly more than a few feet.
in tests conducted by the national rifle association , both rifle
and pistol cartridges were exploded by heat under an ordinary
corrugated pasteboard carton , and neither fragments of the
cartridge cases nor bullets penetrated the cardboard.


any scientists care to try this out in their kitchen \? )

here goes

more than a few years back (if you were born that year , you can legally drink) ,
we tried it out. we found an 8 ft. deep cistern that we lined with some 10 ft.
2x6s. we put a large can (one of those industrial sized pork'n beans cans)
stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom. after lighting the
fire , we lowered a box of .38 spc. swcs into the can. we heard pops , one solid
bang and several fizzzz shussss . after we thought the excitment was over , we
boldly climbed down to find that none of the bullets had left the can , several
of the shells were lieing around the bottom of the well and the boards had all
died of smoke inhalation. and 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers !

(b) thinks that the fbi and batf gave them more than enough time (51 days)

i take it that when something happens that is wrong it 's okay if

fine...you have the right to hold any opinion that you want to. but ,
let me ask you this are you outraged over this tragedy \? i hope
that you are , your opinions of david koresh and his followers not
withstanding. i know i am.

2) since batf chief higgens and janet reno were the 2 who signed off
on this plan , demand that they be fired !

actually , they should both be commended...

why \? i 'd be interested in hearing your reasons.

5) point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the
building , it came as a direct result of the actions of the fbi batf.
and the people inside (including 17 children) deserved a trial , instead
of this.

what i want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do \? i
can see it now...the 11 o'clock news... fbi and batf agents still
surround the waco compound after 451 days... i do n't think so. they gave
them every chance. they had 51 days to surrender to proper authorities.
they had attornies representing them , etc. koresh lied time and time again.
i do n't wish them dead but you ca n't let it stalemate forever. it was time
to do something and the fbi and batf did. what happened was unfortunate
but acceptable (as long as the fbi did n't set the fire intentionally).

today (wednesday). it was explained that two news photographers were found
on the compound earlier this morning without permission. it was explained
to the press corps. that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer
turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous
by a texas ranger surveying the site. ( ! )

the two photographers were said to be currently in jail and
the press were warned to follow the authorities' guidelines.
it was also emphasized that the survey of the crime scene at this
point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere.
the press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the
site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case.

that is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my
memory. i bring this up because i have n't seen anyone else note it
and i have n't seen the regular newscasts mention it. it will
probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow.

my opinions

i find this disturbing. while i believe that koresh is largely
responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the
last 51 days of patient opportunity , i find the secrecy surrounding the
aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.

since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are
already dead , the emphasis on the importance of building the court
case seems overblown to me.

it will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair. i have also
heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government
enforcement agencies which you will recall i have stated would be a good
idea in previous months.

please also note that i by no means endorse or agree with the many
conspiracy type theories i have read here and in other groups. as usual ,
i am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered
by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility , imho. as such ,
my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

what i would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident. i
believe the moves made were right and proper , but i still have some problems
with some of the tactics. after watching the abc special on it tonight , as
well as cnn and nightline , i question some of the atf and fbi actions.

my god , a sane person ! somebody asking intelligent questions rather
than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to nazi
germany. i question , along with others , the initial raid by the atf.
there are some definite questions needing answers.

1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at
some time before the feb. 28th raid \?

probably. which is why there are so many people angry at the
initial confrontation. why attack a compound with as many people in that
compound who are willing to die for their leader \? further , they attacked
in the daylight hours without proper backup , medical support , etc. that
was rather stupid...

2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

this i doubt. while i question the atf 's initial raid , i believe
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single
exception of the psychological warfare by blaring music , etc. i think
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome.

3) were fbi actions (blaring loudspeakers , etc.) the right course of action \?

see above...

and a few other questions. like i said , i believe the actions taken , in
general , were proper. but i still have some reservations.

agreed.

one other point , i'm no fan of janet reno , but i do like the way she had the
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility. seems like the waffle boy
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.

which is actually rather refreshing nowadays. most of the time , the
higher ups claim i do n't remember... or i had no involvement... )

obviously you missed my earlier posting about the physica of woodstoves.
in brief , you ca n't turn your woodstove on and off like your gas range.
it stays on all the time. it even stays on for over 24 hours after you
shut it off (which is why most working woodstoves are n't ever shut off

i am bothered by the suggestion of child abuse that janet reno
used several times last night , both on and off nightline as a de facto
justification for approving the raid. if that is to be used as a
justification of potentially lethal force attack on the compound , and
doing structural damage can fairly be called that , then that evidence
had better be quite strong. that seemed to be on ted kopel 's mind
last night.

reno stated that they had evidence of child abuse. she would
not say what it was. koresh 's now ex lawyer was inside the compound
repeatedly and told her to her face last night that he saw plenty of
happy children playing with their mothers and no signs of child abuse
whatsoever. no brooding silent children , no apparent bruising , and so
on. her reply to this was that child abuse is not always as evident
as that. true , but what better evidence could the fbi have had \? at
this point it seems difficult to see how the fbi could have had better
evidence than that seen by koresh 's lawyer who was an eye witness.

having lived in la and seen the media and authority feeding
frenzy that accompanied the mcmartin preschool debacle , i have seen
just how hot a button a child abuse charge can be. child abuse has
been used before by authorities as a justification to discard prudence.

i find janet reno 's repeated assertions of evidence of child
abuse rather curious. was n't the warrant issued for a supposed
weapons violation \? that certainly had nothing to do with child abuse.
are we to assume therefore that new evidence of child abuse arose
after the issuance of that warrant and the initial assault \? if so , i
fail to see now how that new evidence was gathered , and how it could
be better that on site eye witness evidence.

does that include the right to murder little children \? how about killing
atf officers \? i do not know much about the gun laws in texas , but
koresh 's folks claimed to have grenades , grenade launchers , and rocket
launchers. i am not sure that the nra feels that this falls under
right to bear arms.

if the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers , why
were n't they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house \?
all the media stated was that small arms (ie , ineffective) fire was used
against them.

i noticed that too. special agent (asshole actually) ricks stated that
david koresh had explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air. it looked like to me that the bds had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosives provided that they had them in the
first place. for example , when one of the tanks was injecting cs gas
into the ranch house (yes ranch house the bds were n't living in a
fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time. so , why did n't
they do this \? could it be that they did n't have any explosives or
similar munitions \? i just do n't buy what the atf and fbi have been
saying. hopefully , the truth will come out.

here 's something noteworthy after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurred just one explosion. the media said that
this was some of the explosives that the bds posessed going off. i
do n't think this was the case. my brother and i noticed that this
so called explosion resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.
we figure that this is what it was because of how the explosion
looked and sounded. obviously , it was n't due to something like tnt ,
dynamite , or c4. i have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this. also , i noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.

is n't it curious that the atf was n't very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed \? many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed and or wounded by grenades thrown
by the bds. earlier , when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents , they
said that an autopsy had been done but they weren't ready to release
the findings. now why is this \? does the atf have something to hide \?
perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire. what is the
cause of death exactly \? no one has ever said what it is.

what is certain is this atf agents did throw grenades into the
compound. as a matter of fact , mr. koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyer 's visits to the compound. later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body (i do n't know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw) to the atf. how much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear \? at this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the atf agents. would n't it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades , rockets ,
or explosives in the rubble \? the atf would sure have egg on their
face then. note that the atf is doing the initial sweep of the

this was posted by lyn bates to the firearms politics mailing list

i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk
at the harbard law school about the waco situation. (of course , this was
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy
conclusion.) so , yesterday i went to hear him. what follows is a rough
summary of what i think i heard him say , which should not be taken as
exactly what he actually said...

kates started by saying that since he did n't know any more about the fire
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before) , he would not
discuss that , but would concentrate on the original raid.

koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck. but so what \? this
is n't the first time that the leader of a new , small religious group has
been ridiculed by the public. extreme religious views nearly always fuel
hatred and mistrust. the first amendment applies , maybe especially , to
people like koresh.

lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us.
there were none until about 1830 , when they began in metropolitan areas.
police originally were not armed if they found a crime in progress , they
called local armed citizens to help. many began to carry arms for
protection despite regulations against them , eventually the laws were
changed to allow them to carry guns. the original intent was to have many
small police departments , jealous of one another and competitive , but not
large enough to be a threat to liberty , hence the plethora of
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard. when the
fbi was started , agents did not have the authority oto carry guns (they
were to be , after all , a bureau of investigation , not a police force).
all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that
power.

the batf started as a tax collection agency , whose primary job was to raid
illegal stills. when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners
no longer found their trade no longer profitable , many illegal stills
disappeared , and the batf needed something else to do to justify its
existence , so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores.
around the time when the batf 's annual budget is under review , the media
is alerted by the batf to come to such and such a place , where at a
pre arranged time , a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly. the media is n't
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork , but
if any irregularities are found , the media gets to cover the agents
removing armfuls of guns from the premises , and the luckless ffl in
chains.

the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf 's budget was up for
review.

kates' opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad , and
that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot
at , or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100
agents over open ground with no cover , for example) , and would have had
some medical personnel on hand.

he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh 's arrest
in connection with a murder charge , and the local sheriff called him on
the phone and explained about it. koresh sais , ok , come pick me up , and
the sheriff did , temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could
be tested. koresh was later cleared , release , and presumably got his guns
back. at least at that time , he was rational enough to be approached
rationally , and behaved in a reasonable manner.

the batf did n't take into account that , unlike most of the ffl 's they
audit , koresh was actually paranoid , and fostered paranoia in his
followers. thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them , and
they reacted accordingly.

with respect to the original warrant , it had not been unsealed when kates
was giving his talk , so he could not comment on it , except to mention that
the batf has been known to not double check the veractiy of their
informants , if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant. he had
more to say about the way the warrant was served , which may have been
completely illegal. apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to
knock on the door and announce that you 're an officer with a warrant for
thus and so if they do n't open the door and the evidence is flushable ,
then it is ok to break in the door. but since it is hard to flush guns
down the toilet , there may have been no justification for the batf
breaking in the way they did. if the constitutional rights of the
davidians were violated by an invalid warrant , or by an improperly served
warrant , then the davidians may have been justified in their actons. a
close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent may
have shot himself by accident when entering the building if so , this was
the first shot fired !

the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse. after an initial
position on the side of the batf , the media began to come around to the
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held
off a bad , possibly illegal attack. a real cynic might say that the fbi
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was
beginning to change sides , and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the
public 's sympathy.

should the batf be abolished \? no. police agencies should be numerous ,
diverse , inefficient , decentralized , etc. better a few inept accidents
like this , than a move toward a single , large , well organized ,
well trained , powerful , domestic police force , which would eventually have
even more tragic results.

okay , here is the result of my efforts. i'm just getting started with this
type of activity , so please set your flame thowers on low.

comments , corrections , suggestions , welcomed.



editor ,

i would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to
the right to keep and bear arms , and to a greater degree , the many other
rights that we take for granted on a daily basis.

1. you 're sleeping at night , when you hear someone in your house. you
call the police. how will you defend yourself , should the need arise , while
you are waiting for the police to arive \?

2. you are driving your family home when your car breaks down. a good
samaritan stops to help , when you find you and your family at gun point or
knife point. how will you defend yourself \? and your family \?

3. you are a woman walking alone to your car or home. a man appears
suddenly with the intent to rape you. how will you defend yourself \? are you
strong enough to fight off your attacker \? are you willing to let this man rape
you in order to survive the attack \?

if the house and senate have their way , we will soon not have the right to keep
and bear arms , as provided by the second amendment to the constitution. a gun
may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation , but are you going
to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to
defend yourself and your family \?

many times a situation may be diffused by just brandishing your handgun. if
certain members of the house and senate have their way , .25 , .32 , and 9mm
ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law
enforcement departments. very soon , you may not be able to purchase ammunition
for use in your handgun.

there is already a 15 day waiting period in california. do you really feel
that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for
the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened \?

our local police do an excellent job , but they can not be there all the time ,
or in a moments notice. you should have the right to protect yourself while
waiting for help to arrive.

there is currently legislation circulating in washington that would prohibit
the sale of certain types of ammuntion , handguns , rifles , and shot guns. one
elected official even wants to repeal the second amendment !

i want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected
officials decided that they should only belong to a certain church , or go to
church on a partiular day \? what if you were told that you could only read
certain books \? write about certain subjects \? what if you no longer had the
right to a jury of your peers \? how about the right to assemble in a peaceful
manner \?

these are all rights that are provided by our constitution and the amendments.
if we give up one right , we may as well give them all up. if you do not fight
for the right to keep and bear arms , what will you fight for \? when your life
is affected \? write your law makers now ! protect all of your rights by
defending your second amendment rights.

...gun buyback programs will hopefully

maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level
crime.

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on
any of these things \? evidence , please \?

please do n't misinterret what i was saying joe. i was making the point tha
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
of common incidents.

if you 're a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps
you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the
rate of accidental death from other single causes \? follow that perhaps
with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners
spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death
among children in the u.s. is a serious problem.

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under. i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents.
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths \?
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem \? i assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.

more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the
community. in that sense , i think they might do a little good.

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good.

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were
useful.


i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or
brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135 , 000 youths) are
obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often
borrowed from a parent without their knowledge.

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun)
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students
who carry a gun to school daily.

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence
or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
the cphv reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access
to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200 increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88. these are the statistics .



thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah (got news
for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours
presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they
were in danger).

holding kids \? time for a reality check , son. these kids were the
children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were
outside waiting to kill them. would you send your children out the door
if you believed as they did \?

okay , maybe i worded it wrong...dad. i meant that to put children in a
situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is
would not let innocent children die.
if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive \? thanks for the reality check joe , its been real.

flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires. a fire will
start small and in one location and heat the air. the temperature in
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches
fire at once.

this may have occurred in the bd compound , i have heard reports that
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed
by those outside the compound. when the fire got big enough , and
broke through the walls , it appeared to be started in two places but
was really one big fire.

because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas.
when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them
to escape. they were trapped by the flames in their safe room.

i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final
assault. i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show
their agents of the the fbi overcoming the forces of evil , aka
the branch davidians. the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove
that they were not using excessive force.

if you do n't affect the desire , you 're wasting your time , not to
mention the other costs incurred.

jim , i'm just saying how it is. i'm not saying if that is a good thing
or not. from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun
buyback programs , i get the impression that they really think they are
having an impact on the community.

good for them. i note that the tm folks make the same argument. if
you 'll pay their expesnses ( 21 million for a reasonable size city) ,
they promise to meditate away all crime , disease , etc. at least
they 're not promising to jail me if i do n't go along with their little
plan they 're going to just sit in a room and fly , leaving me alone.

gun violence whether its effective or not. look , if you ca n't measure
the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test
evaluation , what is the point \? it must be symbolic in nature.

ah , but we have evaluated gun control using before after and it
does n't work to reduce crime. what is the point \? we ca n't claim that
it is symbolic , as people do get jailed.

the police are
essentially saying look , if you have a gun lying around and you do n't
want it , we 'll give you 50 for it...because we care about the community .

no , they 're essentially saying we hope this will keep you from
noticing that we 're not doing anything useful . pissing away
resources is n't caring .

if you , i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.

nope , you 'll merely be ignored , as wright , rossi , and daly were after
finishing under the gun . they were supposed to prove that gun
control worked , so ....

jim , listen to me , i said i'm not religious whatsoever , do you understand \?

religion has nothing to do with this. i could care less what religion
they were okay \? to put children in that situation is wrong , pure and
simple. difference is good jim , i am the most progressive and diverse
person in the world. but , if different is allowing kids to be exposed
to tanks and tear gas , then yes jim , different is wrong.

so , who gassed them \? given their previous experience with thugs who

say you 're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody. you

in massachusetts , you will likely be arrested for murder , but

of threat of death or serious bodily harm , then the charges

then you will have a much harder time convincing cops judge jury

correction the fbi says that two of the nine who escaped said the fire
was deliberately set by cult members. since the press was kept miles away ,
we have absolutely no independent verification of any of the government 's
claims in this matter.

indeed. larry king had the two attorneys (whose clients are now
dead) of koresh and another davidian on his show last night. their
discussions with the survivors differ from the fbi account. the
attorneys say that they were told that the tanks knocked over lanterns
in the compound which started the fires.

government spokespeople have lied and contradicted each other
throughout this whole affair. i 'll wait for some better evidence before

not necessarily. if the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due
to the heat , a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.
in fire aftermaths , bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of
meat with little effort. medical examiners tend not to like cleaning up
such scenes.

as such , if the body had been suitably cooked , a bullet comming from a
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the
time of death , or much later , unless you were trained to look for the
evidence. texas rangers are not pathologists.

p.vasilion

this is quite corect , but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy
will show virtually no deformation , ie a hollow point probably would not
expand , an fmj would be pristene . also the bullets will not be marked
with the lands ang grooves of a barrel , because they did n't come out of
one. a good pathologist should be able to notice this right away.

let us hope that the me 's that handle these bodies are more competent
then the ones who did jfk 's body.

i 'd have a spot of tea with them. ) you probably gave up on arguing the
case for arms control directly long ago because posters who know
what they are talking about (e.g. , frank crary) disproved all your
arguments for why more gun control is needed. so , you gave up because
you know they are right and you could n't refute their answers.

no , frank crary 's arguments are based on the assumption that most people
are sane , normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. usenet as a whole
disproves it of humanity as a whole.

we now have proof positive that guns do n't make you safer. buy a lot of
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the fbi to burn
down your house. see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
to support gun control.

(not that i doubt it , i'm just looking for sources...)

this was reported in canadian papers thursday , 22 april i think the
source was upi , but do n't recall for certain.

it seems to me that if they did have this kind of info , they could
broadcast it and it would resolve (or at least help to resolve) alot
of doubt in people 's minds.

personally , the way the (fbi batf reno etc) is claiming all sorts of
things without offering one shred of proof (other than their good word )
is very suspicious to me. a picture is worth a thousand words...

i understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered ,
so we may learn more during their hearings.

i sincerely hope you are right and it turns out (with indisputable
proof broadcast across our land) that the government groups had nothing
to do with the fire. but until i see such proof , i think it is just as
likely that a tank did knock over a lantern as koresh torching the place.
the only evidence i have seen is a tank crashing through the front
wall , withdrawing , and seconds later flames are seen (the first flames
on the video) erupting from this very same spot. coincidence \? perhaps.

tough call without more investigation , but if the thermal imaging story
holds up , i think the government will be more credable... of course ,
paranoia fans wo n't believe their results anyway , will they \?

if such proof exists , the government should publish it and put all this
speculation to rest.

hear , hear ! i 'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports
that multiple victims were found shot (in the head) , and in positions
inconsistent with fire victims. it is simply too early to draw conclusions
either way about this nasty incident , but i tend to believe the government
side.

that really depends upon where you draw the line while defining
these weapons ,

this means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough. good.

very narrow. very , very narrow. if you 'll recall , i was the
nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia
weapons in certain situations. how can you possibly define what is a
weapon and what is n't is only the start of this.

and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of
modern practice five months or five centuries down the road.

i would hope so. let 's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
whose majority of energy comes from fission and or fusion of atomic
nuclei.

and you 've just described any civilian reactor because your
definition fails to note what energy is being considered. reactors
blow with a steam explosion , but the majority of energy still comes
from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant. see
what a can of worms this is \? last i heard , ft. calhoun station just
north of omaha , nebraska was n't considered a weapon. given the
sodium cooled breeder designs on the blocks now , i can easily envision
reactors being household appliances in under twenty years. with the
prism design , there is no operator input needed on the reactor
itself , and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can
be made equally as automatic in the future. so your definition is
flawed in a few respects already.

let 's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses
in such state , quantity , and with such a vector that they could cause
death or serious disease further defined to a significant number of
people if released in a city , similarly populated area , resevoir , or
cropland.

typhoid mary would likely fit this bill if she sneezed. if
you do n't mind extrapolation , any hiv positive person also fits this
bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of
spreading the virus. finally , that manure pile i mention below fits
this definition , as does , say , releasing a pet rattlesnake to the wild.

nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined. other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry. licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals.

and i can show where any such gas has other uses. for example ,
perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers. calcium carbide
is a rock that dissolves in water to produce aceteylne gas. it can
be used for welding , in miners lamps , for gassing gophers , or for
making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing. toss some in a
toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you 'll see that
it can also be a weapon , just like any other flammable substance.
so , now my miners lamps wo n't work , i ca n't do any welding , and i
still have those pesky gophers.

i am not a lawyer , but these ideas could certainly be a basis for
definitions.

the basis for , but i'm sure you see that the problem is not
in writing a law , it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and
extended beyond the point where it does any good.

i 'll give
you a little hint see that manure pile in the farmer 's field down the
road \? in the usa , that is a weapon of mass destruction ,

nope. it is not considered a weapon.

it is under your proposed law. so is a silage pit if there
is run off. so are underground fuel tanks.

biological in
nature , because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate
the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water. so ,
where do you draw the line \? in the usa , the epa has ruled that
a pile of scrap iron is illegal. care to draw a thinner line this time \?

it is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction. many things are
banned for other reasons.

it meets all the criterion of a weapon. it is an instrument that
can be used for fighting , even though that is not its intended purpose ,
and despite there being better weapons around. given that the aquifers
supply a significant part of the country with drinking water , mass
destruction is rather a given.

it 's not that certain weapons are n't something i 'd rather not
see a lot of people having. the problem is that it is nearly
impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some
pretext or another. the looser your definition , the more ripe for
abuse that law is. furthermore , if you get specific then the old
standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to
be added to , generally without going through the hassles of another
vote and public reading of the law. again , ripe for abuse.

and another survivor claims he heard someone shouting the fire 's

odd terminology. that 's what one says when you know a fire is planned ,
not
when one occurs by accident.


it 's also what you say when you 're waiting for the end to come in a
fiery apocalypse ...just a thought.

personally , if the fire was set (by either side) , i wonder about the
timing. if koresh co. set the fires , why wait through six hours of
wall bashing and tear gassing before starting was there anything new
that happened just around that point \? similarly , if the fbi were going
to torch the place (and fake it , of course) , why wait so long , would n't
it be more reasonable to believe the bd 's would set the fire early
after the assault began \?

the most plausible (to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting
of the fire by the tanks. among other things , i say that because i
was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter
(watching from a distance , of course) said that it looked like at least
one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously.
specifically , he said that one tank apparently was halfway (half of
the tank 's lenght) into the building where it previously had only been
penetrating a few feet.

reserving judgement ,

how is clinton responsible \? it was a law enforcement action.
granted , it was a nationally covered incident but clinton had no more to
do with the outcome than fred flintstone.

do i think clinton conceived of it \? no.
do i think clinton ordered it \? no.
do i think clinton was aware of it before it went down \? no.
do i think clinton was aware of it after it went down \? of course who was n't \?
do i think clinton prejudged these people to a certain extent because he
believed the batf crap about child abuse and stockpiling
evil semi automatic weapons \? yes.
do i think clinton ever questioned federal jurisdiction in this matter \? no.
do i think clinton ever considered the civil rights of the victims \? no.

as for the rest , i wo n't argue whether batf handled the initial
confrontation well (or as it should have). but from day 2 on , i have no
problem with the way the operation was handled or the decisions made.

some of us suspect that all the unlawful mistakes made on day 1 were made
on the government 's end. that makes days 2 51 nothing but a macho
alternative to delivering an apology.

as
for day 51 , as long as the fbi and batf did n't intentionally set the fire
then , while it is certainly tragic , the majority of americans (according
to a recent poll) have no problems with the operation itself.

who gives a good goddamn about some bullshit opinion poll of most
americans \? most americans swallow the government line that they 're fed
not because they 're stupid , but because it 's the only line they ever hear.

most americans thought the staff at the mcmaster( \? ) school was guilty ,
guilty , guilty. woops , turns out they were n't. most americans once
thought that black slaves were n't human beings. woops , wrong again.
most americans thought saddam hussein was the antichrist. oh dear ,
he was a special friend of the american government until two years
previously. you know , maybe truth isn't determined by majority vote
of a half informed public after all.

in fact ,
most americans (according to this poll) think it should have been
resolved sooner...

it 'll probably pass the house again , and will probably pass the

right on the money here. we should certainly applaud the disbanding of the

that 's the bd side of the story. the other is that d. koresh met
agents at the door with a weapon. remember the affidavit indicates
that koresh had spent 200 , 000 on assault weapons in the past year and
now we know that the 'bunker' adjacent to the house is thigh deep with
a million rounds of ammunition.



the news statement was that there was 200 , 000 worth of firearms
and ammunition (no mention of assault weapons ) on the premises ,
not that koresh had purchased them (what would his crime be if he
had \? ). this averages to about 2000 per person , not an astronomical
number.

we do n't know that there is a thigh deep pile of a million rounds...
we know that the fbi says there is a pile of a million rounds.

the branch davidians were not violent and were not planning to start
violence.

when the bd compound was assaulted by the atf the bd did fire back.
but they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the atf to care for
their wounded. the bd even released the atf agents they captured. it
is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the atf medical
attention that the bd were not looking for trouble.

if the bd were violent they would have held the atf agents as
hostages. they would not have released them like they did. if they
had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as bargening
chips for medical attention etc.

a big thing is being made of the bd collection of weapons but no one
has shown that they had any plans to use them. it is also apparent
that the bd did not have any military training. if they had , they
could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their
fortifications. they could have shot out the lights and speakers. it
appears that the bd were not violent , they shot back at the attacking
atf agents out of panic. there were shots fired on the last day but
they were in response to the fbi attack on the compound with armor.

all the violence in waco was initiated by the federal agents , not the
bd.

james , it could be that they were determined to stay together in the compound
no matter what happened. perhaps the fire was accidental , and the db simply
refused to leave the compod. perhap they died fighting the fire \? who knows.
we will have to wait and see. i persaonlly find it hard to believe that they
would all agree to burn themselves up ! what a horrible way to go.

jim shirreffs

i seem to recall graphic news file of buddhist monks setting themselves on fire
in the streets of saigon. yes , its a horrible way to go , but apparently not
so horrible that someone with enough religious conviction might not be able to
carry it through. and , since they 've discovered bullet wounds in a couple of
the bodies from the compound , there is the possiblity that those with the will power to self immolate also had the will power to take out the ones who had
less constitutional fortitude. then again , maybe the fbi ran in while the fire
was raging , executed those two , and ran out again.

from a.p. according to numerous accounts by those in the compound ,
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane

if there was a large propane tank , and it was breached , do n't

further , the bd members have as much reason to lie as the

medical examiners have found no bullet wounds , as was stated by the

they 'd only autopsied one body when this information was released.
i would n't doubt though


i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept

was it a 'no knock \? ' i really have n't heard anything on that. but clearly

it was a no knock , according to the associated press report.
here 's something i found in my collection

excerpts from an article in the knoxville news sentinel final
edition monday , march 1 , 1993 (the byline is associated press)

waco , texas fierce gun battles erupted sunday as more than 100
law officers tried to arrest the leader of a heavily armed
religious cult. at least four federal agents and two cult members
were reported killed. ...

the gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock
trailers stormed the sect 's head quarters sunday morning ,

witnesses said. the agents had warrants to search for guns and
explosives and to arrest howell , said les stanford of the atf in
washington. ...

witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound 's main home ,
throwing concussion grenades and screaming come out , while three

national guard helicopters approached. for a moment , there was no
response. then the shooting began.

i think storming the sect 's head quaters and throwing concussion
grenades qualifies as a no knock (or perhaps an illegal assault).

he was not just another guy minding his own business. hell , give them all
the guns in the world if they do n't bother anyone. but he was a scary sort ,
do n't you think \? the sort of person you 'd want your daughter to date \? i

probably not. but then again , neither are you.

then he fired on the atf. that 's not just a little mistake , or some
red white and blue american defending his home against big brother. that
shit does n't fly. anyone with his background that will shoot and kill

and just what is his background \? what prior crimes had he been
convicted of \?

federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade

sorry , batf are federal tax enforcement officials . they 're not
police , nor do they have police powers.

what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf. if they would of
had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the
compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.
the batf is a part of the dept. of treasury , not justice. if they needed
to assault a place they could just do like the irs does...call in the
federal marshalls service , their fugitive collection teams do similar type
assaults all the time. and they are very , very good about it , in both the
tactical and legal parts of it. but i suspect that the marshalls would
not have touched it , because the search warrant (which is still sealed i
believe) was so bogus.

besides the batf also could have gotton swat teams from federal marshalls
service fbi secret service national park service texas rangers nearby
large city police forces the military. but they had to use their own
guys , nobody elses swat team was good enough for the holy cause of gun
control.

i also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting.
initial raid two days before the nj senate was going to overturn their
assault weapon confiscation law a couple weeks before the batf 's budget
was going to come up in congress for review shortly after reno got
confirmed as ag (i do n't need to remind you about her anti gun line)
right around the presidents 100th day in office. as a wise man once
said once is happenstance , twice is coincidence , three times is enemy
action. i do n't believe that these four things are conincidental. do

national institute of justice
research in brief

november 1986

the armed criminal in america
by james d. wright

(1) legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct
sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.

only about one sixth of the gun owning felons obtained their most
recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a
licensed firearms dealer. the remainder five out of six
obtained them via informal , off the record transactions involving
friends and associates , family members , and various black market
outlets. the means of acquisition from these informal sources
included cash purchase , swaps and trades , borrowing and renting , and
often theft. the criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated
by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.

why gun waiting periods threaten public safety
by david b. kopel

the basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a bureau of alcohol ,
tobacco and firearms study of gun dealer sales in des moines and greenville.
the study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous
criminals. 51 in short , waiting periods have no statistically noticeable
impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns
are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.

51. bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms , assistant director of criminal
enforcement , memorandum to director , july 10 , 1975 (greenville survey of
20 , 047 names submitted to fbi for record checks , 68 had felony convictions

committed crimes in the distant past twenty seven buyers were prosecuted)

convictions , and .4 had violent convictions). bureau of alcohol , tobacco and
firearms , assistant director for criminal enforcement , memorandum to
director , may 8 , 1975 (of 374 records checked , 39 were purchasers with felony
records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or

the assault weapon panic
political correctness takes aim
at the constitution

by eric morgan and david kopel

testimony before congress revealed that most assault weapons in the
hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels. 97 the testimony
is consistent with the national institute of justice 's research findings
based on studies of felons in state prisons. the nu study , authored by
sociologists james d. wright and peter rossi found that only sixteen percent
of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (the
figures included purchases by legal surrogates , rather than directly by the
criminal.) wright and rossi , who had begun their research as firm proponents
of gun control , concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases , and
probably not even full scale gun prohibition , would reduce criminal use of
guns. wright and rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime
directly target the black market in criminal guns , and
leave the legitimate retail market alone. 98 not surprisingly , wright
believes that the consequences of current assault weapon legislation on
street violence are likely to be ineffective. 99 he warns that gun
controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of
criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new
business. 100

so far , the medical examiner (according to the news) has found no evidence

a bullet like they do when fired from a gun. the bullet hardly moves ,
it is the brass casing that goes flying , and then with less than lethal
force. it will hurt , yes , but not kill you i doubt if it wil penetrate

how about an independent investigation , with full subpoena powers , and
powers to prosecute on felony charges , to investigate for any possible
illegal criminal activity on the part of both the batf and fbi \? i
cannot see any reason why not to use the phrase they like to use

crimestrike hits town

with the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists
that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the
same column) , we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re
moving criminals from the streets the national rifle association 's
new crimestrike project , engineered by arizona 's former chief assist
ant attorney general steven j. twist.

crimestrike is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily
crime. it is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally ,
including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that arizona is
applying with its truth in sentencing law funding construction and
staffing of appropriate prison space ensuring that the system is
primed to punish serious youthful offenders strict attention to the
rights of victims and citizen and community involvement.

phoenix will be the home for this national organization.

the gazette has vigorously opposed many nra policies on issues of gun
control , and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek
reasonable regulation of firearms.

but crimestrike is an appropriate creation , a response to a clear
need for more robust vigilance in holding legislators and judges ac
countable when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals.

when an organization has an issue , it has an issue , and crime
strike has it especially when it is willing to direct its dollars
to getting criminals off the street.

we say , welcome to town.

for the moment , forget about batf incompetence or fbi hubris. did
anybody catch rep. charles shumer on the news last night holding up
a .50 bmg cartridge and rhetorically asking if anybody should be allowed
to own one of these. (i presume he meant the rifle for which it is chambered
and not the cartridge which you can get for a buck.)

so what 's your guess for the upcoming anti gun agenda

1. a ban on heavy caliber rifles. (read .50 bmg)

2. a ban on sniper rifles

3. a ban on stockpiling guns and ammunition.


btw shumer is perhaps the most misinformed congressman i have seen on
the news. i wonder how he finds the floor in the morning.

shumer is not mis informed , he knows full well what he is doing.

if you look at his other votes , and positions as an agent of redistribution

are incompatible with his obvious world view. they are a threat to the

much of the dispute about the origin of the fire that destroyed the
bd compound could be settled by examining the propane tank supposedly
crushed by one of the army tanks when they breached the walls of the
compound. if the the propane tank is flattened and has tread marks on it ,
then the bd 's version of the cause of the fire would seem to be
verified.

the u.s. government has become a garrotte around the necks of its
citizens. just as with a garrotte , the more people struggle to breathe
the air of freedom , the more the government tightens its stranglehold. the
only possible outcomes at this point are the death of government or the
elimination of personal freedom.

lds and rlds
philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
church as set down by jesus , but that god will judge each on his
own merits. in addition , the rlds also contend (and the lds may
as well) that ignorance of the true way (tm) is an excuse. you
can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
it. in short , lds and rlds suffer everybody from lutherans to
buddhists , secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
will not be penalized for ignorance.


i believe that this is not quite correct. my understanding is that lds is
engaged on a project to convert the souls of deceased persons of other
religions , in order to spare them from damnation and gain them entrance into
heaven. to this end , the church has compiled extensive genaeological records , so
that they will know the names of people to convert. a long article in the new
yorker a few years ago described the lds research methods in some detail (for
example , some researchers pay visits to local native storytellers to learn the
names of people long dead). this sounds like just the sort of lie that would be
made up about any unusual religion , but the new yorker story convinced me that
there is some truth to it (the new yorker used to do extensive fact checking , and
the story was quite detailed).

the b.b.c. news is also reporting that about 20 of those that died
were british citizens.

the b.b.c. are also reporting that bodies of b d members were found
with bullet wounds in a manner that suggests they may have been shot

there is a possibility that these are the bodies of people killed during
the initial shootout.

can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes \? bullets go flying
every
where. imho , these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines
went up. a texas ranger does not a pathologist make , so i 'll wait for an
autopsy to determine if they were shot first.


i would doubt bullets would go flying. there is no particular force to make
the bullet leave the scene of a cartridge going off outside of a barrel. the
brass shell would burst too soon to give the bullet any real velocity. i
would n't want to be near it , but i do not think bullet wounds would result.
shrapnel wounds would be more likely

at least this is my understanding.

not necessarily. if the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due
to the heat , a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.
in fire aftermaths , bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of
meat with little effort. medical examiners tend not to like cleaning up
such scenes.

as such , if the body had been suitably cooked , a bullet comming from a
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the
time of death , or much later , unless you were trained to look for the
evidence. texas rangers are not pathologists.



either way , they 're all dead and the fbi atty. gen. vampria are still
responsable.

yep , at least in large part.

the tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people

dear , dear. they could have come out.

then by your logic , the jews in europe in the 1930 's were the cause for
the holocaust. hitler told them to leave and because they did n't they
brought the whole thing on themselves. because as you say , they could
have come out of germany.

there was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his
aids after the tank invasion (referring to any kind of suicide
pact or counter assault efforts.)


it 's ultimately irrelevant who lit the fire. they had ample opportunity
to leave.

same for the jews in europe 1930 's.

while he was there. anyway , outsiders rarely see abuse. it 's a secretive
thing. all we have to go on are the court documents in the jewell case
and the mistrial in california.

you do n't see any evidence of the abuse therefore it must be taking place \?
as you point out everwhere but here , it is irrelevant to this case. the
atf is not in charge of investigating child abuse.

no one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any
time. the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their
own choices.

exactly. by their own choice.

in obvious contradiction to the statements made by the f. b. i.

i have never judged them by their religion , but by their actions.

and just what are those actions that you are judging them by \?
their refusal to let the government control their lives \? their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws \? their refusal to behave like
cowards \? some of texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the alamo. after all , all they had to do was
come out. they stayed as you say by their own choice . problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds. but as you point out , they certainly do have
that right.

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would
have been no raid , no siege , and no deaths. instead , they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not
irrational. the first was to stockpile weapons. the second was to
shoot federal agents. the third was to stay inside.

bull. they did , in fact , live a quiet , religious life as they claimed.
the warrant was not issued because they stockpiled weapons . it is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want yet (except in
virginia).the warrant was issued for some gun parts that are about the size
of a half dollar. certainly worth the lives of so many people , do n't you
think \?

just as we do n't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
weapon at him , i do n't think the fbi deserves blame in this case.

oh \? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places \?
in particular , three different places where there were no apv 's \?


well , i only saw it start in one place. a tank punched a hole in a wall ,
and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that
a 30 mph wind was blowing. i saw a diagram in usa today yesterday , and
fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made. a terrible , negligent
accident.


and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying
to get out of the compound \?


maybe they could n't. i 've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive
in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire , but it happens all the time.
what if they were in sealed rooms , trying to avoid the gas , and did n't know
about the fire until it surrounded them \? remember the israelis hiding in
sealed rooms during desert storm to avoid gas bearing scuds \?

cripes , mark , are you really a college student \? maybe you ought to stop
worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head.
ever heard of questioning authority \?

and besides... oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering.


ok , i 'll buy that. you do seem totally clueless...


i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the
contrary.

wellllll.... they were n't murderous. they 'd never harmed or even threatened
anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons
and hardware. and as far as evidence , what are you talking about \?
everything the feds have said they 've retracted practically as soon as they get
questioned in detail about it. maybe you and your increased beverage
access buddies , sitting around the bar slurring stuff like they shoulda
killed 'em all 51 days ago do n't feel that way , but then you 're probably
one of those people still saying about klinton give the guy a chance , we do n't
even know what he 's gonna do ! (burp)


thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under
the bush administration. what would your answer be then \? would you still
prefer to believe the cultists \?

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge.)

no problem , you do n't have any questions that scare any of us. most of our
minds are apparently more developed than yours.

the answer is yes ! in a f cking heartbeat !

thought experiment would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth
open , blissfully sucking up anything the feds said if bush were the president \?
what , no comeback \? (ok , go ahead , say it. read my lips , no new taxes p )


but then
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that
his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected \?

not in such a great degree. bush broke one promise , maybe two (taxes guns)
and we held him accountable for it. of course , it took him the better part of
4 years to do it slick 's only been in office 101 days and he 's broken lots
of them. anddd... i imagine he 'll also be held accountable for that.

(i can just see the campaign buttons now abc anybody but clinton )

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
people \? are they , like , just plain evil , or what \? did they just wake up
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states
to figure out who to oppress that day \? i'm eager to know.

hmmm.... apparently you just got here. nobody 's claiming that it was anything
but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally
do n't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up. and as far as how they picked
the davidians , who knows \? maybe they figured that nobody 'd care about such
a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the texas prairie.
maybe they figured they 'd just go in there and run roughshod over the bds
during their religious services (which was the reason the feds gave for the
timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance. maybe they knew
that the bds were n't anywhere near as violent as the feds' spin doctors are
trying to tell the public. maybe they were afraid to try this kind of thing
on the crips and bloods. maybe it was because the atf 's budget is up for
approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is
the case. of course , their reasoning does n't matter , only what they did ,
and this time , people are just paying more attention to it.


and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader \?

not if you mean that stupid do n't stop thinking about tomorrow ...

how is he on diabolical laughter \?

all i 've ever heard is hillary 's diabolical giggle. waffle man seems to have

do n't know , never seen him in one. he probably looks fat and puffy faced ,
just like in a suit. i saw him in the rose garden the other day , and i
could n't get over how much he is starting to look like teddy kennedy.

liberty of deleting all but the header and a single quote. i hope you do n't
mind.

as written the second ammendment states rather clearly for anyone who can
read the following

a well regulated militia , being necessarry to the security of a free state ,
the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

what is regulated \? regulated means controlled ! how about security \?
well hey ! that would be along the lines of being and feeling safe would n't
it \? wow ! we have a concept forming here do n't we ! \? now what have we left \?
the right of the people people people people people people people (sorry
got kinda hungup there) shall not be infringed oops ! backup there , hmmm..
infringed ....that 'd be like interfered with , altered , changed or
watered down in any way , shape or form ! so ! what we have here in it 's big old
long winded version would be.

a well controlled militia , being necessary to the secure safe feeling of
state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be fucked
with in any way shape or form by some happy ass good for nothing in
some piddly government building who wants to run my life in the pursuit of
his happiness ! the item is clear and concise in it 's present form my young
friend ! it does not need my clarification or that of any other. this is
only ammendment which guarantees the continued existence of the others.
it 's whole purpose is to give people recourse against the military machine
of a government which fails to properly represent it 's creators ! us !

james madison , federalist paper 41 (regarding the general
welfare clause) nothing is more natural nor common than first
to use a general phrase , and then to explain and qualify it by a

robin hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts
will have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property
poor districts. the laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending.
imho , however , it is a disaster waiting to happen. taxes will go up in 50 of
the districts and we will lose control of how our tax money is spent. it
penalizes districts that have excelled.

1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at
some time before the feb. 28th raid \?

yes , the local sheriff stated that anytime he wanted to talk to koresh , all
he had to do was call him and koresh would come down.




one other point , i'm no fan of janet reno , but i do like the way she had the
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility. seems like the waffle boy
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.

cnn just reported the atf and the fbi have begun killing everyone in the
united states. a press release stated this action was required because
bugs had revealed that many people were doing something illegal in their
homes , and statistical data indicated that those who were n't might someday
do something illegal. an atf spokesperson , just before he shot himself , stated
that this would clean up things once and for all .

for those of you still unsure whether this is satire , the jury is still out

also yesterday , even though the compound no longer exists , the
us attorney 's office here released formerly sealed documents ,
including a search warrant and related affidavits , that authorities
planned to use when the siege was over.

these documents did not include the original warrants the bureau of
alcohol , tobacco , and firearms had in late february , which to this
day have never been released.

...one of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek
samples of koresh 's handwriting not only to verify that he had
signed for some gun purchases , but also that he espoused
'certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly
the atf.'

so , one of the charges against koresh seems to be contempt of cop he
expressed hostility to the batf. that chilly feeling in your gonads is
perfectly normal , folks... it should go away in about 51 days.

i agree that koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because
he grew up inside the cult , and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego.

that does n't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons. or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds.

this was no move fuck up. a helicoptor was thermal imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
there were no cs canisters... a specially modified abrams was pupming the
stuff in. no chance of starting a fire there. kerosene lamps \? maybe one ,
but not three fires. no way. koresh was n't just talking out of his ass. i
expected this to happen.

maybe they wanted it to look like murder. he had 50 days. i think this was
coming the whole time. he did n't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the cs seige. he put them up into the tower
to die. fuck all of you big brother paranoid freaks. the only good thing

mgb@slacvm.slac.stanford.edu says
from a.p. according to numerous accounts by those in the compound ,
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane
tank , and turning over numerous gas lanterns.

oh \? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places \?
in particular , three different places where there were no apv 's \?

this claim has n't been retracted or contradicted yet , as many earlier
government claims have \? at least one clip showed a fire erupting
after a tank busted in a wall. we have unsubstantiated claims by
the government about the flirs spotting simultaneous fires.

and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying
to get out of the compound \?

that 's easy. six hours of cs gas , heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading
fire , confusion , panic. only 10 got out. the building was collapsing
all around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck.

and besides... oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering.

the davidians may have committed suicide , or some few zealots among
them might have started the fires that is possible. but , given
the government 's earlier inability to tell a straight story , i find
my above scenario equally possible. i wait for some independent
investigation to look into the whole thing.

it would be one thing if the government spokespeople had been
consistent and forthright throughout. keeping the press far away
and ghettoized in pools was not conducive to building up trust.
sealing the warrants was non optimal , as well. this operation
was out of control from the git go.

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept
the governments story , despite much evidence to the contrary.

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the
contrary. thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under
the bush administration. what would your answer be then \? would you still
prefer to believe the cultists \?

speaking only for myself , i think bush and reagan should have been
impeached over iran contra.

in 1979 , i would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to
the government. no more. like i said , i 'll wait to see the
results of an independent investigation if there is one
before i choose whom to believe.

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge.)

but you got one , anyway.

but then
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that
his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected \?

i generally vote for the lesser of two evils. this last time , it
was the least of three evils.

if people will believe that of any politican , it is little wonder they
will believe all of the factoids being given out as fact by the
clinton reno fbi batf confederation.

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
people \? are they , like , just plain evil , or what \? did they just wake up
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states
to figure out who to oppress that day \? i'm eager to know.

it was a bureaucratic execution. out of control bureaucracies driven
by percieved self interest and gross stupidity.

and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader \? how is he
on diabolical laughter \? does he look good in a cape \? these things must be
investigated. you first.

clinton is just another statist. my only problem with clinton on this
is that he is apparently willing to blindly back the atf and fbi.

you sick bastard.

why thanks for your reply to my post. by the way , i never , never ever said

let 's go to the videotape. here 's exactly what you posted

this is murder !
atf murderers ! butchers ! !

flame on ! !
is this guy serious \? \? \? \?
if he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops i forgot that the media
for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts
are known , as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe).
any ways one of koresh 's devoted followers that did i repeat did survive this
genocidal mass slaughter of innocent people . besides there are nine
survivors in the burn unit of the local hospital and was reported that david
was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan. besides , a majority of
these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of ,
this then makes them bastard children to a sacraligious zeloit (sp). also
someone should have told david and his followers that if they ca n't the heat
then they should stay out of the kitchen ! ! (pun intended)

so if you were n't saying that the deaths of bastard children of a sacreligious
zealot was no big thing (and i know i am not the only one who read it that
way) , just what the hell were you saying \?

however it was the branch
davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their savior
(yeah right budy boy) because he had brain washed them into believing that
what ever he says is the truth , even if means that they are to give up their
lives for his cause. therefore it is davids fault and not the atf 's
who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out , this was 50 days to many for me and
for many of the rest of the u.s.

so who brainwashed you into believing that whatever the government says it
the truth \? or that koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the
us \? have n't you ever stopped to wonder why the government raided this farm \?
this raid was not about religion , sex , or child abuse. to the best available
evidence at the moment , this raid , psychological torture , and group death was
about koresh 's failure to pay a 200 tax on one grenade launcher that he may
or may not even have had ! that 's why it was the batf doing the raiding in the
first place.

do you think a 200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government
with 100 armed men in trailers , orchestrated character assassination , noise
torture , and a holocaust \?

i am however sad to hear of the death of any
child unlike the sick bastard i supposedly am.

then think before you post.

tear gas to annoy you , and ramming your home with tanks. yet they claim that

dunno if you 'll find it in the constitution , but that other document of american
liberty , that kids are taught to hallow in school , is the declaration of
independence. that document is in fact a justification not just for the right

gets too oppressive. it is a very radical document , and i recommend all

y'know , when the right to bear arms was invented ,

it was n't invented , but was supposed by the writers of the constitution

all we had to worry about was the shotgun and pistol.

hmmm. you need to spend some time in a library , son.

when the bill of rights was written , in addition to the (muzzleloading)
shotgun and pistol you mention we had

rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
by civilians).
breech loading rifles

in addition , semiautomatic and full automatic firearms had been patented
and or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so.

now , we have to worry about drive bys

sounds good. any refererences to this actually happening , or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
uzi , semi or full auto \?

just because someting was good once , does not mean it will be forever.

until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior ,

i'm sure such weapons have been developed. our society does not ,
however , condone their possession or use.

actually , joe , i wrote the above. peter was responding to my article.

i'm actually rather confused by your post. i suppose i did n't
make myself clear , cause you seem to have gotten exactly the
opposite impression from what i intended. i suppose the authorities
might have been a better term than society . carry and use a firearm
in many parts of the country (certainly the parts i live in) , and expect ,
at the very least , to have an awful lot of explaining to do.
and there is also appears to be a trend in society at large that
actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves.

in a few other parts of our society , handguns are banned or
so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law
abiding citizen for self defense outside the home. funny ,
though , how the criminals in such places continue to have a
lush supply of guns and no compunctions about using them.
imho , you do n't need to be either a political philosopher or
a crime victim to realize that there 's a flaw in the gun
grabbers' logic.

agreed.

you 're welcome to your ho , too , the first amendment being as
important as the second , but please do n't let your obvious
good intentions be subverted by insupportable generalities
about something as big and diverse as us society.

my only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable
weapons of self defense does n't mean you 'll escape a whole shitload
of trouble should you be forced to use them.

or by the
naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause
to someone who would be a criminal anyway.

i made no such statements , nor do i have such a naive hope or outlook.

wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself
if others' thoughts are not that kindly ,

that 's all i want the opportunity to leave in peace , or to
have the means to defend myself when that in not possible.

i think we agree on this issue. i guess my position did n't
survive the transition from cognition to ascii.

no firearms were ever ever shot at the national guard at kent state.

at the time of the shooting , no rocks were being thrown at all. the squad was
slowly proceeding up a knoll , away from the body of students. some students
were taunting them , and photographs of the incident show at most one or two
students who were following and taunting.

the series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill , while
occasionally their nco , .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from.
all at once , as if on command , the entire squad turned and fired their m1
garands , firing 30.06 rounds into the crowd (the nco can be shown with this
45 at full recoil). at least two of the students shot had nothing to do with
the taunters... they were only passing through , and were not participants in
the confrontation.

there is some dispute whether the guard was even legally on campus... apparently
they had not been invited onto the state school by the president , who had
conveniently flown the coop , so as not to be around. the governor of ohio ,
james rhodes , had just embarked on a senate campaign , and wanted it to be known
that he was tough on peaceniks , so had ordered the guard in.

the matter was quickly covered up. some years later , wounded survivors launched
a civil lawsuit against those responsible... a settlement was made , and under the
terms , the plaintiffs could not discuss much , and guilty individuals were not
identified (in fact , those shooters in the squad have been identified).

it was a tragic incident , but it was not provoked by the students , or apparently
by general delcorso or any of his command. from studying the incident the
photos , imo it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers.

texas child protective services (which loves to find child abuse) found no ,
i repeat no , evidence of abuse when they first looked at the bd , and is saying
that they see none in any of the kids who were released. there is no evidence
that koresh was banging anyone but his wives.

it is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell 's soup.
nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as i write this)
to prove the bd really had any proscribed weapons.

i feel they were all loonies , but there is no indication that they ever
bothered anyone. they were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons ,
and the batf and fbi who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle has n't
got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway.

you people are rather amusing in a perverse sort of way. you take
a tragic unpleasant situation that you feel is a terrible injustace , and
assign blame to anybody and everybody with or without a link to the
incident
simply because they do n't fit your extremely narrow definition of good.

how is clinton responsible \? it was a law enforcement action.
granted , it was a nationally covered incident but clinton had no more to
do with the outcome than fred flintstone.

perhaps you 've been under a rock the last few days \? the batf and the fbi
are both federal agencies. clinton has admitted in front of news cameras
that janet reno (the once and future attorney general) gave him a full
briefing of what was planned before they did it , and he gave her the
go ahead.

maybe , just possibly , that makes him a teensy bit responsible \?


the fbi , cia , batf , etc. are federal agencies , you are correct. but to
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the prez , and
that these agencies inform reno who informs clinton , etc. is naive. these
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
ultimate accountability to the prez , they make their own moves , and then
tell the prez , who says , i knew all along . while this may not seem right ,
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
leading to the white house , thats the way it is. bureaucracys are not , after
all , composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis , have lunch , and
maybe golf together. i do agree , the fbi , batf messed up. i'm not sure if
they should have stormed the compound or not. by the way , jehova witnesses
are a religious minority in this country. protestantism is a minority
religion in the world. bds were a cult by all definitions and history of
cults. to say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
koresh said he was the messiah. i was raised a baptist , although i do
not practice the religion and do not think that the big guy upstairs is
digging the divisiveness , closemindedness , and right wing morons that are
associated with the religion. anyway , the messiah that i was taught about
would not be carrying a gun , let alone stockpiling weapons. you can doubt
batf reports all you want , david koresh was not a poor soul who was
unjustly persecuted. while some of the information coming from the u.s
government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side , i
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
are true. anyway , this is just another excuse to try and blame president
clinton for something. people who attempt to do this for political motives
should be ashamed. they are the ones who are keeping this country from
reaching its full potential.



you seem to make two points. no one ultimately oversees the federal agencies
you mention , and since koresh apparently has a different view point from your
baptist upbringing , then he is not worthy of protection from religious
persecution. as to being the messiah , is not christ within us all \?

must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion.

baptists are a cult , two , btw , under most of the definitions in the dictionary
of cult .

it is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers , or re assign

into possible misconduct is going on. the administration has given no
indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. and given that
the president , attorney general and governor were all involved in the

small arms rounds set off outside of a firearm pose little risk except
possibly eye injuries and minor wounds.

true.

large concentrations of ammo ,
or 'magazines' (not the type you insert into your semi auto) probably
pose a larger risk , but mostly from heat and flame. (this is also
covered in the above reference.)

no more risk than smaller stashes unless the stash is somehow confined so
the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk heat the remainder.

two years ago this month my house and office burned. in my office was my
reloading bench. on the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was
about 100 lbs of smokeless powder , 5 lbs of black powder , several thousand
primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds , primarily in .45acp , .30 20
and .308. the fire was extinguished before the area containing the
reloading supplies were fully involved. there was about 1 2 of char on
the joists , subsequently removed by sandblasting. lots of heat in other
words.

none of the powder kegs ignited. one 1lb can of pistol powder ignited.
no explosion , as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do.
the black powder cans were charred and got so hot the plastic lids
completely melted and ran down inside. the smokless powder was
contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs. the kegs were charred
badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case
of the metal cans , the plastic lids melted completely away.

many of the rounds cooked off. they were in close proximity to wood
on all sides so the effects were easy to observe. in most cases with the
rifle ammo , the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle. many bullets were
found still in the neck. small shards of brass were lightly stuck into
the wood. lightly enough that brushing them with a fingertip would usually
dislodge them. primers generally popped out of the primer pockets.
the .45acp rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around.
no dents were observed above the storage area , indicating the bullets
left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard.

ordinary small arms ammo is not a hazard when cooking off regardless
of what the fbi says.

assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about

perhaps they did n't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the

rubble , which finally (combined with teargas , and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them \?

what if.......

what if the fbi thought that tear gas would force the davidians out
at least the mothers and the children , so they (the fbi) did not
bother to think about the effect of tear gas on young children......

what if the fbi knew they killed several of the children by using
tear gas......(let`s assume the fbi knew via their listening devices)

what if the fbi saw fire accidently break out at one end of the
building , e.g. by an upset oil lamp.......

what if the fbi thought they could finally force the rest of the
davidians out and also destroy the evidence that they (the fbi) had
killed the children by starting a fire at the other end......

here are a few ideas

1) a free library card so they can look up the fbi
uniform crime report which shows how good hci is
at lying through their teeth ,

2) a free rtd transit pass which will allow anti gunners
to tour south central los angeles and convince
people living there that they do n't need guns to protect
themselves because the police will do it for them
(do n't lose the pass , you 'll need it to get out) ,

3) a free bus ride to vermont , which has almost no gun
control and , curiously enough , almost no crime either ,

4) a free calculator , since anti gunners have heretofore
been unable to figure out what a small percentage of
the guns owned in america are used to commit violent crime.

in the wake of the waco denouement , i had email discussions with

the way it did , and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing
with cults and similar organizations.

cheers( \? ) ,
oded

(begin included text)

i took a course called the madness of crowds , ... the course included
cults and briefly mentioned analyzed jonestown. (did some external
reading too).

william adorno ... edited a series of books on the psychology of
evil mass movements... starting with the authoritarian personality ,
university of chicago press , 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what
would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in wwii ,
and by extension in other wars , in racial lynchings ... i do n't think
the books are perfect , and the study of psychopathology has advanced
... , but you can elicit koresh types from even the first volume. so i
think they 're onto something.


how cult psychology works...
i'm an amateur. hope i'm not hopelessly naive.

so long as koresh could own his people , he made sure they did n't
believe there was any life out there for them , away from him.
otherwise , he 'd (koresh) be nothing. during the siege , ex davidians
recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived
only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless souls.
absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ... as long as they
believed him , they 'd ignore batf fbi child protective services or even
the red cross asking them to come out. after all , if they ever left
him , god would catapult them straight to hell , and the combined forces
of the us gummint , with all the goodwill in the world (doubtful)
could n't save them for a second. if i believed it , i 'd stay and die
too , like the folks in jonestown.

for a prosaic analogy , replace a cult leader with an estranged wife
(or husband) , and notice how many folks show up , kill the ex and then
themselves. that 's the consequence of shattered cultism. it really
does happen all the time. by the way , the treasured ideal in such
cases , without which life is meaningless , is the relationship , no
matter how abusive , rather than the individual 's partner.

...


why no news , do n't the feds owe the world an explanation \?

i agree that official explanations are in order. i can also see good
( \? ) reasons for news blackouts.

the only fact available is that had the fbi not acted
yesterday , those people would be alive today.

... that no matter what , those people would have died , because koresh
made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence.
hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi acted. he
held them hostage , as his trump against going to jail , but nothing
would really stop him from offing them. even if the fbi went away !

look at history. rep leo ryan (and some staffers) visited jonestown ,
at the request of constituents who had relatives there. once
jonestown was discovered , and even though they killed ryan and his
entourage ... they all killed themselves , because jim jones knew he 'd
be busted. internal arguments asking to spare the children , brought
up by some of the women in the cult , were shouted down. there are
tapes... the logic of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is , it
would n't kill the kids , was shouted down as blasphemy , and the people
who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by
their own avowal would be dead within the hour. i suspect it 's the
same with the branch davidians.
(there 's a book on jonestown by james reston jr. , titled our father
who art in hell. i do n't know whether it 's good never read it.)

...
the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate
reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment , or organizations buying
full auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups , on the
off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...

so , the only way the batf fbi could save those people , and future
cults , is by ignoring such signs.

i suppose there 's another way outsmarting koresh and tricking him
into letting them go , or somehow influencing his people to abandon
him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world.
... a mighty tough row to hoe. ... i suspect the fbi tried to do that
with blackouts , noise and other sensory insults. however , maybe
they 're not very sophisticated , or maybe the job is impossible. it 's
certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk.

...

why the fbi might want to blackout during and coverup after

... if they were doing a poor job of weaning the bd 's from
koresh , they 'd want to keep it quiet so they would n't be embarrassed.

... if they were trying to wean the bd 's from koresh , they 'd
want to keep it quiet so he could n't outflank them , or well meaning
boneheads from any point of view would n't screw it up. ... i hate
playing chess when the world screams in my face , especially if at
checkmate time people really die , and i could be blamed.

...

i do n't think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy , unless you
deny the fbi , batf , child protective services (of whatever stripe) and
the rest of the gummint should exist at all.

(the end)


okay , have at it.

the substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages.

however , i do n't wish to enter into this discussion here , as it will be yet
another rehearsal of a long tired set of arguments. suffice it to say that i
disagree both with the interpretation of well regulated in the second
amendment offered by gun lovers , and what i think to be their distortion of
the same phrase in the associated federalist papers. my webster and my
reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control ,
and disciplined , and not 'of good marksmanship'. i think the latter a
special interest pleading. no one has yet shown a contemporateous reference
in which well regulated unambiguously meant 'of good marksmanship' , and
not under control disciplined , etc.

thus i continue to believe the second amendment is a militia clause and not
an 'arming everyone' clause. others are welcome to disagree (as i know many
do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular

his last sentence says it all. who the hell are we (or the government)

in history as the american holocaust. these people were murdered
by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis.
i hang my head in shame for what i 've allowed my government to become.

i have never judged them by their religion , but by their actions.

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would
have been no raid , no siege , and no deaths. instead , they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not
irrational. the first was to stockpile weapons. the second was to
shoot federal agents. the third was to stay inside.

last time i checked , amassing an arsenal and practicing any kind of
religion were mentioned in passing in the bill of rights. guess it 's
ok with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing
a bunch of religious nutcakes , eh \?

of all the idiots i run into in daily life , dan , your type scare me the
most. you 'll accept expediency and a coward 's safety over any belief
just as long as the government tells you to. you assume that anyone who
does n't comform to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and
therefore bad. worse , you seem to accept without question what the
government says is wrong to be wrong.

david koresh 's religion was not mine but then again , neither are the baptists ,
methodists , catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions. but
even though koresh 's , the baptists , the methodists , etc , do n't believe
the same way i do , i recognize that their religions are equally valid
to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st amendment.
you see , i'm not that much different than koresh and i suspect many others
fit the same catagory. i read the bible many times and as i learned
from it , i discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice
just is n't justified by my interpretation of the bible. therefore i go
my own way. so did koresh. and neither you nor i nor anyone else ,
either individually or collectively as the great socialist we has any
right whatsoever to tell me or you or koresh that our religions are wrong.

you seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the davidians to
just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound
in order to save themselves . think (if you 're capable) for a moment
about some belief you hold dearest. would you abandon that belief if
suddenly told to do so by the government \? if you would do so you are
beneath contempt. let 's assume you have a belief that you hold dear
enough to commit your life to. do you think it would be the correct
course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically
designed to force you to make that forsake or die decision \?

the forsake or die option is exactly what the government forced on the
davidians the day the first wave of black clad stormtroopers fired that
first shot and tossed that first grenade. the fbi clenched it on day 51
when they sent in heavy armor against 80 some odd men , women and
children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms. the
people who stayed , who held to their beliefs over personal safety , whose
individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit , who
believed that the bill of rights meant exactly what it says , to those
people go my deepest respect , regardless of their religion. people like
you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with well they could
have come out get my most scornful contempt. i 'd spit in your face

this is the ap story from fri morning.

as the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air , cult leader
david koresh sprang into action. he left his third floor bedroom and began
looking around the house , making sure women and children were secure and
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. within hours , the
compound became an inferno. nine branch davidians excaped.
this is their story , gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. that day the
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world
since koresh 's right hand man , steve schneider , ripped out the compounds 's
phone line after fbi agents called before dawn monday saying this was the
cults last chance come out or prepare to get forced out.

aw , gee , and whose fault is that \?

they kept their word. by dawn , tanks were battering the mount carmel
compound , punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. the bd
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. strapped into gas masks , the
women did laundry. others read bibles in their rooms. the 17 children , all
under 10 , remained by their mothers' sides. still , it was hard to ignore
what was happening around them. each time a tank rammed the
poorly constructed building it shook violently. cult members dodges
falling gypsum wallboard and doors.

dear , dear. they could have come out.

hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling
the air with noxious fumes. the flying canisters were more frightening than
the tanks. at least one man was hit in the face.

dear , dear. they could have come out.

the gas began filling the air ,
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks
made.

it could n't have gotten too heavy with all that wind blowing through.

scattered throughout the house , the cult members made no efforts to
gather. then the fbi sent in its biggest weapon a massive armored vehicle
headed for a chamber , lined with cinder blocks , where authorities hoped to
find koresh and schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.
here the cult members' story diverges from the government 's version. the
fbi says cult members set fires in three places. but each of the six cult
members , in separate discussions with lawyers , consistently gave versions
at odds with the fbi 's account. they say the tank flattened a barrel of
propane , spilling its contents. and as the tank thundered through the house ,
it tipped over lit lanterns , spitting flames that ignited the propane and
other flammables. the home of used lumber , plywood , and wallboard tacked
together with tar paper was vulnerable. the building erupted. nine bd 's
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. others

the best reason to abolishing the atf is that they do n't have enough
to do. if the organization were disbanded and its duties assigned to
the fbi (firearms) and irs (tobacco and alcohol). both of these
organizations have enough to do. the fbi is probably not going to try
to get a criminal charge of illegal machine gun for having a broken
gun.

there have been postings stating that law enforcement should be
divided and and weak. but there is nothing more dangerous to
liberties than a law enforcement agency without enough criminals to

waco.

when the bd compound was assaulted by the atf the bd did fire back.
but they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the atf to care for
their wounded. the bd even released the atf agents they captured. it
is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the atf medical
attention that the bd were not looking for trouble.

this is the first i 've heard of the bd capturing and releasing atf agents.
is there any more info about this \?

it was filmed the day of the first assault. the bds clearly allowed the

if you wo n't believe anything the government says , and the press
is not reliable according to the same logic , then what do you base
your statements on \? wild speculation laced with a healthy dose
of paranoia \?

then post what the press has said , not what you wished they said.
the medical examiner has refuted the fbi facts and if you do n't

what do you have to say for yourself.

are you a moron or just illiterate \? the facts that the fbi

neither.

i was willing to grant this for sake or argument until i read the
following.

proclaimed on monday suddenly were n't facts anymore by
the tuesday press conference.

you do n't have to pay attention to any one source , neither do you
have to abandon your critical thinking , but to disregard all sources
of information as 'lies' and 'distortions' and substitute your own
pet theories is more likely to get you wild untruths than by basing
your theories on the 'facts' as they are reported by the media and
the government.

the facts as reported by the press and impartial government
sources support me.

there has beed no evidence of
anyone setting the fire deliberately you simpleton so

actually there was evidence of the fire being set deliberately
both testamony by the survivors and ir tape showing the fire
being set in 3 places and the petrochemical soot that the fire
was giving off (indications of kerosine or gasoline feeding the
fire).

there is no testimony , at the press conference , the fbi said they
had no testimony , the survivors as reported by cnn and newsday
wire service said that all the survivors gave consistent stories
refuting the fbi. they were lighting and heating with kerosine.
are you trying to prove you 're an idiot.

you might not believe 1 or 2 if you are totally paranoid or very
skeptical , but my 3rd point is visible to anyone who watches the
tapes of the fire and has started a bbq grill.



what are you basing your statements on \? oh , i forgot , you 're
the guy that does n't know microwave oven need electricity ,
never mind.

lvc@cbnews.cb.att.com (larry cipriani) writes

according to wnci 97.9 fm radio this morning , dayton , ohio is operating a
gun buy back . they are giving 50 for every functional gun turned in.
they ran out of money in one day , and are now passing out 50 vouchers of
some sort. they are looking for more funds to keep operating. another
media event brought to you by hci.

is there something similar pro gun people can do \? for example , pay 100
to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm \? sounds a bit
tacky , but hey , whatever works.

as david veal points out , this sort of promotion would be used
against gun owners by the mass media.

however , here is my proposal offer gun safety classes in your area ,
free , as a community service. such a class would normally cost 40
or 50 , so offering it free is a good promotion.

our gun club has organized several of these (we just finished
teaching another one last night , in fact) and they have been
very well received. we get a lot of people who are novices
interested in guns. we even get a few who are anti gun , but
feel they should know something about gun safety since members
of their family keep guns at home.

teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits

(1) we have the chance to teach gun safety rules this increases
firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.

(2) a gun safety class is politically correct , and likely to
be viewed positively by the public and the media.

(3) most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)
and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a
gentle introduction to firearms.

(4) some of the students are enthusiastic , and will purchase a gun
and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.

(5) it improves the public perception of our club and gun owners
in general. our students see that we are all reasonable ,
non aggressive , soft spoken people , which helps to mitigate
the standard image of a hardcore gun owner. even anti gun
students sometimes tell us they have something new to think
about with regards to personal gun ownership.

(6) sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.

our course is the standard nra certified home firearm safety
class , and our students pay only 5 for materials. we also
teach the nra 's personal protection class , although the cost
is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.

i think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to
gun buy backs.

subject batf fbi do right thing in waco
lines 44

everyone is complaining about the debacle in waco. it is hard to
understand all this angst. what happend there is nothing less than
what we wanted to happen. why all the sour grapes \?

batf was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending
budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big
commando raid is proof. it would have been ever so easier to grab
koresh and his central followers as they shopped in waco. alas , no
propaganda value there.

the fbi screwed up big time , all the time. they should have never allowed
the situation to drag out like that. a quick second assault , before the
bds could decide on a strategy , would have been the better plan.

the bds themselves were the biggest screw ups though. they imagined
that us law and us law enforcement had no jurisdiction within their
little 'country'. wrong ! they had no right whatsoever to fire on
the batf , and if they mistook their identity initially , they should
have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. if the
bds had a problem with the warrants , they take it to court , just like
the rest of us. if they wanted full auto weapons , they could have
obtained the proper permits , just like the rest of us would need to
do. what they may not do is decide for themselves what us law applies
to themselves and which does not. they get their chance like the rest
of us at the voting booth.

if the batf and fbi have become latter day gestapo , then they have
become that way because we have desired them to be so. we get to
vote on laws , and on the lawmakers. by our choices over the years ,
we have approved the creation and form of the batf and fbi. when
the fbi was out chasing 'pinkos' , the general public did n't seem
to mind a bit of extra constitutional activity. when the batf is
raiding militant black organizations , we do n't mind the heavy hand.
when the fbi is dicking around with the rights of potheads , the
public does n't mind. suddenly , when we see a bit of ourselves in
the current 'enemy' choosen by these agencies , we get all bent out
of shape. suprise ! you reap what you sow.

waco was an encapsulation of the all american experience religious
fanaticism , militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence. do n't
blame it on 'them' , the fbi and batf. they were just acting within
the parameters we have set over the years. we made 'them'. we are 'them'.

just heard on the network radio news a spokesman from the
army saying that the type of cs gas used in waco had been
banned from military use. its use is also banned by a
draft international agreement on the use of chemical
weapons in warfare.

the reason given was that the use causes extreme nausea ,
blindness , disorientation , total irrationality , raging paranoia.

i do n't know about the paranoia and irrationality , but the rest is
pretty close , all though you left out the inability to breath. of
course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged
things to get away from it. i 've seen teenagers flatten 200lb. drill
sergeants to get out of tents full of it. which raises another
issue....

children would be all the more susceptible , and show the results all the
earlier.

this is the stuff janet reno was told would be safe for children.

what they did n't mention is that in the open , it probably would n't do
too much harm to children , although i would n't use it in close proximity
to infants. on the other hand , in confined spaces , the effects are
greatly intensified , to the point of lethality , since a sufficient
quantity of cs will displace oxygen. when running a cs chamber careful
attention is paid to ventilation. i wonder if they checked to see if
any of the bds were asthmatics or suffered from other respiratory
diseases. i doubt it.



if you were smarter , you 'd have these opinions....

seems very inappropriate to me.

'religious fanatics' that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from
the reporters \?

to me this was not only in poor taste , but it showed the media 's bias and
hostility to anyone not of the politically correct stripe. no wonder they
have been cheerleading for the kgbatf and the fbi during this whole affair.

just what the hell do you base that ludicrous claim on \? there are
plenty of fine , decent people people who read post to t.p.g. if
any of these people are paranoid it is because of people like you.

hey dude you are making me paranoid ! what an argument ! ! !


while i would n't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got
to be paranoid based on either usenet in general or phill hallam baker 's
comments in general , you 'd be surprised.

for most people , if you accuse them of something long enough and
loud enough , to enough people , they start to ask why they 're bothering
to fight it.

if nothing you do will be considered right , why bother to do right \?
it 's pretty basic human nature.

i 'd have a spot of tea with them. ) you probably gave up on arguing the
case for arms control directly long ago because posters who know
what they are talking about (e.g. , frank crary) disproved all your
arguments for why more gun control is needed. so , you gave up because
you know they are right and you could n't refute their answers.

no , frank crary 's arguments are based on the assumption that most people
are sane , normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners.

what an amazing thing. i did n't realize that over a hundred million
gun owners all posted to tpg.

even if all the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what
you say they illustrate , it would still only reflect the written
personas (which is often different from face to face) of a very , very
small and select group.

anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on
usenet to the general population of any country either does n't care
about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them.

usenet as a whole
disproves it of humanity as a whole.

speaking of which...

most of the readership posts i 've seen put the most read
newsgroups at about 160 , 000 readers , a number i have a feeling is
fairly inflated. the posters , rare and regular , are themseleves a
very tiny minority of that group. and the whole of usenet readers
are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity.

if anything , the only real thing you can get out of the relative
sample of usenet readers is that we 've got too much equipment and too
much time available to us.

we now have proof positive that guns do n't make you safer. buy a lot of
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the fbi to burn
down your house.

proof that guns do n't make you safer is that if you buy one the
government will show up and kill you \?

tell me , if the government took away the voting rights of
everybody who exercised their free speech , would that then be proof

you are equating two things with each other that do n't.

see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons
to support gun control.

phill , if you really believe that the various posts on
computer nets represents either most of the poster 's in person
personalities or the general public 's general opinions , then
i have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality.

but do n't expect you really do believe that. it 's simply
a convenient way to make your point , and hopefully make those

the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane

oh \? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places \?
in particular , three different places where there were no apv 's \?

and just where is the evidence for this \? fbi sayso. the texas medical

and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying

let me put you in a building , pump in cs , knock the walls down around
you and see how fast you find an exit.

and besides... oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering.

i do n't know why either , you 're willing to swallow everything fed you.
good boy.

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept
the governments story , despite much evidence to the contrary.

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the
contrary. thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under
the bush administration. what would your answer be then \? would you still
prefer to believe the cultists \?

oh a clinton apologist , why did n't you say so.

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge.)

but then
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that
his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office.

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected \?

if people will believe that of any politican , it is little wonder they
will believe all of the factoids being given out as fact by the
clinton reno fbi batf confederation.

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty
people \? are they , like , just plain evil , or what \? did they just wake up
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states
to figure out who to oppress that day \? i'm eager to know.

the kgbatf was expecting a quick victory while the cameras rolled ,
however , they were the only ones with a script.

and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader \? how is he
on diabolical laughter \? does he look good in a cape \? these things must be

hey , you 're the apologist , you tell us.

everyone is complaining about the debacle in waco. it is hard to
understand all this angst. what happend there is nothing less than
what we wanted to happen. why all the sour grapes \?

cute word angst. conveys volumes.

i 'd be interested in this particular definition of we. it 's
such a fluid pronoun.

batf was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending
budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big
commando raid is proof. it would have been ever so easier to grab
koresh and his central followers as they shopped in waco. alas , no
propaganda value there.

the fbi screwed up big time , all the time. they should have never allowed
the situation to drag out like that. a quick second assault , before the
bds could decide on a strategy , would have been the better plan.

the bds themselves were the biggest screw ups though. they imagined
that us law and us law enforcement had no jurisdiction within their
little 'country'. wrong !

the bd were a paranoid little cult out in the middle of nowhere ,
which all of a sudden had their worst paranoid fears reinforced.

joy.

they had no right whatsoever to fire on
the batf , and if they mistook their identity initially , they should
have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were.

yes , they probably should have , although how many paranoid
nuts can say they held off the feds for 51 days \?

if the
bds had a problem with the warrants , they take it to court , just like
the rest of us. if they wanted full auto weapons , they could have
obtained the proper permits , just like the rest of us would need to
do. what they may not do is decide for themselves what us law applies
to themselves and which does not. they get their chance like the rest
of us at the voting booth.

the voting booth is highly over rated. people need to get up
off their lazy butts more than every year or every two years. hell ,
most do n't even do that.

if the batf and fbi have become latter day gestapo , then they have
become that way because we have desired them to be so.

no , because we have decided that it does n't make enough
difference to us to get up and do something. that 's something ,
for instance , a lot of people who go speak against gun control
bills at their local government. dozens of pro gun speakers
show up and few if any antis do , but they often win anyway.

why \? because it does n't matter who shows up , it matters
who 's willing to scream afterwards. and it is n't that most people
give a damn one way of the other , but that they do n't. nobody
gives a damn about anybody beyond their own little worlds.

we get to
vote on laws , and on the lawmakers. by our choices over the years ,
we have approved the creation and form of the batf and fbi. when
the fbi was out chasing 'pinkos' , the general public did n't seem
to mind a bit of extra constitutional activity.

the general public 's usually not even read the constitution.
and what they have learned is a distorted picture of the whole thing.

jonestown was discovered , and even though they killed ryan and his

be busted...

the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate
reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment , or organizations buying
full auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups , on the
off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ...

so , the only way the batf fbi could save those people , and future
cults , is by ignoring such signs.

the paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false.

texas state officials could and did investigate child abuse charges.
they could and did apprehend koresh peaceably. the could and did
impound his weapons for the duration. and koresh was not convicted.

note that child abuse and similar accusations are state matters , not
federal. the state could and did handle them properly and peaceably ,
and furthermore violating no one 's constitutional rights in the process.

so maybe the best way for batf fbi to save people is to mind their
own fucking business.

i'm putting together a list of the civil rights violations perpetrated against
the davidians by the fbi batf. here is what i 've got so far. care to add
any or provide more backup info \?

first amendment
1) fbi batf violated davidians right to free exercise of religion from the
start. we now have a de facto precident against any minority religion.

a preventing them to speak to media
b preventing them from practicing their beliefs
3) fbi batf violated the freedom of the press by
a keeping them 2 miles from the davidians
b preventing the media to cover the fbi batf actions close up
c censoring media reports
4) fbi batf violated the bd 's right to peaceable assemble
a proven by initial baseless assault

1) the batf went after them because they had too many guns and guns that the
fbi batf did n't approve of. 'nuff said.

fourth amendment
1) the right of the bd 's to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and
effects against unreasonable searches and seizures was violated by
a initial baseless assault

1) the davidians were held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous
crime without a presentment or indictment by a grand jury.
2) the davidians were deprived of life , liberty , and property without due
process of law.

sixth amendment
1) the accused were denied the right to a speedy and public trial by an
impartial jury when the fbi became judge , jury and executioner.

accusation.

eighth amendment
1) the davidians suffered cruel and unusual punishment when
a the fbi cut off the water to the ranch
b the fbi used psy war (loudspeakers broacasting the screams of

no koresh is responsible.

if a murderer goes on the rampage it is the murderer who is responsible.
the police may bear responsiblity for failing to stop him but the primary
responsibility is with the murderer.


when did koresh go on a rampage \?

what i saw was an unnecessary , unprovoked massive attack on feb. 28th.

probably even an illegal action by atf , certainly way out of proportion
to anything reasonable.

and yet , according to a pole taken yesterday , 95 of the people poled
believe the government forces acted appropriately. they don`t believe
reno or the president have any guilt in ordering allowing the attack.

i suppose they also believed things like
i would present a 5 year plan to balance the budget.
we don`t need to lead with a tax increase....
it starts with a middle class tax cut...
i`ll have the bills ready the day after i am inaugurated and we`ll
have a 100 day period....it will be the most productive in modern history.
i will ask congress for a line item veto..
i will lift the social security earnings test..

i personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves
right , rather than the other way around. that way i have a better than
50 chance of being right about my first guess !

read the constitution sometime , it is supposed to protect the citizens
and their rights. i am sick of the abuse of government power.

as tom jefferson said
when all government , ... , shall be drawn to washington as the centre of
all power , it will render powerless the checks provided of one government
on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government
from which we separated. (1821)

first , i would like to say how much i appreciate having so literate and
erudite an individual as mr. rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.
frankly , most anti rkba posters refuse even to approach the topic of
the original understanding of the bill of rights as detailed in the
writings of the era. this is most refreshing.

second , i must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.
my brigade 's quarterly drill was this weekend and i needed to attend
to several matters pertaining to the state militia.

some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro
nism that is out of place in the 20th century. i'm not sure the swiss
would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia , both
organized and unorganized , fits into the defense plans of my state ,
mississippi. please do not assume that this describes something peculiar
to one southern state. for instance , the commonwealth of massachusetts
has a well organized militia which , members report , maintains stocks
of both riot guns and machine guns. the laws of other states will vary
but are probably similar.

it appears it is time that this article (originally posted by larry
cipriani last year , and which i saved) gets posted again. it offers
as good an analysis of the meaning of the second amendment , especially
regarding the militia clause , as i have seen. i have not seen any
rebuttles with similar bone fides...

the unabridged second amendment

by j. neil schulman

if you wanted to know all about the big bang , you 'd ring up carl sagan ,
right \? and if you wanted to know about desert warfare , the man to call
would be norman schwarzkopf , no question about it. but who would you call
if you wanted the top expert on american usage , to tell you the meaning
of the second amendment to the united states constitution \?

that was the question i asked a.c. brocki , editorial coordinator of the los
angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton
mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the
foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system. mr.
brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud , a retired professor
journalism at the university of southern california and the author of
american usage and style the consensus.

a little research lent support to brocki 's opinion of professor copperud 's
expertise.

roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades
before embarking on a a distinguished 17 year career teaching journalism at
usc. since 1952 , copperud has been writing a column dealing with the
professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher , a weekly
magazine focusing on the journalism field.

he 's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary , and merriam
webster 's usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert. copperud 's
fifth book on usage , american usage and style the consensus , has been in
continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since 1981 , and is the winner
of the association of american publisher 's humanities award.

that sounds like an expert to me.

after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced
myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested , i sent
the following letter

i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in
english usage , to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united
states constitution , and extract the intent from the text.

the text of the second amendment is , 'a well regulated militia , being
necessary for the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep
and bear arms , shall not be infringed.'

the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the
sentence , 'a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a
free state' , is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause , with respect
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence , 'the
right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed.'

i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into
consideration issues of political impact or public policy , but be restricted
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent. further ,
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation
regarding the consequences of the second amendment , i ask that whatever
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to
stand behind with your reputation , and even be willing to testify under
oath to support , if necessary.

my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment ,
then concluded

i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task
with this letter. i am doing so because , as a citizen , i believe it is
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment.
while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of
its results , i ask that you do this because of that importance.

after several more letters and phone calls , in which we discussed terms for
his doing such an analysis , but in which we never discussed either of our
opinions regarding the second amendment , gun control , or any other political
subject , professor copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which i have
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity)

copperud the words 'a well regulated militia , being necessary to the
security of a free state , ' contrary to the interpretation cited in your
letter of july 26 , 1991 , constitutes a present participle , rather than a
clause. it is used as an adjective , modifying 'militia , ' which is
followed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right' , verb
'shall'). the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for
maintaining a militia.

in reply to your numbered questions

schulman (1) can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep
and bear arms solely to 'a well regulated militia' \?

copperud (1) the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear
arms , nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by
others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect
to a right of the people.

schulman (2) is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted
by the words of the second amendment , or does the second amendment assume a
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms , and merely state
that such right 'shall not be infringed' \?

copperud (2) the right is not granted by the amendment its existence
is assumed. the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.

schulman (3) is the right of the people to keep and bear arms
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia , is , in fact
necessary to the security of a free state , and if that condition is not
existing , is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms ,
shall not be infringed' null and void \?

copperud (3) no such condition is expressed or implied. the right to
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence
of a militia. no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state. the right to keep
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.

schulman (4) does the clause 'a well regulated militia , being necessary
to the security of a free state , ' grant a right to the government to place
conditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms , ' or is such
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence \?

copperud (4) the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional , as
previously stated. it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the
militia.

schulman (5) which of the following does the phrase 'well regulated
militia' mean 'well equipped' , 'well organized , ' 'well drilled , '
'well educated , ' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority' \?

copperud (5) the phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior
authority ' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian
control over the military.

schulman (6) (if at all possible , i would ask you to take account the
changed meanings of words , or usage , since that sentence was written 200
years ago , but not take into account historical interpretations of the
intents of the authors , unless those issues can be clearly separated.

copperud to the best of my knowledge , there has been no change in the
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the
amendment. if it were written today , it might be put since a
well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state , the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'

schulman as a 'scientific control' on this analysis , i would also
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second
amendment to the following sentence ,

a well schooled electorate , being necessary to the security of a free
state , the right of the people to keep and read books , shall not be
infringed.'

my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be ,

(1) is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way
the words modify each other , identical to the second amendment 's sentence \?
and

(2) could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people
to keep and read books' only to 'a well educated electorate' for
example , registered voters with a high school diploma \?

copperud (1) your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the
amendment in grammatical structure.

(2) there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the
possibility of a restricted interpretation.

professor copperud had only one additional comment , which he placed in his
cover letter with well known human curiosity , i made some speculative
efforts to decide how the material might be used , but was unable to reach
any conclusion.

so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what
many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally
protects the people 's right to keep and bear arms , forbidding all
governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right.

as i write this , the attempted coup against constitutional government in the
soviet union has failed , apparently because the will of the people in that
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the
old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.

and here in the united states , elected lawmakers , judges , and appointed
officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states
ignore , marginalize , or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely.
american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms , owning
arms of forbidden sorts , or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms ,
guaranteed by the constitution.

and even the american civil liberties union (aclu) , staunch defender of the
rest of the bill of rights , stands by and does nothing.

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to
preserve that right. no one else will. no one else can. will we beg our
elected representatives not to take away our rights , and continue regarding
them as representing us if they do \? will we continue obeying judges who
decide that the second amendment does n't mean what it says it means but
means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak \?

or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice , as the constitution
of the united states promises us we can , and pledge that we will defend
that promise with our lives , our fortuned , and our sacred honor \?

1) the fbi is not stupid. these people are chosen for their intelligence ,
education , loyalty to the government , etc. they are given much intensive
training. so , to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any
conspiracy here , and say that the fbi was just stupid , i say i do n't
believe it.

2) the fbi has acces to the latest in audio and video technology the
latest digital systems. the fbi can manufacture evidence. need a tape of
koresh saying , light the fire , and you can have one. need a thermal
imaging video of three people lighting fires , and through the magic of
computer graphics , you can have one. the thing is , manufacturing these
pieces of evidence takes time. so it may be a few more days before we
get to see them. or maybe we just have n't heard any tapes or seen any
fbi video is because it is
1) classified
2) too gruesome for our eyes
3) lost got coffee spilled on it

but almost everything in them contradicts what i have seen with my own eyes.

in this case , it was unimportant as to who set the fire. the davidians
would have burned no matter what , especially if the batf fbi set the
fire as this would make the beseiged martyrs to vernon howell and

davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this
theory (one cult member said that she wished that she had been there ,
and that now she would have to wait for vernon to return for them. she
actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them).

judgment at waco

now the scientific and political scrutiny of the
horror show in waco begins , though nothing can
undo the tragedy that might have been prevented
there.
forensic experts will study the rubble and
ashes of the branch davidian compound , where at
least 85 people , including 24 children , perished in
smoke and fire caused by theapocalyptic visions of
a manipulative madman and a stunning lapse in
judgment by federal law enforcement officials.
emphasis added by me
investigators will re create conditions at the
compound and identify accelerants and other fac
tors fueling the inferno. that is their strong suit.
but the public must question why agents of the
federal bureau of investigation lacked the oper
ational skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve
the 51 day standoff free of flames and fury.
the loss of life most clearly reflects the demen
tia of cult leader david koresh , whose personal
delusiosn are now seared on the public conscious
ness. his assembly of davidians had stockpiles of
arms and had used them. little in the way of
rationality could be expected from koresh , a self
confsesed sinner without equal.
what continues to mystify are th eactions of
federal agents , who bungled the case from the
start. the misadventure began on feb. 28 when
100 agents of the federal bureau of alcohol , to
bacco and firearms storemd the compound , intent
on seizing koresh and a cache of automatic weap
ons. four agents and an estimated six cult mem
bers died inteh ensuing gun battle. earlier
oppor tunities to isolate and arrest koresh outside the
complex had not been adequately explored.
authorities prepared a siege and resolved that
those deaths would be the last. fifty one days into
the siege there was no public outcry to storm the
compound.
it had been correctly perceived that the chil
dren inside rancho apocalypse were essentially
hostages. with their lives at stake , there was no
reason for the government to be impatient. the
government 's superior firepower , control of water
and utilities and freedom of movement created the
conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution.
neither attorney general janet reno nor the
fbi has provided a sigle compelling reason for
abandondoning the course of patience.
if intelligence was accurate and koresh was
growing increasingly violent and bizarre , it is diffi
cult to see how a tear gas attack launched by an
m 60 combat vehicle would clear his mind. if re
ports of escalating child abuse were accurate , they
would have to be weighted against the potential for
eve ngreated hamr.


etc etc tec....
paragraphs , 2.5 paragraphs deleted

but some of the responsibility rests with clinton ,
and inexperienced president who did not pay
enough attention to the life and death decisions
being made on waco.
if reno is to be faulted for anything , ti would
be for her overreliance on the judgment of law en
forcement officers a common problem among
prosecutors.
full investigations into th ewaco tragedy must
be conducted by both the executive and legislative
branches. the first step is to verify how the blaze
started. though apportioning blame will play a
role , it is of greater importnace to find strategies
to elude the fire next time.

the press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the

my opinions

i find this disturbing.

good. keep thinking critically.

while i believe that koresh is largely
responsible for not ending this standoff in a peacable manner during the
last 51 days of patient opportunity , i find the secrecy surrounding the
aftermath more damaging to the authorities' position than they realize.

what if the secrecy is actually less damaging than the alternative \?

i am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered
by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility , imho. as such ,
my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

please also note that i by no means endorse or agree with the many

...gun buyback programs will hopefully
have an impact on accidental shootings (especially youths) , domestic
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level
crime.

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on
any of these things \? evidence , please \?

please do n't misinterret what i was saying joe. i was making the point
tha
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
of common incidents.

if you 're a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps
you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the
rate of accidental death from other single causes \? follow that perhaps
with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners
spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death
among children in the u.s. is a serious problem.

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under. i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents.
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths \?
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem \? i assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.


any death is serious. wanna discuss match control \? firearms related
unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or
more negligent persons , not the gun.

more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the
community. in that sense , i think they might do a little good.

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good.

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were
useful.


providing false hope , then , is the intent \?


i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or
brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135 , 000 youths) are
obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often
borrowed from a parent without their knowledge.

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun)
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students
who carry a gun to school daily.

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence
or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
the cphv reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access
to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200 increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88. these are the statistics .


200 increase in california schools , eh \? gun control is working fine , there !


thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah (got news
for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours
presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they
were in danger).

holding kids \? time for a reality check , son. these kids were the
children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were
outside waiting to kill them. would you send your children out the door
if you believed as they did \?

okay , maybe i worded it wrong...dad. i meant that to put children in a
situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is
would not let innocent children die.
if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive \? thanks for the reality check joe , its been real.

so your religion is different. does that make it his wrong \? even assuming
koresh actually made that decision , and the verdict is still out on that.

no surrender !
delivered by lenda jackson at the rkba rally in denver , april 18 , 1993

it is a fact of modern life that urban residents , particularly women , feel
threatened. a certain number of them actually are threatened. there are
immediate threats , the things that women will tell you they 're afraid
of. the noise downstairs at night. the lonely walk to the car. the
stranger at the door. the abusive husband , finally kicked out of the
house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. the burglar... the
mugger...the rapist.

and what are we told is the solution \? move. get a dog. keep the door
locked. call the police. as a next to last resort , learn martial arts. and
always , there 's the implied question what 's a pretty little thing like
you doing without a husband around to protect you \?

but what if you do n't like dogs \? like living alone \? do n't have 10
years to devote learning judo \?

what if , after examining the facts , a woman learns that rape victims
using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed
and were less likely to be injured(kleck , 124) than those using any
other form of resistance (kleck , 126) (also true for
robbery assault)(kleck , 123)

what if , to our horror and despair , we find that citizens cannot depend
on the police for effective protection they usually respond after a
crime has been committed. in truth , the supreme court has held that
the police are not responsible for protecting any individual , only the
whole community.

as a society , are we going to ask women , once again , to sacrifice
themselves \? are we going to continue to deny women the ability to
help themselves \?

here 's a thought. neil smith , in his book the probability broach , says
no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110
pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out. but if
a woman decides to protect herself , with the easiest , most efficient
means possible , people especially other women are horrified.
eughh , how could you \? i 'd be terrified ! they ask. how could you
hurt someone \? they 'll repeat the lie it 'll just get taken away from
you. in truth , 1 of defensive gun uses result in the offender taking
the gun away from the victim.(122 , kleck)

well , despite the lies , and the social pressure , some of us have already
made that hard choice. we 've decided that we are not going to be
victimized by the muggers , burglars or rapists. we 're buying more
guns than every before. we 're learning how to use them and teaching
others , women and men , how to use them. most importantly , we are
preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense.
we 're taking our own security , literally , into our own hands. we 're
going to stop begging and pleading and marching and what we
intend is to really take back the night.

but there 's another threat , more insatiable than any mugger , more
secretive than any burglar , more soul destroying than any rapist.

that menace is government , and it threatens us all. we know that
governments , throughout time , have suppressed rights and oppressed
people. it 's the way they survive.

in our names and with our money , it interferes with innocent people
both at home and abroad. it lies to us , cheats us , steals from us and
threatens us with violence. no one knows exactly what it 'll do next
what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides
it 's for your own safety or we know best . any person who acted
like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his
life and locked up as a habitual offender.

but this monster called government persists , and grows. and we , who
should be its masters , have become its unwilling slaves. do you doubt
me \? then why did you file your income tax \?

like any reasonable person , i believe that being afraid of something
that can hurt you is smart , and that paranoia is n't crazy if someone 's
really after you. and make no mistake , they 're after you and they 're
after me. their names are familiar brady and reynolds , groff ,
metzenbahm , moynihan , and clinton. if we 're lucky , they 'll settle for
our assault rifles , our shotguns , our handguns and our ammunition.

as citizens , we have only two choices. they are the same two choices
given to women to surrender or to fight.

surrender leads to the gulag , to the genocide of pol pot , to the
disappearances , to dachau. i do not intend to surrender.

a battle can be philosophical or political in the main , the people keep
the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. but if
they have to , they will keep in mind the words of thomas jefferson
the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots.

as a patriot , i will point out the error in the government 's ways. i will
do my best to vote the villains out of office. i will protest , and write ,
and speak , and teach our children justice , honor and truth. and always
remember that rebellion can lead to bunker hill and saratoga......or it
can lead to tiananmen square.

when the time comes to stand up , if i have to give my life to keep
them from going too far , if there is a tiananmen square in our future ,
i intend to be there. and no matter what lies they tell and no matter
what laws they pass , i intend to meet them with something more
substantial in my hand than a brick.

my opinions are , of course , my own.

original article

the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal 's article
on paxton quigley , including the nefarious little paragraph the journal
tacked onto the end. after recieving much assistance from various t.p.g.
type folks , i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph ,
and surprise , surprise , surprise , they published it. the text follows.
the colorado daily , btw , is the university of colorado (boulder) student
(i think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup , but every little bit , i guess...

(the title was the only thing they changed added)

gun stats

the daily recently reprinted an article from the
wall street journal , primarily concerned with paxton
quigley , author of armed and female. the article ,
in turn , cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the new england journal of medicine. the
article states , a study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner ,
spouse , a friend , or child than to kill an intruder. this
is an often quoted statistic , and it is misleading for sev
eral reasons , outlined below

the study gives the impression that , if you own a
gun , the likelihood that you will successfully use it to
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you. the study , however , fails to take into
account cases where a law abiding citizen uses a gun
to thwart a crime , without actually killing the perpe
trator.

the study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'. this would include the friendly neigh
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork , every
month , the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check. possibly an acquaintance , but hardly a
friend.

the nejm study is based on the immediate dis
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self defense. especially considering the small sample
size (396) , taking these events into account has a sub
stantial effect on the 43 1 ratio quoted.

criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif
erent statistic a gun is 33 times more likely to be
used , successfully , by a private citizen against an
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further , per
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means , or who offer no resistance at all.
statistics available from the fbi and other agencies
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide , 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody , and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu
rate conclusion from them.

in article 93112.153005mgb@slacvm.slac.stanford.edu ,
from a.p. according to numerous accounts by those in the compound ,
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane
tank , and turning over numerous gas lanterns.

oh \? then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places \?
in particular , three different places where there were no apv 's \?

according to an ap report (from texas , written by jaime aron) this morning ,
in addtion to the gas pumped in by hoses from cs generators , canisters of
tear gas were thrown into the building from armored vehicles , one of the
canisters hitting a man inside in the face.

this was in the part of the article before going into differences in
the stories told by bd survivors and the gov't.

tear gas canisters used to be able to start fires...

nothing could at this point. what would have gone a long way toward
convincing me would have been media video , particularly from diverse
sources. imho , if the government did n't have anything to hide , they
would have allowed cameras near the compound from the beginning.

i agree , i saw no reason they could not have had close in pool
cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever.

points made by dick degueran , koresh 's lawyer
the tanks were not pumping cs gas but were ejecting exploding
canisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls
before exploding.

okay , their word against the fbi 's at this point. see ya in court !

the tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people
at great risk.

dear , dear. they could have come out.

the construction of the coupound used almost all used materials that
were very dry and bails of hay were stacked against the walls as
shields against the government 's bullets.

okay , they were living in a fire hazard. that they built.

said that previous to the invasion there were no military drills
and that the supplies they had on hand were for survival.

no crime , irrelevant either way.

their gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible
study and some were sleeping when the fire was set.

ah yes , that is exactly what i would do. hold bible study. take a nap.
always a wise course of action when you 're being gassed.

there was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his
aids after the tank invasion (referring to any kind of suicide
pact or counter assault efforts.)

i do n't believe there was a suicide pact . i believe that koresh
wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers.
in fact , this hypothesis is confirmed by the survivors' stories.

everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape
the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set.

yes , that 's right. and once the whole compound was demolished , where
did they expect to go \?

women and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from
the tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the
building and distorting the frames.

the building is being rammed and they are going upstairs \? that 's almost
as bad as running into a fire.

hallways ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for
the fire and trapped almost everyone in place. his experts have told
him that this horizonal chimney effect is what made the fire appear
to have started at several places at once.

hm , an interesting notion. we 'll see.

koresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to
be in his 4th floor room with some of his children.

more bible study , no doubt. hey , it 's a priority .

the texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies
recovered so far had bullet wounds , directly contradicting the fbi 's
lies.

actually , on friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and
he could not flatly contradict the federal agents' claims. we 'll know
more later. in any event , it 's irrelevant.

the survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten
out they would have , that they were trapped by the tank destroyed
building and the speed of the fire.

for six hours they were trapped \? the building was not destroyed
immediately. they could have left at any time.

the underground bunker cited by the fbi as the place koresh could have
put the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked
by the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door.

six hours to move it away. or come out.

dick said that he had sat in koresh 's bedroom talking to him and
had observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without
air condition or other luxuries , directly contradicting the fbi 's claim
that he lived in splendor.

irrelevant , anyway. pr one way or the other , but no crime or innocence
indicated.

dick saw bullet holes in koresh 's room made from the outside in
which indicates the batf was indiscriminately shooting down through
the roof.

no word on whether they were being fired back at , which is an operative
question here.

the fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over coleman lanterns
that were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted
through , though none of the survivors saw the fire start.

right. for six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at
any point , and you leave a coleman lantern burning. near bales of hay.

every one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the
fbi about starting the fire , hearing someone say the fire was lit
or any of the other stuff attributed to them by the fbi.

it 's ultimately irrelevant who lit the fire. they had ample opportunity
to leave.

he said when he first met koresh in the compound he expected to find
a raving lunatic but instead found a rational , charming and intelligent
young man and was very surprised by that fact.

most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent , actually. they tend
to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators. (ex. ted bundy.)

koresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain.

medical assistance was jsut a phone call away. gee , all he had to do
was come out.

women with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids
that were appointed as nicely as koresh 's.

not relevant to any crimes.

dick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time
did he ever see any signs of abuse.

while he was there. anyway , outsiders rarely see abuse. it 's a secretive
thing. all we have to go on are the court documents in the jewell case
and the mistrial in california.

no one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any
time. the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their
own choices.

exactly. by their own choice.

he called for an independent prosecutor. if ever there were a need
for one , this is it.

looks like there will be several investigations , starting with congressional
committee hearings next week....

his closing comments were they do n't look upon themselves as a cult.
they view themselves as highly religious people. they sincerely believe
what they believe. and who am you or i to judge that as wrong \?

his last sentence says it all. who the hell are we (or the government)
to judge their religion as wrong. this event , i hope , will be recorded
in history as the american holocaust. these people were murdered
by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis.
i hang my head in shame for what i 've allowed my government to become.

i have never judged them by their religion , but by their actions.

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would
have been no raid , no siege , and no deaths. instead , they chose courses
of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not
irrational. the first was to stockpile weapons. the second was to
shoot federal agents. the third was to stay inside.

just as we do n't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy
weapon at him , i do n't think the fbi deserves blame in this case.


the koresh cult standoff is over ... may his victims recquiescat in pace

how fast the fire spread ponted to someone dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire starter.
lots of house fires give off black sooty smoke. and as far as
the speed of the fire the winds were gusting to 30mph at least
that day. i guess you 're forgetting the way oakland and berkeley

so made the decision. he and his followers also probably felt that they
were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff). thsi conclusion , i came

people like you cheapen our constitution by using it to defend sociopaths
who are n't deserved of it. get a life and chill on the paranoia.


i do n't care about cults . there 's no language problem here. my problem is
with religious fanatics (claiming to be god is just a little bit
unsettling) stockpiling several years' supply of canned foods and enough
weapons to hold off a company (not to mention the atf , which ed up in
the first place) and talking about how they 're going to take care of all
of the unbelievers. but granted , up to that moment , he 'd done nothing
wrong. i recognize and respect that.

then the atf discovers he does n't have proper permits for some of his
purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them.


a batf offense , if true.

then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child
abuse be refiled. there have been interviews with some parents whose
children were in the compound at some point. these parents claimed
psychological and sexual abuse. the childrens' statements supported these
charges.

a local offense , if true. totally outside the batf 's domain.


was it a 'no knock \? ' i really have n't heard anything on that. but clearly
he was not just another guy minding his own business. hell , give them all
the guns in the world if they do n't bother anyone. but he was a scary sort ,
do n't you think \?

i did n't know the man. just what the tv chose to tell me.

i thought there were prejudicial undertones here. i would trust my daughter 's
judgement.

i
did n't think so. reason number one to doubt the legal statements made by
some of the survivors. (note that some of them were made by his 'guard , '
well hesitate to say expertly trained killers).

i do n't believe either side blindly.

then he fired on the atf. that 's not just a little mistake , or some
red white and blue american defending his home against big brother.

if they fired first , without announcing in a beleivable way who they were ( i
can pound on your door and claim to be the police , will you just lay down and
take it if i do \? ) , then he could be justified in firing on the atf in
self defense.

that
shit does n't fly. anyone with his background that will shoot and kill
federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade

then post what the press has said , not what you wished they said.
the medical examiner has refuted the fbi facts and if you do n't
believe someone who has a lot more reason to be impartial then
what do you have to say for yourself.

in the interest of accuracy (seems a liitle late to start
that , i know) the medical examiner has not contradicted
the fbi.

the fbi said they found some folks who had been shot in
the head , and the medical examiner said we have not seen
evidence of this .

at the time the medical examiner said that , they were dealing
with charred bodies in the compound this sounds like
typical medical examiner not releasing details until
a thorough investigation. the medical examiner saying
he has n't seen something is not the same thing as saying

no , you were right the first time. law enforcement agencies should keep
his opinions in mind before breaking into or assaulting anybody's house.

ok , let me correct my unfortunate choice of words i just hope that the
law enforcement agencies keep your attitude in mind the next time your
wife is gang raped by a bunch of juvenile , drug dealing thugs while she
was jogging in the park. no , strike that... (etc.)

the batf came out with horse trailers , 100 men , ninja uniforms , machine
guns , and stun grenades , and used them before koresh could even look
at the warrant. koresh fought back , and people died.

the key part of this sentense is koresh fought back. this was his big
mistake. when the police decide to exert their authority over you , you
do n't fight back unless you want people to get hurt. you cease all
resistance and signal your submission to their authority. the cops

they are the boss. you are the subject. the concept of defense against
illegal action under color of law is kaput. no longer is it government
of the people by the people , its government of the people by the biggest
guns. the idea of 'sorting it out in court later' is fine , but one
has to get to court in one piece to do that. korash had good reason
to think that he was not going to get that chance. (see below).

are n't in it to beat up and kill people , in spite of the actions of a
few bad apples. if you quit resisting , they quit hitting. perhaps the
batf did over react to the threat posed by koresh. perhaps they did use
too much force. ok , fine. i'm willing to concede to that point if
sufficient proof is produced (and i admit that there is some evidence to
indicate this). however , resisting the batf is the worst thing koresh
could have done. if they had n't resisted , there is a good chance that
no one would have been hurt. remeber , they were using stun grenades ,
not anti personnel grenades. if the bds were not in violation of any

rember , korash did n't get to sort this all out , serenely typing at his
keyboard. he heard some kind of explosives go off , he saw he was being
attacked with no overt action from him (yet). he could no more say 'oh ,
its ok , its only stun grenades' anymore than i could. he slammed the door at
that point and proceeded to repel the attackers. he felt in genuine fear
of his life i know i would be in fear of my life at that point. have
you ever been shot at \? how clear and logically could you think , under
that pressure , when you might have all of 1 or 2 seconds to evaluate
what is going on \? and , it would not be the first time that 'law
enforcements' intended to bring in their suspect horizontally. for
all we know , he was informed by someone saying something like hey ,
guy , the batf is coming like gangbusters , and they mean to waste you...

according to the latest news , the released warrant (so we are told) said
the reason for this ww iii raid was that korash 's group had spent around
200 , 000.00 on firearms and related stuff (over an undetermined period).
now , even assuming that the figure is n't calculated like the feds do a
drug siezure , for 90 people , that is n't really all that much (you priced
decent guns lately \? ). hell , i can think of a person right now that probably
has that much for one individual , mostly machineguns ! ! ! sure , he is
an avid collector , but unless a new law has been passed , it is not illegal ,
nor an indication of anything illegal , to have a lot of guns. also note
that the warrant had nothing to say about machine guns. so , what
is the justification of this cowboy raid , other than a romp gone bad
for some anti gun media hype , to support clinton 's push for disarming
the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons \?
this administration has only one thing in mind. control. people control.
whether it is gun control , clinton cripple chip , national smart id cards ,
it all boils down to people control. can you say 1984 , only 10 years late \?
i knew you could... )

laws , they would have been released as they had been before. if this
had happened and it turned out that the batf had used too much force ,
then the bds would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges
of civil rights violations (sounds a lot like la , huh \? do n't take that
wrong , i'm not commenting one way or the other about the rodney king
case). but that 's not what they wanted. they got tipped off that the
batf was on the way in , and rather than adopting a non violent ,
non threatening posture to greet the batf , they decided to fight.

and batf knew the bds were expecting them (via 60 minutes report). but
they decided they were so big , so bad , they would have a cakewalk at
the bds expense , for a nice media show anyway. but it all turned to
shit , and the fbi taking over to manage things , we see it all turned to
shit , too. clinton says 'i am taking full responsibility'... bah.
responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong. bet
you nobody pays any serious repercussions. 'responsibility' only has
meaning as media pr , or as a means to corner the average joe schmoe.
figure it out... clinton , reno , the fbi and batf , will all be immune.
can you say whitewash \?

i 've said enough of this issue. i'm probably not going to convince any
of you folks and you 're certainly not going to convince me. i 've got
work to do.

don

be very afraid of our government. in the land of the free...
and if you decide all this is acceptable , get even more afraid... especially
when it is you they decide , for some reason , they dislike...
when they no longer feel the need to confine their cowboy tactics to
'kooks' , or 'wierdos'...

will believe all of the factoids being given out as fact by the

cnn reported tonight that some bodies were found with bullet holes in their
heads. however , i have no information on the possible causes.

this is not to say that government stories are to be taken at the face value in
this case , but to jump to conclusion at this stage may be the source of

good now let 's look at those sections. they 'll prove my point.

(a) a person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he
knowingly

(4) carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person
except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business
any pistol , revolver , stun gun or taser or other firearm

note that this does n't affect all concealed carry. (look after the

it.

would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed \? how about someone at

remember me , tom \? i hope you 'll respond , and i seem to
be a voice of reason or some such (i 've been recieving fan mail ,
so naturally my ego is somehwat inflated of late) , and hope to
make a few points here.

i have never spoken for a ban against guns in america !
what i 've said is that there seems to be to many of them , and especially
to many in wrong hands....

and our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who do n't. a
fairly simple problem , given our size and numbers. do you agree \? we
all believe criminals , particularly violent criminals , should not have
firearms. the problem is making a law that does this without trodding
upon the rights of the vast majority. nobody here seems to be able to
do it , and i doubt anybody in norway can either. thus , we are left with
a philosophical difference does the safety of a few justify restricting
the many \? we say no , while others say yes.

now if you would like to reduce the number , how would you do it without
affecting good responcible gun owners \? \?

can you provide a method that cannot be abused \? i doubt it.

i do believe in a persons freedom.
what i do n't believe is that you can have it all and do n't pay for it.

of course. this is not in contention. what is in contention
is how much one has to pay.

most europeans believe in a society of individuals , and that you have
to give 'a little' to make that society work.

it is this giving a little that makes americans wary...
we have seen this argument before. you might remember how a
chamberlain gave a little to a particular fascist short asshole ,
and how such appeasement worked. while it might work in some
instances , it does n't work in others , and since we cannot predict
the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a
history of failure.

cars and guns should really not be mixed , i just tried to make a point.
like america , norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b ,
so a car is essential in most parts....
guns on the other hand are not essential in norway , so we do n't
argue that if we 'banned' guns we have to ban cars.....

cars are not essential in norway any more than they are in
the usa. i'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price. thus ,
cars are not essential for your transportation. however , the
arguments presented show that , since cars are used to kill far more
people than guns in the usa , it makes much more sense to restrict
cars than it does guns. how one defines essential often depends
upon what one is willing to go through for that service. when we
look at the raw data , such comparisons are not individually weighed.

everyone who believe that hitler and ww2 could be avoided if there were
more guns in germany in the 30 's please read some history !

this depends upon what the populace was willing to do. as
desert storm proved , even an armed populace wo n't just revolt even
when given a chance. still , would hitler have done all that he did
with an armed populace \? we have to wonder , as some of his first
acts were to confiscate firearms. other points in history show
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace.
thus , we 're left wondering if hitler would have been overthrown
or if king george was just unlucky in keeping the usa as a colony.
one can argue both sides one also has to live with each action.

is this discussion about
1. banning weapons for all americans
or
2. making it harder for criminals to get one \? \?

it is about 2 , but so far all proposals to curtail 2 have
wound up enforcing 1 as well. i only wish that or was so logical.

change of name.......

that was , on my part , purely in jest. i merely pointed out
how we were from similar backgrounds racially , but of wholly different
backgrounds politically. i thought this would underscore my point on
how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage.

did the batf get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons.
(child abuse for instance)

batf can only enforce gun tobaccco alcohol violations. child
abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities.

does n't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari.news.
hierarcy \? \? (some seems rather mis uninformed)

that hierarchy is a paid for feed at many sites. most people do
not get it for this reason , and i suspect money , not censorship , is the
main reason. do you get alt.sex at your site \? i ca n't read it here
because of censorship and legal fears , so again our differences show.

some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of
support among conservatives for some individuals in prep. for '96 run.

you 'd be close to the truth.

their two leading spokesmen are bill bennett , former 'drug czar' who heartily
supported bush 's semi auto import ban , and wondered if it went far enough
who helped put the big lie about 'sporting use' into the public 's eye and
jack kemp who recently came out in support of semi auto bans.

these are conservatives \?

anyway i thought it interesting that when i ran word perfect 's spell check

1. banned
2. bayonet


needless to say , i found these choices rather amusing.

what happened to the separation of church and state \?

then the atf discovers he does n't have proper permits for some of his
purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them.

i have yet to see any evidence of this , either. from what i hear the
original warrant (the reason for the feb. raid) is still sealed. what are
unsealed seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid.

then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child
abuse be refiled. there have been interviews with some parents whose
children were in the compound at some point.

funny , i have n't seen any of these interviews.
interesting that when the social services agencies investigated koresh on
these previous charges , they found absolutely no evidence of abuse.

these parents claimed
psychological and sexual abuse. the childrens' statements supported these
charges.

funny , i do n't remember hearing anything about childrens' statements ,
either. where did you say you heard all this \?

what i heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in
the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse , physical or mental. this
from the newspaper and national tv news.

did you also hear that it 's the job of the batf and the fbi to lay siege to
homes where child abuse is suspected \? i thought you did.

was it a 'no knock \? ' i really have n't heard anything on that. but clearly
he was not just another guy minding his own business.

clearly \? please tell us what koresh was doing that can be construed as
other than minding his own business before the batf raided the place.

cavalierly you throw away people 's protection of law because you think
they 're scary and not the sort of person you 'd want your daughter to

then he fired on the atf. that 's not just a little mistake , or some

shit does n't fly.

because you said so , right \? right.

anyone with his background that will shoot and kill
federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade
enjoys our support.

so someone with a different background , say someone who did n't claim to be
the messiah , in your book could shoot and kill federal law enforcement

he 's a loose cannon. just my opinion...

the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal 's article
on paxton quigley , including the nefarious little paragraph the journal
tacked onto the end. after recieving much assistance from various t.p.g.
type folks , i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph ,
and surprise , surprise , surprise , they published it. the text follows.
the colorado daily , btw , is the university of colorado (boulder) student
(i think) newspaper... not exactly a big coup , but every little bit , i guess...

(the title was the only thing they changed added)

gun stats

the daily recently reprinted an article from the
wall street journal , primarily concerned with paxton
quigley , author of armed and female. the article ,
in turn , cites a misleading statistic that was originally
reported in the new england journal of medicine. the
article states , a study... found that a gun in the home
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner ,
spouse , a friend , or child than to kill an intruder. this
is an often quoted statistic , and it is misleading for sev
eral reasons , outlined below

the study gives the impression that , if you own a
gun , the likelihood that you will successfully use it to
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned
against you. the study , however , fails to take into
account cases where a law abiding citizen uses a gun
to thwart a crime , without actually killing the perpe
trator.

the study actually refers to 'acquaintances' rather
than 'friend'. this would include the friendly neigh
borhood thug who shows up like clockwork , every
month , the second your grandmother cashes her social
security check. possibly an acquaintance , but hardly a
friend.

the nejm study is based on the immediate dis
position of cases and fails to take into account cases
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be
self defense. especially considering the small sample
size (396) , taking these events into account has a sub
stantial effect on the 43 1 ratio quoted.

criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif
erent statistic a gun is 33 times more likely to be
used , successfully , by a private citizen against an
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further , per
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a
gun fare better than those who resist vicimization by
some other means , or who offer no resistance at all.
statistics available from the fbi and other agencies
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be
used by a non criminal to defend against criminal threat
than to be used to commit criminal homicide , 535 times
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal
threat than to accidentally kill anybody , and 50 times
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be
used to commit suicide.

it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has
to consider carefully what questions were asked by
those gathering the data before one can draw an accu
rate conclusion from them.

freed om of religion has absolutely nothing to do with building a small

as soon as i finish my manuscript on the seven seals. oh , ok , david.

i agree that koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because
he grew up inside the cult , and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego.

that does n't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons. or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds.

this was no move fuck up. a helicoptor was thermal imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
there were no cs canisters... a specially modified abrams was pupming the
stuff in. no chance of starting a fire there. kerosene lamps \? maybe one ,
but not three fires. no way. koresh was n't just talking out of his ass. i
expected this to happen.

maybe they wanted it to look like murder. he had 50 days. i think this was
coming the whole time. he did n't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the cs seige. he put them up into the tower
to die. fuck all of you big brother paranoid freaks. the only good thing
to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to

david koresh 's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out
peacefully sooner or later. the fbi and atf had nothing but time on
their hands ! why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
this senseless tragedy \? their job is to protect the public and save
lives not kill people for crying out loud.

koresh had lied and lied and lied about coming out of the
compound. to the fbi. to his lawyer. to just about everyone.

i keep hearing this , but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two. as far as i am concerned , i am not
ready to stipulate that koresh ever promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise.

the first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given
national exposure. well , it never was it was broadcast locally ,
in a chopped up fashion , and that 's all. and even then , they cleverly
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded national exposure ,
but not so cleverly that we did n't hear it.

the last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.
we 'll never know if he would have kept that one.

the fbi etc. ca n't wait forever for koresh to come out. as
long as they thought that koresh 's intended to surrender
peacefully. when they lost hope in that , they decided to go
in.

strangely enough , the previous day they said they were prepared to
wait as long as it takes.

further , while the mondays tactics were silly and clumsy ,
they were obviously intended to drive the davidians out of the
compound , not to kill koresh and his followers.

quite possible. but arguments of intent do not mark the dividing
line between guilt and innocence only the line between murder and
negligent manslaughter.

if it is true. i read in the paper that the government
listening devices inside the compound picked up orders to
burn the joint down shortly before the fire was started. i'm
waiting to see what the tapes really hold.

this would be an interesting development.

the davidian may be telling the truth , or he may be lying
to save his skin from possible murder charges resulting from
the blaze. koresh 's lawyer , being the attorney for at least
one surviving davidian , has an interest in claiming that
the gov't caused the fire , at least as much as the gov't
has an interest in blaming koresh for the fire. it 's the
physical evidence that will decide who 's telling what.

it 's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to go state 's
evidence , parrot the fbi story , hang the whole suicide on koresh ,
claim they only stayed at gunpoint , etc. if any of them do this
in the next few weeks , it does n't prove much but if none of them
do , it would be a strong indication to me that the fbi story is
dead wrong.

people are getting killed by gang violence every day \? every single day i hear
about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the weapo s

is kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an m 16

a full auto uzi \? that he can see the difference between the various
versions (some full auto , some semi auto only) of the m 11 9 \?

well , let me see. uzi , no. m 11 9 , no.

i see that i misphrased my question. i should have asked which
full autos kratz can accurately distinguish from semi auto
look alikes. i should have also included some semi auto only guns in
my list to see if he 'd ask how to distinguish them from their
non existent full auto relatives .

let 's do the former now. kratz has claimed that he can visually
distinguish full autos from semi autos. for which full autos is he
making that claim \? how does he do it \? let 's get specific , and as
exhaustive as possible.

m 16 ar 15 , maybe. i remember there
being a selector swtich on the ar 15. if i remember correctly (please correct
me if i'm wrong) the switch would set to an off position or an on position
because the gun (ar 15) is semi automatic. would n't the m 16 have a position
for semi auto fire and full auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts) \?

maybe \? why is kratz asking about what he told us that he knows \?

is kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from
a two position switch via tv inspection \? (does he even get to see the
switch in the typical police display of guns \? ) note that one might
well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection
even though it wo n't be seen on tv. and to think that kratz was
telling us that seeing it on tv was just as accurate as being
there....

how about the other guns \? do they also have selector switch to switch between
semi auto and fully auto fire \?

why all the questions \? kratz assured us that he could make this distinction
and now he 's asking us how he did it....

well , what about what i said above \? if that is correct i guess tv would be
acceptable (if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower
receiver of the ar 15 m 16).

what about it \? it only demonstrates that , as i predicted , kratz
was blowing smoke on this.

andy gave kratz a chance to back down on this in private

jason kratz did n't take andy 's offer to back down in private

what a load of crap ! the bds had absolutely no right to fire
upon the batf agents. if they did n't know who they were at
first , then they should have surrendered immediately when they
did realize who they were dealing with. little groups of loonies
do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey
or what sorts of warrants are justified. like the rest of us ,
they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal
wants are not backed by the majority of voters , then too bad.
if they wanted to keep automatic weapons , then they could apply
for the proper permits. if they had a problem with the warrant
then they get to argue that in court. in no event do they get
to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend
that our laws and law enforcement personel have no jurisdiction
within their borders. you live on us territory , you live by
us laws period. (unless you are a congressman)

sure , the situation was handled badly by both the batf and
the fbi. it would have been all so easy to detain koresh and
his core members while they were out in the streets of waco.
the batf , threatened with budget cuts , was trying for a
propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big
commando style assault is proof of that. they should be
roasted for both their imcompetance and their mindset. on the
other hand , they did have the legal right to do what they did.
once the attack was begun , they should have pressed on and
finished it rather than let an interminable situation like that
take root.

the fbi also used poor judgement in a number of ways but again ,
the laws we voters have approved , or the lawmakers who created
them , gave them the right to do what they did. if batf and
the fbi are latter day gestapo , it is because the voters have
allowed them to become that way. waco was pure americana
militarist mentality , religious fanaticism and unadulterated
violence all rolled into one experience. we get what we pay
for , or vote for , and this was the result of many choices
we have made over the years. do n't blame 'them' blame
ourselves. we made 'them' , we are 'them'.

while it may mean that in 1993 , the relevant meaning comes from 1789.
moreover , controlled does n't tell you who 's doing the controllling.

fletcher 's political works , pub 'd in 1749 , defines a well regulated

note that the first clause has a meaning it is a restriction on

i`m not saying you should ban guns , or that you should take them away
from responsible owners.

but this is all gun control laws end up doing. politicians can never
manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally , so all their
laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally.

karen mcnutt , a local attorney , states that there are about two million
licensed gun owners in massachusetts. in the past year , the number of
licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like six.
yet , there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year.

does passing laws that will further restricting only those people already
obeying laws pay any dividents \?

all i`m saing is that guns should be treated with respect from owners , sellers
and legislators.

so far , i 've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators.

i believe guns are a problem in many countries and that crime rates
would fell if they were more restricted.

believe it 's not necessary to take this on faith. go look at the history
of countries that passed gun restrictions. pay particular attention to
whether or not violent crime was higher before the restrictions and lower
after. (do n't look at violent gun crimes , that 's begging the question.)
you may be very surprised.

if all crimes done with guns stopped and all accidents also stopped or
was reduced to a minimum then i would consider lifting all gun control.

you have this absolutely backwards. if crime stopped in the presence of
strict gun control , there is no way i would consider lifting any of it.
however , if gun control made absolutely no improvement in the violent
crime rate , that's when i would have it lifted. think about it.

so far , none of the stats show any improvement...

likevise if car accidents fell to a minimum in europe , i (and probably
most people i know) would demand easier drivers tests.
(ca. 20 hours and more than 2500 today....)

do you really think driver 's tests are any indication of your propensity
for having accidents \?

i 've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while
drunk after having been up all night with two fighting kids in the
back seat with a hot cup of coffee on their lap or while putting on
makeup , reading the newspaper , or talking on their cellular phone.
but that 's what they 're doing when they have those accidents.

in other words we should have legislation because it`s neccacery ! !

how can anything that has no positive effect at all ever be necessary \?

the one gun month case in virginia
i was thinking about the reactions on the proposal...
loud screeming about civil rights and 2. amendment.

and it did n't help , any of it.

you people are rather amusing in a perverse sort of way. you take

assign blame to anybody and everybody with or without a link to the incident
simply because they do n't fit your extremely narrow definition of good.

how is clinton responsible \? it was a law enforcement action.
granted , it was a nationally covered incident but clinton had no more to
do with the outcome than fred flintstone.

perhaps you 've been under a rock the last few days \? the batf and the fbi
are both federal agencies. clinton has admitted in front of news cameras
that janet reno (the once and future attorney general) gave him a full
briefing of what was planned before they did it , and he gave her the
go ahead.

maybe , just possibly , that makes him a teensy bit responsible \?


the fbi , cia , batf , etc. are federal agencies , you are correct. but to
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the prez , and
that these agencies inform reno who informs clinton , etc. is naive. these
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
ultimate accountability to the prez , they make their own moves , and then
tell the prez , who says , i knew all along . while this may not seem right ,
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
leading to the white house , thats the way it is. bureaucracys are not , after
all , composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis , have lunch , and
maybe golf together. i do agree , the fbi , batf messed up. i'm not sure if
they should have stormed the compound or not. by the way , jehova witnesses
are a religious minority in this country. protestantism is a minority
religion in the world. bds were a cult by all definitions and history of
cults. to say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
koresh said he was the messiah. i was raised a baptist , although i do
not practice the religion and do not think that the big guy upstairs is
digging the divisiveness , closemindedness , and right wing morons that are
associated with the religion. anyway , the messiah that i was taught about
would not be carrying a gun , let alone stockpiling weapons. you can doubt
batf reports all you want , david koresh was not a poor soul who was
unjustly persecuted. while some of the information coming from the u.s
government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side , i
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
are true. anyway , this is just another excuse to try and blame president
clinton for something. people who attempt to do this for political motives
should be ashamed. they are the ones who are keeping this country from
reaching its full potential.

note the following was released by the white house today in
conjunction with the announcement of the clipper chip
encryption technology.

fact sheet

public encryption management

the president has approved a directive on public encryption
management. the directive provides for the following

advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology.
encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access.
advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications.
these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
information age.

despite its benefits , new communications technology can also
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance. sophisticated
encryption can have this effect in the united states. when
exported abroad , it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests. in the past , it has
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests , while at the same time
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens. as
encryption technology improves , doing so will require new ,
innovative approaches.

in the area of communications encryption , the u. s. government has
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
government standard , but also permits escrowing of the keys needed
to unlock the encryption. the system for the escrowing of keys
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
only with appropriate legal authorization.

to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
and decrypt , under legal authority , electronically transmitted
information , i hereby direct the following action to be taken

installation of government developed microcircuits

the attorney general of the united states , or her representative ,
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the u.s. government developed
key escrow microcircuits in their products. the fact of law
enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from
the american public. all appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key escrow
microcircuit are made widely available to u.s. communications
hardware manufacturers , consistent with the need to ensure the
security of the key escrow system. in making this decision , i do
not intend to prevent the private sector from developing , or the
government from approving , other microcircuits or algorithms that
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key
escrow system.

key escrow

the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment. in each case , the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys. the keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits. the attorney
general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications.

procurement and use of encryption devices

the secretary of commerce , in consultation with other appropriate
u.s. agencies , shall initiate a process to write standards to
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information. i expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive.

the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to
the extent needed to preserve the government 's ability to conduct
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure
law enforcement communications. further , the attorney general
shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture
super surplus fund to effect this purchase.

not necessarily. if the body had been denatured (cooked) or dehydrated due
to the heat , a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate.
in fire aftermaths , bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of
meat with little effort. medical examiners tend not to like cleaning up
such scenes.

as such , if the body had been suitably cooked , a bullet comming from a
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the
time of death , or much later , unless you were trained to look for the
evidence. texas rangers are not pathologists.

p.vasilion

this is quite corect , but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy
will show virtually no deformation , ie a hollow point probably would not
expand , an fmj would be pristene . also the bullets will not be marked
with the lands ang grooves of a barrel , because they did n't come out of
one. a good pathologist should be able to notice this right away.

let us hope that the me 's that handle these bodies are more competent
then the ones who did jfk 's body.

speaking of me 's. the fbi said the fire victims were found face up
fire victims , apparently , are usually found face down
suggesting they died prior to the fire. the me says , in a word ,
bullshit , the victims were face down. the fbi says they sent a body

been to waco , texas lately \? yes , the government takes care of us
all , does n't it \? as long as you belong to a government sanctioned
religion.

excuse me , but did n't these gun ladden cult members threaten , shoot and kill
some people \?

they threatened no one. their neighbours thought they were a little
strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live
next door to.

one version has the batf serving a search warrant by jumping out
of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades. if
this is the true order of events then the 'cult' could not know
that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof
that these guys were police , the 'cult' had every right to defend
themselves.

torching themselves shows briliant tactics , and convinces me
they realy belong in society ...

if you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it
is not at all clear that fire was n't started by the tanks. the
people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by
the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns. the fbi is
claiming that the 'cult' started the fire.

'they realy belong in society' is a catchy phrase but
i'm personally waiting to see what the texas rangers have to say
about it all before i pass judgment. why do n't you do the same.

some more interesting facts about the waco incident

1) the original assault was conducted by batf officers wearing
an assorted types of camouflage. i saw , on cnn , at least
three different types. i would be hard pressed to identify
a bunch of guys in 'bring your own' battle fatigues as
uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to
be police.

2) the batf has been lying from the beginning
we only had handguns the original footage showed 4 batf
officers on a roof top getting shot at , one had an mp 5
assault sub machine gun.
we were out gunned sub machine guns and shotguns are the
best in quarters weapon , you ca n't be out gunned when you
have the best guns available for the job.
we did n't know they had guns that would shoot through doors !
this one is the best , there are very few guns that wo n't shoot
through a household door , or through a house wall for that
matter. since officers from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and
firearms should know that , they are either lying or incredibly
incompetent. not to mention criminally negligent if they are
shooting bullets that they think will stop when the encounter
plywood.
we had a search warrant. actually , we had an arrest warrant.
no , wait , we had both. yeah , that 's the ticket.
oh , and they 're child molesters too. and they make drugs .
did we mention we think they have rocket launchers.
the story from batf and fbi spokespeople has changed daily
and their claims were getting increasingly outrageous.

3) throughout the siege the fbi and batf have be claiming that one
of their biggest concerns was that koresh and his followers would
mass suicide. now they are claiming that that 's what he did
and that they are surprised that he did. huh \?

all in all i think that anything the fbi and batf say should be
taken with a grain or two of salt.

themselves to death.

if you wo n't believe anything the government says , and the press
is not reliable according to the same logic , then what do you base
your statements on \? wild speculation laced with a healthy dose
of paranoia \?

funny , brent , but so far we have heard two versions of the facts

1) what the government says. this includes what the government says that
two survivors have said.

2) what koresh 's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says ,
including what he says that most of the survivors have said.

strange , but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.

if anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
speaking first hand , feel free ot pitch in. i may have missed it.
but my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
case 2 , and not at all like case 1.

since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth ,
you have to weigh the 'facts' given by each yourself , and weigh it with
the newsreporting if you care.

many cult members will probably side with the attorney , and if he
is lying , change their stories to match his. and if the feds also
lie , the cult members who become disillusioned will change their
stories to match the feds.

neither sides are interested in the truth. the media is more interested ,
but usually either do n't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves
to the ratings and deliberately distort.

for me , though , the black soot billowing outside the compound added with
how fast the fire spread ponted to someone dousing large parts of the
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire starter. i doubt the feds
did that as they were more interested in arresting vernon. the real
unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool) was vernon , so
i figured that he was more likely to do it (after all he was jesus
being persecuted by the authorities , and had followers to hold onto ,
so made the decision. he and his followers also probably felt that they
were rocketing to heaven by doing this stuff). thsi conclusion , i came
to after umpteen million hours of listening to npr and other radio
shows (i always have the radio going when i am in my office on some
innocuous talk show or news program as background noise).

the b.b.c. are also reporting that bodies of b d members were found

can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes \? bullets go flying every
where. imho , these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines
went up.

unlikely. ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it
is when fired from a gun. the brass case is not capable of holding
the pressure generated by burning powder , and will (unless supported
by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber) simply split open. while
this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around , it will not
propel the bullet with any significant velocity.

in fact , it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded
cartridges by burning them. as long as you were not close enough
to take a piece of flying brass in the eye , you were reasonably safe.

thus , the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause
slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds.

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the

assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about

perhaps they did n't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the
fire from the other side \? like they were surrounded by the fire , and
rubble , which finally (combined with teargas , and combustion gasses)
overcame and enveloped them \?

in other words they were trapped by the flames , heat , fumes and rubble \?

wait a minute. the story being pushed here is that the fire started
in one place. this is not consistent with the story that they were
trapped by the fire (particularly in a building that all of a sudden
had many more exits).

does that sound plausable \? not as dramatic as korash forcing them to

a friend recorded cnn news during the gassing and incineration of
the bd 's. i went through it carefully today , and found something
very interesting. a tank is pulling out of the house , and there
is a fireball , maybe 24 across that lasts for about 1 second.
exactly ten minutes and thirty nine seconds later , the smoke starts
billowing out of that area of the building.
now , i'm no govt. spokestwinkie , so it might really have been a
weather balloon or something. perhaps someone would check it out
and comment.

according to koresh 's lawyer and some other guy (who i am not sure who he
is) , the davidians did not start the fire and apparently made several
attempts at escaping but were blocked by smoke , fire , and fbi tanks.

he states this after interviews with thoses 9 davidians that escaped.
they indicated that their was no suicide pact and that the fire was set by
the fbi (i got that impression , not sure about that).

i agree that koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because
he grew up inside the cult , and engaged in a power struggle where his
supporters helped inflate his ego.

that does n't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a
shitload of serious weapons. or that he was banging thirteen year olds and
twisting their impressionable little minds.

this was no move fuck up. a helicoptor was thermal imaging the compound
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously.
there were no cs canisters... a specially modified abrams was pupming the
stuff in. no chance of starting a fire there. kerosene lamps \? maybe one ,
but not three fires. no way. koresh was n't just talking out of his ass. i
expected this to happen.

maybe they wanted it to look like murder. he had 50 days. i think this was
coming the whole time. he did n't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the cs seige. he put them up into the tower
to die. fuck all of you big brother paranoid freaks. the only good thing

the president is not competent to plan or judge the planning of such a
raid , nor does he need to be. his job is to set basic policies and
manage the people under him. if clinton instructed reno to preserve
lives , and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as
could be , then he did his job. the president should not involve
himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations. this sort
of micromanagement only leads to disaster , as was demonstrated so well
in vietnam.

but the raid went bad over 80 civilians have been killed in a
controntation with u.s. authorities.

now clinton enters the picture in a big way. will clinton start an
investigation \? or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate \?
is he a responsible leader \? or is he only interested in protecting
the image of his administration \?

we 'll all find out as this unfolds.


excellent point , mark. we should all remember that if nixon
had n't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his
subordinates in the watergate burglary , the scandal would
never have brought down his presidency. so far , klinton seems
to be stonewalling this the same way tricky dick did. his whole
case seems to be we did n't do anything wrong . however , if
in the course of the investigation it turns out that the
gov't did do something wrong , and he tried to cover it up ,
then that 's an impeachable crime , i believe...

perhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal... can you
say wacogate , little neighbor \? ... )

just to shed some light on the fire , it was widely reported (ap , etc.) that
there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires. it has also
been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once , which
rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp , etc. as the cause.

what i would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident. i
believe the moves made were right and proper , but i still have some problems
with some of the tactics. after watching the abc special on it tonight , as
well as cnn and nightline , i question some of the atf and fbi actions.

1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at
some time before the feb. 28th raid \?

i think it was he went into town fairly often , and was known to go
jogging. this was even during the 9 month period when he was being
watched. one wonders why the batf went ahead , when they had been warned
according to an interview with a batf agent , that the bd were expecting
them , and why they had the media in tow. almost looks like they wanted
to have a romp and a nice show for the media , and it all went to hell...

he was also never known to act violently. he has always surrendered
peacefully before (but of course , the warrants were served peacefully).
he has been tried on the allegations before and found not guilty.

the justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased
200 , 000.00 worth of guns and stuff (over an undetermined time period).
last i heard this is not a crime , or indication of one. i know of an
individual with that much value in guns. should he get a fly thru the door
shoot first talk later raid \? (grenades are shooting first , nobody i
know of can say 'oh , thats only a stun grenade , thats ok...'). can you \?
i sure cannot. also , one cannot be sure that 200k figure is not calculated
like the feds calculate the value of a drug siezure... even so , it
is a 'so what' issue... he was n't bothering anyone (besides the
batf who does n't like folks other than themselves or other govt
people having any effective guns)... and having an unapproved
religeous group. are we required to not offend the batf these
days \? i sure hope it has n't come to that...

my point is , it does not add up. we need an independent investigation ,
and now. assuming other than fbi batf are preserving the evidence.

2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome.

they had the premisis bugged. i am inclined to think a further wait
would have saved lives. one wonders why they did n't have emergency
gear on hand when they moved , and why they did n't turn on the water
when a fire was observed , instead of saying aw , gee , there is no water .

why so long before the fire gear even showed up like after the building
had pretty much finished burning \? fireman safety \? is n't that a decision
the firefighters should be allowed to make \? no water \? why did n't
the feds turn it back on \? they sure could cut it off quickly enough...

one does wonder about the possibility of 'settling scores'...

3) were fbi actions (blaring loudspeakers , etc.) the right course of action \?

and a few other questions. like i said , i believe the actions taken , in
general , were proper. but i still have some reservations.

one other point , i'm no fan of janet reno , but i do like the way she had the
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility. seems like the waffle boy
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue.

what does 'taking responsibility' mean \? you think she is going to be
facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal \? you think
she is going to face any repercussions if the fbi batf are found to
have acted wrongly \? i do n't. it is a nice pr gimmick , though.

i am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation
for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the batf or fbi.
i expect to hear they are our best law enforcement. they would n't do
anything like that no way. out of the question. end of issue .

i want to see an independent investigation , with full prosecuting and
subpoena powers. with felony prosecution where felony acts are found.
fat chance , i bet. i bet the justice dept will have an internal
investigation which will turn up at most 'poor judgement'.

i hope i am wrong , that this is gone over with a fine tooth comb.

been shot in the head (horrors ! another jonestown ! crazed

that any of them had bullet wounds... he seemed just a tad upset
at the feds for having spread that rumor. (aw , gee , he should n't

before long , i think all the kneejerk government apologists

two notes of interest from texas

the tarrant couonty me (who is doing the autopsies) is well known for rendering
judgements that are contrary to the police view. he presented evidence a few
years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had
his hands in the air. this does not bode well for the boys in black.

the texas dept. of public saftey and the texas rangers have no great love for
the atf. i have heard them referred to as those fucking cowboys . the dps
was totally squeezed out of the bd operation and resented being left as
traffic cops . atf now has two strikes against them.

finally (i guess that makes three notes) , rumour from waco is that four atf
agents were stopped by four waco police cars and a dps trooper after one of the
flashed an automatic weapon at a cop. lots of pissed of cops. and you
wonder why there were so few cops really cheering on the atf.

ahhh , yes. the non existent canisters. call me winston again.


stuff in. no chance of starting a fire there. kerosene lamps \? maybe one ,
but not three fires. no way. koresh was n't just talking out of his ass. i
expected this to happen.

i did too , but for different reasons. the fbi has a habit of burning
up people in fortified areas.


maybe they wanted it to look like murder. he had 50 days. i think this was
coming the whole time. he did n't even put the children in the buried bus or
the underground bunker during the cs seige. he put them up into the tower
to die. fuck all of you big brother paranoid freaks. the only good thing
to come of any of this is that there will be one less group of crazoids to
attract some of the more rootless members of our society.

...gun buyback programs will hopefully
have an impact on accidental shootings (especially youths) , domestic
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level
crime.

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on
any of these things \? evidence , please \?

please do n't misinterret what i was saying joe. i was making the point
tha
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
of common incidents.

if you 're a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps
you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the
rate of accidental death from other single causes \? follow that perhaps
with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners
spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death
among children in the u.s. is a serious problem.

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under. i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents.
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths \?
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem \? i assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.


any death is serious. wanna discuss match control \? firearms related
unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or
more negligent persons , not the gun.

did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent \?
no. i hate to repeat myself jim , but like i told joe , i was not attempting
in any way to justify gun control. you 're right , any death is serious.
that was my point to joe who said that anti gunners try to convinve
the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious
problem. i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem.
no , i do n't want to discuss match control. i do n't equate a book of matches
to a loaded 9 millimeter either. do n't confuse the issue. and please do n't
say that tired old nra line guns do n't kill people , people kill people .
sure , people can kill people without guns. but easy access to guns makes it
a lot more convenient. guns do n't kill people , people with easy access to
guns kill people .

more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the
community. in that sense , i think they might do a little good.

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good.

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were
useful.


providing false hope , then , is the intent \?

jim , i'm just saying how it is. i'm not saying if that is a good thing
or not. from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun
buyback programs , i get the impression that they really think they are
having an impact on the community. when i ask them if they have an evaluatory
component to the program , they say well no... so , in answer to your
question , no , false hope is not the intent. i think the intent is to
show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal
gun violence whether its effective or not. look , if you ca n't measure
the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test
evaluation , what is the point \? it must be symbolic in nature. the police are
essentially saying look , if you have a gun lying around and you do n't
want it , we 'll give you 50 for it...because we care about the community .
if you , i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous.


i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or
brought to school by youths on a daily basis (about 135 , 000 youths) are
obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often
borrowed from a parent without their knowledge.

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun)
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students
who carry a gun to school daily.

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence
or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
the cphv reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access
to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200 increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88. these are the statistics .


200 increase in california schools , eh \? gun control is working fine , there !

i did n't anything about gun control , what are you talking about \?

thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah (got news
for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours
presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they
were in danger).

holding kids \? time for a reality check , son. these kids were the
children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were
outside waiting to kill them. would you send your children out the door
if you believed as they did \?

okay , maybe i worded it wrong...dad. i meant that to put children in a
situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is
would not let innocent children die.
if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive \? thanks for the reality check joe , its been real.

so your religion is different. does that make it his wrong \? even assuming
koresh actually made that decision , and the verdict is still out on that.

jim , listen to me , i said i'm not religious whatsoever , do you understand \?
religion has nothing to do with this. i could care less what religion
they were okay \? to put children in that situation is wrong , pure and
simple. difference is good jim , i am the most progressive and diverse
person in the world. but , if different is allowing kids to be exposed
to tanks and tear gas , then yes jim , different is wrong.

pete zakel is right , we do n't need to worry about capitalization

in the original constitution , militia , arms , etc. were capitalized simply
because they were nouns. this is also done currently in german. there is
no special significance to these words simply because they are capitalized.
the capitalization denotes no special emphasis.

then you did n't understand my grumble... again , i said to get a

something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern

lines 38


well , the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the
compound has been answered. abc aired a report including the 911 tapes
from monday. the fbi called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire 's breakout.
unfortunately , dispatch of vehicles outside the waco city limits
required approval of a deputy chief , who was not available (literally
out to lunch \? ) the 911 operator desperately called around to local
community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. by
the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later , the whole complex was aflame
and it was clearly too little , too late there were just two pumpers
and no water supply. the fbi made another call requesting a tank truck ,
but the waco department apparently depended on hydrants and did not
have one. though clearly unwilling to risk firemen 's lives in the
line of fire , it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient
equipment and water to make a difference.

they even aired a tape of a woman who called waco 911 from georgia
asking if anything was being done. civic minded , but probably
irresponsible if everyone watching television did that , no local
calls could get through.

abc also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who
viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the
standard pool shot ) , and agreed that the fire a) must have been
started in at least 3 places , and b) must have had an accelerant
to spread so fast.

neither of these is conclusive proof that the koresh crowd offed
themselves more than the fbi offed them , but it 's a heck of a lot
stronger proof than some of the theories floating around the net.

fbi director 's statement on waco standoff
i had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening.
after very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought
that today 's efforts by the fbi to bring the branch davidians out of
their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the
stand off or at least meaningful negotiation.
instead , we are faced with devastation and death. however , i
have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with
extreme professionalism and care. i applaud the restraint shown by
agents in the face of life threatening gunfire , and i thank them for
risking their lives to try to end this peacefully. i have only the
greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all
involved.

i have no question that our plan was correct \? months to
get ready , unlimited funds , knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire ,
and no fire trucks on hand \? this is extreme professionalism and care \?

i can understand the first screwed up raid by the batf. they
underestimated the opposition , which happens. but not this one.
the fbi had their first team in place , massive resources , ample time
for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary.
they still botched it.

the fbi director and the fbi sac in overall charge should resign ,
or be fired for incompetence.

i do n't blame reno or clinton. they gave the fbi clear orders
do n't go in unless you can do it without casualties if you ca n't do that ,
wait it out. those were reasonable orders. the fbi said they could
pull off a tactical solution , and they could n't.

what exactly are you trying to say \? and why were there no fire engines within
a mile of the compound \?

because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters.

they were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo. 50mm would be 5cm a
shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells.

snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire. besides ,
the ranch house (not fort apocalypse it was just a house despite what
the fbi and atf says) was on fire . the gun loonies could n't hardly
have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames.
the fbi and atf do n't have any excuse for not having fire engines there
to put out the blaze. the bastards waited until the fire was well
under way before they called the fire department in waco. they did n't
even tell the fire department to be on standby. i sincerely hope that
the fbi , atf , attorney general janet reno , and all others involved in
this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve.
someone should pay for this needless , tragic waste of human life.

sadly , these evil sobs will probably never face justice. the media
and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it
up as being solely david koresh 's fault. sadder still , the american
people will probably believe them.

next question.


the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters
to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.

this is not the problem...the problem is that we have a government that
is becoming more tyrannical every day. if people decide to own guns
and live in one place together then that is their prerogative. on
the other hand , if the bds were in posession of explosives and illegal
guns then the government did have the right to search their compound.
but , the allegations that the bds were in posession of illegal weapons
has n't been proven yet , so i'm not going to conclude that the bds broke
any laws. david koresh was accused of abusing children , but if this
is his only crime then the presence of the atf ca n't be justified.
the atf is only supposed to deal with firearms , tobacco , and alcohol
violations. atf agents are basically cigarette cops...they should
stay out of other kinds of law enforcement actions that are out of
their jurisdiction. better yet , they should be s tcanned imo.

the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to
attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. if the fbi had
had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type
raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.

sounds like something the ss would do. human life children and adults
alike should be treated with respect even if they are heavily armed
religious wackos .

david koresh 's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out
peacefully sooner or later. the fbi and atf had nothing but time on
their hands ! why did they have to escalate the situation and cause
this senseless tragedy \? their job is to protect the public and save
lives not kill people for crying out loud.

it really was a no win situation. koresh had plenty of opportunity
to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf officers. instead
he ordered the murder of the children.

do n't be so sure about that. i read in a newspaper today that one of the
cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that
it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on
fire. this cult member also said that david koresh had no intentions
of committing mass suicide. david koresh 's lawyer also confirms this.
therefore , if this is true then this means that the fbi and atf murdered
everyone in that house ! even if this is not true , the fbi and atf still
do n't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the
waco fire department. perhaps they wanted all these people to die.

in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive
the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the
suicide murder of his other 80 followers. according to the account given
the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. the koresh gun supporter
claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up. if the
aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. for all practical purposes
they were unarmed , the b d followers had automatic weapons.

you 're wrong on several accounts. atf agents were adequately armed. they
had mp5s , ar 15s , and shotguns. some agents were armed with automatic
pistols but not all were. the atf 's initial claim which they later
retracted that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous.

the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. the b d were
quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any
time. a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have
achieved that objective , that would have been very risky , orders of
magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige. airplanes
and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch
apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties
than 80.

allowing the siege to go on was not an option either , besides the serious
risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the
question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over
a prolonged period. the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared
koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. rather than go
in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.


can you think of a better way of getting the children out \?

a 100 certain way \?


the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require
them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through.

gun control is n't the only issue here. if the sick little monkeys in
washington try to use the waco incident as a reason to ban guns then
they will have demonstrated just how f ed up they are. what concerns
me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government
seems to be able to get away with s t like they did in waco...they are
becoming more and more callous about people 's rights and the law. this
greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well.

this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got 4 of its
agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the
middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters.

still the conspiracy theory is comforting , it allows them to pretend that
waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in
resolving a hostage crisis. no govt in the world has ever faced a
comparable situation , quite probably there was no manner in which it
could be peacefully resolved. the blame does not rest on the fbi , it
rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far , in particular
the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of 4 atf
agents and 17 children on his or her conscience.


there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society
preach salvation through armed security. the fact is that these are the
very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. the next waco
may not be religious nutters but a political movement. a splinter group
of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example
and holding several hundred children hostage.

the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent
them arising. no other government in the world has faced such a situation.
this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power
weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah
to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

from memory , today 's houston chronicle (27 april 1993) reported that
hb 1776 passed in the texas house of representatives with (approximately ,
this is from memory) 95 votes for and 45 votes against.

what does this bill do \?

however , in an effort to go into cya (that 's cover your ass) mode ,
they wrote the bill in such a way as to make the law subject to a
statewide referendum in november. however , the paper reported that
this is actually unconstitutional under the texas constitution , which
only allows referendums for constitutional amendments , not for plain
old laws.

if the court does not permit the referendum the bill will probably
go into effect with little fanfare.

all of the above is subject to the texas senate 's voting for
the bill as well. time to start calling the state senators now ! !

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would

irrational. the first was to stockpile weapons. the second was to

what did those people do wrong in the first place \? that is what i ca n't
figure out.

they assembled a frightening arsenal of weapons by circumventing laws
which were intended to prevent such a buildup. then later they used some
of those weapons to kill representatives of the federal government. i'm
sure they were frightened when they saw all those batf officers closing
in , but in retrospect i ca n't see how their subsequent gunfight could be
expected to improve the situation.

what laws did they circumvent \? being frightening is n't a crime. some people
are afraid of young black males. that does n't make the mere status of being a
young black male a crime.

the batf itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades. there is no
evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement
personnel. under those circumstances , other persons have been found to be
acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified
armed intruders.

at this point i place little or no credibility on any of the charges
of child abuse or molestation , but i would remind you that the branch
davidians are n't the only ones burying their dead.

the charges are irrlevant anyway , since the batf has absolutely no jurisdiction
in such matters anyway. of course that has n't stopped them from making other
such spurious charges , such as the existence of mythical meth labs . of
course they whole cult thing indicates the level of contempt that they have
for the 1st amendment.

sure they were crazy , no dought about it , but what did they do wrong \?

they attempted to stage an armed resistance to federal authorities
under conditions that placed dozens of unarmed and innocent people in the
line of fire.

that armed resistance , at least initially , may well have been legal.

...gun buyback programs will hopefully
have an impact on accidental shootings (especially youths) , domestic
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level
crime.

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on
any of these things \? evidence , please \?

please do n't misinterret what i was saying joe. i was making the point tha
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types
of common incidents.

saying hopefully the effect of policy x will be y is much different
from saying hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y.
here you 've made both statements.
if the former describes a reasonably likely outcome of policy x , then
perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration but the latter statement
is not something to base policy decisions on !

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children
ages 14 and under.

according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence (formerly
the national coalition to ban handguns interesting name change , do n't you
think \? ) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the leading causes of
unintentional death) figures but do n't include murder and suicide by other
means as causes of unintentional death. ca n't you see past the bullshit \?

i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents.
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths \?
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental
gun deaths of children is a serious problem \? i assumed that any humane
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends.

certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things but the
anti gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by
firearms is a stastically serious problem , and even if you do n't use
these deaths as a justification for gun control , these groups do. i'm
sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning
accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern ,
but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun
control measures , i think the conclusion was a reasonable one.
the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may
be , they are not a serious problem statistically speaking.

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good.

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were
useful.

sorry if it was n't clear to me. i thought you were waffling on your view
of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully
preventing accidents and heat of passion shootings. i have to disagree on
all these counts i ca n't understand how a buying guns from people who
are n't intending to misuse them (obviously those who want to use guns to
commit crimes are n't going to turn them in) could be construed as a
positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence.

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun)
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students
who carry a gun to school daily.

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence

what , the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit
suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all
methods per year \? who do you think i should believe \? the people who call
everyone up to age 24 children when they 're screaming about the carnage
of our nation 's children being caused by handguns \?

or the centers for disease control.

ah , yes , the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be
such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people
2000 document is to enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of
handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire , minimizing the
likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children \? the
agency that funded the study of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban
had saved x lives (yes , they actually gave us a number) on the basis of
a look at the number of shootings rather than the rate of shootings \?
it was n't their fault that the population of dc dropped in their post law
period...


if you look carefully you will see
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths.
the cphv reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once
in 1990.

okay , i 'll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these. i 'll
retract my dispute of your numbers. however , i would be greatly interested
in seeing how cphv and cdc came up with these numbers.

the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key
children (kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access
to guns in their home.

what 's this got to do with anything \? hell , when i was in elementary
school i came home to an empty house with guns in it. why is this a
problem \? i did n't touch the guns i had been taught not to. i had also
been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage , the fuse box , the
car , the knives , the oven , and the tools. the problem is not the guns ,
it 's the parents ! ! !

california schools reported a 200 increase in
student gun confiscations between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88. these are the statistics .

and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns \?
nothing. no criminal prosecution , no expulsion , in most cases not even
suspension. they take the gun , slap the kids on the wrist , say ai n't it
awful , and go on as if everything 's back to normal. what 's wrong with
this picture \?

okay , maybe i worded it wrong...dad. i meant that to put children in a
situation (fortified compound) where harm could come to them is not the
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is
would not let innocent children die.

i do n't think koresh was the messiah , either... but is n't it obvious that
if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him , then he
believed the children were much safer inside the compound \? i did n't say
he was sane... just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what
he thought was going on. he thought he had them in the one place where
harm would n't come to them.

if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them
burn alive \?

let 's see you try to find the exits , unbarricade them , and flee a fire
when you 've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected
to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault.

(a) a person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he
knowingly

(4) carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person
except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business
any pistol , revolver , stun gun or taser or other firearm

note that this does n't affect all concealed carry. (look after the
word except .) it always helps to read the law before commenting on
it.

i did read the law before i commented on it. judging from replies i received
about my semantics on t.p.g post many (if not most) people here on t.p.g
assume that when ccw laws are asked about the person is asking about the
possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one. it would also follow that said
person would get the ccw to carry on his her person away from their home and or
business.



would a prudent storekeeper carry concealed \? how about someone at
home \? note that both are legal , and a lot of common people qualify
for one or the other.

maybe freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant. the thing
that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying
a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their
person when they are out on the street somewhere. i'm sure that not many
people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home.
speaking as someone who lives in illinois (the only place where the above
quoted law is relevant )) i know that it is legal to own a handgun here (i
am not taking into account city ordinances). i could care less about whether
or not i can carry concealed at home. i only care about the fact that
i ca n't carry concealed in the place where it really counts out on the street.
freeman loves to be accurate and i can understand that (especially not) but he
seems to be forgetting that accurate facts do n't always replace common sense.
i am not going to followup to this thread anymore because i believe that it is
useless to argue these points anymore. the only thing that is happening now
is that freeman and i are running around in circles trying to prove each
other wrong and i do not have the time to be playing games anymore. of course
now freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier
posts but what can i do. my only advice for freeman quit being so picky
about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense it really does work some
times.

the ballad of david koresh.
...
at concord and at waco
the tyrant 's minions failed.
though they all died in the fire
koresh 's people have prevailed.

good irony. the waco finale was on april 19 , patriot 's day.
on that day 218 years earlier , the militias of concord , mass. ,
and other nearby towns repelled a gun control raid by the
then current colonial government ...

of paranoia \?

funny , brent , but so far we have heard two versions of the facts

1) what the government says. this includes what the government says that
two survivors have said.

2) what koresh 's lawyer (who was actually inside the compound) says ,
including what he says that most of the survivors have said.

strange , but they seem to disagree in most important particulars.

if anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors
speaking first hand , feel free ot pitch in. i may have missed it.
but my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like
case 2 , and not at all like case 1.

now i suppose the post is within its rights to refuse such ads. however ,
the second sentence is so noxious , i feel compelled to bring it to the

i called the post classified number (825 2525) and expressed my displeasure.
according to the supervisor i spoke to , the post was reacting to public
complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads. however , she said
the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy. i
strongly encourage denver post readers to call and make their feelings known.

that janet reno (the once and future attorney general) gave him a full

i find this disturbing.

good. keep thinking critically.

dont' patronize me and i wo n't patronize you.

feel free to patronize me all you like i need the tips. )
seriously , if you were insulted , i apologize.

the most tiresome thing about this group is that so many people
tell others they are sucking up to the government when ever they
decide that something the government says is plausible and praise
them as independent thinkers whenever they find something the government
says implausible.

people are sucking up to the government when they decide that only the
things the government says are plausible. especially if they refuse to
consider reasonable alternatives.

however , from what i saw plastered all over the tv news last night , it 's
no longer necessary to be an independent thinker to depart from the
government 's party line. it looks like our independent press may
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance. this , to me , is
a good sign. i hope it continues.

here 's a clue. independent thinkers are able to come to either conclusion
depending on the circumstances. non critical thinkers are the ones who would
always come to the same type of conclusion regardless of the circumstances.

independent thinkers question authority. in a situation where only one
set of facts are being presented , coming to a conclusion is not the
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it 's coupled with the ability
to challenge those facts critically. the scientific method consists
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis it 's even more than choosing
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed.

can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes \?

generally the ship sinks (sorry , there 's a picture of the
uss iowa next to my desk).

bullets go flying every
where. imho , these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines
went up.

first , unless that round is chambered there is little threat of
penetration by the bullet , or the brass for that matter. unless that
expanding gas is held in an enclosed space you get a nice pop and not
enough threat for even firefighters to worry about. finally , it 's
rather simple to tell if a person was shot prior to being burned to
a crisp. see , by the time the ammunition went up those people were
quite dead. look for blood around the wound , particularly bruising.

however , it 's my contention that it makes little difference
whether they died from exploding ammunition or fire the feds seem
to have shared responsibility for both.

or the cultists...) i think i 'll quote the bbc quoting (actually voice
interview) one of the two british survivors. he claimed that the fire
started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall roof to collapse
knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan.

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the
burning building \?

i do n't know , why \?

this is the ap story from fri morning.

as the walls came tumbling down and tear gas filled the air , cult leader
david koresh sprang into action. he left his third floor bedroom and began
looking around the house , making sure women and children were secure and
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. within hours , the
compound became an inferno. nine branch davidians excaped.
this is their story , gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder. that day the
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world
since koresh 's right hand man , steve schneider , ripped out the compounds 's
phone line after fbi agents called before dawn monday saying this was the
cults last chance come out or prepare to get forced out.
they kept their word. by dawn , tanks were battering the mount carmel
compound , punching for hours to creat holes for tear gas to enter. the bd
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines. strapped into gas masks , the
women did laundry. others read bibles in their rooms. the 17 children , all
under 10 , remained by their mothers' sides. still , it was hard to ignore what
was happening around them. each time a tank rammed the poorly constructed building
it shook violently. cult members dodges falling gypsum wallboard and doors.
hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling
the air with noxious fumes. the flying canisters were more frightening than
the tanks. at least one man was hit in the face. the gas began filling the air ,
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks
made. scattered throughout the house , the cult members made no efforts to
gather. then the fbi sent in its biggest weapon a massive armored vehicle
headed for a chamber , lined with cinder blocks , where authorities hoped to
find koresh and schneider and fire tear gas directly at them.
here the cult members' story diverges from the government 's version. the
fbi says cult members set fires in three places. but each of the six cult
members , in separate discussions with lawyers , consistently gave versions
at odds with the fbi 's account. they say the tank flattened a barrel of
propane , spilling its contents. and as the tank thundered through the house ,
it tipped over lit lanterns , spitting flames that ignited the propane and
other flammables. the home of used lumber , plywood , and wallboard tacked
together with tar paper was vulnerable. the building erupted. nine bd 's
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other openings. others
died groping in the blackness.
