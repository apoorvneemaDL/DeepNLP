hey valentine , i do n't see boston with any world series rings on their
fingers. damn , morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his
future. therefore , i would have to say toronto easily made the best
signing. and do n't tell me boston will win this year. they wo n't
even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th.


in spite of what all the stat heads say , jack morris played a large role in
the jays winning the world series last year. i do n't care if his era was 4. \?
he played a leadership role and did win 21 games. his era may have been high ,
but he did pitch many outstanding ball games.

and he pitched many not so outstanding ballgames , too.

jack essentially pitched a lot of .500 ball last year. this certainly
is n't irrelevant , and iif you replace morris with replacement level quality
the blue jays might not win.

re leadership , i do n't see it. if the leadership effect is there for
a starting pitcher , you would expect to see its primary effect on the
pitching staff. you would expect to see the rest of the staff improve.
instead , the rest of the staff declined.

you can make a reasonable argument for winfield providing leadership
the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous
year. i'm not saying i buy that , but at least that argument makes
internal sense.

in article 1qvdrninnd9f@gap.caltech.edu shippert@cco.caltech.edu (tim shippert) writes
the reason i bothered doing this dr stuff was to see if i could
determine the answer to the age old question is jeff blauser more
valuable than rafael belliard .

well , it looks like , just as doug trumped tim , beating him to the net
with his defensive analyses , so tim has gotten in ahead of me.

the way i was doing it was a little different. being me , of course , i
used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth ,
and i calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent
average) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). but i
compared , not to the average player , but the replacement player , and
here 's why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the
system. in the al of 1992 , the average ss is 32.9 runs above
replacement (rar) cf , 31.6 2b , 28.8 3b , 26.3 lf , 26.0 rf , 24.6
1b , 16.9. we may quibble with the exact numbers , but the order looks
substantially right.

in the equivalent average , i have always set league average to .235. i
had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of
.180 the name of that replacement level hitter , often as not , is
billy ripken . i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the
same distance from .235 as .180 , but in the opposite direction as i
have set it up that makes for an eqa of .280. (yes , i can add. runs
are proportional to eqa squared the difference between 180 squared
and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared , and i rounded
off for simplicity). an all replacement fielding team would have
randy milligan at first (.282) , willie randolph (.269) at second , leo
gomez (.279) at third , walt weiss (.269) at short , kevin bass (.271)
in left , hojo (.257) in center , and eric anthony (.277) in right. ugh.

so , the total number of rar for a player is the sum of his batting and
fielding rar. i can rate them by total rar , or rar per some number of
batting outs , like 400. an average player has a total rar of about 55 ,
30 batting , 25 fielding.

if this is true (note that i do n't think it is) , lasorda should be

i did not write that ! in fact , those statements were a rebuttal to
an earlier posting that i made , and this was culled from my strong
rebuttal to those statements. please ! slander. shame.


there is a fine line between getting players' input and knuckling
under to players' demands. a manager , much like a military officer ,
needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during
a game. after the game , it 's no big deal , but when there is no time
to do more than react , players must trust the manager or the team often
falls apart (see boston red sox , ff. ) )


after the game , it 's no big deal \? \? \? \? after the employees leave
the workplace , it does n't matter what they say about the boss or the
company \? puhlease.


strawberry 's demeanor as represented by the media , often sounds like
demands. i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth i'm
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if
it came from strawberry. russ porter quoted strawberry as saying ,
i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best
in that role. (paraphrased by my memory and bias.) that seems like
a fairly non petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question
like , how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order \?


first , it 's ross porter. second , i am really tired of seeing the kind
of response that indicates that all i do is parrot what some media
person says or writes. i have a brain. if i choose to characterize
something in a certain fashion , it 's because that is what i believe
to be accurate. it is not just because some unnamed mediot made
the characterization.

a more media sensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is
doing. if he thinks that batting me third will help the team , then i
am all for it. we 'd ignore that answer as brown stuff , so it seems a
little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl 's response as petulant.

i did not brand darryl 's response as petulant , because i never heard
any response from darryl. i did call him a name. i referred to him
as a primadonna. someone else concluded that i did that because i
hate him. i do n't hate him. i think he 's a primadonna. if you
disagree , fine. but stop putting words in my mouth.

first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball.

i definitely do. that 's why i do n't like going to see games played
on artificial turf )

the lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches.

and while it 's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting , this
is only true when they do n't become extra long.

well , your idea of interesting differs from mine. i think
batting practice is interesting , for example , and make a special
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it. i think the
delaying tactics of batters , pitchers , catchers , and managers are
interesting because they 're attempts to gain advantage through control
of the flow and timing of the game. of course , the umpires can , and
should , intervene when these tactics get out of hand. as ryan robbins
has pointed out , there are rules that cover this.

one of the more fascinating things about baseball , i think , is its
open endedness with regard to time. you never know if the game is going
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours , or if it 's going to
go on until four in the morning. likewise , some games are action packed ,
and some games are slow and lazy. that 's fine by me. those folks who
want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel
surf and cater to their short attention spans.

the major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age. even if

that he'd been thrown out. and gant had a legitimate beef about
the 1 0 pitch that was called a strike. a reasonable umpire would
not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation.

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more
umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter wo n't get back in the box.

so what if the previous strike call was bogus \? it 's in the past , it ca n't
be changed get back in there and deal with the next pitch.

sorry , sherri , but i ca n't agree with this particular incident. while
i'm all for cutting down the number of chain rattles and other examples
of rampant hargroving , there was a difference here.

1) since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls.
so have pitchers and catchers. usually , nothing happens.
unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing
complaints , hirschbeck was acting against expectations.

2) it 's not as if gant was in hirschbeck 's face . gant said
something about the call , stepped out of the box , and turned away
from hirschbeck. as a hitter (alibet of little consequence , but
with a decent eye) , whenever receiving the short end of the stick
on a questionable call , i 'd want a moment or two out of the box ,
if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on
the experience of the last pitch. and if i was really angry
at the ump , i 'd rather turn away and catch my breath than
turn to him and say something that might get me tossed ,
especially at a key moment in the game.

when gant turned away , hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant
to step into the box. imo , at this point in time , hirschbeck
was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game.
gant was n't dawdling he had n't had a chance to dawdle. and hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play. gant resisted , as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and
hirschbeck called for the pitch. at that point , cox came out on
the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other braves left the
dugout. cox was tossed protecting his player . i was pleasantly
surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.

it 's a small sample size , but based on what i saw in that game ,
mark hirschbeck has a hair trigger temper and a need to play
god on the field. not good qualities for an umpire. i will
keep my eyes open for future appearances of hirschbeck in the
future , in order to improve my sample size.

imo , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was
a bad game for the umpire.

is in the general area of the groin . a lot less 3 and 2 counts and a
quicker game.

they tried that in the '60 's and people stopped coming to the ballparks

they lowered the mound first (before the 69 season). the shrinkage of

1) why would owners decrease ticket prices when they obviously get
lots of people to pay the price they 're asking \?


i do n't think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing
to pay the price. i'm sure someone out there in net land has some
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
sold. but even if the trends are relatively flat , you have to consider
what is happening on a team by team basis.

when the tv money dries up , franchises will be seeking to supplant the
lost revenues from alternative sources. one of the best sources may
be ticket sales.

example 1 the dodgers

the dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales
and probably believe that they have the ability to raise
prices without hindering revenues. i certainly think that is
true.

example 2 the padres

they will be lucky to average 10 , 000 fans a game this year.
if they raise prices , less. if they want to increase their
overall revenue base , the best thing they can do is put a
winning team on the field. but given that wo n't happen (it
wo n't) , they can probably make more money by lowering ticket
prices and running frequent promotions. will they do that \?
i have no idea. but they wo n't increase prices , because it
wo n't work for them .


2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners
decrease ticket prices , that does not decrease the tv contract.


the only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place.
each team 's market is somewhat different , and each owner is going to
be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those
market forces. as a buiness manager , i would never want to lower my
prices , but sometimes that strategy is necessary , and sometimes it works.
you have to consider everything if you want continued success.

baseball is a team game , but it is made of individual talents. it is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates , whom he did not choose (at least in most
cases.) morris won last year because he played on a team with joe
carter , robby alomar , tom henke , juan guzman , john olerud , et al.
clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
herm winninham , luis rivera , and jeff reardon. to define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components (as i do , albeit imperfectly)
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do)

no , i am not trying to define the quality of an individual , at least not
for the purpose of ranking them. toronto won with olerud. they might
have won with fielder. they might not have won with thomas. detroit
might have won with thomas. chicago might have won with fielder. you
ca n't rank these individuals. you can only look at who might contribute
more to the team effort , which is winning the ws. thomas could not
have contributed to that goal any more than olerud so i cannot say that
olerud is less of a player.


ok , roger , here 's a question for you. say you are running an expansion
team. you do n't have a team at the moment , but the draft is coming up. who
are you going to pick , guys who have won the most ws rings , or guys who
could contribute the most to your team. say the reds were dumb enough to
not protect larkin , and the jays did n't protect alfredo. who would you

i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do

at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a
ticket , i do n't mind a game that last more than 2 10. i really do n't
understand it.

games are longer now for several reasons more pitching changes ,
more basestealing ( and throws to first ) , etc...i think a very small factor
is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy
showboat ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the
batter 's box. my impression is that sportcasters and writers have made this
an issue because they like shorter games they get to head back to hotel
bar , eat steaks , get drunk , tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase
stewardesses around the bar. sure they want the game over with. print
journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games
they have deadlines. the espn guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy they
constantly harp on this primarily because they often have to work late
when the game goes longer than 2 30.

maybe i am just a ne'er do well with nothing better to do , but i
would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.

as a parenthetical note , it seems the league is in any case fighting

can anyone out there tell me why they call left handed pitchers

i dont know about the story but it comes from the fact that in most stadiums , the batter faces northeast and so when
a pitcher is on the mound , his left arm is to the south , hence the term.

southpaw \?

also the story on how the term originated.

thanks ! !

to really speed up the game umps need to start calling strikes the way
they used to. i'm talking about making the strike zone start at the
knees and go up to the top of the letters. forget this the strike zone
is in the general area of the groin . a lot less 3 and 2 counts and a
quicker game.

there is absolutely , positively , quite verifiably , no causation that runs
from salaries to ticket prices. the two are separable decisions. the
owners do not raise ticket prices to recoup costs they raise ticket prices
because demand for seats has risen. (wish i had bold type for that no .)

for more evidence , please come to my intro to econ course , somewhere around

i suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning. an
outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a
lot of balls , preventing both singles and doubles , and also cut off more
uncatchable balls , turinging doubles into singles. however , a fielder
who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies this
means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles.

has anyone seen these players' positioning \? do butler and felix play
deep , and lankford , martinez , and wilson shallow , or is this a park
effect \? i thought butler liked to play shallow.

this week 's play


it took three days to get to us , but i 'll try anyway as i naturally
have n't seen the answer.

with runners at first and second and one out , the batter hits an
easy pop fly to the third baseman.

(a) the umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman
lets the ball drop. the runner at second heads for third and the
third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who tags the bag
before the runner.

safe. the correct call is infield fly , (batter out) if fair . runners
may advance at own risk. (gotta tag up if caught , etc.) it is not a
force , and the pop was not caught , so regardless of whether the ss
tags 3b or 2b (it was n't clear , above) , he has n't got the runner out.

(b) the umpires do n't declare the infield fly rule and the third
baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop , who
tags the runner from second while the runner is between second and
third.

out. see rule 6.05(l) approved ruling. (below). in this case , the
umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule
does n't apply. (sounds like a bad call here , but that 's not the
point). the batter is not out , so a force situation is created.
therefore , the runner is out. ( unless , by rule 6.05(l) the ball is
dead and the batter is safe , then i guess the runners would advance
unmolested. i ca n't really tell from 6.05(l) that the ball is dead in
this situation.)


what 's the call in (a) and (b) \?

pertinent rules 2.00 definition of infield fly when an infield fly
is called , runners may advance at their own risk. if on an infield fly
rule , the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball , the ball remains
in play despite the provisions of rule 6.05(l). the infield fly rule
takes precedence.

6.05(l) a batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair
fly ball or line drive , with first , first and second , first and thrid ,
or first , second and third base occupied before two are out. the ball
is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base
or bases. approved ruling in this situation , the batter is not out if
the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground ,
except when the infield fly rule applies.

johnson is a quality pitcher.

and not the only quality mariner pitcher. i logged on expecting to see
at least one congratulatory note for chris bosio 's no hitter , but nary
a peep.

so i 'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11 5 and
slinking out of town without having scored a run in the last two games
or even a hit in last night 's gem.

not that we m 's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers
of new england 's long running tragedy , but only one winning season in

the mariners now have two no hit pitchers on the staff and not

o any of you experts want to analyze ron gant \?

omeone sure needs to analyze him. gant is a head case. in his , what , six or
seven years in the majors , he 's put together a combined total of maybe one
good season \? he lacks self confidence , but worse , he does n't really
understand baseball. curiously , he seems to perform best when his job
is threatened. sit him down for a game , and he might get a hit the next
night. but let him play , and what is he thinking about \? getting hits ,
driving in runs \? no , he 's worried if he 's going to get that 30 stolen
bases , or that 100th career home run. he appears to have no learning curve.
he never figured out how to play third base (what a fiasco). he still
plays the outfield with his legs. he 's lucky he 's so fast , because it enables
him to outrun his mistakes (but , as i suggested earlier in the season , it
looks to me like he 's slowing down a little bit , or else every groundskeeper
is watering the infield dirt a little extra).

gant has had way too much of a chance already. he may get hot again for
a couple of months , but he 'll always revert to his true level.

gant 's ml record age 28 this season.

year g ab ba obp slg hr sb cs
1987 21 83 .265 .271 .386 2 4 2
1988 146 563 .259 .317 .439 19 19 10 3rd base expt. year

1991 154 561 .251 .338 .496 32 34 15
1992 153 544 .259 .321 .415 17 32 10

in the majors for parts of 6 seasons , total playing time
approx 4.5 seasons.

just looking at his hitting record , he 's had 2 seasons of ops
greater than .800 , which is pretty good for an of. his
1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2b. the move to
third base explains a lot of his 1989. when he returned as an of ,
he began hitting again. and of course , last year he slumped.

but no learning curve \? he has obviously improved his batting eye
over the years , as well as his sb cs ratio. as to his fielding ,
he was an infielder when he was drafted , a 2bman as he came
up through the braves system , and then the braves put him through
2 position changes in the space of a year. he 's an adequate of ,
although not great , and at least some of your perception of his
fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the of at the
ml level. (i know you 're another long term braves fan )

about playing 3b...imo , that 's the 2nd most difficult position
to field , after catcher. at ss or 2b , you need more range and
speed , but at 3b , you 've got to have quick reflexes and have
a gun for an arm. there are no second chances at 3b , even when
playing sandlot softball ! granted , i 'd still put my best
overall infielder at ss , but that 's because he gets more
chances , not because the job is harder. it still amazes me
that so many teams have tried to convert other position players
to 3b. but maybe that 's because the supply of natural 3b is
scarce.

finally , gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to
perform well , and works hard to improve. you do n't get
those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a
lot of weight work. now , whether he 's been overdoing it these
days may be a valid question , as is the question of whether
he tries too hard to make something happen during each at bat.
but frankly , if a player is going to not live up to potential ,
i 'd much rather they fail by trying too hard , than by not
trying hard enough. you might be able to teach relaxation
to an adult but at that age i do n't believe you can teach
hustle.

all that said , i do n't think i 'd sign gant to another long term
contract. he 's 28 now , and i think he 's free agent eligible
in 2 years , when he 'll be 30. given his career curve and
limitations , i would n't expect him to last much past 35
as a ml ballplayer. he might surprise me here , but atlanta 's
got some talent on the farm , and i 'd rather take my chances
down the road with nieves et al.

indeed , you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement. to
rebut my opinion , you have made an analogy with a game of chance.
your hypothesis assumes that the lotto players have no impact on
the selection of the numbers , and hence their ability to win.

well , that 's certainly true in lotto. but it has absolutely
nothing to do with the sport of baseball. when you start down
the wrong path , you finish down the wrong path.





i repeat. i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch
hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting
performance.

i do , however , think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance
may , for some players , indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed
will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance.
and i think chris sabo is such a player.

twins update posted april 22 , 1993

the twins defeated the milwaukee brewers 5 4 today to conclude a three game
homestand with the brew crew. the twins took two of three games in the series ,
with scores as follows

tuesday april 20th mn 10
mil 0
winning pitcher banks (2 0)

wednesday april 21st mil 10 (10)
mn 8
lp hartley ( 0 1 )

thursday april 22nd mn 5
mil 4
wp deshaies (4 0)
sa aguilera

highlight low lights of the series

jim deshaies continues to be the surprise of not only the twins , but of
the american league as well. going into today 's game , deshaies was 3 0
with a 1.74 era. deshaies allowed 2 earned runs in 6 2 3 innings , meaning
his era will climb slightly. deshaies , who came to mn via a trade with
philadelphia which sent david west there , continues to make andy macphail
look like a true genius.

willie banks has put together two solid starts for the twins , going 6.1 innings
on monday while coasting on solid twins hitting. deshaies and banks now
combine for 6 of the twins eight victories , while tapani mahomes erickson are
0 5.

wednesday 's game marked the first opposing left handed starting pitcher for the
twins this year (rickey bones). the twins teed off against both him and
subsequent relief , including a grand slam by kent hrbek which pushed the lead
to 7 3. the twins pitching staff could not hold the lead , though , allowing
4 walks in the 7th inning , 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded.
tapani gave up one walk before being relieved , guthrie two walks , and mike
hartley one walk before the inning was over. this tied the game at 7 7 , and
the brew crew rocked mike hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win
it.

aguilera continues to be shaky against the brew crew. 6 of 20 career blown
saves have come against the brew crew , and today 's game was shaky as well.
coming into the ninth with a 5 2 lead , aguilera gave up a solo hr to vaughn ,
then hits to darryl hamilton and dickie thon before finally retiring the
side. once again , the tying run made it to second base on aggie.
weak hearted twins fans are advised not to watch aggie in the ninth.

general news

pedro munoz continues to improve as an outfielder , playing in left field on
tuesday 's game. he continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching ,
though , which has limited his playing time. gene larkin and jt bruett(former
gopher) have been playing right field , as both can bat left handed.

the twins begin a three game series with the detroit tigers tomorrow. starting
pitching is tentatively scheduled as erickson , mahomes , banks. the detroit
tigers have had two 20 run games in the last ten days , and should provide
quite a challenge to the young mn pitching staff.

the twins have 9 hr 's this year , three each from puckett , hrbek , and winfield ,
the third , fourth , and fifth batters , respectively.

brian harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second
this year , and shows much improvement in this category.

jim deshaies has three pick offs and one balk this year. some say he
has the best 1st base move in baseball. this move has enabled him to pitch
out of some tight early jams , and has certainly contributed to his 4 0
start. watch to see if umpiring crews began calling the balk more tightly
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the
rubber on the pick off move.

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time (x 3 to 5)
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base
as if walked.

this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably. suppose the pitcher uses up (n 1) of his n pick off
attempts. the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base ,
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time.


if it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead , it would probably
also result ina greater number of pickoffs. i think it would be a
workable rule , but it would probably be best to experiment in another
league before trying it in the bigs.

truly an amazing shot.

i was at that game , behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the

best fastball , topping out at 88 90 (in contrast to frank tanana , who went
as low as 50 with one lollipop in the process of striking out phil
plantier five times on the night). inky 's shot would have gone further
than any i 've ever seen if it had n't crashed into the lights (not the

disclaimer this is for fun.

in my computerized baseball game , i keep track of a category called
stolen hits , defined as a play made that an average fielder would not
make with average effort. using the 1992 defensive averages posted
by sherri nichols (thanks sherri ! ) , i 've figured out some defensive stats
for the leftfielders. hits stolen have been redefined as plays kevin
bass would not have made.

ok , i realize that 's unfair. kevin 's probably the victim of pitching staff ,
fluke shots , and a monster park factor. but let 's put it this way if we
replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with kevin 's 49.4 out
making ability , how many extra hits would go by \?

to try and correlate it to reality a little more , i 've calculated net
hits stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make. by the same method i 've calculated net extra
bases (doubles and triples let by).

finally , i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution , or
dcon . basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
i add this number to ops to get dops (defense onbase plus slug) , which
should represent the player 's total contribution to the team. so do n't
take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this
article.

the short version definition of terms
hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell

dcon formula ((nhs ndp) pa) ((nhs ndp neb) ab)
why such a bizzare formula \? basically , it 's designed to be added into the
ops , with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored .
the extra outs are factored into obp , while the extra bases removed are
factored into slg. that 's why i used pa and ab as the divisors.

no , but i am for starting rec.sports.idiots for people who respond to
obvious flamebait.

nah , let 's reserve rec.sports.idiots for people who post
obvious flamebait , like yourself.

funny. i did n't realize mr. tanner brought up bob knepper v. pam postema
in the first place. thought it was someone named jacobs.

if someone posts something as controversial (not to mention
idiotic) as what austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup ,
someone should challenge the statement.

why \? if a statement is truly idiotic , and is universally thought so ,
the challenge is a waste of panting. further , challenges that have
nothing (yes , nothing) to do with baseball are wasting others' time.

you got a problem with what bob knepper thinks \? let 's hear it , in
some sort of categorical manner. (actually , i question whether either
knepper or postema are n't old news at this point , although what i
have read of postema 's book is interesting.)

there is a school of thought that suggests that silence consent.

i agree this far.

whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life , it certainly
should apply to a forum of public discussion...

sez you.

if you 've been reading r.s.b. lately , you 'll find
that even elementary school children have had access
to our postings , albeit in an edited form. it 's making me
think a little more carefully about some of the things i post.

that does not come out in what you say down the road , here.

in conclusion , if someone like austin wants to post his drivel
in some obscure newsgroup that i do n't read , fine. he 's got the
right to rant , rave , and drool all he wants to in the name
of free speech. but if he drools in a newsgroup that i read ,
then i will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal
to his drooling.

yo. even elementary school children have had access to our postings ,
albeit in an edited form. you want them to hear you talk like this \?
do n't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think
you like to do the same \? or do you want them to think you 're some
politically correct demagogue who 's oh so sensitive \? (ho hum.)

plus , you 're here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that
i do n't read. what bs. you got a problem with what jacobs says , what
knepper thinks , all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas , more
and better speech. yours is the easy way out.

as for knepper ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of
them \? you know that often the best copy for the news is the one that is n't
pre prepared. they know knepper has controversial ideas about women , they
pop some question about postema. (an interesting related question would
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game. off the top of my head ,
i guess no. if my guess is right , knepper popped off about something that
had nothing to do with him and postema gets a book for it , and he does n't.)

now , of course , you do n't have to read any of this.
and if you want to cut down on flames , then don't post flamebait !
(you do n't have to respond to flames , either. saves cyberspace)

now , why did n't i think of that \? ) ) )

not at all. i am talking about morris winning with toronto last year. you
are about to launch into a fantasy about the red jays and how toronto
would have done with viola on their team. viola did n't play for toronto
last year. morris did.

the problem with your nihilistic approach , roger , is that it takes all the
sense out of the game. by your line of reasoning , if a guy hits into a
double play with one out and the bases loaded , there 's no point in saying
that that was a bad thing to do (if his team won anyway) or speculating
on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise , so the double
play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was
eventually won or lost for unknown reasons. after all , any speculation
involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but did n't.

roger , do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the
ceiling instead \? or are you willing to consider empirical evidence \?

teams go to the post season when they win more games than anybody else
in their division. if they do n't make the post season , they do n't win the
series. will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate
goal in ring collecting \?

if so , you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal
towards winning the division , and our disagreements come when we consider
how to win games.

in your viewpoint as expressed , winning games happens for reasons that
cannot be analyzed. while many of us are thinking things like base
runners are good , outs are bad , and therefore walks are better than
double plays with the bases loaded , you are thinking things like
it 's a team game , so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious
team dynamics that will cause the team to win today .

the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual
players. perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left
field. after all , perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would
have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt
it. therefore , i could be an extremely valuable player. did dave winfield
have anything to do with the jays' victory \? probably , but how do you know \?
if you replace him with andres galarraga , perhaps the jays would have won ,
perhaps they would have lost , perhaps they would have defected to alpha
centauri (bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed
in mid season had winfield been dhing for toronto).

was babe ruth a good player \? he played on some ws winning teams , but did
he have anything to do with their success \?

it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player , and
jarvis brown and dan schatzeder were n't. it seems to me that anybody who
would deny this needs to provide the proof.

now , we have observed things about baseball over the years , both empirically
and by looking at the rulebook. it is necessary to score more runs than
one 's opponent to win the game , so it would seem important to score runs
and to prevent one 's opponent from scoring. runs are scored while a team
is batting , and an inning ends after the third out , so it would seem that
making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. players have tendencies
to hit or pitch at certain levels , and these are usually somewhat consistent
from year to year.

we do use these statistics to predict winners , and so do you. to make
some flat predictions barry bonds will have a higher obp slg than
gene larkin this year. the braves will finish ahead of the rockies
in the standings. the tigers will score more runs than the royals , but
will also give up more. i would be astonished if any of these turned
out to be false , and , i suspect , so would you. as a matter of fact , i
am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year , given
3 4 guesses per division , and this is certainly better than random
chance (and almost statistically significant).

if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in
the world series , you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure
likelihoods , however fuzzy.

it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally
meaningless.

so how about real life \? person a robs a service station with two people
in it , using a .38 automatic pistol , gets 42 , and is convicted and sentenced
for three years. person b , with a similar criminal record , robs a service
station with two people in it , using a .38 revolver , gets 42 , and is
convicted. since they used two different types of handgun , are comparisons
totally meaningless \?

say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works (my cats are always
testing this they do n't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time). you
have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before , so
all previous evidence is meaningless \? or would you be surprised if it flew
out the window instead of hitting the desk \?

you want to speed up ballgames \?

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current
rule is too lenient) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more
than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball ,
and restart the clock.

i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work. i do n't remember
why they said that it did not work. anyone remember this \?

jody mcdonnel on wip in phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable. how would a pitch clock work on throws to first \?

another pair of suggestions
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe
no matter what the pitcher does.

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time (x 3 to 5)
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base
as if walked.

the no balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage. the base walk allows
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base.

baseball games take about 2 51 in the nl , and just a shade under 3 hours
in the al. that 's just too damn long. i do n't like to play in 3 hour
games , much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep , and
if i'm watching on tv , i 'll channel surf between pitches , catching
colorized versions of mr. ed , leave it to beaver , and those wacky
nieporents on nick at nite.

i too , find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between
each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery .

before folks jump on me , let me ask the net would the jays
have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris (given
his run support) \? how about an average ml pitcher \? i ca n't believe
that morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
impact on the jays performance ...

i know it 's very trendy nowadays to dump on morris , but let 's give credit
where credit is due.

it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris.

well , when you say , without morris , you have to mention an assumed
replacement. if the alternative to morris was letting cito gaston
soft toss the ball underhand to the opposition every 5 days , then
of course the blue jays would n't have won without morris. if the
alternative was replacement level , then i think it would 've been very
close , and yes , morris might 've made the difference. if the alternative
was frank viola , the blue jays probably would have won more easily with
viola.

last year , when the team went 13 15 for the month of august , and all the
other starters were being shelled , and milwaukee was making a charge ,
morris went 5 1 with a pretty good era (i ca n't remember exactly).

yes. you can make the argument that the his presence prevented
the team from collapsing in august.

also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save
the bullpen every fifth day. if he did n't help us win the al east , forget
about the pennent and the world series.

those innings were probably helpful.

his run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was stottlemyer 's (5.90 runs)
and he won only 12 games. i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of
6 5 and 8 6 ballgames , but this is to his credit. he pitched only as good
as he needed to be. when he was up 6 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
(i hate this expression ! ). an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. but morris , being a
veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball. by saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra
(i hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line.

well , i think is complete bs. what happened most of the time is that
morris fell behind , and the team came back and rescued him. mostly ,
this is because he 's a lousy 1st inning pitcher , and much better
the rest of the way. that the team can climb out of 4 0 , 5 0 holes
consistently and win them 6 5 is not to morris' credit it 's to the
team 's credit.

furthermore , while morris did exceed the w l percentage that would
be projected from his runs allowed and run support , he has n't done
this in previous years. in fact , his w l record in 1991 is a lot
worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed.
do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992.

look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in. typical
morris games. morris gets behind team rescues him. he 's not
responsible for that rescue. and in both those games , the team
just did n't rescue him enough. jack morris pitched as well as he did
during much of the season in those 2 games the offense just did n't
earn him a victory.

btw , i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a
veteran pitcher which cito would never do , but his era is 17 , how much more
can he be embarrassed \?

morris is one of those guys who will reture when he ca n't start
anymore he 's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen.

hey folks ,

saw the giants play ball at the 'stick saturday , april 17. it was the game
where pendelton broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two out ,
two run homer to right to win it. (it was n't the game where the fans
threw the give away fotoballs onto the field in response to the homer
too bad , huh \? )

well , the 'stick is still cold. the saturday game ended at 5 45pm , and it
was cold then. i ca n't imagine night games in april at the 'stick. the
wind kicked up a little , too , and i got this idea.

at most games , there 's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on
the field a lot of the time. i propose a kid 's clean up corps composed
mainly of 10 12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the toro smooths
the infield) and grab the trash.

it might not be glamorous , but at that age i probably would have given
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers. everybody wins here !

whaddaya think \?

the giants have won 8 of their last 10 games behind some solid pitching
(excluding that 13 12 win against atlanta). if they can stay around first
place after say the first 50 games , i think they 've got a legitimate chance
at winning the pennant (and maybe even more than that).

do n't you remember that the giants were in 1st place as late as
june last year \? then their pitching collapsed.... their problem
is they have (optimistically) only 2 3 good starting pitchers
(swift , brantly , and the bowler(ca n't remember his name)) the
other starters are extremely unreliable and often get blasted
before 4 innings... that means the already shallow bullpen gets
over worked. this means after a few months , the bullpen collapses
and their post all star record tends to be much worst than
their pre all star record.

the bowler is john burkett , who went to 4 0 last night. he is
a bargain pickup on my roto team , i got him at a minimum of 5.

just a thought... does someone have the won lost pre post
allstar records for the giants the last few seasons \? i bet
their records tends to be worst and worst as the season goes on.

this is not really true. excluding last season , the giants
has been a better 2nd half team. in 1991 , they had a hot august
to pull to within a few games of the braves and dodgers before
fading in september.
the giants may go back to earth , but not as fast as last
season for two reasons
(1) barry bonds
(2) roger craig is no longer the manager. dusty can manage
his pitching staffs much better than craig.

but it is subject to all kinds of bias , and is almost completely
useless
for first basemen. from the raw stats , there is no way to tell
which of
a first baseman 's putouts were made on throws from other fielders ,
and
which were made on his own plays likewise , you ca n't tell whether
a
double play was 6 4 3 or 3 6 3. fielding runs thus gives a first
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays , only for assists and
errors.

but ingnoring putouts is biased in yet another way. range is
not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman. the ability
to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the
dirt , stretching for others , and so forth is important. thus ,
putouts do provide some information. maybe what we need is a
comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the
first baseman vs. how many he actually got.

how many cy youngs does morris have \?

how many cy youngs does clemens have \?

ballparks and such... fenway average pitchers park. detroit , hugh hitters

morris is a great team pitcher , sort of in the doug drabek mold.
if morris 's team needs a well pitched game , as in minn in 91 , morris
snaps the ball , and throw for ks. otherwise , he just tries to get people out.

as for clemens , in the elias stat book of 1992 , i believe
that clemens has the best lifetime record for his team , as compared to
when he does n't pitch. how bad would the red sox have been last year
without him \? can you say 92 phillies \?

i believe clemens is the better pitcher because of more power , and hsi

before folks jump on me , let me ask the net would the jays
have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris (given
his run support) \? how about an average ml pitcher \? i ca n't believe
that morris' performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive
impact on the jays performance ...
i know it 's very trendy nowadays to dump on morris , but let 's give credit
where credit is due.
it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris.
last year , when the team went 13 15 for the month of august , and all the
other starters were being shelled , and milwaukee was making a charge ,
morris went 5 1 with a pretty good era (i ca n't remember exactly).
also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save
the bullpen every fifth day. if he did n't help us win the al east , forget
about the pennent and the world series.

a guy who threw 240 innings with about .6 run lower era would have saved the
bullpen even more. say , somebody like frank viola (238 innings).

his run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was stottlemyer 's (5.90 runs)
and he won only 12 games. i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of
6 5 and 8 6 ballgames , but this is to his credit. he pitched only as good
as he needed to be. when he was up 6 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
(i hate this expression ! ). an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. but morris , being a
veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball. by saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra
(i hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line.

who we may not even have liked as players , but mourned for dying too young.

wiggins , alan \?

i believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died.

but that 's besides the point. i'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for rickey if he were killed. but , they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions.

example \?

how about jose canseco \? he gets a couple of speeding tickets , and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful. what the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway \? so why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time.

uh , he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car , and smashing it
into a tree , as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. and the
speeding reported was over 100 mph reckless driving.

or brian hunter and keith mitchell \? both of whom had dwi problems
towards the end of last year. (two years ago \? ) it was cited as a sign
of their immaturity , etc.

actually , i had n't heard about this thanks.

meanwhile , dykstra almost killed both himself and daulton , and i did n't
read any sportswriter complaining about that. they may have talked
about how bad it was for the phillies , but i never read anywhere
criticism of dykstra 's character (or daulton 's intelligence , for that
matter) based on this incident.

i do n't know what you were reading or watching , but i sure saw a lot about
that , and about dykstra 's poker games. most of the writing was along the lines
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was , and how he 'd hurt the team by
wracking himself and the catcher up , etc. espn raised questions about his
judgement , etc. the print media here in the sf area questioned why disciplinary
action would n't be taken against dykstra , and one article pointed out that if
lenny wanted to kill himself , there were ways that would n't endanger other
people 's lives. then there was dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it
was , etc.

another pair of suggestions
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe
no matter what the pitcher does.

quite honestly , this one is ridiculous. consider the following
scenario runner on third. as the pitcher starts to throw home , the
runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for
the suicide squeeze. the pitcher , seeing this , does not throw home ,
but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down. it is the
balk rule that prevents this from happening.

believe it or not , this actually happened to me once in an oba
(ontario baseball association) game in milton , ontario. i was the
batter and to my amazement , the umpire missed it. in the 12 years
that i played ball , this was worst piece of umpiring i ever saw.

did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night \? he addressed
this exact issue , and dismissed it rather quickly. according to gammons ,
advanced scouts are reporting that morris' fastball and slider still have
the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability
to keep the ball hidden during his release. guzman and stottlemyre have
gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a
little work with the pitching coach. gammons looks to see morris back in
top form within the month.

i , on the other hand , still have my doubts. morris' era last year was
rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games. his showing in the series was
not surprising. although i'm not convinced that he 's washed up , i have my
doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the
twins in '91.

in this morning 's paper (or was it on the radio \? ) , vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still

i agree with nick. what 's the big deal about long games \? if you want
to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes ,
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.

first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball. the lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches.


until six or seven years ago i was an enthusiastic fan of nfl football.
last year i hardly watched a game. what turned me off were the
incessant interruptions to the continuity of the game. a team scores.
2.5 minutes of commercials. kickoff. 1.5 minutes of commercials.
three downs and a punt. 2 minutes of commercials. aaaaarrrrgh !

earlier in this thread i commented on larussa and the a 's , whom i
believe institutionalize slow play. i do n't mind the cat and mouse
game with rickey on first in fact , i rather enjoy it. similarly
i would enjoy the battle with listach or lofton or polonia on first. what
i object to is when such games are played with karkovice on first ,
or when the game is a blowout. i do n't mind when the pitcher steps off
the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation , or when a hitter
steps out of the box to regain his concentration. what i object to
is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity.
when a game is exciting , these little delays serve as tension builders
and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game. when the
delays happen with regularity , they become nuisances , just like the
commercial breaks in football.

i understand the nfl imposed a number of rule changes to speed up
the games , basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move
the markers and the ball to the spots faster. that did not address
the problem of the continuity of the game. it may have appeased the
sponsors and the networks , but i would be amazed if it did anything
to enhance the experience of the fans.

similary , while some 3 hour baseball games bore me to tears , those are the
ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking exasperatingly
long periods to get ready for each pitch. i doubt if anyone watching
the braves giants game cared about gant stepping out. i doubt if anyone
watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an
opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that
was present. i would be totally opposed to any effort that would
eliminate that aspect of baseball.

on the other hand , i wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful
enough to sit down with alderson larussa duncan and explain that they
are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games
out the way that they do. i sure would n't mind a little arm twisting
there.

blame the associated press. after the official scorer balances the
official score card , they copy it and give it to several diffent people.
one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up (using a
template on a laptop) and transmit it to the ap offices in new york
(rockefeller center) via the telephone. the box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over ap 's news delivery services. if there are
corrections , those are issued later. it is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at shea (or whereever) whose fault that is. note the ap
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one

not totally true. for the past year or two , the ap has been getting box
scores from stats , inc. the ap representative in the press box is actually
a stats reporter ( 25 dollars a game , but free parking. and anybody can
do it.) the box is downloaded to stats in chicago , some quick error
checking is done , and then stats sends it to the ap. i'm not sure where
the appreveiations come in hear. i do n't think it is at stats 's. it may

while i'm mentioning stats reporters , they are always looking for new
people. especially if you live in cleveland or pittsburgh , you 're road
to getting into the press box may be real short. for more info , call
stats (708) 676 3322 , and ask about the reporter network. it 's a fun
way to get paid for watching baseball games.

last week they were in denver. maybe the ap person in denver did this

for the last couple of years , the braves have been fostering a program to reach to the latin american audience. this has included licensing spanish fan magazines , encouraging spanish co broadcasts , and marketing programs directed at the latin american community. one of the biggest heros to the latin american audience has been francisco cabrerra (a fact of which he was slightly embarrassed ! ).

one funny story is that during spring training , the braves played a game in mexico. this game was broadcast back to atlanta in spanish. it took the broadcasters a few innings to get a rythm going because they had to keep changing their location. seems it took a while to find a place where they could get a clear signal on their cellular phones through which they were calling the game !

last night , boston red sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating seattle
5 2. roger clemson pitch not so dominate. he walked at least 6 man in
first 6 inns. but valetin and greenwell hit homeruns and red sox prevail.

i think that game is must win for red sox in seattle , considering darwin will
faced seattle ace randy johnson tonight.

i agree with nick. what 's the big deal about long games \? if you want
to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes ,
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.

i hesitate to make assumptions about other people when they write , but
neither of you two sound as though you have kids , and you may not have
spouses either.

consider a night game starting at 7 05 pm est. (it was 7 35 last year ,
but cleveland showed what i thought was good sense in pushing it back.)
i go , and i'm into it until 11 pm minimum. extra innings could put me
well past midnight. even without extra innings , if the score is beyond
2 1 i ca n't see my family that night at all. if the next day is a workday ,
i may have to bag that as well. further , the later the game goes , the
colder it gets on the shore of lake erie.

all that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game. if
you say you do n't care about whether the game is sped up , impo you are
saying you do n't care where the time goes , and that the game is for people
who do n't have families and do n't have to get up for work the next day.

i do n't think it was that obvious at the time that viola was better.
morris and viola had comparable k ip ratios in 1991. viola was coming
off an injury , whereas morris was healthy.

at the time i did n't really want the sox to sign either. i was more
than a little worried about viola 's elbow.

but you surely remember my shout of relief when , after a week of
rumors that morris was coming to the red sox , they ended up with viola
instead.

now i'm even happier. viola seems to have rebounded nicely.

also , morris was willing to sign for only two years.
the jays do n't like to sign pitchers to long term contracts , which i think
is a sensible policy.

how long did viola sign for. three years \? i generally agree with
their policy of avoiding long term contracts for pitchers. but i
think they enforce it rather too strictly. these days the premier
pitchers all sign three or four year deals. which leaves the jays
with morris and stewart. if the jays want to compete for top free
agent pitchers , they will have to accept greater risks.

any idea what the option year deal is for morris \? are there any
automatic activation clauses \? what is the buyout amount \? f

subject yankee thoughts
organization clam associates , cambridge , ma 02141
lines 76


yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are
finally moving in the right direction. they should finish
over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race
in august. however , i would take back a few moves

1. the jim abbott trade.
i think abbott is not only an inspirational person , but a
great pitcher also. he could win the cy young this year ,
but he wo n't because the right side of the yanks infield
is n't good enough. so why was this not a good trade \?
jt snow. how many rookies have been able to step in and
immediately have the impact that he has had so far on
the angels \? i know it 's early , but if you 've seen this kid
hit , field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be
a tremendous player. the yanks should have kept him. what
about mattingly , you ask \? well it 's great that the yanks
have taken care of him and remained loyal , but he 's 10 years
older than snow and just does n't have the same bat speed as
before his back injury. it 's a shame , but as a yankee fan
who wants to see the best yankee team , i 'd take
snow over mattingly at first. the yanks also gave up two
promising propects with snow for abbott. besides , with
domingo jean , brien taylor , wickman , militello , and sterling
hitchcock , they are just loaded with propects. i know abbotts
only 26 , but this was too much to give up. i believe george
forced this trade because he believes (and he 's right) that
abbott will be a big hit in ny. however , i 'd like to see the
yankees build a baseball team , not an amusement show.

2. wade boggs.
i live in boston and like wade a lot. but , his career is
winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop
a long term solution (i.e. hensley muelins , russ davis , velarde \? ).
besides , wade just does n't have any range. what a shame about
charlie hayes , huh \?

3. spike owen.
see wade boggs. i 'd much rather see them develop dave silvestri
or whoever. wade and spike next to each other in the infield is
going to raise the yankee staff era 1 2 point. and these guys
are on the down sides of their careers.

4. danny tartabull.
yes he 's put up some tremendous numbers and it 's nice to think
about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year. but he
never is. we should expect 120 games max out of him. meanwhile ,
gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o'neil is playing
left field ! i believe o'neil led nl outfielders in assists
last year and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.

what i'm basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right
direction but are not ready to win a pennent this year. they should
(at the gm level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series. this
means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they
will be ready in a year or two.

i'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of george steinbrenner.
certainly , the boggs deal was all george. it looks like george is
planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world
series now. the veterans are always available and can be added at any
time (like boston did this year). develop the young players first ,
then add the one or two veterans (or in the yankees case , just keep
them). let 's all us yankee fans hope that george does n't dismantle
the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee
organization back into one of respect. i'm really afraid that he will
trade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for
example). george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is
still one or two years away. have patience george and we will all
enjoy the future. fire bucky and trade the kids and it 's baseball
hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time !

sam i'm not militello or millitello mandelbaum.

oh , yea , and chris bosio pitched a no hitter. one over the minimum , two
bases on ball in the first inning , one runner left , 95 pitches. i listened
to the game on radio and listening to dave niehaus call the game was a
real treat (as long as they keep ron fairly quite , i doubt if anyone is
better than niehaus but that fairly guy is really annoying me).

but , i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching , it would have
been a different story )

two shutouts in two nights against the hottest , best hitting team in
major league baseball .... pretty impressive in any league.

man , if johnson , bosio and hanson keep going the mariners could be a
really interesting team to follow this year. also , john cummings (rookie)
has had three solid outings with no support. if fleming comes back
this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year
(relief is another story , though grimace).

too cool. the first no hitter that i have been able to follow from
start to end. and again , i think niehaus will win some kind of award
for the way he called the game. the guy is truly a joy to listen to
he deserves a pennant race ...

npr this morning had an interview with linda mccarthy (name possibly
garbled by me) , an official historian for the cia. she has won an emmy
for research on moe berg for a tv documentary (which i know from nothing
but which sounds good). she said that among other things , berg was the
principal spy for the oss (cia 's wwii precursor) spying on axis atomic
programs , because of his physics background and language skills. she said
that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland , and had
instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb
research (he concluded they were two years behind , and did n't shoot him).
(i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb
program , but i do n't know how reliable this is.) unfortunately , npr did n't
mention any kind of a book she 's writing i 'd certainly buy it.

(in case you 're wondering about baseball relevance , berg was a longtime
mlb backup catcher. he was a member of an mlb all star team that toured
japan in 1934 , presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because
he was one of the few americans , much less mlb players , who spoke japanese.
photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids ,

probably time wasted in the middle of an inning , say by a batter

some evidence that is not working

take a look at the standings. it 's real easy to get so focussed on
minutinae and forget that the giants happen to be in first place. if it 's
working , you do n't screw it up by changing things , just because you think it
ought to be different.

some folks like to argue about theoretical details. i prefer to watch teams
win. when the giants slip to third , then we can talk about how to re arrange
the batting order. until then , i think it 's stupid to focus on what 's wrong ,
for the simple fact that it's working as it is.

p.s. does the mailing list maintainer think that will clark is the best
first baseman in the majors and that matt williams is a better power hitter
than any other ballplayer \?

in the majors \? i do n't follow al , so i wo n't comment on majors . in the nl ,
if i had my choice of any 1b in the league for my team , it 'd be clark , and
i 'd hit him third. (my fantasy team has both grace and murray on it , because
i 've never been able to get clark. i 'd take any of the three without
hesitation in real life , but i think clark is it).

williams not even close. i much prefer his defense , but when he is n't
headcasing it , matt has a good , solid swing and some real punch. if he drops
to .230 , then he wanders out of cleanup , but according to the latest
baseball weekly , he 's hitting .275 , and in the last week , hitting .296.
that 's not exactly chopped liver.

mostly , though , the giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that
continues , it 's rather silly to second guess their strategy. but evidently ,
some folks would rather be right than be first.

after a quick start , pena has been stuck in a rut. torre gave alicea

and it has worked again. pena went 3 for 3 last night against colorado.


without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war , i would like to
question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real
effect on his long term performance. sure , if a man is tired and needs
real rest , then taking a break might be a constructive act. perhaps if
a man is mentally strained , then sitting him down might help to the
extent that that helps him relax. but i would like to suggest that
in the long run , players do slump , and benching is probably irrelevant.

samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299

i do not claim that this is a complete statistical analysis that
proves the existence of clutch hitting , or compelling testimony that
samuel would have gotten a base hit. i'm sure there is something wrong
with the sample size , or that the basic assumption that clutch
performance is random invalidates any conclusions from this limited
application. or something or other. i do n't pretend to understand
statistical analysis.


well , we agree on the last part. ) one of the basic things you need to
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player 's performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. a
player 's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.
a player 's ability to walk or infielder 's defensive average are correlated
better. that is to say , given their past performance in those statistics
we can have a pretty good handle on how they 'll do next year. put in
some simple information about aging and you can do even better. one of
the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.
adding to the sample size does n't seem to help much. as a counterexample to
what you showed , consider the following two players from 1984 1987

non clutch clutch
ab h ba ab h ba

maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307
lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223

if you had had these two players in 1988 , by your logic , in those clutch
situations , you 'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye. well , in
1988 , maldonado hit .267 in non clutch and .190 in clutch , while lemon
hit .254 in non clutch and .313 in clutch . before you accuse me of
completely cooking the data , there were 96 players who had 25 clutch
at bats every year from 1984 1988 (according to elias). as a simple
measure of clutchness , let 's just look at clutch ba non clutch ba. if you use
'84 '87 to predict '88 for those 96 players , you 'd find that 27 of the
96 were below league average in that measure both in '84 87 and in '88 ,
26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were
above in one and below in the other. if you were just flipping coins ,
you 'd expect to get 24 above below in both and 48 that switched. the
difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment
is not statisically significant.

btw , correlating players' overall batting average from '84 '87 with
'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59 , which is significant at
something better than the 99.9 confidence level. correlating their
(clutch non clutch ba) for the same period gives a correlation of
0.088 , significant at no level of any interest.



everyone would agree (i hope) that a grand
slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three
is a very clutch hit. there is just no way to predict who is more
likely to get the clutch hit based on past performance (hitting in
clutch situations).


if you say so , dave. no way.


actually , it 's technically incorrect to say that we ca n't predict future
clutch performance. it 's more correct to say that we ca n't predict
future clutch performance with any skill.

the saturday game in montreal (apr 17) that rockies won 9 1. i have n't
paid much attention to gallarraga since he left the expos but his stance
seemed to be much different. he stands more erect and very open , with his
left foot pointing to 3rd base. i'm wondering if this is a recent change
in stance for him \? andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. he could
always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. if this is indeed a new
stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily \?

yes , the stance is new. don baylor was his batting coach at st. louis last
year , and now , as his manager , is continuing to work with him. maybe andres
has a weak left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the
ball. or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics i dunno. but the
change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago. his
selectivity has not changed.

you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team .

fine , are you willing to bet that he will bat .400 the rest of the way \?

the point is that he has hurt the rockies so far it 's that he will hurt
them , eventually. just as much as he hurt the expos and the cardinals the
past couple seasons.

if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen) ,
then i would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches. my comment

it has happened for the past 3 seasons where have you been \?

that he is n't paid to walk does n't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it 's more along the lines of he 's
batting .400 and leading the league in rbi 's so what bloody difference
does it make if he is n't drawing a lot of walks \? sheesh.

huckabay 's counting frames for bat speed discussion ommited...


well , it 's just studying tape , frame by frame. that 's all. the biggest
thing that you notice , however , is how bastardized the strike zone has
become. death to the umpires' union ! the plate is 17 ( 1 ) across ,
not 23 ! call the high strikes strikes , and quit calling pitches 3
outside strikes they 're balls !


speaking of this 23 wide strike zone....

i 'd sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that
an overview shot of home plate is available. cbs had this during the
ws , or did i just dream it.

these pictures would be a feedback device for the umpires so that they can
see just how terrible (or not) there calls were. tapes could be sent to
the league as evidence of bad ball strike umpiring. tapes are available
as evidence of bad out safe calls on the bases.

i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series (and , in
fact all year) have been pretty much consistently correct. remember the rule
says it 's a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone.

i would certainly agree that high strikes are not called (who could argue
this point \? ) but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well.

in article mssc5y5u0.4dn@netcom.com mss@netcom.com (mark singer) writes

actually , i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem.
it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve. (the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting
vs. non clutch the y axis being the number of players.) certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell.

right. most definitely.

my supposition is that if we were to find the same players
consistently (year after year) at one end of the bell or the other ,
then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about
those players (as opposed to all baseball players).

this may be the root of the confusion...

please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind. note
that i am not (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the
question at hand.

suppose we have a simplified lotto game. you pick a number from 1 10
and win if that number is drawn. suppose we have a large population
of people who play this game every week.

in the first year of the game , approximately 1 4 of the population
will win 7 or more times.

in the second year of the game , 1 4 of those 7 time winners will again
be 7 time winners.

in the third year of the game , 1 4 of those who won 7 or more times in
each of the first two years will win 7 again.

suppose i started with 1024 people in my population. after three
years , i have 32 people who have consistently , in each of the last
three years , won 140 or more the number of times expected.

do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game \?
no. because we know there is no skill involved. nothing about these
consistent winners can influence their chances of winning. but
suppose we do n't know whether or not there is a chance that skill
might be involved. perhaps some of the people in our population are
psychic , or something. how would we test this hypothesis \?

we can look for correlations in the population. now most of the
population will show zero correlation. but our psychics should show a
high positive correlation (even if they are n't very good psychics ,
they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years). net
result \? a small positive correlation over the entire population.

this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having
with others on this topic. must any conclusion based on statistical
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before
it has any validity \? is it impossible (or irrational) to apply
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base \?

well , zero correlation is zero correlation. you mention that sabo has
hit poorly in the clutch over the last 3( \? ) years. but if we look at
the past , we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse
as they are to remain consistent. the length of the streak does n't
seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be
clutch or choke the next year. is there any reason to expect this
streak to be different from past streaks \?

now if it were true that 75 of all three year streaks remained true
to form , then we might have something useful. but then we would n't
have zero correlation. instead we have 50 of all three year streaks
remain true to form , and 50 of all three year streaks reverse . you
look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more
likely to choke this year . but it would be equally valid to look at
those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to
be clutch this year , since the probabilities are split 50 50 each
way.

i completely accept that reasoning. again , what if we were to find
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent
basis \?

then we would have something useful. and we would also have a
positive correlation. but for every individual that exhibits such a
pattern and holds true , there is another who exhibits such a pattern
and then reverses.

i like the clark williams bonds order.
pitchers can only walk clark with 2 outs (unlike last year).

williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming
in the on deck circle. since matt has a terrible batting eye ,
this helps the giants a lot.

when bonds gets on base all by himself , he can try to steal 2nd
and then be driven in with a single by thompson , manwaring , or clayton.

if you bat bonds before the other sluggers , then you do n't want
him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a
big inning.

also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he
is such a good base stealer (a walk is a potential double).

the only draw back is when clark and williams are clogging up the
bases infront of bonds... and i think that 's a problem the
giants will be glad to see especially if robby thompson gets hot.

another pair of suggestions
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe
no matter what the pitcher does.

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time (x 3 to 5)
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base
as if walked.

this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases
considerably. suppose the pitcher uses up (n 1) of his n pick off
attempts. the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base ,
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it
right this time.

would this suggestion apply to pick off attempts per pitch , per

replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with kevin 's 55.4 out
making ability , how many extra hits would go by \?

to try and correlate it to reality a little more , i 've calculated net
hits stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make. by the same method i 've calculated net extra
bases (doubles and triples let by).

finally , i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution , or
dcon . basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
i add this number to ops to get dops (defense onbase plus slug) , which
should represent the player 's total contribution to the team. so do n't
take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this
article.

the short version definition of terms
hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell
nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder
ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented , as a rate.
dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player 's total contribution.

dcon formula ((nhs ndp) pa) ((nhs ndp neb) ab)
why such a bizzare formula \? basically , it 's designed to be added into the
ops , with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored .
the extra outs are factored into obp , while the extra bases removed are
factored into slg. that 's why i used pa and ab as the divisors.

the subject line says it all. what is the rule that qualifies
a pitcher as making a save \?
imho this is the most untrustworthy , silly stat , by today 's rules , in all
of baseball. my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least
appear in the on deck circle. also , the lead a pitcher enters with cannot
excede three runs.

this is a phenomenon known around work as ready fire aim. i am astounded at
the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only
do n't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. in fact , there 's a
plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins.

for the record , there are two ways that a reliever can get a save
he must finish the game and either
1. have entered the game with the tying run on base , at bat , or on deck.
2. have pitched at least three innings effectively.
a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game.

i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in
determining winners savers etc. for instance , a pitcher can come in in the
ninth with a lead , blow the lead , fall behind , have his team come back in
the next half inning and earn the win. has this pitcher earned a win , no
way.

but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat , not saves.

i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his
teammates rally to tie the score. assume he came in to start the fourth
and left after the eighth. his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. the
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat
satisfaction.

this again does n't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your
post.

it was. are they still , officially \?
if so , why \? and how did they receive this label \?

unoffically , but without a doubt , america 's team is the cubs. why \?
well , my guess is because america loves underdogs. every year , no matter
the cubs' talent or the predictions , they never (as close to never as
possible) win anything. over the years , as the losing has mounted , america
has fallen in love with these perennial losers. the cubs have more fans
in chicago then some teams do worldwide. the cubs have more fans
worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined.
an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season
like no one else. (including the ws champs) it must be that eternal hope.
this is the year. they 've got the talent. they 're off to a good start.
they 've got the pitching (or hitting , or whatever their strong point is
at the time). it 's that inevitability that the cubs will eventually
win the ws again. when \? only god knows. since it 's been so long , it
could come at any time , or it could be another 85 years. but until they
do finally win , and start winning consistently , the cubs will remain

you are absolutely correct. braves fans are nothing but a bunch of
bandwagoners. correct me if i am wrong , but 4 or 5 years ago you couldnt give
away a ticket to see the braves play.i would bet my next paycheck that 80 of
the so called braves fans living outside of georgia at the present time can not
name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. on the other hand , ask any
cubs fan living anywhere in the united states to name 3 players from any given
year and 80 of them probably could.
granted , the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park , but
that does not mean they diserve the title america 's team
the only reason they are considered america 's team is because of ted
turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation.
i 'll consider toronto america 's team before the braves

as the heading indicates , it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not
batting 4th for the giants behind will clark. barry is such an awesome and
consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho , to
have williams , a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting
4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the
giants.

2 simple reasons

(1) batting williams ahead of bonds will create a left(clark) ,
right(williams) , left(bonds) situation in the middle of the
batting order. this makes it tougher for opposing manager
to change pitchers.

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to
walk williams to get to bonds.

both your reasons are not good ones. joe morgan thinks that bonds clark
williams should be the 3 4 5 hitters. while he believes that clark bonds
williams is fine , he definitely is of the opinion that bonds should hit
ahead of williams. i am inclined to agree with him.
your first reason is not valid because bonds can hit both lefties and righties
very well. he hits lefties or righties better than any other giant
williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season.
but , the bottom line is bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive
hitter than williams , and i prefer to take my chances with bonds driving in
the 1 , 2 or 3 hitters (who are expected to have high obps) than with williams.
williams would get more fastballs with bonds on first and second base open
because of the threat of bonds stealing.

it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris.
last year , when the team went 13 15 for the month of august , and all the
other starters were being shelled , and milwaukee was making a charge ,
morris went 5 1 with a pretty good era (i ca n't remember exactly).
also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save
the bullpen every fifth day. if he did n't help us win the al east , forget
about the pennent and the world series.

his run support was high (5.98 runs) but so was stottlemyer 's (5.90 runs)
and he won only 12 games. i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of
6 5 and 8 6 ballgames , but this is to his credit. he pitched only as good
as he needed to be. when he was up 6 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get themseleves out
(i hate this expression ! ). an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. but morris , being a
veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in
baseball. by saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra
(i hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line.

i do n't buy this at all. i think things are colored to a very large
degree of preconceived notions of who the players involved are. try
this exercise

xxx is pitching today. his team scores 4 in the first inning , and 3
in the fourth. xxx gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th. in the fifth ,
he gives up 3 runs. in the 6th , he gives up 2 more. the score is now
7 5 , with xxx 's team still on top.

i contend that if xxx were jack morris , the assessment would be he is
a gutty veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win.

if xxx were mike trmbley , the assessment would be he is an
inexperienced rookie who does n't know how to pitch. needs more
seasoning. send him to aaa. or to the spice rack.

did you see the same game i saw \? gant , most reasonable , argued a
horrible call which hirschbeck , correctly , did nothing about. gant
then proceeded to walk halfway to 3rd base , lean on his bat and
glare at hirschbeck. while i do n't necessasarily subscribe to the
theory of showing people up , this was an obvious attempt by gant to
do so to hirschbeck. he left hirschbeck no choice but to take control
of the situation. the bottom line is gant started a dangerous
power struggle with hirschbeck when his team needed him most and
he lost.


the events i saw were
1) called strike by hirschbeck

was it just me , or did it look like hirschbeck pointed to
the 3b umpire before calling that strike \? i thought that 's
why gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire
he thought hirschbeck had gotten checked swing help from the wrong
umpire.

2) shocked looking gant asks for appeal to first
3) no appeal to first
4) gant steps out of batters box.
5) hirschbeck immediately orders gant back in. bad move
6) gant ignores hirschbeck and walks off. bad move
7) hirschbeck yells at gant. gant is silent.
8) hirschbeck calls for the pitch.

after hirschbeck called for the pitch , but before the pitch was thrown ,
cox came onto the field. it was obvious that he was trying to get time
called before the pitch , but no one was watching.

9) pitch is called a strike.
10) cox argues (could n't see when he came on the field)
11) cox is ejected , players everywhere
12) play finally resumes.


gant should n't have ignored hirschbeck. not returning made the strike
call fairly likely. although i suspect an argument might have gotten
gant tossed altogether. but if hirschbeck had let gant step out , the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

your listing pretty much agreed with what i saw , with the aforementioned
addendums. perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark. personally ,
i was amazed that gant did n't get ejected. but that 's why cox did
it 's called protecting your players.

and to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game ,
all i can say is that you 'd be making baseball history. even in
the worst baseball brawls , usually only the major instigators are
ejected , not everyone who comes onto the field. and i 'd have to
say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game
than what the braves did fri. night.

anyhow , that 's my last two cents on the subject , barring
outrageous postings. i will try to keep my eyes open
for more incidents involving hirschbeck. i think there will
be some with other teams as well. i hope not.

batter and to my amazement , the umpire missed it. in the 12 years
that i played ball , this was worst piece of umpiring i ever saw.


now this sounds like a fun topic....

in a slo pitch softball game , we had the first base dugout. one of our
players hit a shot down the first base line with the bases loaded. the only
question was fair or foul. ball hits ground , chalk flies. umpire calls
foul. we give him the standard did n't you see chalk line. his response
was it hit the foul half of the line . we all started laughing.

mark pede


not bad. we had a similar situation. slowpitch softball , bases loaded ,
weakest hitter at the plate. he hits a line drive over the third
baseman 's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in
foul ground , almost hitting the fence down that side of the field.
but the umpire called fair ball ! i was coaching third , yelling at evrybody
to move up a base. the ump 's position it was still fair when it
passed third base .
why the other team did n't immediately protest i 'll never know we
certainly were n't going to argue about it , since every body did manage
to advance one base safely.

there was also the time when a batted ball ricocheted off my (runner
from second base) leg , fielded by the ss , steps on second to force the
runner from first , and throw to first in time for what the umpire
called a triple play protest removed when we won the game anyway.

to go through the 1993 championship season without a

at starting one.

except there 's one little problem...

i do n't know the first thing about how to do it or

in regard to boggs i 'll relate a story about a yankee fan at fenway last year
for opening day. i was there to see them face baltimore and could n't help but
listen to the boston fans talk about various players on the team. one guy was
totally obliterating boggs , how he sucks , etc.... i told him i was a yankee
fan and i 'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back. he
said a pile of sh t. i know boggs had some personal problems while playing for
boston , but come on he 's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed
dimension to the yanks. a solid hitter , a decent fielder and more importantly
a teacher , ask pat kelly. i think he 's got a few good years left in his bat
and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the american league
east this year. boston fans have no class ! ! ! they 'll probably boo him like
crazy his first time back in pinstripes and i hope he goes 4 for 4 and shuts
them up.

are you going to pick , guys who have won the most ws rings , or guys who
could contribute the most to your team. say the reds were dumb enough to
not protect larkin , and the jays did n't protect alfredo. who would you
pick \?

for an expansion team \? i'm pretty sure i would go with the rings , as long
as their salaries and ages were n't too high. i would want the fans to be
able to identify the players. i would like a championship attitude in the
clubhouse.

as for larkin and griffin \? salaries aside , i would have to consider which
player is likeliest to contribute to a ws victory. past performance , age and
attitude would all be integral to my decision. i certainly would n't just
haul out my copy of gillete and pick larkin , as many others would. and ,
unlike many others who post to this group , i hardly consider myself quali

actually , according to the da information posted by sherri , boggs is superior
defensively to have. here 's their defensive averages for the last five

1988 1989 1990 1991 1992
boggs .643 2 .659 47 .550 54 .653 33 .634 32
hayes .601 40 .622 18 .606 14 .574 28

if hayes is a defensive standout at third , he 's done a good job in disguising
it. to put it another way , compared to an average third baseman last year

boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs , turned 2 more double plays , and
prevented 11 doubles.

hayes let 12 more grounders go by for hits , turned 6 more double plays , and
prevented 4 doubles.

braves' weaknesses
a)weak defense a couple of bond 's doubles and a bloop by
clayton would 've been caught by a better outfield.
b)weak bullpen ha ha , their closers are bedrosian and howell !

not an astute observation this is a straw bullpen. the lefties ,
stanton mercker are strong , and wohlers is down learning a new pitch.
the bullpen is fine , probably superior.

c)over reliance on pendleton a pendleton slump becomes a team slump.


also false. gant , nixon , justice , hunter , blauser present a decent enough

some discussion about whether elias is money grubbing deleted

funny , it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks ,
which are nothing but collections of statistics , are authored by bill james
and stats inc. (and howe , for the minor league handbook) .

and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies
as a book with statistics , while the elias analyst is a statistics book .
the analyst contains more stats , sure , but it also contains more dialogue.

finally , the point was not about the word statistics . it was about
money grubbing . i do n't see how anyone who has looked at the bill
james player ratings book cannot consider him money grubbing.

bob vesterman.

some thoughts and facts ,

1.) bill james is a partial owner of stats , inc. however he has almost
nothing to do with the day to day operations of the company , although he
does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.
(the handbook , but not the scoreboard). to the best of my knowledge , the
only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section
of the handbook , and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook.

2.) the debate over elias goes way back. bill james' early stuff was hampered
by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price.
project scoresheet , and later , stats were founded to fill this void. you
can call stats , and ask them for a report on just about anything in their
database , and they will provide it for a price , of course. or you could
just log into their online system and look at the data yourself. having
attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past (football , not baseball) , they
just do n't do that. in stats eyes , the high ground comes from making the
information available at all.

3.) that being said , i'm pretty dissapointed by bill 's book this year , too.
i am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers
desire to have the book come out sooner than april.

hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.

(bias alert. i am a former part time employee of stats.)

magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs.


i do n't know why you guys keep bickering about morris. the stats show he
is a mediocre pitcher at best (this year is another case) , he just happened
to win 21 games. i saw many of his games last year , he did pitch some good
games. but this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense , he was
constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6 8th innings (the clutch innings)
and the jays would somehow scrape a win for him. another major factor in
his 21 wins , is that cito 'i dont realize i have a bullpen' gaston would
leave morris in for ever , therefore giving him many more chances to win
games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year).

is n't the best anything of all time.



henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all time , arguably. winfield has
meant more to his team than henderson. unlike daryll , henderson tries
hard. he is an amazing centerfielder. rickey is very good , maybe better
than winfield , i was angry at the dissing of winfield. though winfield has
been better than henderson lately. check the numbers , winfield may
surprise you. he will have 3000 basehits , and should have 500 homeruns
when he retires(wishful thiniking if he plays to 45)

last night , boston red sox win its 11 games of 14 games by beating seattle
5 2. roger clemson pitch not so dominate. he walked at least 6 man in
first 6 inns. but valetin and greenwell hit homeruns and red sox prevail.

clemens struggled with his control , but was also the beneficiary
of some pretty shoddy umpiring. but to be fair , most of the walks were
early in the game , and he adjusted. he was also helped by (dare i say
it \? ) some pretty good defense by the sox , including rivera playing
at second , not his normal position.

actually , clemens is pretty lucky that he got the win , considering the sox
almost gave up the lead in the bottom of the 7th on mo 's error catching
a throw over.

i think that game is must win for red sox in seattle , considering darwin will
faced seattle ace randy johnson tonight.

must win \? in april \?
they 've already won 4 more games so far than anyone thought they would at this

major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). ( invariably , all the
arguments from people who do n't like to watch baseball on t.v. say the
same thing the games are too long and too boring. baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider t.v. appeal. if you look at
it , though , baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games. the difference is that there is more action in that duration in
football games. perhaps if there were more action in baseball games , you
would get more of those fans to tune in. anyway , coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.
on soapbox yet another reason to get a commisioner now since it 's obvious
that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in
nebraska. off soapbox

how can you say there is more action in football then baseball. a football
game consists of approximately 120 plays and the average duration of a play
is around 8 seconds. this means that in a game that lasts approximately 3
hours you have about 16 minute s of action. in a baseball game you have
upwards of two hundred pitches. there are very few on field strategy
on field stratgy sessions (ie. huddles) and you always have a chance to win
until the last out is made.



ah , but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and
a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time , but it happens
when there 's less than 5 minutes to go quite often). this sense creates
drama , even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer 's
attention. in baseball , only 3 players are involved in the action for about
(here comes a wild guess) 70 of the time \? and they 're just playing a
sophisticated game of catch hold the ball step out of the box adjust chains
touch self in interesting locations. there 's a lot of dead time with the
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher
who then takes (8 \? 10 \? ) pitches or helen dell playing the organ (dodger fans
will appreciate that one). to the non baseball junkie this is boring.
at any rate , i'm not putting baseball down for this i 've been an avid
fan since i can remember it 's just that watching a baseball game on
t.v. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie. that 's what major
league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of
shortening the game. it 's because of t.v. not because football has more
action than baseball .

lines 88

(dale seer stephenson) writes
while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around ,
gant was n't ordered back in the box sooner , he was ordered back immediately.
as soon as he stepped out , hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.
now , gant does n't take a lot of walks between pitches. the only reason
he did then because he was very bothered by the call. i expect his
concentration was n't there yet , and in a crucial situation i imagine it 's
best to be as calm as possible. contributing factors would be gant 's
bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the braves long scoring
drought.

and it is not hirschbeck 's job to help gant with any of these difficulties.
if gant ca n't gather his concentration for whatever reason , that just makes
him all the more meat in the batter 's box. the umpire 's job is to
maintain flow of play. gant is not entitled to time to regather his
faculties.

nor is anyone else.

now , it 's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
telling you to get in there. you know the umpire is going to do something
(call for a strike , throw you out , etc.). gant was wrong.

absolutely. i think it 'd be more accurate to say gant was foolish.

but hirschbeck was more wrong , in my biased view. aside from the major chip
he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem. gant had a reason
to want some time (disputed strike call).

if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout , games would last
about nine fifteen weeks , if jack morris or dave whiner stieb were
pitching. a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out.
suck it up , get back in the box , and never badmouth the blue. they 're
not going to change their mind , and you 're just going to come across
as a pinhead , which wo n't help you with the borderline calls.

ftr i never speak to umpires when i do n't know them personally , nor
do i glance at them , or react to calls. as a result , i think i get more
than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate , because i have a
rep of having a good eye. (actually , there are a lot of negative
connotations that go with that rep , including copious questions about
my masculinity , party affiliation , and sexual preference.)

gant had n't been wasting time all
game. the game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old.

irrelevant. he was wasting time then.

the score was 1 0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.
is there any reason hirschbeck could n't , and should n't , cut gant a little
slack \?

1. because it 's not his job.

2. because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily
extend to those 3 hour games. (kind of like the phantom dp.)

for no discernible constructive reason , hirschbeck disrupted the
game , caused a five minute delay , and materially hurt the batter in a key
situation. did he have a date to get to \?

gant hurt himself , and the braves disrupted the game. your biases are
exposed , and i'm sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants ,
which is like phyllis schlafly defending gary segura , jack kevorkian ,
and the swedish abortion team.

and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game.

i believe terry said the magic word. there are some truly quick ways
to get tossed from a ballgame. for a primer , email me.

good ways to get tossed from a game

1. ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutri system.
2. kiss rich garcia on the lips , and say hi , honey , i'm home !
3. goose eric gregg.
4. ask bruce froemming if his parents had any children that lived.
5. get naked.

point one sex.
point two violence.

sex cheerleaders , cheerleaders , and more cheerleaders. dancing on top
of the dugouts. bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh
inning stretch. running up and down the stands. (the south bend
white sox actually do this).

violence baseball players are such utter wuss boys. the pitcher beans
the batter , and both benches empty in what is called a bench clearing
brawl . everybody just stands there and looks at each other. stand ,
stand , stand. look , look , look. ho , hum. then , the bullpens
come running in. when they reach the fight , they just stand
there , too.

anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
should be suspended and fined. further , the bullpens should fight
it out in the outfield , so as not to waste time and energy running
to the infield.

perhaps you can give a more recent citation of any player mentioned as a
malingerer \? thanks.

i guess i do n't understand your question. i was trying to imply that
the accusations of glenn davis' malingering were certainly not played
up very much.

still , if the 'whispers' reached san francisco , it is certainly possible they
were stronger elsewhere. also , it was teammates making the aspersions. in any
event , i know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years.

but , in any case , i believe mike lavalliere has been accused of poor
work habits and general sloth recently (probably not malingering) ,
just as he was being released. it 's interesting that nobody heard
much about these problems before if they were so important.

i have heard sanders called many things as well. i have not heard him called
lazy. given the 2 sport phenomenon , it would be difficult to label him as
such.

exactly so. which means his media detractors have had to say other
things about him. i believe it 's a general phenomenon that if writers
do n't like you , they 'll find a label that will stick no matter who you
are. i find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in
why writers feel they need to act this way. (not that this fascinates
me that much , either.)

uh , the original author 's point was that black and white players were por
trayed differently by the media , and towards this , he gave a highly selected
list to prove his case. sanders' name showed up eventually. i dispute that
sanders has ever been called lazy by the media .

hmm , big ego , possible club house disturbance , etc. is that good press \?

no , but it is n't the total extent of the press he received in
pittsburgh , where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and
spoiled by the local columnists. again , the actual words used may
shift around with time and expediency , but lazy tends to be higher
on the list for non white players , at least in my subjective opinion.

aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study
on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken ,
and on teams like the red sox which have been traditionally white.
nowadays , most people think of carl yastrzemski as one of those
blue collar , hard working guys , but in the early 70s he was often
portrayed as a lazy bum. really.

hmm. i never heard anyone accuse canseco of being lazy. nor sierra.

i 've heard accusations that canseco was a bad fielder , but could be a
great one if he put his mind to it . ignoring whether or not he is a

actually , dave stewart is (was) one of the most vocal about this. in any
event , that is not lazy .

at least one poster in the last week has fired off a major screed on the
canseco is lazy issue , so i think your point is at best a quibble , and
probably weaker than that.

uh , that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first . it is not a
quibble , then , to state that the media did not portray canseco as being
lazy. if the other person chooses to so accuse him , after my post , that does not
make it a quibble. and in fact , the media around here tend(ed) to play up his
time in the wieght room. hardly lazy , and hardly a quibble . have you ever
seen any mediot portray canseco as lazy \? unconcerned with his fielding , yes.
lazy , no.

bad fielder , i think this is still interesting. for that matter , i
think canseco 's colorful off field antics get lots more national
attention than those of , say , roger clemens.

well , he 's had a few more of them.

at least more that you 've heard about. i think one of the questions
here surrounds selective reporting. having said that , i have to say
that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be
unfalsifiable , at least by those of us who are n't reporters , police ,
or private investigators.

well , canseco has been involved in several felonies , including his high speed
record , carrying concealed fire arms , and of course the domestic violence.
clemens had a run in at a bar. canseco had that , as well , and in both cases , the
coverage was relatively minimal.

make an interesting counter argument. btw which jackson are we talking
about here \? reggie , bo , darrin , danny , or ... \?

uh , if the only evidence offered is anecdotal , how can it be objected that the
counter to it is also anecdotal \?

and it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title (among
others) has been accused at some time of caring more for his own
stats than for the good of the team . it also seems to me that you 're

kirby puckett \? i have never heard this accusation made of puckett. i
have heard it of boggs. actually , i believe it of him , but that 's another
matter.

not living in minnesota , i ca n't say whether or not this line has ever
been used against kirby there. as far as boggs goes , i'm not sure why
you bring him up , since he 's one of the obvious prototypes for the line
i quoted (along with ted williams , rod carew , and many others).

uh , yes , and i agree with your assesment of boggs , rather specifically. however ,
you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of
selfishness. i have not ever , anywhere , heard this said of puckett. pendleton ,
either. similarly , brett , b williams , and others.

how about daryl strawberry \? and i think the plus or minus refers more to
the born again types , ie , butler and gaetti.

again , you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes. on the other
hand , my argument by is of the because jon says so variety if we have
no other data. i have to admit i have problems generating lists of
non white players who became (in)famous for their religious or
political beliefs , while names like butler , gaetti , dravecky , knepper ,
hersheiser , et al. come rolling out.

there are others. perhaps they are simply not as outspoken , except in the
case of the born again types i mention.

last night on the giants mets radio broadcast hank and ted were
discussing the fact that there were only 16 players who had ever hit
200 homeruns and stolen 200 bases in their career (while hojo was
batting). anyone have a list \? not as easy as it sounds to come up
with all of them. i could n't. mays , mantle , aaron , henderson , morgan ,
bonds (dad) , \? \? \? frank robinson \? molitor \? yount \? guessing now. i 'd
be interested to see the whole list.

first , please watch your line lengths. not everyone has autowrap.
second , franklin to the rescue ! here 's the list
player hr sb
aaron 755 240
mays 660 338
frobinson 586 204

morgan 268 689
pinson 256 309
yount 235 247
kgibson 208 253
sandberg 205 297

players marked with an are still active numbers through 1991. that 's only
15 the 16th is probably rickey henderson , who was listed at 184 hr , 994
sb or george brett , listed as 186 sb , 291 hr.

the surprises \? probably reggie , bayor , and wynn for steals. maybe morgan (to
a lot of people) for homers. i was kind of surprised to realize that
sandberg has that many steals , though i was n't surprised that the number was
200.

during the local rockies broadcast the other day don baylor
went out to bring in a relief pitcher and a graphic came up
on the screen that it was the so and so sponsored pitching
change. i saw another game where the pinch hitter was sponsored.

at other times during the game rockies announcer duane kuiper was
setting up the strategy that the defense might use with the expectation
that charlie jones would jump in and discuss the situation. but
what does charlie do , he read 's a beer advertisement and leaves
duane hanging. duane 's strategy proved prophetic.

these examples happen over and over on radio and t.v. braodcasts
making them sometimes very boring to listen to.

even matching hitting pitching styles. all of these will give me some
advantage if used properly.

was predicting the future , the next ab. he was predicting that
sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel.

he believed one of two things 1) sabo was more likely than samuel
to get a hit or 2) that more good would be done in the long run
by leaving sabo in regardless of the expectation of the actual outcome.

in fact you do n't know what perez had in mind when he left sabo in.

by supporting the swap , you are predicting the opposite.

in fact , i do n't think anyone is claiming that they can predict
the future , or any particular future event. but we can believe
that certain trends are due to a cause (whether or not we have
identified the cause) and therefore will continue.

and i am not dismissing your work. i'm stating my opinion.
you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work.
well , yes. you are aware of its existance. you claim to be incapable
of understanding it (though i suspect you are simply unwilling). yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite. you do n't seem to think the
work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).
i 'd say this is insulting.

i think seeing insults in other people 's opinions is kind of silly.
after all , mark did n't call you a total idiot , or call your work
stupid , he simply stated that it did n't change his opinion on the
subject.

i did not say that it is a consistent skill.
i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
certain set of circumstances.
right ! this is the beef. it has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under any circumstances. at least none that
we 've been able to come up with. if you know of some where it is an
indicator of future performance , please let us in on your secret.

if player a hits better on tuesdays and always has , and mark believes
that it might be an indication that he will hit on tuesday better next
season as well , would you respond the same way \? at some point you
might admit that all variable might not be known to you (who knows
what this guy does every monday night \? maybe he sees his sports
shrink on tuesday mornings , or has his vitamin b shots monday nights \? )

but this is something that 's true of one guy only. it does n't
mean that there will be a meaningful correlation for the entire
league by days of the week , nor that there should be. but it does n't
mean we ca n't make predictions based on that for that particular
player.

i believe that by
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll
just have to wait and see.

is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year \? or is this
a prediction for all batters who have , over the past few years , hit
(xxx amount \? ) worse in the clutch than overall \?

i only see a prediction for one player here. i do n't see anything
about all batters.

here 's another one for you. in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in non clutch situations each year. i presume you think
this is random.
i'm not going to get into case analysis. sure , you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. you
can also find those who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit well in
'92.

that 's exactly what mark is trying to do though. find hitters
that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions
for these hitters based on their past performance.

major league ballplayers. it just makes me think that in 1993
joe carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in non clutch situations.
gambler 's fallacy. unless there is reason to expect consistency , a

huh \? what does gambler 's fallacy have to do with anything \?
whether you can know the reason for correlation or not , you ca n't
deny that it has existent , you can only make an argument that
you do n't think it is likely to continue to exist because you
ca n't see a reason for it to exist.

run proves nothing. can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to
correlate from one year to the next \? i 've seen a detailed study of

someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate.
the argument along the lines of star player with l r splits will
always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game
(i.e. opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to
face him , where his manager will not pull him for a ph)

i do n't see how you can deny it.) as for total idiot \? yes. if you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong , i would say the term fits nicely.
so tell me \? does the term fit \? or do you have an open mind \?

what about you \? if the shoe fits , will you wear it with an open mind \?

and also that gant should have listened to him. however , what is with this

( non mediot ) i have seen endorse this policy.

i wholeheartedly endorse it.

i have no problem with the
length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd ( and other announcers )
bitching about it. i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a
ticket , i do n't mind a game that last more than 2 10. i really do n't
understand it.

have n't been to many a 's games , have you \?

seriously , i do n't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts
a long time because there is good baseball being played. however , i do n't
like 3 2 games that take 3 hours , because there 's a lot of dead time going
on in that game. i do n't find anything exciting about watching batter or
pitcher wander around between pitches , or watching the catcher make a slow
walk to the mound , or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason
(whitey herzog used to be the master of this the game could be way out of
reach , and he 'd still be making switches for platoon advantage).

i want to see the game , not people standing around. i do n't really enjoy
watching nfl football games in person , for example , because there 's so much
dead time (you do n't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch
it on television , because they 're busy showing you replays). i do n't like
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game
(the ncaa has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next
year they 're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next
year , and they 're going to a 35 second clock).

there 's also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if i'm
watching them on the tube , and if i'm going there in person. for me , going
to an a 's game has become a major commitment of time , one that i'm not
willing to make that often the length of their games is costing the a 's
revenue from me.

if black players ca n't survive being mediocre or worse , how can mcrae
and chamberlain be explained \?

nobody 's saying it 's a hard and fast rule. my point is that white
players are likely to stick around longer if they 're mediocre.

i went through tb iii and made a list of 10 year of and 1b who were
negative in both adjusted batting runs and total player rating. tpr
has some problems , but it 's generally not too far off for a career ,
imho. all players who played most of their career after 1960 were
considered.

here are a through i (have n't done the rest yet)

armas , bailor , balboni , bannister , beauchamp , beniquez , bergman , berry ,
biittner , blair , bochte , bonnell , bosley , bradford , l. brown , buckner ,
cabell , c.castillo , cater , cimoli , cline , clines , coles , d. collins ,
davalillo , dernier , dilone , gaston , geiger , geronimo , gosger , heep ,
iorg.

a few black players there a lot of white and hispanic.

hmmm...one question...how do you differentiate hispanic and black \?
after all , some people fall into both categories...rafael ramiriez
comes to mind...and he 'd fit into this grouping also.
(oops...he 's not an of 1b...although he is a light hitting
utility player. sorry about that. but miguel dilone would
qualify , if i remember correctly.)

when i say black , i mean us born black people for the purposes of this
discussion. hispanic players were in baseball before 1947 , and one
team in the 50 's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better
with the local audience than blacks did.

and why would more hispanics stick around than blacks \?

do n't know. but remember this is the country that had special racial
laws for one group and one group only blacks. our national history
includes huge , long term , global tensions regarding the black minority
the hispanic minority , while often discriminated against , has never been
the object of national obsession.

it might also be worth your while to subdivide the data into careers
starting at 10 year intervals. i would think that your prediction
would be most true for careers starting in the 1960 's and least true
for careers starting in the 1980 's. of course , you 'd also have to
compare total ml racial percentages for the era in question.

absolutely. as i said before , i expect that this effect is disappearing.
but it certainly did exist , and all out talk of twg 's and all that is
not without some small reason.

i'm of the opinion that your point is less valid today than it was
25 years ago , but i would be curious to see the data.

well , there 's the list. go for it ! i 'll cull some more names as i go.
i expect you 're right , btw.

hi there ,

i'm german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now.
there are many problems occuring for me. one of them is the era statistic for
pitchers. what does it say \? \?

era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game. thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned
run , his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs , thus his era
is 3.00. to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.

era (er ip) 9

an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error. more specifically , if an error occurs that represented
the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs.
earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game. here are some examples

if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base. if
an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after
this error and not counted as earned runs.

if a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks) , and leaves the game
before the inning is completed , he is responsible for the people who
were left on base. if the those runners who were left on base score ,
and the score was not a result of an error , those eraned runs are
attributed to the pitcher who left the game.

i hope this explains things for you.

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them , than because they have a great eye

this comes up periodically , and i just do n't get it. take , for example , mark
mcgwire. he walked 90 times in 1993. if that 's not a potential great example
of what you 're talking about then i do n't know what is. now let 's look at
what happens when mcgwire does n't walk
75 of the time he made an out.
10 of the time he hit a single.
5 of the time he hit a double.
10 of the time he hit a homer.
now , you 're pitching against mcgwire. would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers ,
1 double , 2 singles , and 15 outs \? i would. why give him the base when you
can get him out 3 times out of 4 \?
then there are guys like alex cole , who has a career .363 obp even
though he 's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in
227 ab in 1990) or hit a single home run. yep , that 's right , he 's
never hit a homer in 916 ab 's through the end of 1992. who 'd be

for an extra 15 minutes game (average) in the al , and an extra 11 minutes
(average) in the nl , i'm seeing fewer runs score.

now , what i think i am seeing is more pitches. more strikeouts (over
1 game in the al , over .6 game more in the nl) , more walks (.2 game more in

yep. and the ks do n't have to denote a slow game , either. last night ,
sid fernandez was mowing the giants hitters down (14 ks in 8 innings) ,
yet the first 7 1 2 innings of the game were quite brisk.

he also threw 119 pitches , leading me to believe it is n't just the

as it happens , i have a husband but no kids , and my husband usually
attends games with me.

extra innings could put me
well past midnight. even without extra innings , if the score is beyond
2 1 i ca n't see my family that night at all. if the next day is a workday ,
i may have to bag that as well.

i can see it 's a problem if you do n't bring your wife to the ballgame ,
but that 's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1 2 hours. as far
as bagging work the next day , i do n't really understand why that 's
necessary , unless going to a game also means that you consume vast
quantities of beer (i note that this is the case for many guys).
if you do n't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening
out , then do n't have long evenings out during the week.

all that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game. if
you say you do n't care about whether the game is sped up , impo you are
saying you do n't care where the time goes , and that the game is for people
who do n't have families and do n't have to get up for work the next day.

look if i pay between 8.00 and 20.00 apiece for tickets , plus 10.00
for parking , plus spending my time and energy driving to and from boston ,
plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark , then
i see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money.
i ca n't afford to go to a lot of games. hence , going to a game is a
big deal , like going to a play or an opera. maybe you have more money than
i do and can go to games all year long , so it 's not such a big deal for you.
but i'm not interested in having games sped up , any more than i want to
have die walkure cut down to a convenient weeknight version of two
hours. if i felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere
with my family life or my work life , then i 'd choose to go to a weekend game.

i do n't pretend to understand
statistical analysis.

well , we agree on the last part. )

cool. and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly
name calling of others. )


one of the basic things you need to
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player 's performance on it
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. a
player 's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year.

ok.

the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero.
adding to the sample size does n't seem to help much.

actually , i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem.
it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve. (the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting
vs. non clutch the y axis being the number of players.) certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell. my
supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently
(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other , then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players
(as opposed to all baseball players).

as a counterexample to
what you showed , consider the following two players from 1984 1987

non clutch clutch
ab h ba ab h ba

maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78 .307
lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223

if you had had these two players in 1988 , by your logic , in those clutch
situations , you 'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye. well , in
1988 , maldonado hit .267 in non clutch and .190 in clutch , while lemon
hit .254 in non clutch and .313 in clutch . before you accuse me of
completely cooking the data ,

you wo n't hear those kind of accusations from me. it is interesting
that you selected maldonado , because he is someone whom i have also
looked at. he has been a very inconsistent hitter (in terms of ba) ,
hitting in 1989 92 .217 , .273 , .250 , .272 admittedly , he has
been traded between leagues as well as clubs. his clutch hitting
record is equally inconsistent. so , for my purposes in 1993 i would
not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based
on his prior performance. i do n't know how i would have felt in 1988 ,
but you may indeed be right.

when i looked at sabo i found a more consistent record of hitting , and
a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately
below his non clutch ba. ditto for joe carter.

this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having
with others on this topic. must any conclusion based on statistical
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before
it has any validity \? is it impossible (or irrational) to apply
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base \?


btw , correlating players' overall batting average from '84 '87 with
'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59 , which is significant at
something better than the 99.9 confidence level. correlating their
(clutch non clutch ba) for the same period gives a correlation of
0.088 , significant at no level of any interest.

i completely accept that reasoning. again , what if we were to find
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent
basis \?

actually , it 's technically incorrect to say that we ca n't predict future
clutch performance. it 's more correct to say that we ca n't predict
future clutch performance with any skill.

amen.

of course , this is not the same as claiming (as some do) that galarraga 's

alright , that 's enough. i 've suffered with all kinds of insults (as
typical for the net) , but give me a break. galarraga is currently
batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he is n't drawing
enough walks. what would he have to do to please you guys , bat 1.000 \?
you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team .

if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen) ,
then i would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches. my comment
that he is n't paid to walk does n't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it 's more along the lines of he 's
batting .400 and leading the league in rbi 's so what bloody difference
does it make if he is n't drawing a lot of walks \? sheesh.

based only on this data , i do n't see any reason to
pinch hit for sabo , or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch hit.
does the pinch hitter give you a platoon advantage \? (any portion of
sabo 's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability , even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.) do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run \? do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves \?


hey ! what 's this \? we agree !

no platoon advantage (sabo vs. samuel).

both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters ,
and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with
slow curves and change ups.

sabo has more power , and a little bit of a better batting eye. samuel
is noted as an agressive free swinger. sabo has more homerun power.

both players started the game hitting below .200.

there may have been some game considerations that might have prompted
perez to want to reserve samuel for use later. but the game
was on the line , and samuel never did get in.

given all of this , i do n't see a lot to suggest pinch hitting , nor do
i see anything to suggest no pinch hitting. there is , of course , the
clutch hitting information. but if that 's useless...

then again. if it 's not...

we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris' contribu
tion from the rest of the team 's. there is only one way of determin
ing best in baseball. and that is by looking at the scoreboard at
the end of the game. each game determines which team is the best
that day. at the end of the season , the team that was the best the
most often is the best in the division. the playoffs determine the
best of the best. but the point is that the only decision making pro
cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams . not the individual players. there is no method
inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. and that
is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game.

and you know what \? there is no such method inherent in real life
either. so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we
cannot state , with any level of objectivity , that mother theresa
has accomplished more good in this world than joseph stalin.
after all , life on earth is a team effort.

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has
done better with those statistics as a criteria , then fine. but you
have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the
individual 's contribution to winning the ws because that is the
only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base
ball. so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham
pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub
jective and is mere opinion. i have yet to see that any of you can
predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon.

have you tried glasses \? i find them quite useful.

after all , there must be some reason you choose to ignore the mounds
of evidence we present. it 's too bad you feel it necessary to close
your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result
of that choice.

heck , i 'd wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater
accuracy than jeanne dixon. and you know why \? because i have
full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary ,
you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up
with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level.

you do n't have to be rude.

have you tried calling a kettle black \?

for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of my argument , or you yourself have committed a fallacy ignoratio
elenchi. i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because
he has more rings (although i have , tongue in cheek , claimed
that in the past). i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an
individual 's performance from that of his team 's for the purpose of
comparing that individual 's performance with another individual 's per
formance.

in other words , in your world , you cannot objectively state that
jack morris was more important to the blue jays than al leiter last
year.

in your world , that may indeed be true. fortunately , in the world
the rest of us occupy , it 's not.

i hope you never serve on a jury , roger. i think the rest of the
jury would have to kill you. there 's no way i can objectively
judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty. you see , there are
2 billion other people on this planet. we have no way of knowing
whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it was n't
for all the other people on the planet. we have no way of knowing
how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet ,
because living on this planet is a team effort. and no individual
committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of
that society. that being case , anything i have to say on his
culpability would be absolute subjectivity , so i refuse to vote.

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them , than because they have a great eye

this comes up periodically , and i just do n't get it. take , for example , mark
mcgwire. he walked 90 times in 1993. if that 's not a potential great example
of what you 're talking about then i do n't know what is. now let 's look at
what happens when mcgwire does n't walk
75 of the time he made an out.
10 of the time he hit a single.
5 of the time he hit a double.
10 of the time he hit a homer.
now , you 're pitching against mcgwire. would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers ,
1 double , 2 singles , and 15 outs \? i would. why give him the base when you
can get him out 3 times out of 4 \?

i did n't say that pitcher 's fear of throwing strikes to guys like
mcgwire , bonds , and frank thomas was rational.
i just said that it exists.

then there are guys like alex cole , who has a career .363 obp even
though he 's never had a batting average over .300 (he did hit .300 in
227 ab in 1990) or hit a single home run. yep , that 's right , he 's
never hit a homer in 916 ab 's through the end of 1992. who 'd be
afraid to throw a strike to him \?

i do n't know alex cole 's batting style at all. some questions
how tall is he \?
does he go into a crouch like rickey hederson pete rose \?
does he foul off a lot of pitches like brett butler \?
does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat \?

it could be the cole has a good batting eye .
look above , i said that many high obp guys draw their walks because
pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them , not all high obp guys.

does this seem dumb to anyone else \?
(the fact not the comment.)

why should a batter 's obp be hurt by a sac fly \? especially if sac
bunts do n't have the same effect , since they do the same thing ,
but sac flies usually score a run while bunts just advance a base.

but both of these situations involve the batter giving up an ab for
the benefit of the team (sacrifice) \? so why should it hurt their
stats \?

the sac bunt is a purposeful act , ordered by the manager.
the batter does not go up trying to get a sac fly , and the
evidence available indicates that there is no such ability
players ca n't will themselves to hit sac flies , they fly out
to the same place just as often when there 's nobody on third.

greg



sorry , i gotta disagree here. last time i played ball , i went up on
several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the
runner from third or advance a runner to third. it 's relatively easy
actually... you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to
hit a good line drive. with fastballs it 's very easy , much more
difficult with good breaking balls. a good hitter with excellent bat
control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least , oh , 60
of the time \?

you have n't been facing major league pitching.

maybe more... you have to be good at the plate , and most
of those guys are just as likely to opt for getting the base hit and
helping their average as getting the sacrifice. the best example i know
of is jerry willard in the 91 series against minnesota. all he had to
do was put one in the of and the game was over. he swung waaaaaay past
parallel and accomplished (barely) getting the run in safely.

stats did a little study in the 1993 scoreboard book entitled can
you hit sacrifice flies on purpose \? a summary of the findings

over the 5 year period , sac fly type fly balls were produced 17.6
percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful , and
17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly was n't useful.

they looked at the leaders in sac flies , and found that the leaders
in sac flies in other words , the guys you would expect to be good
at it it hit sac fly type fly balls only 3 more often when they
needed to a difference way too small to be the result of a skill.
essentially , the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do
so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often , with and without
a runner on third.

stats concludes so it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit
sacrifice flies on purpose even if they practice in the batting
cage.

the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a
large enough portion of the population , and have suggested various
remedies , such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that
smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation is an accurate description
of what is , essentially , a laid back game.

forget those lame ideas. here is my new and exciting two point plan to
generate interest in baseball among the masses.

point one sex.
point two violence.

let 's face it , sex and violence are the only things that sell in
america. here 's how we can implement them in the game

sex cheerleaders , cheerleaders , and more cheerleaders. dancing on top
of the dugouts. bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh
inning stretch. running up and down the stands. (the south bend
white sox actually do this).

violence baseball players are such utter wuss boys. the pitcher beans
the batter , and both benches empty in what is called a bench clearing
brawl . everybody just stands there and looks at each other. stand ,
stand , stand. look , look , look. ho , hum. then , the bullpens
come running in. when they reach the fight , they just stand
there , too.

anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
should be suspended and fined. further , the bullpens should fight
it out in the outfield , so as not to waste time and energy running
to the infield.



i think what bob is describing here is a game which mad magazine
called 'basebrawl'. i have no idea what issue , but it sure did cover
the violence issue.

later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the helll
is he thinking.

if memory serves me well , alicea hit it , and damn near tied the game.
torre obviously knows his players better than you do.

not to mention that lankford had been hurt two nights before running
into the outfield wall. this being the reason he was available to pinch
anything. his ribs were the problem so he could run but not hit.
torre is no white rat but give him credit for what he is , a pretty darn
good manager. with the exception of the felix fiasco , but i'm not sure
who 's brainchild that was.

great that dawson has trouble hitting the ball to the right side of the

precede him \?

yes , that 's him. was i not specific enough \?

just because someone consistently pulls the ball does not mean that
they have a quick bat. dawson 's release is slow , and he is 38 , after
all. he may swing early , and rotate his hips so that he hits the ball to
the left side all the time , but he swings slowly.

as for me disagreeing with peter gammons... whoa ! that 's never happened
before ! next thing you know , i 'll probably believe dave campbell is the

1) since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls.
so have pitchers and catchers.

however , batters did n't use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree
they do now.

i really think that this is the key point. when i saw the incident on
baseball tonight sunday , i could n't believe how far away from the plate
gant went. then he casually leaned against his bat. i do n't blame the
umpire at all for telling the pitcher to pitch.

the worst part of the whole incident was the braves coming out onto the
field. what were they going to do , attack the umpire \? the only people
who should 've been out there were cox and maybe the coaches , but no players.
i agree with the person who posted before that cox should be suspended for
having no control over his team.

you want to speed up ballgames \?

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current

rule is too lenient) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more

please pardon my ignorance if this is well known , but what is the current
rule \?

than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball ,
and restart the clock.

i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work. i do n't remember
why they said that it did not work. anyone remember this \?

jody mcdonnel on wip in phil. has been saying that a pitch clock was
inevitable. how would a pitch clock work on throws to first \?

maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make ,
and award a balk if he exceeds it. i 'd have another question who would
operate the pitch clock \? one of the umpires \? add another one to the crew \?

another pair of suggestions
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe
no matter what the pitcher does.

i'm not sure i like this idea. i think it would severely diminish the
number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic
ploys as the hit and run and the squeeze play (one of my personal favorites).

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time (x 3 to 5)
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base
as if walked.

ahhh ! i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the 'f' key ,
eh \? obviously , from what i wrote above , i like this idea.

the no balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage. the base walk allows
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base.

it may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag , since the
pitcher knows he does n't have very many chances to pick off the runner ,
so he may hurry too much. i 'd rather see runs scored as the result of
sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness
that could result from this kind of rule. so , i suppose there are some
disadvantages to that idea too.

baseball games take about 2 51 in the nl , and just a shade under 3 hours
in the al. that 's just too damn long. i do n't like to play in 3 hour
games , much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep , and
if i'm watching on tv , i 'll channel surf between pitches , catching
colorized versions of mr. ed , leave it to beaver , and those wacky
nieporents on nick at nite.

i too , find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between
each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his jewlery .

i remember in little league , if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter 's
box , even for a moment , we were automatically out. that may be a little
harsh for the majors , but seriously , how about putting a limit on the
batters being able to step out , take several dozen practice swings , pound
their shoes , scratch their balls , etc. \? maybe forcing them to stay in the
batter 's box would n't be such a bad idea. that could save a few minutes.

i do n't think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing
to pay the price. i'm sure someone out there in net land has some
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity
sold. but even if the trends are relatively flat , you have to consider
what is happening on a team by team basis.

attendance in 1992 was down. by .3 . from an all time record in 1991.
in people terms , attendance was down by 310 , 000 from 1991 to 1992. two
franchises , the dodgers and mets , were down by 1 , 100 , 000 from 1991 to 1992.

many right fielders including darryl strawberry and andre dawson can

surpass this for a career slugging average. so unless there are some
real stats
that make winfield worthy of the team he wo n't even be allowed to be

p.s. eddie gaedel is the water boy and his career on base percentage is
tons
better than winfield 's.

so is winny 's i would like to see your facts. winny has probably done
better than 129 points above with a carrer slg of 480. check on more

of course you can. you just have to be careful about what conclusions
you draw.

if you will notice the best
pitchers (stat wise were in the 20 's and 30 's) and the best all around hitters
probably came from the 40 's to 60 's.

huh \? the 20 's and 30 's were the worst decades for great pitching. grove ,
vance , dean , and not a whole lot else.

as for the best all around hitters , stat wise , ruth , gehrig , foxx , greenberg ,
hornsby , cobb , etc. all played before the 40 's. stat wise , the 60 's were
a graveyard for hitters.

now we have a great number of great
pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders. (also ,

how do you know \? which ones do you consider great \?

about fielding , the gloves were much smaller than they are now in the early
years of baseball) maybe a hitter like sheffield with the .330 ba , 30hr , and
100 rbi(even though it was probably a fluke year) can be compared to a mantle
because the pitching sheffield faces is faster and not to mention better. the

so \? sheffield also has better shoes. more time between pitches. you can
run the comparison , but there are lots of things to take into account.

same could be said for frank thomas who is said to be the best hitter since ted
williams , although frank 's defense does suck.

well , can we compare them or ca n't we \?

all i am saying is that you ca n't compare players from different era 's ,
if you want a best player try choosing best players from different era 's. that

why \? we can compare players to the standard of their era and we can
keep in mind era to era differences without throwing up our hands in
despair.

way there is reasonable basis for comparison.

you have n't shown us what 's un reasonable about the mantle sheffield
comparison that you yourself did.

you want to speed up ballgames \?

1. enforce the two minutes between innings. as it is , many fields are
allowing three minutes between them. fifteen seconds before
tv commercials are gone to , thirty or so before action begins upon
the return to the game. two minutes , last out to first pitch , or
a ball is called.

2. do n't grant time to batters just because they want it. they may get
pissed at first , but they 'll get in line , once anything the pitcher
throws while they 're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current
rule is too lenient) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more
than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball ,
and restart the clock.


i 've only ever seen this called once. back around 1979 1980. i think
that steve carlton was pitching. on the other hand , i am not sure how
much effect this would have. it seems that most of the time lost is
when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this.


i have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the
game. let 's be serious. the relief pitcher has normally been
throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes. does he really need 8
more pitches \?

sorry , i gotta disagree here. last time i played ball , i went up on
several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the
runner from third or advance a runner to third. it 's relatively easy
actually... you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to
hit a good line drive. with fastballs it 's very easy , much more
difficult with good breaking balls. a good hitter with excellent bat
control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least , oh , 60
of the time \? maybe more..

there 's a blurb in the stats scoreboard about this , and though i do n't have
the book with me here , my memory is that the best at hitting sac flies were
far below this 60 number.

tim belcher pitched a dandy three hit shut out tonight as cincinnati won
their second straight 5 0. pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin was hit early and
often by the heavily right unbalanced reds line up , which managed some
recently rare power with their bats.

belcher (1 1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the
game progressed. early on he had several three ball counts , but even those
were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base on balls while
striking out nine. in a post game interview he said his change up was working
for him i should say so all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on
breaking balls.

tomlin (0 1) , on the other hand was in trouble early , giving up a second pitch
double to lead off batter bip roberts. bobby kelly followed with a single and
barry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right. the big guys
(mitchell , sabo , milligan) were unable to get anything after that in fact
they all struck out but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double steal
and a tomlin wild pitch.

in fact , it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky
start he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only
2 0. randy milligan , though , had different ideas as his line shot was
poorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple. milligan would
later score on reggie sanders' sacrifice fly , giving cinci the 3 0 lead
after 4.

the fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when roberts led off with his second
double of the game , and one batter later larkin smacked a double down the
left field line , chasing tomlin. barry later would score the final run on
tom prince 's two base passed ball.

the pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the
fifth when merced and kevin young hit back to back singles (the second
being of the bunt variety) , but carlos garcia struck out , prince fit a
foul fly , and pinch hitter lonnie smith k 'd to end any pittsburgh hope.

pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well , though relievers blas minor ,
moeller (sp \? ) , and nagel gave up only two hits in their four plus innings
work.

barry larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played
bruised his right thumb. he was taken to the hospital for precautionary
x rays . let 's hope he 's ok.

cincinnati is now 4 9 , still the worst record in the majors , but with the
two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar !
pittsburgh is now 7 6.

the subject line says it all. what is the rule that qualifies
a pitcher as making a save \?

imho this is the most untrustworthy , silly stat , by today 's rules , in all
of baseball. my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least
appear in the on deck circle. also , the lead a pitcher enters with cannot
excede three runs.

i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in
determining winners savers etc. for instance , a pitcher can come in in the
ninth with a lead , blow the lead , fall behind , have his team come back in
the next half inning and earn the win. has this pitcher earned a win , no
way.

i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his
teammates rally to tie the score. assume he came in to start the fourth
and left after the eighth. his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. the
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat
satisfaction.

his .300 season last year was good , but i'm not convinced that he can do

30 or so homers and had 127 rbi. it never even came close to happening
again. of course , maybe i just prefer guys who go about their business

tim wallach can be explained with the rabbitball. deion can be explained
as learning how to play the game . i'm not betting that deion will be able
to play as well as last year , but i think the odds of deion playing as well
or better than he did last year are better than the odds of otis nixon
doing the same thing. when you factor in defense , otis was more valuable last
year. but i'm not convinced he 'll be more valuable this year , and especially
next year.

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to
walk williams to get to bonds.

i have to wonder if this good hitter behind you argument is really valid.
has anyone done a study on this.

you want a study \? look at matt williams the year after
mitchell was gone. look no further. not a scientific
study , but it 'll show the truth for matt. besides , bonds
wants to bat 5th

i had thought that williams batted after mitchell. would n't that show that
williams does better at 5th rather than 4th \?

the point is moot , though , becase clark pretty much demands to be 3rd
and , like you point out , bonds does like to bat 5th. the only person
left to bat 4th is williams.

sigh. here we go again.

you started it...

for predicting the future , it has been entirely meaningless. at least
if it has meaning , we do n't know how to find it.

i did not say i could predict the future.

you most certainly did !

non clutch clutch
ab h ba ab h ba
sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228
samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299

sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel. yet you would pinch hit
samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and
sabo will be a choke hitter. right \? i 'd call that predicting the
future .

if you were to have been the reds manager at that time , i assume you
would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting samuel. i'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance. you just would n't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance. is this not correct \?

right. i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past. overall performance , l r splits ,
even matching hitting pitching styles. all of these will give me some
advantage if used properly.

even if all else were equal , there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance. and in this case , everything else
pointed to sabo.

one more time. i did not claim to be able to predict the future.
i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo.

that comes down to the same thing. when perez left sabo in , he
was predicting the future , the next ab. he was predicting that
sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel.

by supporting the swap , you are predicting the opposite.

and i am not dismissing your work. i'm stating my opinion.
you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work.

well , yes. you are aware of its existance. you claim to be incapable
of understanding it (though i suspect you are simply unwilling). yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite. you do n't seem to think the
work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).
i 'd say this is insulting.

i did not say that it is a consistent skill.

i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
certain set of circumstances.

right ! this is the beef. it has not proven to be an indicator of
future performance under any circumstances. at least none that
we 've been able to come up with. if you know of some where it is an
indicator of future performance , please let us in on your secret.

it is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility
that you actually could have some preconceived biases.

most certainly. as i have repeatedly stated , if you can come up with
a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability , i would
love it ! however the straightforward attempts at such a study have
all failed miserably.

yeah. hindsight is always 20 20. does n't that make you bright \? this
is a stupid argument and you know it.

ah. i knew we could get to the name calling. and there 's that word
you like so much.

well , it was a stupid argument. (are you honestly debating that \? \? \? )
sure , we know sabo did n't get a hit. we have no idea whether samuel
would have done any better or not. one ab most certainly does n't
prove anything !

i believe that by
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll
just have to wait and see.

is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year \? or is this
a prediction for all batters who have , over the past few years , hit
(xxx amount \? ) worse in the clutch than overall \?

if you mean the first , then as you say , we 'll just have to wait and
see. but the second is a much stronger statement. in fact , it
suggests a rule. we can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years. i think you will agree that if the rule
did n't work last year or the year before , that it is unlikely to do
any better this year. right \?

here 's another one for you. in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in non clutch situations each year. i presume you think
this is random.

i'm not going to get into case analysis. sure , you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. you

'92.

no , this does n't prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of
major league ballplayers. it just makes me think that in 1993
joe carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in non clutch situations.

gambler 's fallacy. unless there is reason to expect consistency , a
run proves nothing. can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to
correlate from one year to the next \? i 've seen a detailed study of
why i should n't expect it to correlate.

stupid . total idiot .

the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid. (and
i do n't see how you can deny it.) as for total idiot \? yes. if you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong , i would say the term fits nicely.

and for some barely explicable reason the camera kept dwelling on the

do you remember game 7 of the 1988 nlcs , after the dodgers defeated
the mets , and ugh a dugh foo boo fat stomach tom lasorda came running out
on to the field in celebration \? yuck ! ! ! ! ! !
he undulated. his arms flew up and down , keeping time with his
rolling set of 9 stomachs , which flew all around the cozy confines of
chavez ravine. he oozed , like a white gastropod. he ran. it was a
disgusting sight. not only could n't i watch my mets in the series , i had
to watch fat stomach lasorda roll around dodger....
blargh !

but what made it memorable was what karen eventually said about this ,
which was

i would rather sleep with a jar of bill landrum 's spit under my pillow
than look at whitey herzog in one of those uniforms.

if you like short , fat men , who grunt , curse , and spit a lot ,

but it 's true , this emphasis on the appearance of ballplayers in
tight uniforms only works if the player actually has an extraodinary
physique. looking at charlie hough 's scrawny torso through those tight
white shirts just sort of makes me decide , hmmm , i do n't want to eat lunch
today...or tomorrow...or anytime soon... .
when al harazin first became mets' gm , he was asked if he intended
to help redesign the mets' uniforms and change their image. in particular ,
they asked him about the orange and blue racing stripe that runs down the
sides the uniforms. he said that he 's very much in favor of keeping them
because they 're sleek and they 're sexy .
sid fernandez , in a tight fitting uniform , with a sleek racing
stripe to denote speed and potencty. mmmmmmmm...lard.
kevin mcreynolds , diving after a fly ball. mmmmmmmm...man o' war , baby !
pat howell....well , never mind. nothing could be tight on him.

should , but if he thinks it will , it might be a self fulfilling
prophecy.

i do n't understand. if it is williams' lack of ability (which you say
above , and i agree with) which causes him to swing at bad pitches , how
will thinking that bonds hitting behind him will help him to stop
chasing bad pitches.

i did n't mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that
specific deficiency. i meant that if having bonds bat behind him
gives williams (possibly unfounded) confidence , that might translate
into more hitting productivity. but you 're right if williams'
biggest problem is more physical than mental , that 's less likely
to make a difference.

in article 93109.145942io20456@maine.maine.edu ryan robbins io20456@maine.maine.edu writes

rule 7.09(k) states it is interference by a batter or runner when
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base
... he runs outside the three foot line , or inside (to the left of)
the foul line and , in the umpire 's judgment , interferes with the field
er taking the throw at first base...

the key word in the rule is and. a runner is n't out just for running
out of the baseline. he 's out for interfering with the fielding of the
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first. because the catcher
opted to throw the ball over the batter runner 's head , there 's no inter
ference.

sorry , i still do n't buy it. you 're certainly right that the runner is
not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with
the play. but the argument here is over what constitutes interference.
you certainly cannot infer from what you 've quoted that the batter runner
must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you have n't posted
a definition of interference at all.

imo this calls for one of the approved ruling s that go in small print
in the rulebook. something like

approved ruling
if in the judgement of the umpire the runner , by running to the left
of the allowed path , caused the fielder to make a bad throw , blocks the
vision of the fielder receiving the throw , or otherwise impedes the
defensive team 's making a play on him , the batter runner shall be
judeged guilty of interference.

or

approved ruling
the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes
contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball.


in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor
rules trivia question since it cannot be authoritatively answered.

summary let 's talks stats and not stats

note i'm not posting this as part of an argument with roger meynard ,
but as an independent sort of thread. i do actually quote some things
that roger meynard wrote , but it might be better to think of this as
sampling his post (in the hip hop sense) because it fits in with what
i want to say.

maynard@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca (roger maynard) writes
but the point is that the only decision making pro
cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams . not the individual players. there is no method
inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. and that
is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game.

there 's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball
team and some people 's conception of a biological organism. in the
biology context , we would very likely read fitness for the score of
the game and organisms for teams . how we interpret players is
trickier , but either organs , or genes might seem reasonable
choices depending on what point we were trying to make. a genes
interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case ,
but that would be a different and probably longer post.

if , however , we take the organ view , then our knowledge of biology
should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is
more fit than species y because of a better organ z . given what we
know about the interdependence of organs , we would often be suspicious
of such claims. (but note that this type of argument is quite often
made when you map species x onto 'humans' , and organ z onto
'brain'). on the other hand , some statements of this kind do seem
more reasonable than others , as far as we can test them (e.g. 'brain'
above might be more reasonable than 'pancreas' assuming no gross
pathology , particularly if species y is a primate).

even when you make such statements , you should be concerned with the
functioning of the whole organism , and the possibility that one organ
might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.
(not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial
in some third species.) however , if we are non vitalists with any
kind of reductionsit streak , we will want to say that an organism is
not some completely magical unanalyzable whole but an intriguing
process made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are
potentially observable. some of these processes might be localized to
particular organs , while others may be distributed across multiple
organs. in a way , this is just like a baseball team , except that i
think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved
in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.

to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely that player a 's team would have played better with player b
in their lineup. sheer speculation. impossible to ascertain.

one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly
controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do. but , of
course , this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they
can , and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the
absence of certainty. most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation ,
but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens
has done better than another pitcher with those statistics as a
criteria , then fine.

in this cases , we 're seeing the word statistics means summary of
observed events , where the events themselves can be viewed as the
output of some process , and possibly inputs for other processes.
thus , if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together
into the functioning organism , data in the form of statistics might
give us a basis to test particular hypotheses.

but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the
individual 's contribution to winning the ws because that is the only
measure of best that has any meaning in the context of baseball.

this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.
fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment
you might be fit in one situation and not another. moving to
baseball , it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an
environment including all the other teams in the league. in at least
a nominal sense , the division winners are the fittest teams in the
league , in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any
of their competing opponennts. but in a real sense , there is a fairly
large random component in the performance of each team that is
difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors
intrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball. the same is true in
biology. but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the
world series in basebal. in the world series , the random component
may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played ,
and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement
where they were originally successful. it might be fun to watch , but
it 's unclear what it all really means.



now just one more un related point

i have yet to see that any of you can predict a
ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon.

on the other hand , you have seen some of us who can predict the
outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of
teams to finishes , and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this
better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.
but this is probably only due to the fact that a 162 game schedule
gives you a little hope that bad hops are n't the only difference
between the winners and the losers.

moreover , you 've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world
series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict
the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only
to reflect the well known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.

the stats are a nice hobby and that 's about it. there is no new
knowledge being produced.

since stats are summaries of events , it 's true that if you know the
events you can derive the stats. but if somebody is trying to
understand the process behind the stats , then the stats produce new
knowledge , and some of this might even be reliable , repeatable , and
useful. speaking of which , i should get back to producing knowledge
in a different field. that is , of course , if i can produce knowledge
even though i'm relying on stats to do it.

that he'd been thrown out. and gant had a legitimate beef about
the 1 0 pitch that was called a strike. a reasonable umpire would
not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation.

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more
umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter wo n't get back in the box.

while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around ,
gant was n't ordered back in the box sooner , he was ordered back immediately.
as soon as he stepped out , hirschbeck told him to get back in the box.
now , gant does n't take a lot of walks between pitches. the only reason
he did then because he was very bothered by the call. i expect his
concentration was n't there yet , and in a crucial situation i imagine it 's
best to be as calm as possible. contributing factors would be gant 's
bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the braves long scoring
drought.

now , it 's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is
telling you to get in there. you know the umpire is going to do something
(call for a strike , throw you out , etc.). gant was wrong.

but hirschbeck was more wrong , in my biased view. aside from the major chip
he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem. gant had a reason
to want some time (disputed strike call). gant had n't been wasting time all
game. the game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old.
the score was 1 0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position.
is there any reason hirschbeck could n't , and should n't , cut gant a little
slack \? for no discernible constructive reason , hirschbeck disrupted the
game , caused a five minute delay , and materially hurt the batter in a key
situation. did he have a date to get to \?

and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game.

1) since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls.
so have pitchers and catchers.

however , batters did n't use to go for strolls after bad calls to the degree
they do now.

unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing
complaints , hirschbeck was acting against expectations.

everyone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games. the rule that
hirschbeck invoked has been in the books a long time.

2) it 's not as if gant was in hirschbeck 's face .

nobody , including hirschbeck , ever said he was.


when gant turned away , hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant
to step into the box. imo , at this point in time , hirschbeck
was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game.
gant was n't dawdling he had n't had a chance to dawdle. and hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play.

that 's your (perhaps colored by your partisanship of the braves)
perception. hirschbeck 's view was that gant was heading off for a long
walk , and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up ,
directed him into the batter 's box.

gant resisted , as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and
hirschbeck called for the pitch.

the point is , based on the rulebook and the umpires' instructions , it was
not an unreasonable request.

the braves were already upset

imo , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was
a bad game for the umpire.

had gant done as instructed , you would n't have remembered the name of the
umpire.

as the heading indicates , it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not
batting 4th for the giants behind will clark. barry is such an awesome and
consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho , to
have williams , a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting
4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , ( ! ! ! ! )
i agree that hirschbeck was just doing what he was instructed to do
and also that gant should have listened to him. however , what is with this
policy of trying to speed up the games. you are the first person
( non mediot ) i have seen endorse this policy. i have no problem with the
length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd ( and other announcers )
bitching about it. i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking
at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a
ticket , i do n't mind a game that last more than 2 10. i really do n't
understand it.
games are longer now for several reasons ... stuff deleted
maybe i am just a ne'er do well with nothing better to do , but i
would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you.

well , i do n't want shorter games per se , but i would like for them to stop
wasting so much time during games. the gant incident is a perfect example.
when a guy comes to the plate , he should be up there to hit , not show off
(or show up the umpire , which is clearly what gant was doing). i feel like
writing a fan letter to hirschbeck.

there is a great book out called they also served which is about the

info on pete gray (one armed outfielder) and other players of the era. because
of the draft many players during the war were those who were exempt from the

rangers. here are the highlights


r h e
texas 1 4 1
detroit 3 5 0

wells gets the win , he 's now 3 0 with an era just under 1 , and henneman gets
his third save in three chances. ken rogers started for the rangers and
gets the loss. he was relieved by burns in the 7th.

the rangers got their only run on a solo home run by dean palmer in the 7th.
the tigers opened the scoring with an rbi single by fryman in the 3rd , then
took the lead for good in the bottom of the seventh when whitaker greeted
reliever burns with an rbi double which scored tettleton. whitaker in turn
crossed the plate on an rbi single by phillips (who has been red hot) for
the third tiger run.

this afternoon , it 's another battle of southpaws , bill krueger for the tigers
vs. craig lefferts for the rangers.

in reply to ez027993@chip.ucdavis.edu 's message of tue , 20 apr 1993 15 51 37 gmt

the real way to speed up ballgames is for each home park owner to offer the
following schedule of bonuses to players on both teams

for all players who participated in the game , offer 500 for each 10
minutes less than 3 hours the game took (i.e. if the game only took 2.5
hours , each player gets a bonus of 1500).

for all pitchers throwing 3 or more full innings in the game , extrapolate
the number of pitches or attempted pickoffs to the number they would have
thrown in a full 9 innings , and offer 500 for each number less than 120.
(if the pitcher throws a complete game with 100 pitches and 5 throws to
first he would get 7500).

i suspect you could finance this the same way presidential campaigns are
paid for. offer each fan a checkoff on his or her ticket that says i want
5 of the price of this ticket to go towards fast game bonuses ...

to all the braves doubters

do n't worry. the bats will come alive , and the braves will come around.
the pitching is solid , and as long the braves do n't have serious injuries
to the starting rotation , they 'll continue to pitch well. heck , with
the five starters on the braves rotation , they could even sustain an
injury to one of the five (i hope this does n't happen , though).

the bats are there... pendleton will certainly bat over .280 , justice
is catching fire , bream , nixon , sanders , gant... well , there 's too
much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer. right now , the
cleveland indians have 7 players batting over .300 ! but i certainly
would n't their seven for our respective seven (though would n't the
braves be something right now with their pitching and 7 players batting
over .300 \? ).

the bullpen... well , it is suspect. but when the bats come alive , the
guys in the bullpen will be of less concern.

so anyway , i believe the braves will be tough to beat this season. i'm
not saying the braves have automatically won the division , but i'm optim
istic about their season (though it 's awful painful to watch them at
times right now).

go braves ! ! !

i 'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted.

for most career k 's with one team , if it 's not ryan , perhaps steve carlton.

no way gotta be walter johnson. all were with washington.
carlton spent too long in st. louis to collect less than 700 there.

with the rangers , hough was there for a long time.

i 'd also guess hough due to his length of tenure though i suspect
bobby witt was n't far behind. maybe even jenkins snuck in close....

in the 100 saves department...maybe lee smith(he should have at least
a hundred with the cubbies , maybe enough with either the rsox or cards.)
then maybe , gossage \? (nyy and sd) , fingers (mil , oak)

fingers had to have achieved 100 with either mil or with sd so , yes ,
i 'd go with that guess. otherwise i was thinking that reardon has a better
chance of having 100 with min along with (i would think) easily reaching 100
with mon.

do n't know about the homers steals dept.

gotta be willie mays...i am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his
career.

in some other article , (mets trivia) , it could be tim leary in at least
the losing to all teams , maybe beating all of 'em too. probably seaver
and koosman fit too.

hmmm...leary is a really good point. i 'd forgotten about him. well ,
if nothing else , there are plenty of ex met pitchers in the category of
could have lost to all teams koosman , leary , torrez , ryan , seaver....
i guess the best three guesses would be leary , ryan , and either seaver or
koosman.

actually , i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem.
it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball
in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of
bell curve. (the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting
vs. non clutch the y axis being the number of players.) certainly
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell. my
supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently
(year after year) at one end of the bell or the other , then we might
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players
(as opposed to all baseball players).

let 's be careful here. if players' performance was completely random
in (clutch no clutch) , then you would still expect some players to be
good in the clutch every year and some to be not so good every year.
with two years worth of data , you 'd have 1 4 of the players good each
year , 1 4 bad each year , and 1 2 would have one good and one bad year.
we have 96 players for 5 years ('84 '88). just flipping a coin , you 'd
expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year.
this is what we actually get

no. of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5
clutch performers 4 10 37 24 18 3
coin flip (random) 3 15 30 30 15 3

essentially the distribution of clutch performers by number of years
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process
leading to deviations from non clutch performance was completely random.
if there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition)
that had any predictive capability , you expect to see the number of
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping
a coin. further , if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above
or below average in clutch situations (say , 1 standard deviation from
the mean) more than one year , the random explanation still looks good.
in the four years ('84 '87) that i looked at the data from elias , there
were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years. of
those 79 (29) players , 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two
years. in other words , they were great clutch hitters one year and
really horrible the other year. if it was just a random process ,
you 'd expect those numbers to be 39.5 (14.5).

everything that 's been measured about clutch hitting over a period
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any
proposed definition has looked like a random process (with the
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage
that could be dragged out of the data e.g. , john lowenstein
probably never had a clutch ab against a left handed pitcher ,
but he might well have had some in blowouts , so that there would
be a bias since his clutch abs would be more geared to his
platoon advantage). this is not a subject that has been glanced
at casually. a lot of people have put a lot of effort into
studying it and every one of them , with the exception of the
elias study , has been unable to find anything that would allow
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better
than flipping a coin. (self serving plug follows some of the
flaws in the elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth
coming sabr book , the perfect game , by taylor publishing. the
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance , so go bug
your local bookstores now , and maybe i can get enough to take my
wife to dinner once. )

by then , it 's too late. the problem with not fixing something while it 's

mostly , though , the giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that

of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for
drawing walks). if he hit .400 for , say , even 250 ab 's i 'd be convinced that
there was a real change in his ability. if he did it with an obp avg , i 'd
not only be amazed but i 'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in
the history of the game. but what do 45 ab 's prove \? look at some of the
other fluke players at this point in the season
player avg ab
blauser .367 49
grace .391 48
milligan .400 35
conine .375 40
lansing .400 50
slaught .406 32
are any of these guys really that good \? well , in a word , no. how significant
is galarraga 's average \? at the 45 ab level , a hit is worth about .020. if
he 'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good
defensive play , he 'd be in the .380 range. if he goes 0 for 4 in his next
game he 's all the way down to .388. in one game. come back in june. let 's
talk then.

if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches
and he starts making lots of outs (as someone speculated might happen) ,
then i would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches. my comment
that he is n't paid to walk does n't mean that he should have a license
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it 's more along the lines of he 's
batting .400 and leading the league in rbi 's so what bloody difference
does it make if he is n't drawing a lot of walks \? sheesh.

it 's history , greg. andres' history is that he does n't walk much because he
swings at bad pitches , so his average is n't very good. 45 ab 's does n't mean
an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand , especially when
there 's ample evidence (0 bb in 1992) that his basic hitting approach has n't
changed. yeah , he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never
walks , but do n't bet the rent money on it.

dan

nolan ryan qualifies on both counts. i would guess that viola is the
other one who has beaten and also lost to every team in the majors.

viola has only played in the nl with the mets not possible for him
to have defeated or lost to every team. ditto for tanana who was mentioned
in a previous post.

the 3rd pitcher to lose to every team is probably tom seaver , but
it could be koosman.

i do n't remember if seaver managed to get a win against the white sox
in his brief sojourn with boston so i 'd say the other pitcher to defeat every
team is either mike torrez (he bounced around enough for a long enough period
of time) or koosman as mentioned. i would also guess that if one of these
two did not manage to beat every team he did manage to lose to every team.

consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho , to
have williams , a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting
4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the
giants.

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to
walk williams to get to bonds.


you 're definitely correct in that williams absolutely has to be sandwiched
in between clark and bonds. he must , and i mean must , get fastballs to
hit...otherwise he becomes little more than sixto lezcano in disguise.
what i would suggest is perhaps batting bonds , williams , and clark
3 4 5 , the reason being that i feel bonds' potential basestealing
abilities are wasted when he 's stuck behind two slow runners.
i think the chance of getting 20 30 extra stolen bases with bonds in the
3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having
clark in the 5 spot.

i do n't understand this at all. matt williams has demonstrated
throughout his career that he will not wait for good pitches to hit.
he wo n't take walks. he 'd rather swing. if i'm the opposing pitcher ,
why would i groove a fastball to williams and have him hit it well ,
when i know that williams will swing (and miss , or at least not hit
very well) at a low and away curve \?

matt 's problem is really more ability than attitude. it is n't that he 's
got it in his mind that he wants to swing away , but rather that he 's
(still) a total sucker for the curve ball. it looked for a while in
1990 that he was getting better but it 's still his weak point.

as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him , the
net.stat.mavens will probably tell you there 's no reason that it
should , but if he thinks it will , it might be a self fulfilling
prophecy.

as to whether the giants' lineup is optimal who knows \? batting bonds ,
the team 's best hitter , fifth does seem to be odd , but the 1 and 2
hitters are n't exactly messrs. oba , so they are n't giving much up
there. and although clark is n't the overall offensive force that bonds
is , he seems better suited to the 3 spot. assuming , of course , that
he starts hitting one of these days...

really struggling at the plate and on the basepaths.

his performance at the plate may well be from the shoulder injury
received when he ran into the wall making a catch in the cincy series.
it may also be him pressing a little.

as for the baserunning , it does not appear to be just lankford.

to encourage the great tradition of red sox negativism , i am having a
contest to predict the magnitude of the sox' fall from their current
heights. you must decide first , whether the sox will be at .500 again
at any time during this year. then you must predict either

(1) their record the first time they 're at .500 , if they are , or

(2) their final record , if they stay above .500 the rest of the year.

so valentine 's earlier prediction would go as 13 13 (resend it if you
were serious , val ! ).

espn pointed out last night that the last sox start better than this was
in 1952 , when they finished 76 78 , in sixth place.

3. have entered the game with no more than a 3 run lead and pitched

if a pitcher finishes a game which his team has won , does not get the win ,

yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are
finally moving in the right direction. they should finish
over .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race
in august. however , i would take back a few moves

1. the jim abbott trade.

bleagh ! this was a terrific trade. snow will certainly be better than
mattingly in the future , but that they 'll be about the same now is a
defensible opinion. abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in
the game today.

2. wade boggs.

i'm not sure about this one. i think that it 's good , in that a
pre 1992 boggs kicks hayes meulens whoevers' ass , and that a 1992
boggs still is n't all that shabby. it 's bad , though , that the
yankees expect a pre 1992 boggs , and will probably get a 1992 boggs.
however , i 'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.

3. spike owen.

you have my full agreement here. he 's not all that much better than
velarde , and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.
however , i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname.
not that this helps the yankees.

4. danny tartabull.

tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james.

would n't have had time to throw riles out. yet , the throw beat riles
by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out
think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.
does anybody think vizquel was wrong to field the ball barehanded \? and
if he failed to field it cleanly , would it (or should it) have been an
error or a hit \? (judging from bosio 's grimace when the ball bounced
past him , he must have thought it would go through for a hit.) whether
vizquel was right or wrong , he certainly made one hell of a play.

two run homer to right to win it. (it was n't the game where the fans

well , the 'stick is still cold. the saturday game ended at 5 45pm , and it

at most games , there 's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on

mainly of 10 12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run
out on the field in the fifth inning (when the guy in the toro smooths

if i were the manager , i 'd argue that the runner was out of
the base line since he was to the left of the first base
line. if the umps do n't budge (which they wo n't they nev
er admit when they are wrong) , i 'd file a protest with the
league.

rule 7.09(k) states it is interference by a batter or runner when
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base
... he runs outside the three foot line , or inside (to the left of)
the foul line and , in the umpire 's judgment , interferes with the field
er taking the throw at first base...

the key word in the rule is and. a runner is n't out just for running
out of the baseline. he 's out for interfering with the fielding of the
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first. because the catcher
opted to throw the ball over the batter runner 's head , there 's no inter
ference.



so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw \?

the rule book certainly does n't have a definiton or clarification , so it 's
possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter
his throw to avoid hitting the batter runner , then again we have interference.
you know , it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly if the
catcher (or the pitcher , say rob dibble , for example) throws toward first
and hits the runner running inside the baseline , the fielder takes the chance
of being ejected. therefore he probably would throw around the runner or
(your scenario) above him.

you should note that in our american legion league , (which uses mlb rules) we
interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference
per rule 7.09.

i disagree on one point velarde. yes , maybe the yanks should have let
him develop , but he rode the columbus shuttle way too many times to do
so.
probably the fault of george , but no matter now. his usefulness is
done ,
he will not be able to develop into a good player this deep in his
career
(at least i do n't think so). his fielding is horrendous at 3rd (maybe
he 'd be good at short \? ) , he ca n't his the curve at all , and i think all
his trips from new york to columbus and back have demoralized him to the
point that he just does n't care. get rid of him , i say the sooner the
better , for both the yanks and velarde.


keith keller let's go rangers ! ! ! ! !



velarde has n't been to columbus , if i recall , for about three
years. granted , he has n't been a full time player but
when he does play i 've always thought he had a good bat.
he might be demoralized about not playing full time , but
he has n't been shuttled around. i think he 's been in new york
ever since he had 34 hits in 100 ab back in 1989 , or 90 , i
believe.
i do n't think he is gold glove calibre , but he does n't boot
it around either. i think if velarde is given a chance ,
he could become extremely productive. i do n't have any stats
to back this up , and i do n't know if his defense would
cost any games , but i think he could help and he has
this year. he has 3 hr already. same goes for
jim leyrtiz. he has a big mouth , but he does get
the job done when he concentrates. i think the situation
with leyritz is that he believes he is a potential
super star , and he gets pissed about not playing. i
think he might have realized something when the marlins
or rockies did n't select him.
the yanks need to worry about the bullpen right now.

you are absolutely correct. braves fans are nothing but a bunch of

away a ticket to see the braves play.i would bet my next paycheck that 80 of
the so called braves fans living outside of georgia at the present time can not
name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. on the other hand , ask any
cubs fan living anywhere in the united states to name 3 players from any given
year and 80 of them probably could.

you could be right. then again , you could be wrong. this claim is completely
unverifiable and untestable. i 'd wager most of the braves fans on the net
could name more than 3 players from their 1988 season.

you could give away tickets to braves games. however , my dad and i were able
to get great seats from scalper for face value , which is n't exactly the sign
of a hot ticket...

granted , the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park , but
that does not mean they diserve the title america 's team
the only reason they are considered america 's team is because of ted
turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation.

this is precisely why they were considered america 's team. even
(especially \? ) when they were bad , you could see most of the braves games on
cable. you could do that for the cubs as well , but the braves had better
camerawork , better announcers (what would you rather listen to harry discuss
the game , or skip and pete discuss motoball \? ) , and teams that were n't too
much worse. because of tbs , the braves had a lot of fans outside of georgia.
at home in kentucky , even though we were much closer to cincinnati there was
as many braves fans as reds fans , even in 1990. you could actually watch the
braves play you had to go to cincinnati to watch the reds. i can go
anywhere in america and watch the braves.

i 'll consider toronto america 's team before the braves

why \? i 'd guess that braves fans are more widely distributed than toronto
fans.

i think that , everything else being equal , it 's not too much to ask that
if a weeknight game can be shortened by half an hour by cutting out warmup
pitches , dawdling outside the batter 's box , commercial time outs and that
sort of thing , i'm not asking for too much.

how do you know they can be shortened by half an hour \? has anybody done a
study to determine how much time is actually wasted say , in these a 's
games \?

oh , probably.

ms. nichols has given the average game times (and average runs scored) for
1983 and 1992. (a very nice piece of information , ms. nichols. who knows \?
she may be listening , and not have me in her kill file after all.) those
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half a run less being
scored per game , and the games taking 15 minutes longer . something is
being done now that was n't done ten years ago , which is extending the games
by 15 minutes. ms. nichols thinks it 's more pitches. given the increasing
specialization of pitchers , it would n't surprise me.

if it 's not simply more pitches , though , i do n't think it 's unreasonable
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back. then
i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher
after he comes in , and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules ,
which have been stated in other posts in this thread (and other related ones).

the problem is , who decides whether that time is wasted \? you do n't seem
to think it is at all. right now , i think it is , although i have heard one
case favoring giving the reliever all the warmups he thinks he needs (the
difference in mounds between the field and pen) but who knows \? if the
rules get changed , maybe something i did n't foresee will happen to change my
mind. but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing ,
or else nothing will be changed.

funny , it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks ,
which are nothing but collections of statistics , are authored by bill james
and stats inc. (and howe , for the minor league handbook) .

and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies
as a book with statistics , while the elias analyst is a statistics book .
the analyst contains more stats , sure , but it also contains more dialogue.

finally , the point was not about the word statistics . it was about
money grubbing . i do n't see how anyone who has looked at the bill

the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings. last
night 's game was hard fought. the game in chicago should have been a
blow out. all in all these two games show a different phillies team.
in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run
games. i do n't know how many times i saw them losing by only 1 run.
if they were able to win most of those , they might have been more of
a contending team. they are 3 0 so far in extra innings. and of

the original poster wanted to know how the big cat looked. i was also at
the saturday game in montreal (apr 17) that rockies won 9 1. i have n't
paid much attention to gallarraga since he left the expos but his stance
seemed to be much different. he stands more erect and very open , with his
left foot pointing to 3rd base. i'm wondering if this is a recent change
in stance for him \? andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter. he could
always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. if this is indeed a new
stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily \? as for his patience ,

dennis martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. if he was grooving
pitches to andres , you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did ! ).
does andres generally start hot or cold \? does it take until may for most
pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away \?

while we 're on the multipurpose subject , let 's not forget shea , which
was designed to accommodate both the mets jets. it was the first
stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football.

minor point shea stadium was designed as a multi purpose stadium but
not with the jets in mind as the tennant. the new york football giants
had moved to yankee stadium (from the polo grounds) in 1958 and was
having problem with stadium management (the city did not own yankee
stadium until 1972). the idea was to get the giants to move into shea.
when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the
new afl franchise , the new york titans , approached the city about using
the new stadium. the titans were playing in downing stadium (where the
cosmos played soccer in the 70s). because shea stadium was tied into
the world 's fair anyway , the city thought it would be a novel idea to
promote the new franchise and the world 's fair (like they were doing
with the mets). so the deal was worked out.

of course , with the jets gone to jersey (and a truly good football
stadium) , the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where ,
because it 's circular , the seats are almost always too far from the
action. the mets announcers kiner murphy in particular have
always hyped it as beautiful shea
stadium , a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

i'm under the impression that when murph says it , he means it ! as a
regular goer to shea , it is not a bad place since they 've cleaned and
renovated the place. remember , this is its 30th year !

it 's actually not an uncommon phenomenon , and how long a guy hangs around
based on one good year seems like a reasonable question to explore on a

billy hatcher
we 'll see if he 's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.
hey , he plays for lou gorman , does n't he \? ok , so it 's eight years.

ok , i admit to taking a quick browse through the major league handbook , but
only after the first 7 or 8. oh , and there 's the all time light hitting
black outfielder lou brock. look it up. and curt flood. cesar geronimo.
cesar cedeno.
brock suffered from otis nixon disease , but he was n't perceived as
light hitting. neither was curt flood. cesar cedeno was not light
hitting.

good point on cedeno. otoh , i have n't seen that extensive list of 10 year
dan gladdens , either. there really are n't that many players altogether who
hang around for 10 years even if they 're reasonably good.

ideally , dhs should be the strongest offensive players , because
any schmoe can play dh if he can hit. that would take care of position
corrected anomolies such as frank 's. since that is not the case (and why
not \? is it always this way \? ) then we are going to have trouble finding the
true value of dhs using the same models as that for position players.

there are several reasons for this difference. the main reason is that
good hitters in their prime (such as frank thomas and danny tartabull)
are rarely regular dh 's , even if they ca n't field it 's more commonly a
place to put aging veterans.

another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury
slowly , getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the
field. i would expect such players to hit worse as dh 's than they did
during the rest of the season.

a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first
or the outfield do n't hit as well as dh 's for some reason. reggie
jackson was a good example in five years as a rf dh for the angels , he
hit like the old reggie when he was in right.

the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by
their primary position only a player who plays 90 games in right and 60
at dh will count only in the right fielders' averages.

a logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement
value (if you can find it) for 1b or lf or something. we can assume that
if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value , even though i
doubt this is actually true for players like winfield and molitor. this
would let us discount the time they spend playing dh , because that
forces the team to find another real fielder to play.

this makes sense you might also look at it another way. although the
average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left
fielder , the replacement level offensive performance is certainly
lower if you are a left fielder but ca n't hit well enough to keep a job
anywhere , then you certainly ca n't hit well enough to keep a job at dh.

when gant turned away , hirschbeck immediately motioned for gant
to step into the box. imo , at this point in time , hirschbeck
was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game.
gant was n't dawdling he had n't had a chance to dawdle. and hirschbeck
was simply exercising a power play. gant resisted , as many of
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and
hirschbeck called for the pitch. at that point , cox came out on
the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other braves left the
dugout. cox was tossed protecting his player . i was pleasantly
surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.

did you see the same game i saw \? gant , most reasonable , argued a
horrible call which hirschbeck , correctly , did nothing about. gant
then proceeded to walk halfway to 3rd base , lean on his bat and
glare at hirschbeck. while i do n't necessasarily subscribe to the
theory of showing people up , this was an obvious attempt by gant to
do so to hirschbeck. he left hirschbeck no choice but to take control
of the situation. the bottom line is gant started a dangerous
power struggle with hirschbeck when his team needed him most and
he lost.

the events i saw were
1) called strike by hirschbeck
2) shocked looking gant asks for appeal to first
3) no appeal to first
4) gant steps out of batters box.
5) hirschbeck immediately orders gant back in. bad move
6) gant ignores hirschbeck and walks off. bad move
7) hirschbeck yells at gant. gant is silent.
8) hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9) pitch is called a strike.
10) cox argues (could n't see when he came on the field)
11) cox is ejected , players everywhere
12) play finally resumes.

gant should n't have ignored hirschbeck. not returning made the strike
call fairly likely. although i suspect an argument might have gotten
gant tossed altogether. but if hirschbeck had let gant step out , the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

in a game that saw a little of everything incredible defense , some power ,
clutch pitching , and a little wildness the reds managed to overcome their
trademark lack of timely hitting in crucial situations...

during spring training i made a similarly innoncent looking comment
about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying. no such
thing as clutch hitting they (the sdcn 's) all screamed. i assumed
they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance ,
given their comments.

this is certainly not the case. there is no significant ability toi
perform in the clutch , but clutch performance certainly happens every
time there is a game winning hit. the clutch pitching quoted above is
something which happened , not a claim that any particular player should
be expected to be a clutch pitcher.

over the past four seasons sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as
clutch situations (by the scouting report) for an average of .228.
over that same period he had another 1539 abs with 452 hits for an
average of .294.

according to the rest of the sdcn 's , any differential such as this is
completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable
inference , such as perhaps perez should have used a pinch hitter in
that situation.

simple statistics tell me that there is a 2 chance an average clutch
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points ,
standard deviation about 30). there will be such hitters in any league ,
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays.

and there is only a very weak correlation (.01 in my best study) between
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year ,
probably because most of the clutch data is determinaed by luck rather
than any ability. based only on this data , i do n't see any reason to
pinch hit for sabo , or any other player who had been a poor clutch
hitter in the past.

but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch hit.
does the pinch hitter give you a platoon advantage \? (any portion of
sabo 's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a
real ability , even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting.) do you
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run \? do you
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves \?

this braves team is made up of slow starters. people are amazed that the

time , nor were they the year before. they had slow aprils and mays in the
1991 and 1992 seasons , and yet they still managed to go to the series in
those years. well , this team is no different , so why should we be suprised
at their slow start \? they started that way for the past two years , and
they 'll be that way until the richmond club makes it to the majors. judge
their offense in june or july when things start to average out. i'm just
happy that the reds have gotten off to such a poor start. the giants always
do well in the early part of the season , but they 'll be out of the race by
july (just like the last few years). unless bond 's developes a knuckelball ,

you said it all right there.

his .300 season last year was good , but i'm not convinced that he can do
it again. it reminds me (sorry) of the year 1987( \? ) when tim wallach hit

like clinton and reno , i accept full responsibility for this
senseless disaster. my wife and i picked this game to go to
and thus caused the return of the pre season projected sox
offense. like all no no 's bosio was good , lucky (hard grounder
by vaughn off t. martinez' glove but straight to boone who
threw to bosio at first , 3 4 1) , and backed by good defense
(many non trivial groundouts). the game was amazingly fast ,
as the sox tended to go down quickly and hesketh was also
working fast. the sox relief pitching was ok the runs off
quantrill were on two ridiculous bloops and a hard line single
which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch.

greenwell 's mental stability is a serious concern (i guess it
has always been , but his quirks were amusing back when he was
an mvp candidate). wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a
after striking out on a bad inside pitch (apparently johnson
made an ok , i 've got to stay focused gesture which iron mike
interpreted as taunting) , and struck out to heavy booing the
next two times. as valentine noted , last night he came up in
the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game.
can you say take the first pitch \? not mike , who dribbled it
into a 6 4 3. the pi quoted bosio that this was a batting
practice fastball . next time up he also hit the first pitch ,
a hard liner straight to kgjr in center. he also made the
pathetic error and failed to catch boone 's hr (which looked
comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight
reel that night).

is riles suppsoed to be good defensively \? i could n't tell from
the field angle but his range looked bad , and he coughed a dp
that cost a run or two. why was he leadoff \? i hope fletcher
gets well soon.

also on lineups , pinella put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond
me. it seemed to work , as he was 3 4 with a hr and some good
defense (a wag behind us said he sure do n't want to go back to
calgary ! ) there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth
because they 'll likely lead off the second (as boone did).

well , now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in
langston. a reminder that contest entries are open through next
wednesday i expect a surge of pessimism. by the way , ties will
be broken by earliest entry. one entry per person or pseudonym ,

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them , than because they have a great eye

i'm not sure. i used to think this was true , but more and more i'm becoming
convinced that it 's the other way around among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard , the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot.

let 's break down the four basic categories of hitter , according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot


power no power

patient frank thomas brett butler
barry bonds ozzie smith
mark mcgwire craig grebeck
babe ruth miller huggins
ted williams billy hamilton
rickey henderson eddie joost
joe morgan mike hargrove
. .
. .
. .

impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen
dave kingman shawon dunston
joe carter andres thomas
george bell jose lind
kirby puckett devon white

okay , i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a
strike or two and try to get on base any way they can.

so the no power impatient guys have no excuse.
the no power patient guys are doing the right thing.

now the impatient power guys (how could you leave out the big cat \? ).
would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took
more pitches \? perhaps , but i doubt it. if you tell joe carter
to go up there and take a few pitches , he will draw more walks , but
he also wo n't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because
he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.

the patient power guys \? joe morgan had a small strike zone and
rickey henderson has a strike zone the size of hitler 's heart
so they get their walks based on the small zone.

look at the other 5 guys thomas , bonds , mcgwire , ruth and williams. wow !
a lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe
walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.
the pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after
them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch , but pitchers
would rather nibble , go 2 0 or 3 1 and then get hurt.

according to the atlanta paper , bream will be the full time first baseman
with klesko used as a late inning defensive replacement if bream is lifted
for a pinch runner. he 'd have to hit a homer in his first ab (or win the

if this is true (note that i do n't think it is) , lasorda should be
fired for at least two reasons

1) publicly humiliating his players
2) knuckling under to his players wishes.

there is a fine line between getting players' input and knuckling
under to players' demands. a manager , much like a military officer ,
needs to have his (her) players' complete obedience and respect during
a game. after the game , it 's no big deal , but when there is no time
to do more than react , players must trust the manager or the team often
falls apart (see boston red sox , ff. ) )

strawberry 's demeanor as represented by the media , often sounds like
demands. i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth i'm
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if
it came from strawberry. russ porter quoted strawberry as saying ,
i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best
in that role. (paraphrased by my memory and bias.) that seems like
a fairly non petulant answer to what was almost certainly a question
like , how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order \?
a more media sensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is
doing. if he thinks that batting me third will help the team , then i
am all for it. we 'd ignore that answer as brown stuff , so it seems a
little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl 's response as petulant.

personally , i think his argument is nonsense and that it really does n't
matter much in which order the 2 5 players in the order are batted ,
except for personal stats. if i were darryl , i 'd probably answer that
question , the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get
paid for rbis. i think it is best for me to bat fourth , but i am willing
to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team. or something like
that. it would be helpful at salary time my rbis were down because i was
hitting third and make him sound like a team player. since strawberry
will not likely go through arbitration , but use the free agent market for
his next contract , maybe that argument is useless , but it would help
his image with the media without appearing to be totally content free.

remember , the media is of the belief that one 's best rbi man should hit
fourth , so the argument is sensible , regardless of whether or not it is

i do n't actually have the answer to this one.

bosio , after walking the first two batters , retired 27 straight for a
back end perfect game.

well , there were 27 outs in a row with no hits or walks in between , but
really , he only retired 26 batters in a row. the first out of the game
was the front end of a double play. still counts as a back end perfect
game in my book , though.

congrats to chris bosio. too bad the brewers could n't hold on to him.

(dale stephenson) says

the events i saw were
1) called strike by hirschbeck
2) shocked looking gant asks for appeal to first
3) no appeal to first
4) gant steps out of batters box.
5) hirschbeck immediately orders gant back in. bad move

even i noticed that gant 's demeanor was not one of a batter
attempting to regain his concentration. gant was stalking off.
i wonder if gant said something to the ump \?

6) gant ignores hirschbeck and walks off. bad move

actually , there was a small hand wave by gant...as if to say
'do n't bother me'. gant may have said something here , too.

7) hirschbeck yells at gant. gant is silent.
8) hirschbeck calls for the pitch.
9) pitch is called a strike.
10) cox argues (could n't see when he came on the field)

cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called.

11) cox is ejected , players everywhere
12) play finally resumes.

gant should n't have ignored hirschbeck. not returning made the strike
call fairly likely. although i suspect an argument might have gotten
gant tossed altogether. but if hirschbeck had let gant step out , the
whole incident probably would have been avoided.

my impression was that gant was not 'stepping out.' he was making
a protest about the lack of an appeal to first. as has been
pointed out earlier , there is no appeal to first on a strike.
i can understand gant feeling a little pressure in a two out ,
risp , 1 0 game , ninth inning. he let it get to him. the ump
also overreacted. gant was stalking off , but i doubt he would
have been gone long. hirschbeck should have let him have a
moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat.
imho , umpires should be more flexible than what hirschbeck
showed. gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely
he would not get a hit.

a very bad finish to a pretty good game.

just watch me. mattingly is a below average fielder.

before you start up , yes , i have proof. there are really only two
adequate ways to measure fielding prowess. the first , which has the
advantage of being applicable to older players , since it uses raw data
available for almost all of mlb history , is the total chances per game
method favored by the total baseball people among others. it basically
says that you measure a fielder by how many balls he gets to.

but it is subject to all kinds of bias , and is almost completely useless
for first basemen. from the raw stats , there is no way to tell which of
a first baseman 's putouts were made on throws from other fielders , and
which were made on his own plays likewise , you ca n't tell whether a
double play was 6 4 3 or 3 6 3. fielding runs thus gives a first
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays , only for assists and
errors.

it thus favors first basemen who play deep , reaching a lot of balls but
forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently. it also hurts first
baseman who play behind left handed pitching staffs and thus face few
left handed batters.

a better method , but newer and based ondata that has only been collected
over the last few years , measures the percentage of balls hit into the
part of the field the guy is responsible for.

this is better of course , it still is n't all of a first baseman 's
defense.

some references mattingly 's 1992 defensive rating , stats method , from
mike gimbel 's baseball player and team ratings 1.

defensive average , which uses larger (and probably better) zones , has
mattingly tied for second in the league.

on the other hand , he has contributed 233 runs by his batting
actions , a pretty healthy number.

while 233 batting runs is good , it is mostly in the past the runs he
produced in 1986 do n't say much about his value in 1993.

total baseball , which also tries to evaluate a player 's total offensive
and defensive contributions , gives barry bonds a total player rating of
9.0 for 1992. only one other player since ruth attained that mark cal
ripken for his 1984 season. rounding out the top five offensive players
in the nl last season sheffield , 5.9 sandberg , 5.8 van slyke , 5.3 and
larkin , 4.7.

the top 5 offensive players in the al in 1992 were e. martinez , 4.8
ventura , 4.8 anderson , 4.5 r. henderson , 4.4 and thomas , 4.4

in short , total baseball says bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons
ever in the game 's history better than any year had by mantle ,
mays , williams , etc. (if you disagree , do n't flame me flame the
writers of total baseball.) also , martinez and ventura are neck and
neck , so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis , which one
had the better year can be considered a toss up. thus , total baseball
supports your choices of bonds and ventura as the mvps of 1992.

sigh. here we go again.

actually , several scdn 's stated that there were no definable skills
that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch
situations vs. non clutch situations , however one might choose to
define clutch .

right. can you define such a skill \?

must i \? if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that
can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a
hit on a particular plate appearance , is that only valid if i can
define the skill in hitting a baseball \? that 's all i 've said ,
except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations.

and elsewhere on this thread sherri nichols repeats her position
that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic.

for predicting the future , it has been entirely meaningless. at least
if it has meaning , we do n't know how to find it.

i did not say i could predict the future. i 've suggested that the
statistic is not necessarily meaningless. here 's the data for this
situation

non clutch clutch
ab h ba ab h ba

sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228
samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299


if you were to have been the reds manager at that time , i assume you
would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting samuel. i'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance. you just would n't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance. is this not correct \?


i 'll try to avoid being insulting. but it 's difficult when you so
cavalierly dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an i do n't pretend
to understand , but...

nobody is denying that there are people who have hit well in the
clutch in the past. but i challenge you to find a method to predict
who will hit well in the clutch in the future . which , after all , is
what you are claiming you can do. since


one more time. i did not claim to be able to predict the future.
i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would
have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo.

and i am not dismissing your work. i'm stating my opinion.
you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary
invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult
to your work.


fine. we have plenty of data. obviously our preconceived biases must
be coloring our work , since you know clutch hitting is a
well defined and consistent skill , all of our failures
not withstanding. so i challenge you to prove it ! i guarantee you
that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability ,
you will have plenty of happy sdcns dancing around you.

i did not say that clutch hitting is well defined.

i said that the data is significant to me.

i did not say that it is a consistent skill.

i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a
certain set of circumstances.


but you are n't going to win any support by merely stating a position
and claiming 'they are stupid , so i must be right'.


and , big sigh


i have not
not
not
not
not
not
not ever called you or anyone else on r.s.b. stupid .


it is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility
that you actually could have some preconceived biases.


yeah. hindsight is always 20 20. does n't that make you bright \? this
is a stupid argument and you know it.

ah. i knew we could get to the name calling. and there 's that word
you like so much.


a suggestion \? take data from 1990 1991 , and attempt to come up with
some method that predicts who hit well in the clutch in 1992. if that
works , we can then attempt to apply it to 1993 and beyond.

wait a minute. i thought i first had to define clutch hitting.
do i , or do n't i \?

you have made strong statements. now back them up or be proven a
total idiot.

i made two statements in my post.

1. i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting.

2. i would have hit for sabo.


as for 2 , many of us make a number of written statements through
this media about what we think will happen in baseball. i'm not
shy about it. i 'll make the statement again. i believe that by
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll
just have to wait and see.



here 's another one for you. in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting
average in non clutch situations each year. i presume you think
this is random.

non clutch 1585 ab 411 h .259
clutch 338 ab 68 h .201

so what could we expect in 1992 from mr. carter \?

well , his composite ba through 1989 was .268 through 1990 was
.262 through 1991 was .263 , so i think we have a pretty good
idea of what kind of batting average he can produce. in 1992
he hit .264. not surprising , huh \? also in 1992

non clutch 536 ab 144 h .269
clutch 86 ab 20 h .233

no , this does n't prove any overall statistical trend that can
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of
major league ballplayers. it just makes me think that in 1993
joe carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be
as high as his ba in non clutch situations.


as for 1 (above) , i have plenty of company. john dewan of stats , inc. is
the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding
clutch hitting are compiled , reported and referenced in the text.
bill james makes numerous references to a player 's ability to hit
well in the clutch. i am not saying that i can predict the future
any more than they are. you (and others) are saying that your
work renders their statements (and mine) meaningless. i do n't
accept that , which in your words proves that i am a total idiot .


stupid . total idiot .

hi there ,

i'm german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now.
there are many problems occuring for me. one of them is the era statistic for
pitchers. what does it say \? \?

era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per
nine inning game. thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned
run , his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs , thus his era
is 3.00. to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.

era (er ip) 9

i think there is another formula for era. i heard something about it last
year. im not sure what it is , but im gonna give it a stab. it allows for
a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit , cuz it
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched...

era (er 27) outs recorded

like i said , im not sure this is exactly it , but im pretty sure they changed
it to something of the sort.


an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed
to a fielding error. more specifically , if an error occurs that represented
the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs.
earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base
when the pitcher exited the game. here are some examples

if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base. if
an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after
this error and not counted as earned runs.

if a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks) , and leaves the game
before the inning is completed , he is responsible for the people who
were left on base. if the those runners who were left on base score ,
and the score was not a result of an error , those eraned runs are
attributed to the pitcher who left the game.

i hope this explains things for you.

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more
umpires will do as hirschbeck did in instructing the pitcher to pitch if
the batter wo n't get back in the box.


a reasonable umpire would have recognized that ron gant was
disturbed with the call. a reasonable umpire would have realized that
there was a 1 run game in progress , with two outs in the ninth. what
ron gant did was try to regain his composure. what a normal baseball
player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument
with the umpire , and since you ca n't argue balls and strikes , he would
have been ejected from the game. ron gant , by trying to avoid such a
conflict , was penalized for showing some restraint.

incidentally , a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire , as gant
requested. if the home plate umpire had appealed to first , the first base
umpire could have wrung up the strike , and gant would not have been so
upset. if the call had been a ball , and the catcher had requested the
appeal , it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.

finally , the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so called
efforts to speed up the game. the game was played very quickly , it was
just at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth , and the only delays
in the entire game had been the result of actions by the umpires (other than
deion having to clean garbage off the field).

if it has meaning , we do n't know how to find it.

i did not say i could predict the future.

you most certainly did !

i really do n't want to get into a didso didnot debate with you. but
this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement. i did not say ,
nor did i imply , that i could predict the future. you have inferred
that my comments meant this , and you have based your rebuttal of my
comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that
there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in
regard to clutch hitting.


sabo 1539 452 .294 259 59 .228
samuel 1564 383 .245 278 83 .299

sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel. yet you would pinch hit
samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and
sabo will be a choke hitter. right \? i 'd call that predicting the
future .

that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than
samuel. the above data is for a 4 year period ending last season.
last season samuel batted .272 while sabo hit .244 (not park adjusted).
this season they are both hitting below .200 , albeit sabo with more
at bats. i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better
hitter than samuel , but i will also remind you that samuel has been
a better hitter in certain situations than sabo.

i did not predict that sabo would choke , nor that samuel would get a
hit. i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager (or
even a reds fan) that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that
situation than sabo.


if you were to have been the reds manager at that time , i assume you
would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch
hitting samuel. i'm sure some of that basis would have utilized
prior performance. you just would n't have used this particular
aspect of prior performance. is this not correct \?

right. i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been
shown to be consistent in the past. overall performance , l r splits ,
even matching hitting pitching styles. all of these will give me some
advantage if used properly.

ah. properly . yes. i see.

even if all else were equal , there would be no advantage gained by
looking at past clutch performance. and in this case , everything else
pointed to sabo.

please help me. what , exactly , is everything else that pointed to sabo \?


well , yes. you are aware of its existance. you claim to be incapable
of understanding it (though i suspect you are simply unwilling). yet
you rather forcefully state the opposite. you do n't seem to think the
work is worth reading (yet you obviously feel the topic is important).
i 'd say this is insulting.

i must say , i was not aware of the publication. can you email me the
information regarding its availability \?

and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive
study on , say , supply side economics. i did n't mean to insult you.
but i never did believe you were on the right path. i'm sorry for
my contrary opinion position. i also regret that i do n't have the
ability to prove that you are wrong. but you are.


i believe that by
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll
just have to wait and see.

is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year \? or is this
a prediction for all batters who have , over the past few years , hit
(xxx amount \? ) worse in the clutch than overall \?

it is what it says it is !

if you mean the first , then as you say , we 'll just have to wait and
see. but the second is a much stronger statement. in fact , it
suggests a rule. we can then test this rule on past data to see if it
worked for recent years. i think you will agree that if the rule
did n't work last year or the year before , that it is unlikely to do
any better this year. right \?


the second is your statement , not mine.


i'm not going to get into case analysis. sure , you can find somebody
who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. you
can also find those who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit well in
'92.

well , actually , i have n't yet. but i'm not finished looking.
that is , i have n't yet found someone who hit significantly below
his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years
1989 91 , and then reversed that relationship in 1992.


gambler 's fallacy. unless there is reason to expect consistency , a
run proves nothing. can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to
correlate from one year to the next \? i 've seen a detailed study of
why i should n't expect it to correlate.

nope. sorry. but if you were interested in a reason why i expect
chris sabo 's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one
year to the next , i think i could. if you were interested in a
reason why i expect joe carter 's ability to hit in the clutch to
correlate from one year to the next , i think i could. but you 're
not interested in that , because you think that those conclusions
could only be valid if they could be extrapolated over the entire
baseball population. and they ca n't be.


the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid. (and
i do n't see how you can deny it.) as for total idiot \? yes. if you
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might
suggest that you are wrong , i would say the term fits nicely.

the problem here is that i do believe you. i accept your work.
i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based
on prior clutch history is meaningless. no better than a coin toss.
i actually do accept your work.

as it happens , i also have an opinion that in certain situations ,
for certain players , a history of superior or inferior ability to
hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be
valid in projecting future player performance. for that player.
and chris sabo is one such player.


so tell me \? does the term fit \? or do you have an open mind \?

well , since i defer to your statistical wisdom , i think i must have
an open mind. now we have to pose the same question to you.

mattingly scores badly on both counts. he does n't get to very many
balls , and he lets a lot of balls go through. the fact that he looks
smooth , has great hands , and makes few errors means nothing. this is
traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be
misled. like a lot of bad fielders , mattingly actually makes himself
look better by not having any range. he 's nowhere near as bad as steve
garvey , but that 's not much of a compliment.

i agree with the flavor of this post , but disagree with one specific
argument. that has great hands means nothing. it seems to me that
a first baseman 's defensive value is not entirely (or even primarily)
from his ability to field grounders or catch popups. how many such
chances does he get during a game \? many fewer than he gets chances
to catch throws from 2b , ss , 3b and p (i mean the total of these is
much higher than grounder popup totals). this implies to me that there
is value in catching these throws well , even if they are high , up the line
or in the dirt. good hands are needed for such plays , and thus have
value. i do n't have any numbers for the relative number of occurences
of these plays , but i 'd guess that the values of these abilities are
similar. it 's just like you do n't judge catcher 's defense primarily
on how they field bunts and popups. (but not as marked i suppose).

major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter
attention spans (i.e. the football crowd). ( invariably , all the
arguments from people who do n't like to watch baseball on t.v. say the
same thing the games are too long and too boring. baseball is trying
to find a way to shorten the games for wider t.v. appeal. if you look at
it , though , baseball games last around the same amount of time as football
games. the difference is that there is more action in that duration in
football games. perhaps if there were more action in baseball games , you
would get more of those fans to tune in. anyway , coming up with a solution
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.

yeah , morris just knows how to win. that 's why he lost 18 for detroit in
1990. funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but
loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. and if rings was the only
criteria for success , then teams would always tend to repeat , and
eventually you 'd have the same team win the ws every bleepin' year. sort
of like the yanks in the 50s.

morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good , not great , career.
toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year , with morris and all those

i agree with nick. what 's the big deal about long games \? if you want
to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes ,
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves.

first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless
you include watching the grass grow as baseball. the lengthier games
are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers
and pitching coaches.

and while it 's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting , this
is only true when they do n't become extra long. quickly pitched games
can grab and hold your attention much better.

that 's the trouble what peak years \? he wavers between excellent and
very good , with no real bell shaped pattern in there. 1979 was a fine
year 78 and 80 were merely really good. with the yankees , 84 (i think)
was the best that was the one with the .340 ba.

of course , 1992 was n't bad , either. he 's been in the bigs since 1973 ,
with a one year intermission for surgery. though he does n't have the
mix of skills that pete rose did , he 's like pete rose in one way he 's
not a natural hitter. winfield 's swing used to be the ugliest thing
in new york , and that includes the gulf western building. but his sheer
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.

fascinating player to watch , even now. not obviously great in any one
way but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
levels.

incidentally , a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire , as gant
requested. if the home plate umpire had appealed to first , the first base
umpire could have wrung up the strike , and gant would not have been so
upset. if the call had been a ball , and the catcher had requested the
appeal , it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help.


yes , but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a
strike. there was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal.
once he called it a strike the call could not be changed.

i thought that the umpire did the right thing.

organization worcester polytechnic institute

nntp posting host rajeesh.wpi.edu

is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi 's \?
this is the situation that brought the question up

the red sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5 1. the mariners
had the bases loaded with 1 out. the batter hits a fly to center , which the
fielder catches. the runner at third tags and scores without a throw.

now , without a judgement call (and i do n't think there is one) , this is an rbi
for the batter. it seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive
indifference , since it does n't really matter whether the guy at third scores
at that point. (i know , i can think of several if the mariners stole third
and second , which opening the base would allow , and then the batter hit a
grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and
third , he would n't have a play at home , third , or second for the out , and
maybe he therefore ca n't make the throw to first to get the last out , etc...
scenarios , too. but does it really matter if this guy scores this way when
you 're down by 4 \? if the tying run is going to score , so is the guy on third.)

the point is that the batter (imo) should n't get credit (an rbi) for utterly
failing to do his job which at this point is to get a hit or a walk , not
trade an out for one run. what do you guys think \?

can anybody figure out why some box score abbreviations make
absolutely no sense \? (at least in the local gannett rag that finds its way

good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was. would n't
it make more sense to use colemn \?

i 've seen it as colmn also.

blame the associated press. after the official scorer balances the
official score card , they copy it and give it to several diffent people.
one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up (using a
template on a laptop) and transmit it to the ap offices in new york
(rockefeller center) via the telephone. the box scores are not checked
and just rebroadcasted over ap 's news delivery services. if there are
corrections , those are issued later. it is the person sitting in front
of a laptop at shea (or whereever) whose fault that is. note the ap
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in
most newspapers being the first one

last week they were in denver. maybe the ap person in denver did this
(remember , they just started with mlb out there). check tomorrow 's
paper (4 21) and see if the person who is doing it from shea does the
same thing.

stole 300 bases. (ok , he 's still light hitting , but baseball managers do n't
think so , they think he , like omar moreno before him , is a perfect leadoff
man. awesome defense.)

darnell coles

he 's still around because of his 1986 , when he hit 20 hr.

henry cotto

has n't played 10 years in the bigs. was n't a full time major leaguer
until 1988.

manny mota.

consistent .300 hitter.

billy hatcher

we 'll see if he 's still around in 1994 for his tenth year.

herm winningham.

same goes for herm.

lonnie smith (not light hitting , but a horror in the field)

does n't count then.

gary redus

redus is hardly light hitting , plus he stole 300 bases. close to
800 ops career against lhp.

dion james

we 'll see if he 's still around in 1995 to qualify.

daryl boston

slugged .416 to .440 for three straight years in one of the worst hitters'
parks in the nl. he 's going to be one of colorado 's better players this
year. plus , to make ten you have to count all the time he spent in denver
and buffalo and hawaii while with the white sox.

vince coleman (yeah , he 's finally started to have a decent obp)

coleman , assuming he makes it to 1994 , was never perceived as being
weak offensively , though of course he was. led nl in sb his first six
years in the majors.

cecil espy

we 'll see if he 's still around in 1997.

willie wilson

wilson has always been overrated , but hit .300 five times in a six year
stretch and led the league in triples five times. but we can count him
if he 's still playing in 1994 , though it 'll be because he 's otis nixon
deluxe with slightly worse defense.

gary pettis

okay , if he 's in the league this year , he can count , though he 's also
in the majors because of otis nixon syndrome.

milt thompson

he 's not spectacular , but he 's neither light hitting nor a ten year man.

gary varsho

halfway there , and unlikely to make it 3 4 of the way there.

ok , i admit to taking a quick browse through the major league handbook , but
only after the first 7 or 8. oh , and there 's the all time light hitting
black outfielder lou brock. look it up. and curt flood. cesar geronimo.
cesar cedeno.

brock suffered from otis nixon disease , but he was n't perceived as
light hitting. neither was curt flood. cesar cedeno was not light
hitting.

note these guys may not have reached 10 years yet , but they 've got
to be close.

likewise for my list. oh , and a prediction milt cuyler.

would n't have had time to throw riles out. yet , the throw beat riles
by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out
think vizquel had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand.

in this morning 's paper (or was it on the radio \? ) , vizquel was quoted as
saying that he could have fielded the ball with his glove and still
easily thrown out riles , that he barehanded it instead so as to make the
final play more memorable. seems a litle cocky to me , but he made it
work so he 's entitled.

i guess so.
still , that 's kind of a stupid move , imo. he 'd be singing a different

dj was a popular player in san diego , derek bell was not faring well in the

was a steal for the jays just from the perspective of team chemistry.

i laugh at you now , and i will laugh at you again , equally publicly ,
when the jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent.

the jays will finish third because of the depletion of their pitching staff ,
not because derek bell was traded for darrin jakson.

i could n't agree more. the jays have a lot of power in their line up.
so far pitching has been the biggest problem. maybe we can get acker back \? )

but anyway the point of my post , if you missed it , was that derek bell was
traded because he was basically in the doghouse with cito and the rest of
the team.

one incident that sticks out in my mind was when derek bell ran back out on
to the feild after the jays had won the division and all the players were
back in the clubhouse. bell ran around the field with his arms in the air ,
waving a big towel over his head. he looked like a big jerk , especially
when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole
season. the next day , winfield and carter somehow got the keys to bell 's
jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started. the stadium
announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for bell 's
jeep. bell really freaked out. i do n't think bell was to popular after that.

i think that jackson might be trying a little too hard right now. he 's known
for being a great outfielder , and he 's not the only blue jay who has been
booting balls and playing generally awful.

i suppose a foul ball machine (like brett butler) is pretty valuable ,
but i 'd rather watch (and root for) the lower obp guys who can
actually hit the ball.

now this is a legitimate point. baseball is entertainment , and i have no
quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than
others , regardless of their win value. personally , i'm a huge fan of the
slug bunt i doubt it 's a high percentage play , but i get a big kick out of
it. i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun.

of course , this is not the same as claiming (as some do) that galarraga 's
inability to defer gratification is n't hurting his team because he is n't
paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever.

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike
to them , than because they have a great eye

i'm not sure. i used to think this was true , but more and more i'm becoming
convinced that it 's the other way around among players with the physical
ability to hit the ball real hard , the patient ones are the ones who get the
chance to do it a lot.

let 's break down the four basic categories of hitter , according to whether
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot


power no power

patient frank thomas brett butler
barry bonds ozzie smith
mark mcgwire craig grebeck
babe ruth miller huggins
ted williams billy hamilton
rickey henderson eddie joost
joe morgan mike hargrove
. .
. .
. .

impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen
dave kingman shawon dunston
joe carter andres thomas
george bell jose lind
kirby puckett devon white
etc.

as far as i can tell , all the categories are full. it really looks like the
two are independent. nobody could possibly be afraid of craig grebeck at
the plate , and yet he walks quite a lot. part of that , undoubtedly , is being
small of stature , but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of
target at least 3 times out of 6. randy milligan is an even better example
he 's only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season , but he walks all
over the place , despite his huge strike zone.

darryl has not gotten off to a good start , he has to blame someone.

as far as i know , a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or
beyond , and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game.
for example if it is the bottom of the 8th inning and clemens is
pithching. the red sox are leading 4 1 and clemens has just givin up a hit. so ,
there is a man on first , the batter , and the batter on deck could tie the game
with a homer. if jeff russel came in , (the red sox reliever) , and finished the
game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score , he would get the save
and clemens would get the win.
thats how i beleive it works.

i stopped going to a 's games some years ago while i still lived inthe

has been institutionalized by larussa duncan. they encourage their
pitchers to be overly deliberate , to throw to first often , to study
the catchers' signals , and so on. and almost every a 's hitter takes
a step out of the box after every pitch. this is not , imo , a coincidence.
this is planned. and i hate it.

wait a minute. if i read the rules right. a stike is any portion of the ball
over any portion of the plate.


given that the ball is 2.9 in diameter. this sez that the zone width
is 17 (2 2.9) or 22.8 . while this is still less than the 23

run values for players last year. we can use these as a springboard for
reconsideration of the mvp award.

major caveats these numbers include no defensive park adjustment , so if
san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the
infield , that will cause some inaccuracies. the offensive numbers are
position adjusted , but not park adjusted , so we have to deflate some and
inflate others to be fair. finally , we still do n't know what to do about
catchers , and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions
of tony phillips and bip roberts.

having said that , there are still some surprises. let 's look national
league first. all numbers in total runs contributed over the season.

player offense defense total

sandberg 44 32 76
bonds 67 3 70
walker 26 26 52
justice 14 33 47
daulton 44 \? \? 44 \?
larkin 36 4 40
grace 13 27 40

as i see it , these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season.
if you deflate sandberg 's offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley , you
get essentially a dead heat. had bonds been his usual defensive self , it
would n't have been close , but that apparently was n't the case. darren
daulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference ,
and i could n't tell you whether that 's easy or impossible. a good case
could be made for any of sandberg , bonds , or daulton as top dude.

my personal vote bonds , sandberg , daulton , walker , justice.


in the american league

player offense defense total

ventura 22 34 56
martinez 47 1 46
b. anderson 21 25 46
thomas 47 5 42
r. henderson 25 16 41
raines 17 23 40
tettleton 33 \? \? 33 \?

ok , let 's see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top
player in the al last year \? i certainly did n't , but i 'd have a hard time
arguing against him at this point. yes , i know these numbers are only
approximate , but that 's a big gap between him and the 2 guy. also , those
of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds.

once again , there 's a catcher in the ointment. if calling a game is as
important as it might be , 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away). take
a guess , folks i do n't think we can do any better than that.

my personal vote (excluding pitchers)

ventura , tettleton , anderson , martinez , henderson.

i'm a big frank thomas fan , but i have to admit to a bias in favor of
balanced offensive defensive contribution , which should have a higher
leverage in w l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with
negative defense.

for the record

carlos baerga 27 5 32
roberto alomar 35 2 33

forget it it 's a wash.

let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding
don mattingly 's defense this past season. don recovered brilliantly from his
weak '90 and '91 to end up with

mattingly 1 17 16 runs

which is clearly an above average first baseman. however , it 's still 18 runs
behind mark mcgwire , 26 runs behind frank thomas , and 7 runs behind john
olerud. on the other hand , it 's ahead of rafael palmeiro , cecil fielder , and
every other al first baseman not yet mentioned.

you want to speed up ballgames \?

1. enforce the two minutes between innings. as it is , many fields are
allowing three minutes between them. fifteen seconds before
tv commercials are gone to , thirty or so before action begins upon
the return to the game. two minutes , last out to first pitch , or
a ball is called.

2. do n't grant time to batters just because they want it. they may get
pissed at first , but they 'll get in line , once anything the pitcher
throws while they 're adjusting their wristbands is a strike.

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current
rule is too lenient) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more
than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball ,
and restart the clock.

baseball games take about 2 51 in the nl , and just a shade under 3 hours
in the al. that 's just too damn long. i do n't like to play in 3 hour
games , much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep , and
if i'm watching on tv , i 'll channel surf between pitches , catching
colorized versions of mr. ed , leave it to beaver , and those wacky
nieporents on nick at nite.

umpires are not required to call time out just because a player
asks for time. only in extreme cases , like dust in the pitcher 's
or hitter 's eyes , should an umpire call time.

the batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive
a pitch. i'm against putting a giant clock (or any size clock
for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and
the minute for warm ups. but i think umpires should tell hitters
to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever , and
instruct the pitcher to pitch. the same goes for pitchers. umps
should tell them to pitch or feint within 20 seconds or a ball
will be called. that 's the way it should be.

arocha broke his finger trying to field a ground ball.
he was put on the dl after the game and may require surgery.

the injury is to his fielding hand , which is good. unfortunately , he may
have some ligament damage and may require surgery , which would lay him up
for a while.

pitchers are required to pitch (or feint or attempt a pick off)
within 20 seconds after receiving the ball , not 15.

pitchers are required to pitch their warm up throws within a
one minute time frame , beginning after each half inning ends ,
not two minutes.

and the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm ups is
simple different mound , different catcher.

well , you 're absolutely , completely dead wrong , but thanks for playing.
as soon as i get to my office , i 'll be happy to post rickey and dave 's
career lines. both are very fine players , but henderson has
consistently
been better.

as for rickey 'slacking' due to his contract problems this year any
comments \? considering he 's basically picked up the entire team and put
them on his back , i think he deserves a little slack , and i think he
deserves a 4 year extension at 6m per year. quickly.





i was upset at people dissing winfield. henderson is the better player.
winfield can come close though. lets see what rickey does for the rest of
his career. people forget how good winny was in the 80 's , and also how
great rickey was.

winfield ca n't touch frank robinson or mel ott , as far as i can tell.
you 'd also have a hard time convincing me to rate him better than or
equal to clemente.

two sets of numbers career equivalent average and equivalent runs

1. ruth .377 , 2721
2. aaron .318 , 2808
3. ott .318 , 2197
4. robinson .313 , 2245

7. clemente .289 , 1745
8. winfield .288 , 1921

ruth is in a class by himself for both rate (eqa) and total (eqr)
performance , aaron runs over everybody in the total category. ott and
robinson , who lead winfield in both categories , could be safely put
ahead of ahead of him. reggie too , although he is barely ahead. these
numbers are normalized for league and park. clemente is held down by
some really anemic offensive production in his earliest years , and was
still productive when he died it is reasonably safe to assume he had
150 200 runs more he could have gotten. still , jackson , waner ,
clemente , and winfield form a pretty tight knot.


yes , but

(a) we were talking about peak level , not career averages
and
(b) clemente was the best fielding rf of all time , as far
as anyone can tell

i did a quick scan last night , looking for players with a peak comparable
to or better than winfield. in my quick n dirty subjective judgement , you
could make good cases for ruth , aaron , ott , robinson , clemente , kaline ,
maris , klein , jackson , waner , and probably a few others. this is not a
knock on winfield , but a comment on his consistency all of those other
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches , while winfield has
been more uniformly excellent. hall of fame \? absolutely. top 10 peak \?
i'm not so sure. top 10 total career value \? yes , almost certainly.

we cannot isolate completely , roger , but we can make a pretty good

measure who was better , robby alomar or carlos baerga , last year the
difference is too close to call. but larkin and lee \? clemens and
morris \? the differences are too great there.

in your measure of the game , why should a team that has just won it
all ever replace a single player \? since they are now clearly best ,
how can they do better \? yet every team can always find someplace where
they beleive they can improve the team they can always find a player

the best player is the one who does the most things to help his team

well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that
alfredo griffin could bring something to a team that that team needs
to win while larkin might not have that something the team needs \?
would griffin then be better than larkin \?


baseball is a team game , but it is made of individual talents. it is
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success
or failure of his teammates , whom he did not choose (at least in most
cases.) morris won last year because he played on a team with joe
carter , robby alomar , tom henke , juan guzman , john olerud , et al.
clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser performers as
herm winninham , luis rivera , and jeff reardon. to define the quality
of the team as a sum of its components (as i do , albeit imperfectly)
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the
mean quality of the team (as my reading of your arguments suggests you
do)

no , i am not trying to define the quality of an individual , at least not
for the purpose of ranking them. toronto won with olerud. they might
have won with fielder. they might not have won with thomas. detroit
might have won with thomas. chicago might have won with fielder. you
ca n't rank these individuals. you can only look at who might contribute
more to the team effort , which is winning the ws. thomas could not
have contributed to that goal any more than olerud so i cannot say that
olerud is less of a player.

consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho , to
have williams , a streaky hitter (and not really a clutch hitter) batting
4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the
giants.

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to
walk williams to get to bonds.


you 're definitely correct in that williams absolutely has to be sandwiched
in between clark and bonds. he must , and i mean must , get fastballs to
hit...otherwise he becomes little more than sixto lezcano in disguise.
what i would suggest is perhaps batting bonds , williams , and clark
3 4 5 , the reason being that i feel bonds' potential basestealing
abilities are wasted when he 's stuck behind two slow runners.
i think the chance of getting 20 30 extra stolen bases with bonds in the
3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having
clark in the 5 spot.

matt


williams does not like hitting cleanup ! !
secondly , bonds and clark (in that order) are a lot more productive with
runners in scoring position than matt i am streaky , free swinger williams.

another question , is derek lilliquist the main closer for the indians now

either of the players would be greatly appreciated. thank you for your
