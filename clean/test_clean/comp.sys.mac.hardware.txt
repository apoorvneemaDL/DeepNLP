i read in a recent tidbits(171 2 \? ) about the possibility of putting
a 68030 in a pb100. i am interested in doing so , but would like
to know more about it. does it involve just replacing the 68000 that
is on the daughterboard , or does it involve getting a new daughter
board. also , would the 68030 be able to run qt with the pb100 's
screen(not pretty i know , but possible \? ) and of course , what would
the damage be ( ). any info would be appreciated.
thanks in advance. jay fogel

this is the first part of the this faq. the second part is
posted to comp.sys.mac.system and features many questions about
system software. the third part is posted every two weeks in
comp.sys.mac.misc. tables of contents for those two pieces are
included above. please familiarize yourself with all three
sections of this document before posting.

all pieces are available for anonymous ftp from
rtfm.mit.edu (18.172.1.27) in the directory
pub usenet news.answers macintosh. except for this introductory
faq which appears in multiple newsgroups and is stored as
general faq.z , the name of each file has the format of the last
part of the group name followed by faq.z , e.g the faq for
comp.sys.mac.system is stored as system faq.z and the faq for
comp.sys.mac.misc is stored as misc faq.z. rtfm stores files as
compressed (.z) binary files. if you leave off the .z at the end
of the file name when getting the file , rtfm will automatically
decompress the file before sending it to you. you can also have
these files mailed to you by sending an e mail message to
mail server@rtfm.mit.edu with the line send
pub usenet news.answers macintosh name in the body text where
name is the name of the file you want as specified above (e.g.
general faq). you can also send this server a message with the
subject help for more detailed instructions.




i have a question... (1.0)


congratulations ! you 've come to the right place. usenet is
a wonderful resource for information ranging from basic questions
(how do i lock a floppy disk \? ) to queries that would make steve
jobs himself run screaming from the room in terror. (i used
resedit to remove resources init 11 , wdef 34 , and nvir 17 from my
system file and used the hex editor to add code string a67b45 as a
patch to the sfgetfile routine so the standard file dialog box
would be a nice shade of mauve. everything worked fine until i
installed supercdevblaster , and now when i use the aldus driver to
print from pagemaker 5.0d4 to a linotronic 6000 my system hangs.
p.s. i'm running system 6.0.2 on a powerbook 170.)

since the macintosh newsgroups are medium to high volume , we
ask that you first peruse this faq list including at least the
table of contents for the other pieces of it , check any other
relevant on line resources listed below in question 1.2 , especially
the faq lists for the other macintosh newsgroups , and rtfm (read
the friendly manual) before posting your question. we realize that
you are personally incensed that the system is taking up fourteen
of your newly installed twenty megs of ram , but this question has
already made its way around the world three hundred times before ,
and it 's developing tired feet. finally , before posting to any
newsgroup (macintosh or otherwise) , please familiarize yourself
with the basic etiquette of usenet as described in the newsgroup
news.announce.newusers.


how do i use this document \? where can i get it \? (1.1)

comp.sys.mac.faq is currently divided into multiple pieces ,
a general introduction which you 're reading now , and specific lists
for the newsgroups comp.sys.mac.system and comp.sys.mac.misc. faq
lists for comp.sys.mac.wanted , comp.sys.mac.apps and
comp.sys.mac.hardware are in development. when ready each part
will be available in its respective newsgroup. all pieces are
available via anonymous ftp from rtfm.mit.edu in the
pub usenet news.answers macintosh directory. except for this
document itself which is named general faq.z the pieces are named
as per the last part of the newsgroup they cover followed by
faq , e.g. system faq.z , misc faq.z. the .z means the file is
stored compressed so you 'll need to ftp it in binary mode and use
either maccompress , stuffit deluxe , or the unix uncompress command
to decompress it. however if you leave off the .z extension when
you get the file , rtfm will automatically decompress the file
before sending it to you.

this introductory document is posted to all of the concerned
newsgroups. the tables of contents for each of the specific faq
lists are at the beginning of this file so you should be able to
get at least some idea whether your question is answered anywhere
else in the faq even if you do n't have the other parts at hand.
it 's not always obvious , especially to newcomers , where a
particular question or comment should be posted. please
familiarize yourself with the faq lists in all the major macintosh
newsgroups before posting in any of them. which questions appear
in which faqs can serve as a basic guide to what posts belong
where.

to jump to a particular question search for
section number.question number enclosed in parentheses. for
example to find where can i ftp macintosh software \? search for
the string (2.1) . to jump to a section instead of a question
use a zero for the question number.


what other information is available \? (1.2)

comp.sys.mac.faq provides short answers to a number of
frequently asked questions appropriate for the usenet newsgroup
comp.sys.mac.misc and comp.sys.mac.system. four other files are
worthy of particular note daryl spitzer maintains a faq list
covering macintosh programming for the newsgroup
comp.sys.mac.programmer. it 's posted to that group weekly and
available for anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.uoregon (128.223.8.8) in
pub mac. eric rosen maintains a frequently asked questions list
for comp.sys.mac.comm available in that newsgroup and from
rascal.ics.utexas.edu in mac faq (where the file you 're reading now
is also irregularly archived). this list answers many frequently
asked questions about networking , unix and the mac ,
telecommunications , and foreign file formats. norm walsh has
compiled an excellent faq for comp.fonts that answers a lot of
questions about the various kinds of fonts and cross platform
conversion and printing. it 's available in comp.fonts or by ftp
from ibis.cs.umass.edu in pub norm comp.fonts faq . finally jim
jagielski maintains a faq for comp.unix.aux covering apple 's unix
environment , a ux. it 's posted every 2 to 3 weeks in comp.unix.aux
and news.answers. it 's available for anonymous ftp at
jagubox.gsfc.nasa.gov.


which newsgroup should i post to \? (1.3)

there are no stupid questions , but there are misplaced ones.
you would n't ask your english teacher how to do the definite
integral of ln x between zero and one , would you \? so do n't ask
the programmer newsgroup why your system is so slow when microsoft
word is in the background. ignorance of basic netiquette is not an
excuse. if you want people to help you , you need to learn their
ways of communicating.

posting questions to the proper newsgroup will fill your
mailbox with pearls of wisdom (and maybe a few rotten oysters too
) ). posting to the wrong newsgroup often engenders a thundering
silence. for instance the most common and glaring mispost , one
that seems as incongruous to dwellers in the macintosh regions of
usenet as would a purple elephant to aleuts in the arctic , asking a
question about networking anywhere except comp.sys.mac.comm ,
normally produces no useful responses. posting the same question
to comp.sys.mac.comm ensures that your post is read and considered
by dozens of experienced network administrators and not a few
network software designers.

please post to exactly one newsgroup. do not cross post.
if a question is n't important enough for you to take the extra
minute to figure out where it properly belongs , it 's not important
enough for several thousand people to spend their time reading.
for the same reason comp.sys.mac.misc should not be used as a
catch all newsgroup.

the breakdown of questions between different newsgroups in
this document can also serve as a reasonable guide to what belongs
where. specifically questions about productivity applications
(software you bought your macintosh to run , not software you bought
to make your macintosh run better) should go to comp.sys.mac.apps
unless the application is covered in a more specific newsgroup.
communications programs , games , hypercard , compilers and databases
all have more topical comp.sys.mac. newsgroups. post questions
about non communications hardware including questions about what
software is necessary to make particular hardware work to
comp.sys.mac.hardware. questions about macos system software
belong in comp.sys.mac.system. questions about utilities and
extensions normally belong in comp.sys.mac.misc. questions about
a ux go to comp.unix.aux. detailed questions about appletalk
belong in comp.protocols.appletalk.

direct questions about hypercard to comp.sys.mac.hypercard.
non hypercard programming questions and questions about development
environments should go to comp.sys.mac.programmer. resedit
questions may be posted either to comp.sys.mac.misc ,
comp.sys.mac.system , or comp.sys.mac.programmer but generally the
netters who inhabit the darker recesses of comp.sys.mac.programmer
are considerably more practiced at the art of resource hacking.

a general exception to the above rules is that any very
technical question about an application that actually begins to
delve into the how 's of a program as well as the what 's (recent
example how does writenow which is written entirely in assembly
compare to other word processors written in high level languages \? )
might be better addressed to the programmer newsgroup.

for sale and want to buy posts should go to
comp.sys.mac.wanted and misc.forsale.computers.mac only. we
understand that you 're desperate to sell your upgraded 128k mac to
get the for a powerbook 180 but trust me , anyone who wants to
buy it will be reading comp.sys.mac.wanted. political and
religious questions (the mac is better than windows ! is not ! is
too ! is not ! is too ! hey ! how 'bout the amiga ! what about it \? is
not ! is too ! ) belong in comp.sys.mac.advocacy. anything not
specifically mentioned above probably belongs in comp.sys.mac.misc.

finally do n't be so provincial as to consider only the
comp.sys.mac newsgroups the appropriate forums for your questions.
many questions about modems in comp.sys.mac.comm are much more
thoroughly discussed in comp.dcom.modems. questions about mac midi
are often better handled in comp.music even though it 's not a
macintosh specific newsgroup. shop around. usenet 's a big place
and not everything relevant to the macintosh happens in
comp.sys.mac.


4. someone just asked why the system was taking up sixteen of
their twenty megabytes of ram. shouldn't i put my brilliance and
wit on display for the world by posting the seventeenth response \?

no. frequent answers are just as boring and uninteresting as
frequent questions. unless you really have something new to add to
the traditional answers (such as the recent discovery that fonts in
system 7.1 could eat memory) private e mail is a much better medium
for answering common questions like this one.

you might want to add a mention of this faq in your e mail
response and a polite suggestion that your correspondent read it
before posting future questions. i do read all the newsgroups
covered here and have written a small script in microphone ii that
lets me send pwfaq 's (people with frequently asked questions) the
section of this document that answers their question with just the
click of a button so please do n't feel obligated to respond to
someone who cares so little about the answer to their question they
ca n't be troubled to read the faq list to get it.




ftp (2.0)


where can i ftp mac software \? (2.1)

the three major north american internet archives of shareware ,
freeware , and demo software are sumex aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) ,
mac.archive.umich.edu (141.211.165.41) , and wuarchive.wustl.edu
(128.252.135.4) which mirrors the other two sites and several
others. wuarchive often holds on to files after other sites remove
them for space concerns , and still has files that were deleted from
the formerly important site , rascal.ics.utexas.edu. rascal was
notable for storing its files in macbinary format rather than the
less efficient binhex format common at the other archives. unless
otherwise noted shareware and freeware mentioned in this document
should be available at the above sites.

to keep traffic on the internet manageable , scandinavians
should try connecting to ftp.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) , ftp.lth.se
(130.235.20.3) , or sics.se (192.16.123.90) instead. those in
the u.k. should look first at src.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.2.1).
continental europeans can try nic.switch.ch (130.59.1.40) ,
ezinfo.ethz.ch (129.132.2.72) , and anl.anl.fr(192.54.179.1).
australian users should try to find what they want at archie.au
(139.130.4.6) which mirrors info mac and mac.archive. japanese
users will find sumex mirrored at ftp.u tokyo.ac.jp
(130.69.254.254).

a fourth very important site is ftp.apple.com (130.43.2.3).
this is apple 's semi official repository for system software ,
developer tools , source code , technical notes , and other things
that come more or less straight from apple 's mouth. some material
at this site may not be distributed outside the u.s. or by other
sites that do n't have an official license to distribute apple
system software. please read the various readme documents
available at ftp.apple.com for the detailed info if you 're
connecting from outside the u.s. or if you wish to redistribute
material you find here.


can i get shareware by e mail \? (2.2)

the info mac archives at sumex aim are available by e mail from
listserv@ricevm1.bitnet (alternately listserv@ricevm1.rice.edu).
the listserver responds to the commands macarch help , macarch
index , and macarch get filename. mac archive files are available
from mac@mac.archive.umich.edu. send it a message containing the
words help and index (no quotes) on the first two lines of your
message for instructions on getting started and a list of the files
you may request. you can retrieve files from other sites by using
the server at ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com. for details send it a
message with just the text help (no quotes).


where can i find application x \? (2.3)

if you ca n't find what you 're looking for at one of the above
sites , try telnetting to your nearest archie server or sending it
an e mail message addressed to archie with the subject help.
archie servers are located at archie.rutgers.edu (128.6.18.15 ,
america) , archie.mcgill.ca (132.206.2.3 , the original archie server
in canada) , archie.au (139.130.4.6 , australia) , archie.funet.fi
(128.214.6.100 , scandinavia) , and archie.doc.ic.ac.uk (146.169.3.7 ,
the u.k. and the continent). these sites index the tens of
thousands of files available for anonymous ftp. login as archie
(no password is needed) and type prog filename to find what
you 're looking for or type help for more detailed instructions.
for instance you would type prog disinfectant to search for a
convenient ftp site for disinfectant. if the initial search fails
to turn up the file you want , try variations on and substrings of
the name. for instance if you did n't find disinfectant with prog
disinfectant , you might try prog disi instead. substring
searches often hide the gold in a pile of dross. to avoid many
erroneous matches add a . .hqx to the end of the substring , e.g.
prog disi. .hqx most mac software available on the net ends in
.hqx but almost no unix or pc software does.

please check the above archives and archie personally before
asking where you can find a particular piece of shareware. if you
follow the above advice , you should almost never have to ask the
net where to find a particular piece of software.


can someone mail me application x \? (2.4)

no. nor will anyone mail you a part of a file from
comp.binaries.mac that was corrupt or missed at your site. please
refer to the first questions in this section to find out about
anonymous ftp , archie , and automatic e mail servers.


what is .bin \? .hqx \? .cpt \? .etc \? (2.5)

most files available by ftp are modified twice to allow them to
more easily pass through foreign computer systems. first they 're
compressed to make them faster to download , and then they 're
translated to either a binhex (.hqx) or macbinary (.bin) format
that other computers can digest. (the macintosh uses a special
two fork filing system that chokes most other computers.) binhex
files are 7 bit ascii text files , while macbinary files are pure
8 bit binary data that must always be transferred using a binary
protocol.

how a file has been translated and compressed for
transmission is indicated by its suffix. normally a file will have
a name something like filename.xxx.yyy. .xxx indicates how it was
compressed and .yyy indicates how it was translated. to use a file
you 've ftp 'd and downloaded to your mac you 'll need to reverse the
process. most files you get from the net require a two step
decoding process. first change the binhex (.hqx) or macbinary
(.bin) file to a double clickable macintosh file then decompress
it. which programs decode which file types is covered in the table
below. also note that most macintosh telecommunications programs
will automatically convert macbinary files to regular macintosh
files as they are downloaded.


suffix .sit .cpt .hqx .bin .pit .z .image .dd .zip .uu .tar
extractors

stuffit 3.0 x x x x x
compact pro x x
packit x
uutool x
maccompress x
suntar x x x x
binhex 5.0 x
binhex 4.0 x
diskdoubler x x
unzip x
diskcopy x
macutil x x x x


a few notes on the decompressors

stuffit is a family of products that use several different
compression schemes. the freeware stuffit expander will unstuff
all of them. versions of stuffit earlier than 3.0 (stuffit 1.5.1 ,
stuffit classic , unstuffit , and stuffit deluxe 2.0 and 1.0) will
not unstuff the increasing number of files stuffed by stuffit 3.0.
you need to get a more recent version of stuffit or stuffit
expander.

stuffit 3.0.5 (lite and deluxe) consistently makes smaller
archives than any other macintosh compression utility. to allow
maximum space for files on the various ftp sites and to keep
net bandwidth down , please compress all files you send to anonymous
ftp sites with stuffit 3.0.5.

uutool , maccompress , and suntar handle the popular unix
formats of uuencode (.uu) , compress (.z) , and tar (.tar)
respectively. the unix versions are often more robust than the mac
products , so use them instead when that 's an option. translators
that allow stuffit lite to expand uuencoded and tar files are also
available by anonymous ftp.

macutil is dik winter 's package of unix utilities to
decompress and debinhex files on a workstation before downloading
them to a mac. since unix stores files differently than does the
mac , macutil creates macbinary (.bin) files which should be
automatically converted on download. it ca n't decompress
everything. in particular it ca n't decompress the new stuffit 3.0
archives. ( however , if you need only one or two files out of an
archive for instance if you want to read the readme to find out if
a program does what you need it to do before you download all of
it macutil is indispensable. it can be found at sumex aim in the
info mac unix directory.

a few notes on the compression formats

.bin these are macbinary files. always use a binary file
transfer protocol when transferring them , never ascii or text.
most files on the net are stored as .hqx instead. only rascal
stores most of its files in .bin format. most communications
programs such as zterm and mackermit are capable of translating
macbinary files on the fly as they download if they know in advance
they 'll be downloading macbinary files.

.image this format is normally used only for system software ,
so that on line users can download files that can easily be
converted into exact copies of the installer floppies. instead of
using diskcopy to restore the images to floppies , you can use steve
christensen 's freeware utility mountimage to treat the images on
your hard disk as actual floppies inserted in a floppy drive.
mountimage has a reputation for being buggy , so you should have
some blank floppies and a copy of diskcopy handy just in case.

.sea (.x , .x) .sea files do n't merit a position in the above
table because they 're self extracting. they may have been created
with compact pro , stuffit , or even diskdoubler but all should be
capable of decompressing themselves when double clicked. for some
unknown reason alysis has chosen not to use this industry standard
designation for self extracting archives created with their
payware products superdisk ! and more disk space. instead they
append either .x or .x to self extracting archives.


how can i get binhex \? stuffit \? etc. \? (2.6)

by far the easiest way to get these programs is to ask a human
being to copy them onto a floppy for you. if you 're at a
university there 's absolutely no excuse for not finding someone to
give you a copy and if you 're anywhere less remote than mcmurdo
sound , chances are very good that someone at a computer center ,
dealership , or user group can provide you with a copy of stuffit.
once you have stuffit (any version) you do n't need binhex.

if you 're such a computer geek that the thought of actually
asking a living , breathing human being instead of a computer
terminal for something turns you into a quivering mass of
protoplasmic jelly , you can probably download a working copy of
stuffit from a local bulletin board system.

if you have religious objections to software gotten by any
means other than anonymous ftp , then i suppose i 'll mention that
you can in fact ftp a working copy of stuffit though this is by
far the hardest way to get it. ftp to wuarchive.wustl.edu and
login. type the word binary. hit return. type cd
mirrors rascal.ics.utexas.edu compression and hit return. then
get stuffit expander 1.0.1 sea bin and hit return. of course
it 's always possible that by the time you read this stuffit
expander will have been updated and the name changed so if this
fails look for something similar. if you 've ftp 'd straight onto
your mac you should now have a self extracting archive which will
produce a working copy of stuffit expander when double clicked. if
you 've ftp 'd to your mainframe or unix account first , you still
need to use a modem program to download it to your mac. just make
sure that the mac is receiving in macbinary mode and the mainframe
is sending in binary mode. if you need more details on the last
step , consult the faq list for comp.sys.mac.comm and the manuals
for both your mainframe and macintosh telecommunications software.


how can i get binhex , stuffit , etc. from a pc \? (2.7)

you ca n't. there is absolutely no way to get an executable
macintosh file from an ftp site onto a pc and then onto your mac
without some software obtained by means other than anonymous ftp.
you must beg , borrow , or steal the necessary software such as
binhex or stuffit lite from another person. i realize this may
terrify those among you who have n't left your parents' basement
since you got an apple ii in 1980 , but eventually you 're going
to need to link up with some human being other than your mother.
(though i suppose if you 're this much of a nerd you could send
your mother out to get it for you.) while you 're gathering
your nerves for a venture into the strange and terrifying world
of daylight , please do n't bother the net by asking this question
again. there simply is no way to move executable macintosh
programs from a pc or other non macintosh computer onto a
mac without software that is not bundled with most macs.




troubleshooting what to do (before posting) when things go wrong (3.0)


while the various faq lists cover a lot of specific
problems , there are far more problems that are n't covered here.
these are a few basic techniques you should follow before asking
for help. you should probably also perform the ten step
preventative maintenance routine described in section four ,
especially rebuilding the desktop (4.3) and resizing the system
heap (4.5). following these steps may or may not solve your
problem , but it will at least make it easier for others to
recommend solutions to you.

identify the problem. (3.1)

microsoft word is crashing does n't say much. what were you
doing when it crashed \? can you repeat the actions that lead to the
crash \? the more information you provide about the actions
preceding the crash the more likely it is someone can help you.
the more precisely you 've identified the problem and the actions
preceding it (step 1) the easier it will be to tell if the
following steps fix the problem. for example , sometimes
quarkxpress 3.0 crashes with a coprocessor not installed error. is
not nearly as helpful as quarkxpress 3.0 crashes when i link two
text boxes on a master page when copies of those text boxes already
contain text. the former will leave you wondering whether the bug
remains after a given step. the latter lets you go right to the
problem and see if it 's still there or not.


read the read me file. (3.2)

many companies include a list of known incompatibilities and
bugs in their read me files. often these are n't documented in the
manual. read any read me files to see if any of the problems sound
familiar.


check for viruses. (3.3)

run disinfectant or another anti viral across your disk. virus
infections are rarer than most people think , but they do occur and
they do cause all sorts of weird problems when they do.


reinstall the application and all its support files. (3.4)

for half a dozen reasons (external magnetic fields ,
improperly written software , the alignment of the planets) a file
on a disk may not contain the data it 's supposed to contain. this
can cause all types of unexplained , unusual behavior. restoring
from original masters will normally fix this.


reinstall the system software. (3.5)

bits are even more likely to get twiddled in the system file
than in the application and the effects can be just as disastrous.
see question 4.6 for a detailed procedure for performing a clean
reinstall.

if the problem continues to occur after you 've taken these
steps , chances are you 've found either a conflict between your
application and some other software or a genuine bug in the
program. so it 's time to


isolate the problem. (3.6)

you need to find the minimal system on which the problem
will assert itself. here are the basic steps of isolating the
cause of a system or application crash

a. run only one application at a time. occasionally applications do
conflict with each other. if the problem does not manifest itself
without other applications running simultaneously , you can begin
launching other applications until you find the one that causes
the crash.

b. if you 're running system 6 , turn off multifinder. if you 're
running system 7 , allot as much memory to the application as you
can afford. sometimes programs just need more memory , especially
when performing complicated operations.

c. if you 're running system 7 , turn off virtual memory and 32 bit
addressing. there 's still an awful lot of system 7 hostile
software out there including some from companies that really
have no excuse. (can you say microsoft word 5.1 , boys and girls \?
i knew you could.) some of this software only expresses its
incompatibilities when certain uncommon actions are taken.

d. boot from a virgin system floppy. if the problem disappears
you likely have an init conflict. you need to progressively remove
extensions until the problem vanishes. use a little common sense
when choosing the first extensions to remove. if the problem occurs
when you try to open a file , remove any inits that mess with the
standard file open procedure such as super boomerang first. if the
problem remains after the obvious candidates have been eliminated ,
either remove the remaining extensions one at a time or , if you have
a lot of them , perform a binary search by removing half of the
extensions at a time. once the problem disappears add half of the
most recently removed set back. continue until you 've narrowed the
conflict down to one extension. when you think you 've found the
offending init restart with only that init enabled just to make
sure that it and it alone is indeed causing the problem.


contact technical support. (3.7)

by now you should have a very good idea of when , where , and why
the conflict occurs. if a tech support number is available for the
software , call it. if you 're lucky the company will have a work
around or fix available. if not , perhaps they 'll at least add the
bug to their database of problems to be fixed in the next release.




preventive maintenance (4.0)


you would n't drive your car 100 , 000 miles without giving it a
tune up. a computer is no different. regular tune ups avoid a lot
of problems. although there are mac mechanics who 'll be happy to
charge you 75 or more for the equivalent of an oil change , there 's
no reason you ca n't change it yourself. the following nine step
program should be performed about every three months.


trash unneeded files (4.1)

many of the operations that follow will run faster and more
smoothly the more free disk space there is to work with so spend a
little time cleaning up your hard disk. if you 're at all like me ,
you 'll find several megabytes worth of preferences files for
applications you no longer have , archives of software you 've
dearchived , shareware you tried out and did n't like , announcements
for events that have come and gone and many other files you no
longer need. if you 're running system 7 you may also have several
more megabytes in your trash can alone. throw them away and empty
the trash.


rethink your extensions (4.2)

some macintoshes attract inits like a new suit attracts rain.
seriously consider whether you actually need every extension
in your collection. if you do n't use the functionality of an
extension at least every fifth time you boot up , you 're probably
better off not storing it in your system folder where it only takes
up memory , destabilizes your system , and slows down every startup.
for instance if you only read pc disks once a month , there 's no
need to keep accesspc loaded all the time. cutting back on your
extension habit can really help avoid crashes.


rebuild the desktop (4.3)

the desktop file database holds all the information necessary
to associate each file with the application that created it. it
lets the system know what application should be launched when you
open a given file and what icons it should display where.
depending on its size each application has one or more
representatives in the desktop file. as applications and files
move on and off your hard disk , the desktop file can be become
bloated and corrupt. think of it as a congress for your mac.
every so often it 's necessary to throw the bums out and start with
a clean slate. fortunately it 's easier to rebuild the desktop than
to defeat an incumbent.

one warning rebuilding the desktop will erase all comments
you 've stored in the get info boxes. under system 7 maurice
volaski 's freeware init commentkeeper will retain those comments
across a rebuild. commentkeeper also works with system 6 but only
if apple 's desktop manager extension is also installed.

to rebuild the desktop restart your mac and , as your
extensions finish loading , depress the command and option keys.
you 'll be presented with a dialog box asking if you want to rebuild
the desktop and warning you that this could take a few minutes.
click ok. it will take more than a few minutes. the more files you
have the longer it will take. if you 're running system 6 you may
want to turn off multifinder before trying to rebuild the desktop.

if you 're experiencing definite problems and not just doing
preventive maintenance , you may want to use fifth generation 's
freeware init desktop reset. desktop reset completely deletes the
desktop file before rebuilding it , thus eliminating possibly
corrupt data structures.


zap the pram and reset the clock (4.4)

all macs from the original 128k thin mac to the quadra 950
contain a small amount of battery powered ram to hold certain
settings that properly move with the cpu rather than with the disk
such as which disk to boot from. unfortunately this parameter
ram can become corrupted and cause unexplained crashes. to reset
it under system 7 hold down the command , option , p , and r keys
while restarting your mac. under system 6 hold down the command ,
option , and shift keys while selecting the control panel from the
apple menu. click yes when asked if you want to zap the parameter
ram. since you 've erased almost all the settings in the general
control panel , you should now reset them to whatever you want.

the one setting that zapping the pram does not erase is the
date and time but since the internal clock in the macintosh is
notoriously inaccurate you 'll probably want to take this
opportunity to reset it anyway.


resize the system heap (4.5)

even after rethinking their extensions as per step two most
people still have at least half a row of icons march across the
bottom of their screen every time they restart. all these
extensions (and most applications too) need space in a section of
memory called the system heap. if the system heap is n't big enough
to comfortably accommodate all the programs that want a piece of
it , they all start playing king of the mountain on the system heap ,
knocking each other off to get bigger pieces for themselves and
trying to climb back on after they get knocked off. all this
fighting amongst the programs severely degrades system performance
and almost inevitably crashes the mac.

if you 're using system 7 , your macintosh will automatically
resize the system heap as necessary but if you 're running system 6
it 's important to set your system heap size large enough to manage
all your extensions and applications. by default this size is set
to 128k , way too small for most macs with any extensions at all.
the system heap size is stored in the normally non editable boot
blocks of every system disk. bill steinberg 's freeware utility
bootman not only lets you resize your system heap but even checks
how much memory your heap is already using so it can tell how much
needs to be allocated. if you 're running system 6 , get bootman ,
use it , and be amazed at how infrequently your macintosh crashes.


reinstall the system software (4.6)

system files can become corrupt and fragmented , especially if
you 've stored lots of fonts and desk accessories inside them.
merely updating the system software will often not fix system file
corruption. i recommend doing a clean reinstall. here 's how

1. boot from the installer floppy of your system disks.
2. copy any non standard fonts and desk accessories out
of your system file into a temporary suitcase.
3. trash the system file on your hard disk. also trash the
finder , multifinder , da handler , and all other standard apple
extensions like control panel and chooser. these will all be
replaced in the new installation. if you 're running or
installing system 7 , move everything in the extensions ,
control panels , and preferences folders into the top level
of the system folder.
4. rename the system folder. any name other than system folder
is fine.
5. double click the installer script on your system disk. then
choose customize... select the appropriate software for your
model mac and printer. you could do an easy install instead ,
but that will only add a lot of extensions and code you do n't
need that waste your memory and disk space.
6. once installation is finished , move everything from the
temporary folder you created in step 4 into the new system
folder. if you 're asked if you want to replace anything , you
forgot to take something out in step 3. you 'll need to replace
things individually until you find the duplicate piece.
7. reinstall any fonts or da 's you removed in step 2.
8. reboot. you should now have a clean , defragmented system file
that takes up less memory and disk space and a much more stable
system overall.


disk utilities (4.7)

much like system files hard disks have data structures that
occasionally become corrupted affecting performance and even
causing data loss. apple includes disk first aid , a simple utility
for detecting and repairing hard disk problems , with its system
disks. it 's also available for anonymous ftp from ftp.apple.com in
the directory dts mac sys.soft hdsc. even if you have an earlier
version , you should get the latest version (7.1) from ftp.apple.com
and run it on all your hard disks.

several companies have released payware disk utilities that
detect and repair considerably more problems than disk first aid
though , interestingly , none of them detect and repair everything
that disk first aid does. the three most effective for general
work are central point 's mactools deluxe 2.0 , fifth generation 's
public utilites , and symantec 's norton utilities for the macintosh
2.0. a department or work group should have all of these as well
as disk first aid since none of them fix everything the others do.
for individuals mactools ( 48 street) is about half the price of
norton ( 94 street) or public utilities ( 98 street) so , features
and ease of use being roughly equal , i recommend mactools.

all of these products occasionally encounter problems they
ca n't fix. when that happens it 's time to backup (4.7) and
reformat (4.9).


backing up (4.8)

this is one part of preventative maintenance that should be
done a lot more often than every three months. the simplest back
up is to merely copy all the files on your hard disk onto floppies
or other removable media. if you keep your data files separate
from your application and support files then it 's easy to only back
up those folders which change frequently. nonetheless every three
months you should do a complete backup of your hard disk.

a number of programs are available to make backing up
easier. apple included a very basic full backup application with
system 6. with the performas apple ships a new apple backup
utility that can backup the entire disk or just the system folder
onto floppies. the previously mentioned norton utilities for the
mac and mactools deluxe 2.0 include more powerful floppy backup
utilities that incorporate compression and incremental backups.

finally if you 're lucky enough to have a tape drive , network
server , or removable media device to use for backups , you should
check out the more powerful payware utilities redux ( 49 street ,
does n't support tape drives) and diskfit pro ( 74 street). there
are no freely available backup utilities other than the old hd
backup from system 6.


disk defragmentation (4.9)

as disks fill up it gets harder and harder to find enough free
space in the same place to write large files. therefore the
operating system will often split larger files into pieces to be
stored in different places on your hard disk. as files become more
and more fragmented performance can degrade. there are several
ways to defragment a hard disk.

the most tedious but cheapest method is to backup all your
files , erase the hard disk (and you might as well reformat while
you 're at it. see question 4.10.) , and restore all the files.

a number of payware utilities including norton utilities for
the mac and mac tools deluxe can defragment a disk in place , i.e.
without erasing it. although the ads for all these products brag
about their safety , once you 've bought the software and opened the
shrink wrap they all warn you to back up your disk before
defragmenting it in case something does go wrong. there are no
freeware or shareware disk defragmenters so please do n't annoy the
net by asking for one.


reformat your hard disk (4.10)

just as a floppy disk needs to be initialized before use , so a
hard disk must be formatted before it can hold data. you do n't
need to reformat every three months but when your system is
crashing no matter what you try , reformatting is the ultimate means
of wiping the slate clean. reformatting your hard disk may even
gain you a few extra megabytes of space. not all hard disks are
created equal. some can hold more data than others. to facilitate
mass production and advertising without a lot of asterisks ( 81.3
megabytes is the average formatted capacity. your mileage may
vary.) apple often formats drives to the lowest common denominator
of drive capacity. when you reformat there 's no reason at all not
to reclaim whatever unused space apple 's left on your disk.

unlike floppies hard disks need a special program to
initialize them. most hard disks come with formatting software.
apple 's disks and system software ship with hd sc setup , a minimal
disk formatter which will format apple brand hard drives only.
most other manufacturers ship appropriate formatting software with
their hard drives. normally this will be all you need to reformat
your hard disk.

a number of general purpose formatters are also available
which go beyond the bundled software to include features like
encryption , password protection , multiple partitioning , faster disk
access , system 7 compatibility , and even compression. two of the
best are the payware drive7 and hard disk toolkit personal edition
( 49 street for either). while there are one or two freeware
formatters available , none are likely to be superior to the ones
bundled with your hard disk.

powerbook users should be sure to turn off sleep and
processor cycling before reformatting their hard drives no matter
what software they use. otherwise disk corruption , crashes , and
data losses are a very good possibility.

subject re good aps experience
organization school of engineering and applied sciences , ucla
lines 31

i thought i 'd share a good experience , too. i bought the aps quantum 240 zero
footprint drive in may '92 (back when they still used two separate leds on the
front panel and the case was metal). while traveling with it (it was in my
se 30 mac bag , on top of the mac) this past winter , one of the plastic tabs
holding the front panel on broke , so that the right side of the front panel
was coming forward away from the rest of the drive. i lived with this situation
until it became completely intolerable (which more or less coincided with a
network shutdown at school and a trip out of town i had to take , which gave me
some dead time during which to have the drive sent out).

i called aps for an rma and got one , with no questions asked about how the
tab got broken (it was handled a little roughly by airline baggage handlers
though nothing else was damaged well , except for the internal speaker in my
modem , which was n't that well glued down to begin with yeah , yeah , i'm
never flying with my se 30 again). and when i called back to ask whether i
could send it in a little later rather than right away , they had no problem
with that even when i exceeded the normal valid period for an rma by a
day (they 're usually good for 10 days). the front panel was replaced under
warranty , and the drive was shipped back quickly (i mailed it first class
insured on a saturday by noon from l.a. to missouri , and it came back by fed
ex by friday i do n't know exactly what day it came back because i was
traveling that week from wednesday afternoon to sunday afternoon ).

the only thing that could 've been bad was that the first service rep i talked
to , in an attempt to prevent jeopardizing my data , suggested that i take the
drive mechanism out and send just the case. unfortunately , i discovered the
day i was mailing the thing , that would necessitate breaking the little
seal and thus voiding the warranty ! oh , well.

writes
enter game developers. the sound driver and current sound manager are
inconveniently lame for making games.

the sound driver is pretty ok , since it 's fast. sound manager used by the
book is useless . disposing of sound channels as soon as sound has
completed
is out of the question for games with smooth animation. (it 's too slow.)

why would you dispose a channel if you are going to play more
sounds soon \? if you are trying to write a game , you should n't
be using sndplay. instead , make a channel and use buffercmds
to play sounds on it. it works great. you can add callbacks to
the channel also to let you know when the channel is getting
empty. before it gets empty.


the sound driver is so much snappier than sound manager. unfortunately ,
system 7 supports it poorly , making programs crash occasionally.

the moral of the story is to developers don't cheat !

well , i want my code to work on old systems too. i do n't know about sys
7.1 ,
but at least on 6.0.7 , there are bugs in the sound manager that causes
channels to hang (with no error message). this happends when i keep a
channel open for long periods necessary for performance and play many
sounds , stopping sounds halfway. callbacks seems not to be reliable.
then only way i can safely tell if a sound has stopped playing is to
inspect private variables in the channel (qhead , i think it was) , and the
only way i have found to tell if a channel is hung is to inspect an
undocumented flag and modify it.

callbacks are very reliable , i found them 100 reliable , even
under system 4.1. i was doing continuous background sound with
interrupting sound effects on system 6.0 with the im v
documentation.

you probably were cancelling your callback commands out of
your channels , of course you did n't get called. in general , if
you have problems with sounds working when you play one per
channel and then close the channel (with the related
slowdown) , but then when you play more than one you do n't
work , then you are adding more than one synthesizer to a
channel , possibly the same one multiple times. this might be
because you are calling sndplay on a preexisting channel with
a sound resource which adds the sampled sound synthesizer to
the channel first thing before it plays. most sampled sounds
have this command at the start of them. you need to resedit
the sound and remove that command , then when you create your
channel , specify the sampled sound synthesizer to be the
channel 's synth. then you can use asynch sndplay 's all you
want. you 'll probably want to switch to buffercmd 's , since you
are going to have to use snddocommand anyway to add callbacks.

now before you go ahead and tell me i am full of it , and the
sound manager does n't work for games , remember , spectre uses
it. and it works great. if spectre can spare the cpu time , you
can too.

one little disclaimer there are some out there who say the
sound manager in the iisi ca n't be made to work right. i'm not
sure either way , but i know for sure that you can make your
sounds work 100 correctly on every other machine using the
sound manager.

research has shown that the majority of the time that the united
states' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on , they are not
actively being used. in addition , 30 to 40 percent are left running
at night and on weekends.

computer equipment is now the fastest growing private sector use
of electricity. computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption , and may account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

if you are one of those who leave them on after you 're done , it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just turn it off
when you 're not using it. it only takes a second or two to do.

also , the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself , but by the monitor. if you ca n't turn the
computer off , then please just turn off the monitor.

the u.s. environmental protection agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy
efficient pcs that power down automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation. these
new computers will save enough electricity to power both vermont and
new hampshire and save up to 1 billion u.s. dollars in annual
electricity bills. look for the special epa energy star logo when
you buy computers. they should be available in one to two years.

according to the epa studies , the energy saved will prevent co2
emissions of 20 million tons annually , the equivalent of five million
automobiles. also , 140 , 000 tons of so2 and 75 , 000 tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved these are the major pollutants

i am looking at a new lc iii and a used iici. prices

the iici has much greater potential for expansion , a la nubus and
greater memory capacity.

how important is this \? how many nubus cards do you have plan to
acquire \? how much memory do you really need \? i 've got a ci , and
20mb of ram. that 's plenty. i also have a 24bit graphics card
on the nubus i'm a sucker for pretty pictures...i think the
lciii can have a bootable ramdisk in memory , which a ci can
not have. at least , not out of the box.

the lc iii would be new , under warranty , newer roms (is the iici
32 bit clean \? ) , and would have sound input. i also like the
pizza box case.

the ci is 32 bit clean. i solved the sound input problem with
a macrecorder. but that 's gotten to be a fairly expensive
solution now that macromind owns macrecorder.

performance wise , i have read that they are almost identical , the
lc iii being a little slower.

the actual difference is probably not worth worrying over.

so , which should i get \?

depends on the price you can get the ci for. educationally speaking ,
the 4 80 \? lciii here at fsu can be had at just under 1300. add
in roughly 500 for a monitor. last i 'd heard , an 8mb lciii simm
went for 250.

i think you 're in a win win situation. no matter what you decide ,
you 'll most likely be happy with it.

well the monitor is consistently the largest power drain on your
electric bill when you are looking at your computer set up , especially
if you have a large (16 or greater) color monitor. generally what i do
is leave my mac on all the time , except for the occasional resart or
syetem crash , but i turn my monitor off each night before i leave my
office. i also turn off after dark when i do this , since there is no
reason to have the screen saver running when there is no picture being
displyed on the monitor 's tube.

actually , i thought macs were suppoused to be restarted once a day.

really \? what makes you think this \? the q700 file server in my office
has been on for the last 2 months , straight , and it has n't had any
problems. (note i also keep the monitor for the file server turned off

the most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a
greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than
the smaller one. if your running the drive on a mac i would recommend a
shareware utility called timedrive which tests seek , scsi throughput and
rotational speed. this utility should let you know what the differences are
between the drives.

larger drives tend to have multipule platters which can allow adjacent
bits to be read in parallel resulting in higher throughput. they also
have higher spindle speeds which leads to both increased throughput and
reduced seek times (due to reduction of rotational latency.)

my friend recently purchased a lc iii and he wants to know if there is

the lc family of macs can only
use pds cards. they are not able to use nubus.

ah , but why \? can some technically hip macslinger tell us what the
difference is between pds and nubus \?

is it impossible to make a gadget that plugs into pds and ends in a
nubus card cage \? at least , marvin 's friend has not been able to
locate one and neither have i. what is the fundamental reason for
this \?

i think that there do exist nubus expansion cages (i'm sure i 've seen
them advertised occassionally) , but i think that the main problem is that
they cost much more than the difference in price between say a lc and iivx
so unless you need lots of nubus slots its not worth the bother.

(of course , it may be that these extra boxes are so expensive because
no one buys them because they are so expensive...)

nubus technology is n't a special apple proprietry thing (i have this
sneaky feeling that it is licensed from texas instruments \? \? \? ) so there
is no problem building an expansion box.

apple uses the ieee nubus 90 standard for their 32 bit backplane bus.
(i got this from a technote that i reada couple of weeks ago)

well , almost nubus 90 anyway , comprehensive bus contention between processors
is not supported in the current macintoshes , could be wrong \?

however , i know for a fact from seeing the cyclone data spec sheets myself ,
do n't ask , macintosh cyclone models will provide full implementation of the
nubus standard.

very interesting possibilities indeed !

i'm currently trying to select which magneto optical drive to purchase. i'm
primarily looking at 128mb drives , although i might consider 256mb ones.

when looking through macworld and macuser ads , the prices for the 128mb drives
seem to range from just under 1000 (for the dgr 128rem portable , magic 128mb
portable fujitsu , or nudesign 128mb from macdirect) to about 1600 (for the
fwb hammerdisk 130 and mass microsystems datapak mo 128). different drives
use different mechanisms most , fujitsu , sony , epson , probably some others.

my problem is that after reading the nov 92 macworld and apr 93 macuser
reviews of these drives , i'm still not sure what to get. so , i'm asking
if anyone has had good bad experiences with any 128mb m o drive or can shed
some light on the wide range of prices (is spending more really buying me
much \? ) , reliability of different drives , compatibility between them , or
anything else i should probably know.

thanks.

hi , there !
i have a mac lc and consider buying cd300. i 've been told ,
however , that
1. the double speed of cd300 is achievable only on machines
with scsi 2.
2. the double speed is a prerequisite for photocd multisession
capability , which i need.
3. which means i seem to gain nothing compared with , say cd150.

any comments \?
thanx.


your source is wrong. the double speed cd300 is still slow compared to a
typical hard disk. the lc can easily handle the scsi transfer rate of the
cd300. none of the current macs , even the quadras , support scsi 2 unless
you get a scsi 2 nubus card.

you do n't have to have double speed to use photocd. it 's just faster
reading images off of a disk. i think that the cd150 can handle photocd ,
but only single session. the cd300 can do multisession photocd.

there has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement. true ,
there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage , but
the internal power supply is well protected. (i 've turned my mac on and off
six or seven times a day for three years without problem). the monitor is
the same. to leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity twice as much
as a television , possibly more.

the computer itself uses far less electricity than a tv.
monitor depends on the size ).

but one thing not to do is use a self shutdown or power shutdown
iron appliance on the same electric line.

they do not persist each is visible for perhaps one refresh , and then

answer appeared on the net. what is the good oil on connecting the apple
extended keyboard to a powerbook \? the earlier questioner wonderd if this would
be too much of a load for the pb and as i want to connect just such a beast i
am curious.

i have n't got a pb yet so i ca n't rtfm but i assume that a standard keyboard
with a mouse would be ok as the spec sheet i read mentioned connecting an
external keyboard. but is the extended plus mouse pushing it \?

any help gratefully recieved. i will summarise to the net if necessary.

thanks , john collins.

p.s. i am thinking of a pb160 but i assume that this would apply to all pb 's.

repost due to net problems

hi ,
i have problems with the fdhd on a iicx that ekg reports is rom
revision 376. i had reports that this mac was having trouble
formatting disks and by the time i got to it , the fdhd just would
not respond although all other functions were fine.

i checked the voltages on the db19 external drive connector and pin
6 showed no volts with 7 and 8 giving 25volts unloaded. the power
supply is an astec and i sent it away for repair.

with the power supply reinstalled , i now get the following error

with the internal fdhd connected , the mac boots fine but on completion
of boot cycle an alert displays the disk is unreadable do you
want to eject it \? . for every combination of response , the alert
reappears within approx 2 seconds and this error is continuous. the
fdhd does spin but there is no head seeking and the fdhd is incapable
of ejecting the disk. this error sequence occurs regardless of whether
there is a floppy in the drive or not. pin 6 on the db19 external
connector shows 1.2v , pins 7 and 8 show 10.75v.

with the internal fdhd disconnected , the mac boots fine and works great
(macekg reports no errors). the db19 external connector now shows
no voltage on pin 6 but pins 7 and 8 show 10.75v.

now , the internal fdhd may be fubar , but i have an apple 800k external
drive that gives exactly the same symptoms as the internal drive when
connected to either the external db19 or the internal connector at j16
(after suitable surgery to the external drive). the voltages at j16
(with the internal fdhd disconnected) are as follows

2. the double speed is a prerequisite for photocd multisession

this is also false. what you need for multisession capability is
multisession capability which is based on the firmware and

not seen a multisession capable drive that is n't double speed.

3. which means i seem to gain nothing compared with , say cd150.

the above (1 2) , proves 3 to be false.

any comments \?

the apple cd300 is an excellent double speed multi session photocd
capable drive. so are drives based on the slightly faster toshiba
xm3401. some companies selling such drives are spin peripherals (a
bargain at 499) and pli (a company i hate) and relax technologies
(a company i know little about other than that they are a longtime
player in mac mailorder , which is usually a good sign). the nec
cdr74 is also a good choice (nec 's own mechanism , i think). clubmac
sells it for around 619.

thanx.

your welcome , ooh but now i see your from germany. most of the
mailorder info does you little good , i guess. if not
spin peripherals 800 466 1200
club mac 800 258 2622
relax tech 510 471 6112

nothing wrong with the apple , though , which is based on a sony
mechanism and speed identical to the nec. the toshiba 's speed
advantage is very slight 20 in average access time (a minor plus)
and 10 in data transfer rate (a slightly more important plus).

good luck ,

having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes. at
least for the 600x400 configuration. you can get an adaptor called mac
vga q from james engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you
display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable. i think the
800x600 requires 56khz horizontal sync. i use this on my sony 1604.
(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.

hope it helps

a rep at the dealer (actually it 's a university order center , so

they have been having lots of problems with their centris 610.
he did n't go into details , but mentioned problems with the
floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.
it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
and software compatibility problems with the machine.

he 's not recommending the centris 610 to anybody he says to
consider a centris 650 or a iivx. (why he would recommend a
iivx over an lciii i do n't know , but that 's what he said.)

so , what does the net think \? did the dealer just get one flaky
machine , or did apple send the c610 out the door too early \?
is your c610 working just great , or is it buggy too \?

jay scott

sounds to me like your dealer really wants to get rid of the iivx 's he has in
stock. i can imaging that they are getting hard to sell , given that
1. a c610 is way faster , and is comparable in price.
2. an lciii is about the same speed , and is way cheaper.
so your dealer may well be trying as hard as he can to convince people
that iivx 's are a much better buy than a c610 just so he can get rid of all
his old stock !

no disrespect to dealers or the iivx intended !

summary sync problems on multiple boards
nntp posting host merlin.cvs.rochester.edu
organization university of rochester , rochester ny
lines 61

we are having a problem with a quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of
techs sent to us by the vendor , as well as us )
this quadra is 'stuffed' with 64mb ram , 2mb vram and some large disk (400mb
i think). what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. it is quite apparent that the
mac cpu is still ok , and the problem really seems to lie with the video
circuitry , since you can still save your documents , quit your aplpications ,
even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy , so it 's
pretty hard to hit menu items )
we had the original logic board replaced twice now , and the same problem
has been occurring on all boards although the inteval between occurrences has
varied. the first board had this problem every about 1hr , more often if the
cache was turned off (yes off). this is the only symptom that is not
obviously related to the video circuitry (after all the cache is on the cpu
right \? ). the second board had the problem every about 10 minutes (we did
not keep it , rather we put the original back) , the current board we have
has this problem a lot less often (has gone about a week without doing it ,
but did it twice within an hour yesterday).
the technicians that have come out to try to figure it out seemed pretty
sharp and tried a number of sensible things (most of which we had
previously tried ourselves anyway). these included
swapping the ram
swapping the vram
swapping monitors (3 different 13 apple rgb and 2 16 apple rgb)
swapping cables
disconnecting hd and booting from floppy
sacrificing various small mammals
here are some other facts
when we put a rasterops procolor 32 on the nubus , the problem is fixed
(it does not occur with the internal video or the procolor video out)
the vendor cannot reproduce the problem back in their shop on the boards
that exhibit it in our lab
apple is said to be getting a little bit pissed off at shipping us boards
that they cannot find anything wrong with , and getting them shipped back as
faulty according to us.
here are some speculations
i bet that neither apple nor the vendor has tested these boards with that
much ram and vram on them simultaneaously , which may have something to do
with their finding it hard to reproduce the problem (though we can
reproduce it with just 4mb of ram , so this is probably a red herring).
the vendor 's representative blames 'metal in your walls' claims that our
walls have metal in them which interferes with the mac 's operation. we
have another 950 in the lab which works like a charm (though it 's not in
the exact same spot....) please do n't tell me this is probably it , i do
not want to believe it.
it 's probably not poltergeists , since they do not have badges to get past
security at the entrance to our site.

has anyone any ideas \? please \? please email as well as posting cause i seem
to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less
time available to read news ! )

no , multisession capability and double speed are two different thing. its just
that the newer cd rom drives have both capability. multisession means that

cd150 is not multisession capable. this means that you lose the ability to add

cd150 is not a double speed drive , it will require twice as long to transfer

my mac iisi runs a radius pivot le monitor , with the pds card.

as i wanted to try to switch to 32 bit adressing , i could n't startup my mac
anymore.

1. what is the trick to zap the pram (so i wo n't have to take out the
battery next time)

2. is there any trick that could allow me to switch to 32bit \?

3. what does 32bit adressing bring to me as an user \? faster work \?

4. any chance to have more than 8mb of adressable memory with 24bit
adressing \?

thank you a lot for your answers (via mail or reply)

i have the logitech hand scanner for the mac. it uses a scsi
interface box that the standard scanner unit plugs into. i
have tried my friend 's ibm hand scanner with the scsi box and
it works. see if you can get logitech to sell you the scsi
box by itself. warning most of the cost of mac handscanners
is contained in the scsi interface box , so it could run up
to around 200. when i upgraded my old style scanner to
the new gray scale model , it cost 75 they just gave me a new
scan head and software the box was the same. the gray scale
scanner interface runs about 300 making it around 200 for

a similar reason is why people at work , used to seeing sco unix running

this is why you need a gargantuan processor to run windows. the basic

actually , the 295 is for the 33 mhz powercard , not the universal powercache.
the 33 mhz universal powercache with fpu and adaptor can be had for about
500 (still not a bad deal). i believe the powercard is one generation
older than the universal powercache , and the one primary difference is that
the powercard is machine specific while the powercache can fit into many
macs with the proper adaptor. both cards are 68030 based.

i'm not sure if the hardware or software with the powercard is otherwise
different from the powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me \? ).

i would also add that i called river computer the other night and these

stop cheating on sound !
really soon , you will be sorry , as even those without external speakers

the sound manager is understandable now , and works pretty well and will
work
even better soon , so use it.

do n't be silly.

using the sound manager on a quadra is very well , but using sm on
any of the low end machines does n't simply work for a decent action
game since it just steals too much time from the cpu. this is
a fact. by writing directly to the hardware on an se , it is
possible to have 4 simultaneous channels of sampled sound (11khz) for
a cost of approx. 8000 cycles. exactly how would you do that using
the sm , pray tell \?

the correct thing to do is to use the sm on the machines that can
carry that extra load using the sm means , and to write directly
to the sound hardware on the machines that ca n't. it 's not the
politically correct thing , but from the developers' point of
view it is.

hi
do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory
architecture apple uses in the powerbook duos \? or in the powerbook
in general \?

what are the factors that make the duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop
machine running the same processor at the same speed (25mhz 68030) \? how
many wait states are in the memory system , etc \? what kind of a data
bus does it use \? 32 bit or 16 bit \?


huh \? where did you get this idea from \? i think you got this
backwards. the duo 's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by 5 10 (and the rest of the powerboks). i think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5
cycles i believe). things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the fpu (which the duo
does n't have undocked). extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too. real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running , what kind of screen
depth you are running etc.

espen

ps ! the duo is 32 bit through out.


thanks for the enlightening post. is there a technical note on this \?

the desktop machine i was referring to was actually not a mac ,
but rather , any of various workstations that use the
68030@25mhz , such as old suns or old nexts. i used to own a next
68030 cube.

but i will try rebooting without extensions to see what kind of
a speed difference i get with my powerbook duo. i did notice an
extreme slowdown to unusability with a mac plus after
installing system 7 on it. why does the os suck up so much cpu
power \?

also , you 're right software does make a huge difference. i
have the misfortune of using ms works on my duo. when editing
relatively small (40k) files , cut or copy takes several
seconds , often more than 6 seconds ! ! this happens with power
cycling turned off. as usual , ms software is maggot infested
feces.
i'm getting nisus to replace it for my text editing.

cam ,

several months ago i bought a 4 40 pb100 with external floppy , appletalk
remote access , a kensington case and ac adapter with complete documentation
and in almost new condition , used for us 900. i considered it a very good
buy and am very cosy with my little baby now... )

put me down for a pb100 4 20 with ext. floppy , appletalk remote acces ,
ac adapter , and fresh out of box (was used , but buyer switched to 140
on arrival and sold unopened box. purchased last october for 925.
later i bought a used powerport v.32 9600 bps internal fax modem for
something like 225 , i'm using right now ! works great ! )

no real complaints. i love my portable system (got a color home setup
also. mac ii). reasoning was that matlab programs at school and other
simulations of dynamic control systems sometimes took hours (or
overnight) to run , tying up my mac ii. i got the pb100 with fast modem
to do light work and on the run stuff. i figured i 'd give it to my
little sister next year when she goes to college. it 's running system
7.1 now without any problems. also i sometimes do dec4015 terminal
emulations with matlab on our university 's vax vms (nice thing that it
benchmarks itself as an average of 230 times faster than a mac iifx).
so , the pb100 just does graphical output and terminal emulation (not
too hard at all for it). it was a fabulous setup ! ! ! ! ) weeee ! ! !

(by the way , all matlab software was on class accounts. i was also the
ta for a class that used simulab simulink. we had site license and
take home , then destroy later site release licenses... no pirating
there , incase you 're wondering.... great program ! ! ! )

just like to add , whatever future system you get , you can almost never
get enuff memory.... buy it while it 's cheap that is buy it when you
get the computer since it 's usually cheaper than upgrading... i always
run out of disk space... but i have a syquest on the mac iisi , so i
never worried about space before... got several carts).

you should n't have ignored the zyxel. it can be purchased with a mac
bundle , which includes a hardware handshaking cable and faxstf software.
the bundle adds between 35 and 60 to the price of the modem , depending
on the supplier. it is true that the modem has no mac specific docs ,
but it does n't require much 'tweaking' (aside from setting d0 in the
init string , to enable hardware handshaking).

for more information on the zyxel , including sources , look at various files

the performas are made to be low cost business solutions. the 4xx have

because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper

as far as the monitors go , buy 3rd party. much cheaper.

regular price is 199.

no idea if this is still going on , but i can get the phone no. if anyone is
interested (i found their ad in macuser).


can some people with cache cards please post speedometer numbers they get
with the cards. i have only one report , which seems to indicate that
a 32k cache card gives you only about a 1 speedup ! ! access to memory takes
longer when you have a cache card(and get a miss) thus a small cache card
of 32k may be worth 0. i do n't know what kind of numbers 64k cards get
you. also i found it interesting that you can disable the cache cards
via software(read about it in the mac iisi tech notes from ftp.apple.com)

so is 99 a good deal or not , i still do n't know.
i would say that is not a good deal. in june 's macworld , river

besides the faster processor , the 950 has scsi 2 , and as far as i know ,
faster i o due to separate processors handling those functions.

mostly. the q950 does have a scsi2 controller chip as it 's scsi
chip , but it does not have the chips to use the wide or fast scsi 2
modes and therefore does n't offer much more in the way of scsi
performance over the q900. it does , howrever , have a faster i o

choi@gsbsrc.uchicago.edu (dongseok choi) writes

i understand that if i have a correct adapter then i can
use a vga monitor with my iisi.
are those adapters working with specific brands \?
is adapter for nec or sony working with other brands \?
i will be using a vga monitor with iisi for a month soon.
i do n't have any clue what monitor will be.

here 's the story

(1) the iisi cannot supply a vga output. however...

(2) some vga type monitors can adequately deal with the video signal
the mac uses to drive the apple 13 or 14 inch high resolution color
display i.e. , apple 's own 640x480 mode.

so , if you wish to hook one of these monitors up to your iisi , you
need (a) an adapter that converts from the mac db 15 connector to the
vga style high density db 15 connector , but tells the mac to use
it 's own 640x480 mode , not the vga 640x480 mode , and (b) a vga monitor
that can deal with the higher bandwidth of the mac 640x480 mode over
the vga 640x480 mode (which as i stated in (1) above , the iisi cannot
produce).

as far as (a) above is concerned , contact

james engineering , inc.
6329 fairmount ave.
el cerrito , ca 94530
510 525 7350
fax 510 525 5740

they can probably get you the right adapter. remember you do not
want the run of the mill mac to vga adapter , because it will try to
have your iisi produce the vga mode , which it cannot (the computer
will just fail to produce any video signal at all). instead , you want
an adapter that connects between the mac style and vga style
connectors , but tells the mac to use the apple 640x480 mode. sorry
for the poor terminology available for describing this distinction.

as far as (b) is concerned , make sure to get a monitor that can deal
with a horizontal bandwidth of 35 khz and a vertical retrace rate of
67 hz. these are the spec 's of apple 's 640x480 mode. for comparison ,
the vga standard 640x480 mode uses a 31.5 khz horizontal bandwidth and
a 60 hz. vertical retrace rate.

the monitor will probably need to have auto synch'ing capability , as
the apple mode you 'll be using is n't one of the set of standard modes
in the pc compatible world.

good luck !

i need to add to your message.
i have a major problem on my hands. i have a rodime 60 (series
ro3000t) external hard drive. rodime is out of business ,
and not writing any more drivers. in particular , drivers
compatable with system 7.1. after talking to rodime ,
they recommended the following hard drive manufacturers
and their driver software that were compatable

scsi hard drive manufacturer driver software

fwb hard disk tool kit
fwb hard disk tool kit personal
la cie silverlining 5.2 or higher
casa blanca driver software drive7

if anybody has experience with these driver software packages , please reply.
if there is shareware out there , i would like to get my hands on it. i would
much rather send a good developer the 25 or so , because most of the software
i mentioned , if purchased , would cost 125 , 49 , 149 , and 49 respectively.

thanks in advance.

organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering
lines 31

well ,

you can always try and find a pc dealer who sells guaranteed memory.
i work at a company growing at 40 a year , we have on order hundreds
of computers per year. it never fails , machines come in with bad simms.
now for those of you who are wondering just why your pc or mac just crashed
i can tell you i always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or
designed the software.
well , i do n't think that way anymore , especially with the results i
have gotten with replacing bad simms in my own machine and others at work.
the moral to this story is to make sure your memory is good. i would
be willing to bet lots of you out there have simms with either soft
or hard errors on them and you do n't even know about it , but every once
in awhile those bad simms just makes your life hell.

i just got plain sick of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine
just crashed and they lost thier work. in case your wondering , or if you
have n't already guessed i work in an is department. service is a do or die
perogative in this line of work , so the moral is have your memory tested
with a simm hardware tester...and no i do n't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine. simms are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

if any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap , write me back. they make life a little bit easier , and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity
people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.

btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving

with the power switch on front. there was some indication that
monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
lots of power cycling. this may only apply to the monitors we use , but
might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back.

i'm not an expert , but having spent much too much of my life looking for
the power switch , or the brightness control , or the de gauss , etc. , etc. ,

controls switches knobs whatever in places where they are hard to reach is
because the designers put them there deliberately.

the real question is weather this is because of stupidity , or

is there an extension cord type cable i can buy which allows me to plug
my existing power cord into and then plug this extension cable into my

there are two approaches

1. if your power cord is the kind that detaches from the back of the
monitor (most common) you can get a replacement power cord that will go
from the monitor to the back of the computer.

2. you can get an adpater that connects to the plug end of the existing
power cord and provides the proper end that plugs into the back of the
computer.

both cost about the same (aprox. 5) and are available from many computer
stores (clone dealers are usually better at having these things and at
good prices). power cords are standard , so you do n't have to go looking
for some special thing at a mac store.

depends on the price you can get the ci for. educationally speaking ,
the 4 80 \? lciii here at fsu can be had at just under 1300. add
in roughly 500 for a monitor. last i 'd heard , an 8mb lciii simm
went for 250.

i think you 're in a win win situation. no matter what you decide ,
you 'll most likely be happy with it.

james

yes , and one thing to think about is the pricing on the 160m harddrive
configuration. when i got my lowly classic ii , the options were 40 or 80m
harddrives , and it was clear that buying another 40m of harddrive space
would cost much more than the difference in price between the two config
uartions. there is an analogous break in the lciii 80 and 160 prices , and
you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.

particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use softpc , which sets up a
several mb (up to 30 ! ) partition , or if you are generating large files
with dtp software , or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix like
os , like machten , having the extra space will be helpful. when you are
pricing used iici 's , look at the harddrive size they come with , and how much
it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (might be a
useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80m , though
i must admit that i am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my
computer , i was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that i rarely use to
because i was running out of space , without having started using dtp stuff ,
softpc or trying any unix os ! )

my telephone line seems pretty stable and i have the supra as well. works
great but with every passing day i fall behind on how many great 14.4s are
out. zoom is out of the question from what i'm hearing. at t has a great
product from what i hear and the sportster is really cheap now too.

if you want to receive a fax , your computer will have to be on , but not
the monitor and of course the modem. you can set the number of rings that
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with fax stf software.
it 's entirely up to you how to arrange that. i 've had faxes sent to me
which is great but i 've been home to set it. i do n't have a need to set
fax receiving up all day. also i hear there is a device that can channel
all incoming phone signals for about 70. rumor also that the phone
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about 5 if that 's what
you need.

best of luck and write back if you 'd like more feedback.

well , i do n't exaclty know what should be done , but what i do is
keep my cpu on and turn my monitor off when not in use. i do this as
much for easing power consumption as anything though. turning off the
monitor when not in use has the advantage of requiring less ram than
a screen saver (but it requires more of my memory to remember to turn
it off... pretty easy to remember to turn it on though )

the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight ,
along with heat.

i wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time. this is pretty standard in portable machines , and the
same kinds of tricks could be played spinning down disks , turning off
screens , reducing clock speed , etc. the advantage of this over just turning
the thing off would be 1) you do n't have to remember to do anything and 2)
the machine is still available over the network.

the tricky part might be in defining what constitutes inactivity.
certainly , you do n't want to wake up from sleep mode just because somebody
pinged you , but you do want to wake up (at least the cpu) if somebody
logs in via a telnet connection.

i would n't worry too much about wasting electricity in the winter
months that energy is just getting turned into heat. it may not be as
efficient a way to heat a building as the central heating plant , but it 's
not too bad. in the summer though , it 's a disaster. not only are you
wasting that power , but you 're probably also running the air conditioning to
get rid of the waste heat.

installing the drive was simple i did n't even have to read the manual. the
scsi address is set by a pushbutton arrangement. i daisy chained the drive
from my syquest (also from aps) and booted up with no problems.

i'm still going through all the shareware that comes on the drive. it 's a
pretty good assortment.

the drive fan is a bit noisier than i would like , but i think it 'll be ok.
the speed seems very good , although i have n't run any objective tests. it
also seems to spin up pretty quickly i can hit the power switch for it , and
almost immediately power the mac without any problems booting from the drive.

some observations the case is plastic (good quality , though) while my older
syquest case is metal. there is one led , which is normally green , and
flickers red as the drive is accessed.

subject when you 're not using it , turn it off !
to multiple recipients of list c18 l c18 l@psuvm.bitnet

research has shown that the majority of the time that the united
states' 30 to 35 million personal computers are on , they are not
actively being used. in addition , 30 to 40 percent are left running
at night and on weekends.

computer equipment is now the fastest growing private sector use
of electricity. computers alone are believed to account for five
percent of commercial electricity consumption , and may account for
ten percent by the year 2000.

if you are one of those who leave them on after you 're done , it
would be a big environmental benefit if you would just turn it off
when you 're not using it. it only takes a second or two to do.

also , the majority of the power your computer uses is not consumed
by the computer itself , but by the monitor. if you ca n't turn the
computer off , then please just turn off the monitor.

the u.s. environmental protection agency has formed an alliance
with computer manufacturers to promote the introduction of energy
efficient pcs that power down automatically when not being used
and thus reduce the air pollution caused by power generation. these
new computers will save enough electricity to power both vermont and
new hampshire and save up to 1 billion u.s. dollars in annual
electricity bills. look for the special epa energy star logo when
you buy computers. they should be available in one to two years.

according to the epa studies , the energy saved will prevent co2
emissions of 20 million tons annually , the equivalent of five million
automobiles. also , 140 , 000 tons of so2 and 75 , 000 tons of nitrogen
oxide emissions will be saved these are the major pollutants
responsible for acid rain.

please do your part ... be responsible. if you 're not using it ,
then just turn it off.

i guess the real question is

who asked the original questions , and why was it so broad .
are we talking pure processing power (what kind of processing btw)
isolated from every other factor and influence in the system \?
or are we shopping for a home computer based on the cpu specs (yuck) !

i just finished a project that involves real time processing of serial
data and discovered that the programming interface (assembly) has
a lot to do with the power of a cpu in a particular application.
if what you want to do is easy to code with the instruction set given ,
then not only is it easy , but it 's cheap and quick. if you have to
fake things (like resolving indirection without a lea instruction) , then
your cycle count goes through the roof !

well , let 's not start a flame war about whose computer is better than whose.
the orginal question was about classifying micro processors...

there has been no empirical evidence to support the first statement. true ,
there is a power surge at startup that has the potential to do damage , but
the internal power supply is well protected. (i 've turned my mac on and off
six or seven times a day for three years without problem). the monitor is
the same. to leave it on is to waste a lot of electricity twice as much
as a television , possibly more.

turn it off when you 're not using it. it 'll save you money and the world
a few more resources.

the problem with turing your computer on and off constantly is not due to
the power surge at start up. it is due to thermal fatigue. you turn on
your computer , it heats up , and everything expands. you turn it off , it
cools off , and everything contracts. there is a limited number of cycles
of this that any component can take before it fails. modern electronics
are much more robust in this respect than their predeccesors. in fact
portable computers are designed with this in mind since the sleep function
that extends battery life also greatly increaces the number of thermal
cycles that occur. as a rule of thumb , if i am not going to use my
computer (and this includes the monitor) in the next 4 6 hours , i turn it
off (i always dim the monitor when not in use to prolong the life of the
phosphor). i tend to think that with the pace of technical innovation in
the computer industry you should be much less concerned with the fatigue
life of your equipment and more concerned with how long your particular
architecture will be supported by hardware and software vendors. )

re methods for attaching heat sink to processor.

go to radio shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. it comes
in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap. at
radio shack , it 's catalog number 276 1372. it 's a mix of
silicone and zinc oxide , and conducts heat very well. plus , it 's
tacky.

usually , you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink , and then
bolt or clamp the sink down , but if you do n't move your mac , gravity
and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold
things in place. just make sure you remember it 's in there , in case
you tilt your mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose. you
would n't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your mac.

mcp is a development platform for hardware designers so they can use a card

hi everyone ,
i'm experiencing a very annoying problem with background printing
on the hp deskwriter (sys 7.1 , deskwriter driver 3.1 , powerbook 170).
when i print from , say , ms word , i see the message spooling to disk ,
but sometimes nothing prints. checking my memory map thanks to now menus ,
i see that hp backgrounder has not loaded. restarting fixes this. it
seems to me that hp backgrounder is quitting unexpectedly , and that its
status as multifinder not aware allows it to do this without my being
informed by a message such as hp backgrounder quit unexpectedly. have
you ever seen this problem before.
there may or may not be a related problem. i have experienced
problems in putting my computer to sleep. choosing sleep from the
finder menu sometimes does nothing. today on a whim i checked the memory
map , and i discovered that hp backgrounder was not loaded. restarted
reloaded hp backgrounder , and i was able to put my machine to sleep as
usual. just a mere coincidence or is the hp backgrounder crash preventing
my machine from going to sleep \?
has anyone seen this problem \? i'm seriously considering the purchase of
a stylewriterii because of the poor quality of the hp software.

please send your answers directly to me and post to the net.
yours truly ,

you should look for the silicon free stuff. there 's a comany who makes the stuff
called tech spray , their address is p.o. box 949 , amarillo , tx 79105.

you should be wary in using most kinds of tape and definately do n't use duct

when using the heat sink glue or compound , only use enough to fill the small

hi ,
i'm having problems tying to get a sony dat drive to work. i'm using
retrospect 1.3ci ,
and my only luck with getting the drive to work has been with a mac iici ,
which has
now unfortunately gone to another department.
ideally , we want to attach it to our quadra 950 setup. i ca n't seem to
get the
retrospect software to recognize the media at all. when in the devices
dialog ,
it can see the dat device , but comes up with , firstly , 'running' , secondly
'media failure' and then immediately 'contents unknown'. this does not
happen with the
mac iici setup , which simply says 'ready'.
i'm hoping someone else will have had similar problems but found some
solution... i
know some others who have had problems with dat devices and their quadra ,
but they have
a mac iici which they can use !

the symptoms
system software is 7.1 , also did n't
work with 7.0.1
i have tried the following
turn off all extensions , except retrospect scsi (required)
tested on a variety of machines quadra , iisi , and lc (at least).
connected no other scsi devices
tested all varieties of scsi termination etc.
replaced the dat unit with a new one (yes ! we got that desperate ! )
read the retrospect manual (even more desperate ))

replies via email would be greatly appreciated... thanks in advance.
i 'll post any
solutions to this group.

cheers ,
matt.

i wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time.

i believe that apple , sun and a number of other desktop machine
manufacturers have agreed with the government to incorporate
power saving techniques this is also something that governments in
other countries are likely to require in the future , so expect to see
it. this may include the ability for the system to fully power down
the monitor , via a controllable power outlet , and power it back on
automatically. (is this a sell on screen saver software companies \? )

goals for idle power consumption have been set at something like 30
watts for the system , not including the monitor ( \? do n't quote me on
this).

note that in many businesses , the savings will be substantial ,
especially if you factor in reduced load on air conditioning systems.
sun did a study that indicated that simply powering off monitors for
the night would save the company (sun itself) on the order of 1m per
year. putting other (and automatic) power saving features in would
probably have greater than double that value.

given that we are seeing more and more reason to leave our work and
home computers on (getting faxes , automatically getting email , ...) ,
building power consumption control into all machines has a potential to
cut 2 off the national power consumption , based on data i heard.

btw when encouraging employees to power off monitors when leaving
work , it was pointed out that this should only be done with monitors
with the power switch on front. there was some indication that
monitors with power switches on the rear are not designed to tolerate
lots of power cycling. this may only apply to the monitors we use , but
might be worth checking if you happen to have a monitor with the switch
in back.

now with sys7.1 and mode32 or 32enabler it does not boot..

a tech support person said the card does not support these 32bit
fixes.

i guess he is right. early versions of the rasterops cards did not either ,
but they fixed it , and people with problems can get a free rom upgrade
from rasterops.

but when pressing the shift key while booting (when the ext. monitor
goes black after having been grey) the system sometimes boots properly ! !
and then works ok with the 20mb and full graphics.

what 's happening \? \? \?

very easy. if you boot without the mode32 control panel , then it will
disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32 bit clean patches. so when
you run ok you must be in 24 bit adressing mode. check about this macintosh
and see if you havce a 12 mb system.

thanks a lot for any advice ! ! !

hello. i have a question (or two) about the serial ports for the
powerbooks (specifically the 145 with system 7.0.1). is there a
difference between the serial ports on the powerbooks versus
any other mac , say plus or ii \? \? i have heard , though not confirmed
by apple that the serial ports have problems at high speeds.

i also heard that sys 7.1 's new power manager 'fixes' this problem
allowing speeds just as any other serial port.

my particular use is that i have a 6811 evb board that i need to
interface with my powerbook via the modem port at 9600 baud.
currently , we are interfacing using mac pluses. i set everything
up just as in lab and nothing. in fact , the powerbook locks up.

can anyone help , inform , advise \? i would appreciate it.
i would prefer email since i do n't read the news at all.
i will post a summary if enough response is generated.

more on the subject. any replies encouraged. thanks in ad
vance.

you may have been emailed this , but the iisi 's power supply is not rated to
handle the gc board. remember when the si came out and everyone complained
about it 's power supply. this is one result of apple providing a low cost
computer and i think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end
computer (at the time anyways) that could n't even support their own video
board. even if this is n't what is causing your problems , you might develop
one later.

having been discusse essentially adnausium the answer is yes.
at

mac
vga q from james engineering (510) 525 7350 and this will let you
display 600x400 and 800x600 if the monitor is capable. i think the
800x600 requires 56khz horizontal sync. i use this on my sony 1604.
(gives a slightly wider screen than the 832x624 adaptor.

i am using a nec 4fg with my centris 610. the cable adapter was provided by
nec (you have to call to get this free adapter). i am also sharing it with my
486 (using a switch box and extra cables).

my questions

how do you tell if it is 600x400 or 800x600 that was displayed \?
or how do you change the mode(resolution) \?
is there sw for this or something i have to do with the hw \?

i am assuming i am getting 800x600 since i have 1m vram and the 4fg can display

its not a good idea to have a horizontally formatted hard disk in a
vertical position. if the drive is formatted in a horizontal position ,
it can
not completely compensate for the gravitational pull in a vertical position.

i asked this question a while ago while contemplating placing my 650 on
it 's side. i received a response from someone at seagate (sorry i
trashed the message) stating that most newer drives (seagates at the
least) can very well compensate for gravity. this means that a
horizontally formatted drive can be later placed vertically with no data
integrity problems.

so is there any problems putting a drive formatted vertically on
its side horizontally \?

i got a drive a few years ago with the rubber feet on the side ,
etc. and have used it like that since (obviously designed for that
orientation). however , it does n't fit under any of the clever
places i can think of to place it , so i would really like to lay it
flat and put it under a low shelf.

this is probably not a newer drive , and it is only 70 meg , but
when i bought it , it was a large drive for an average user
(comparable to buying a 200 meg drive today). so is my old , 70 meg
drive as fragile (or not) as a new 200 meg drive \?

nntp posting host po2.andrew.cmu.edu
in reply to c5wxqg.h93@news.claremont.edu

the origional bit is missing but long short follows

the origional poster asked if he she could use any old vga svga
monitor with a centris (hence title).

the answer ot this question is an unqualified yes. you can use any
old vga svga monitor with a centris. you do need an adaptor (i use a
mac vga q from james engineering (510) 525 7350) to run between the two
machines. the adaptor i have mentioned will convert a centris to a
three row vga svga 25( \? ) pin adaptor for your monitor.

now , the special interest disclaimer.
the above answer is correct for using a vga monitor at 600x400
resolution. if your monitor will sync to 56khz horizontal the above
adaptor will allow you to choose 800x600 resolution (i prefer this on my
1604s).

then you have the question of matching adaptors and sync rates. i would
advocate calling james engineering because they seem to have a clue. as
to the comment by the person who said do n't bother calling apple because
they will treat you like an idiot this is totally untrue.
apple will treat you like a f king assanine idiot for even
considering going third party and if you want this treatment wants you
to pay for their thech support line (the supposedly compitantly one) and
then still has no fu clue.

personal experience. also the tech suppport for the vga monitor makers
does n't see to extend to macs (sony , magnavox). in addition to this to
find out the info you will have to call dealers unless you can find the
sync rates elsewhere as ads like hardware that fits
( ( ( ! ) that rate monitor resolutions give the most
favorable rating (which usually means you can get this if you use a
specialized application video card).(i.e. well you can get a resolution
1168x832 on this 5 , 9 super smelly sock monitor that will let you
display two full pages side by side. all you need is our reasonably
priced oder eater video board for 27 , 000 and it will give you an
ultra fast horizontal sync rate of six fast kilohertz and three khz
vertical. )



note with the sony 1604 at least on the centris 610 built in video
board using an 832x624 adaptor , there is a boarder of an inch to the
sides of the image after adjusting the horizontal width as favorably as
possible. using a 800x600 adaptor this can be reduced to about half an
inch.

sure there are other considerations , but it goes to show you how
proper design from the beginning (in hardware and software) can give
you great returns. as well as showing you that if you do n't have a

according to the official documentation , failure to use the iifx terminator
can not only affect scsi bus performance but can also damage the bus.
whether this is your problem or not i do n't know. i have had sporadic scsi
problems with my iifx since i bought it. (i cannot connect more than three
devices , fourth one causes major problems).

first thing to do is to try to reformat your drive on someone elses system.
if you continue to get errors it is probably the drive. if it formats fine
then i would try to format it on your system with no externals. if this
fails then the scsi controller on your iifx needs repair replacement.

hope this helps.

actually , the 295 is for the 33 mhz powercard , not the universal powercache.
the 33 mhz universal powercache with fpu and adaptor can be had for about
500 (still not a bad deal). i believe the powercard is one generation
older than the universal powercache , and the one primary difference is that
the powercard is machine specific while the powercache can fit into many
macs with the proper adaptor. both cards are 68030 based.

i'm not sure if the hardware or software with the powercard is otherwise
different from the powercache (perhaps someone could enlighten me \? ).

i would also add that i called river computer the other night and these
powercards were going very fast.

hey all

we have an old (1990) external hd attached to the plus in our lab. it had
given us flawless service until last week. the problem someone in our lab
has an old 512 that was upgraded a couple years ago to a plus with an
aftermarket simm scsi setup (digigraphics simmer ). the db25 scsi plug runs
through the back of the machine and attaches to the board with a 26 pin
rectangular connector. well , this guy had removed the back from the machine ,
to put more memory in , and had disconnected the the scsi plug. since the
26 pin connector is symmetrical (not keyed) he may have reinstalled it upside
down , essentially reversing the pins on the db25. he came in and asked if he
could try out our hd on his scsi port (it had never been used). naive fools
that we are , we said o.k.. his computer failed to recognize the drive. now ,
none of the computers in our lab will recognize it. we tried disk doctor , and
it does n't recognize anything on the scsi chain. could installing the scsi
upside down have wrecked the hd 's driver board \? the drive seems to spin up
all right and unpark itself upon powerup. the events are too coincidental to
attribute the problem to stiction.

not without replacing most of the chips on the motherboard. the c610
is n't like the iisi was , meaning that the motherboard of the c610 is
actually designeds to run at the speed of the cpu , and not designed to
run at a higher speed (like 25mhz) but be forced to run at the speed of
a slower cpu (20mhz).

i did n't see any oscillators on the motherboard like the ones on the iisi 's

there is more than one oscillator. if you are talking about the cpu

from what i 've heard the pds slot clock is only 16mhz , to be

i guess a board designed for the lciii can get a 25mhz clock from the

x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl8


several weeks ago , i described a problem with my apple high resolution
monitor and promised to summarize replies received by e mail. to
recapitulate occasionally , every two or three hours or so , my monitor
momentarily loses sync. the entire raster image bounces down about an
eighth of an inch or so , then rights itself. this usually happens right
after i close a large window , highlight a large area , or do something that
radically alters the image on the screen. sometimes , though , it happens
with no provocation whatsoever.

i have received a bewildering range of replies. at one extreme was
a man , clearly quite knowledgable about monitors , who said that the
problem was that the 13 monitor 's power supply simply could n't always
keep up with sudden changes of the raster image the rapid change from
a largely light screen to a largely dark one overtaxed the monitor 's
power supply. there was no fix available , he said , because nothing was
really wrong. (i guess he meant that the flaw was so fundamental that
it had to be endured.)

this seemed quite persuasive and i would have been tempted to
adopt an attitude of stoicism , except for a reply from a 13 monitor
owner who discovered that this very problem is documented in the
apple service technical procedures , volume 3 , under the heading
jitter correction. the section describes a fix involving the replacement
of a capacitor , the adjustment of a potentiometer , or , failing that ,
the swap of a circuit board.

i would be grateful for a discussion among those who have had
experience with this sort of thing.

or to leave it on \?

subject iici rom offers 32 bit clean rom for iix
organization cts network services (crash , ctsnet) , el cajon , ca

last week 's macweek article by ric ford indicated that david ramsey 's
mac iix has been running nicely with a mac iici rom in it , offering
clean 32 bit rom code (liberating his iix from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by apple 's 32 bit system enabler).

does anyone know of a source for these roms \? is it okay for a
remanufacturer to resell only rom chips from used machines \? i know that
copies cannot be made , but it seems to me that it would be okay to
resell the original used rom. (after all , reselling a used computer
involves the sale of the rom anyway , so what 's the difference \? ).

needless to say , i'm interested in purchasing such a rom. what would
be a reasonably price to offer \?

i posted on here about a problem with a datadesk 101e keyboard that
failed to rebuild the desktop with the command option keys pressed
or to shut off inits when pressing the shift key. after absolutely
no help from datadesk i called macconnection tech support. they tried it out
on their centris 610 and had the same problem. they immediately offered
to get a new keyboard , try it on their centris and ship it to me
overnight if it worked. i could send them my keyboard back after i
got the one that worked. this is from a guy in tech support named dave.
it turns out that the keyboard will wrok if you wait for the smiley face
before pressing the shift key to disable inits and wait for the inits to start appearing to rebuild the desktop by pressing command option. i really like
this keyboard so i was glad to be able to keep it. on the other hand ,
datadesks tech support sucks while macconnection 's is great !

summary results of iisi clock modification poll
keywords iisi , clock , poll

this poll was conducted to help users decide whether or not to alter their
iisi clock oscillator. i have attempted to gather as many case histories as
possible to find some estimate of success and risk. the number of replies
probably shows how rare this modification is but give the impression that
success rates may be higher than the previous 80 estimate. 24 of 24
machines were able to run at 25 mhz when no add on boards were present.
this is not a scientific survey but it is the best we have to work with.

thanks to all who contributed to this poll.


issues

speed) 25 mhz to 27.5 mhz appears to be the norm for machines without
add on cards. all reported machines were able to use
25 mhz as long as no add on cards were present. several apple
nubus cards were in use. no machine with the nubus adapter
was able to go faster than 25 mhz. one was n't even able to
achieve 25 mhz with the nubus adapter in place

at speeds of 32 and 33 mhz , the startup sound is distorted and
hi density floppy disk problems have been reported.

note unless specifically listed below , machines were not
tested with a higher speed clock to failure. hence ,
the 25 mhz operational machines may well work at
higher speeds.

damage) one user reported pulling out the plating of one pad. this was
repaired and the machine is operational. one other
reported pulling the pin out of the original clock oscillator
during desoldering. there is one second hand report of a user
putting a gash in the motherboard with a slipped soldering iron.

no reports of static discharge damage.

no reports of high speed operation causing damage.

then again , i also do n't have any reports from users of
defective parachutes.

add on boards) compatibility appears to be a problem with apple nubus
adapters. several other add on boards have been used with
success. see case histories

heat sinks) virtually all modified machines had a heat sink installed.
these were often the to 220 style power transistor type. some
used epoxy. some used a dab of heat sink compound with a dab
of cyanoacrylate glue. there was also use of a clamp with a
bolt through the hole in the motherboard.



case histories

all speeds are the effective cpu speed (1 2 of clock oscillator). all reported
cpu versions were 20 mhz.

performa monitor too.

performa 200 classic ii
performa 400 lc ii
performa 4xx lc iii
performa 600 well , nothing )

the performas are made to be low cost business solutions. the 4xx have
bundled software , modems , etc.
because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper
discount on them. shop around.

as far as the monitors go , buy 3rd party. much cheaper.

brett

there 's nothing so passionate as a vested interest disguised as an
intellectual conviction. sean o'casey in the white plague by frank herbert.

hmmm... that 's not quite right. the performa 600 is real darn close
to the iivx (but a better buy imo). i also do n't think they are so
much a 'low cost business solution' , but a low cost home solution.
why else bundle at ease (among other things) \? hardly a business
application.

what do you mean by 'no retail price '. quite the contrary , i think.
the price is darn near the same all across the country. that (again ,
imo) was one of the selling points of the performas ie no haggling
required. kinda like the saturn (car) of the computer set. one
price , medium performance , ready to go.

when i shopped for my performa (600cd) , the difference between sears
( sigh) , montgomery wards , silo ( sigh) , circuit city ( sigh ) and
bizmart ( sigh ) could n't have been 100.00. why i chose one over the
other was based solely on availability and a friendly salesman who
went the extra mile (when did you last hear that about someone who
sells apples \? ). admittedly , except for montgomery wards (and i
suspect i was just lucky) all of the salesfolk i spoke to did n't know
didly about the computers , peecee or mac. but then , neither did any
of the apple dealers i spoke with...

if you would 've told me a year ago that i would buy a macintosh from
montgomery wards i woulda laughed for a long , long time. go figure.
i'm real happy with my performa. oh , and i bought the apple
performa plus monitor (vs. buying 3rd party). happy with that
decision as well. i walked in , plopped down some cash , and walked out
with a spankin' new computer the day before christmas.

i purchased 2x8 mb 72 pin (60 ns) simms for my quadra 800 from chip
merchant (i 've been very satisfied with them in the past). either one
alone works , but both together fail. i called apple for advice and was
told that there was a problem with composite simms. only non composite
simms should be used with the q 800. chip merchant confirmed that they
presently sell only composite 72 pin simms. so , q 800 simms need to be
both 60 ns and non composite.

8 mb simms do not have to be composite simms , although many (most \? ) 16 mb
simms are. 72 pin simms allow two memory banks per simm , thus permitting
the use of 4 mb dram devices (the same ones used on 4 mb simms) to be used
for two 4 mb banks on one simm. i ca n't imagine that it would be cheaper
to build an 8 mb simm using 1 mb drams as the 4 mb parts reached (and
exceeded) bit for bit price parity with the 1 mb parts some time ago.
it 's probably possible to build a single bank 8 mb simm using 4 mb parts
this could cause problems in a q800. i'm not sure why you 'd want to do
this , though , as a dual bank 8 mb simm would be cheaper to build than a
single bank composite one.

1st c 1st e 1st g 2nd c on the music scale) , and it hanged before
giving the happy mac. i had to re powerup.

this was asked before but i ca n't remember the answer. i 've tried to
find the answer from the faqs and other ftp sites but to no avail.

can anyone tell me what those unusual chimes mean \? a spurious memory
check error \?

thanks
willie

those chimes indicate a hardware failure of some type during system startup.

one thing that can cause the chimes is a cable that has become a bit loose. next time you power down the computer , check that all cables are on tight.

we are having a problem with a quadra 950 that has stumped a couple of
techs sent to us by the vendor , as well as us )
this quadra is 'stuffed' with 64mb ram , 2mb vram and some large disk (400mb
i think). what happens is that after a certain variable interval of time
the video circuitry 'loses' vertical sync. it is quite apparent that the
mac cpu is still ok , and the problem really seems to lie with the video
circuitry , since you can still save your documents , quit your aplpications ,
even pull down menus etc. (only the display is scrolling lik crazy , so it 's
pretty hard to hit menu items )

has anyone any ideas \? please \? please email as well as posting cause i seem
to be spending a lot of time rebooting my mac lately and have a lot less
time available to read news ! )

are you sure it 's not a problem caused by software \? i 've seen this sort
of effect when a runaway program (which could be caused by an init
conflict , for instance) accidentally wacks on a register in the video
hardware. have you tried booting with no extensions and then letting the
q950 just sit there in the finder \? you might also want to try changing to
24 bit addressing (yes , i know you ca n't access your full 64 mb of ram
it 's just an experiment) as the video hardware registers ca n't be accessed
then.

another thing to try as a 'recovery' measure is to use something like
quickkeys to change the pixel depth of the display. this reprograms (some
of) the video hardware registers and may allow sync to be restored.

even better than that... how does a 68000 based amiga 2000 perform in
daily tasks compared to my 68030 based iici.

answer , except in a very few cases , i get my butt kicked by the amiga.
sure there are other considerations , but it goes to show you how
proper design from the beginning (in hardware and software) can give
you great returns. as well as showing you that if you do n't have a
marketing department to speak of , no one will care how good your system is

i 've had the same experience actually. i love the mac interface and any number
of the features , but am sorely dissapointed with the speed. i use macs daily
and am a moc consultant for osu statistics department i'm familiar with almost
every model out there , and my experience is that both the amiga and the atari
st simply blow the mac out of the water in terms of performance. at this time
i would in general say that the other advantages of the mac outweigh the
advantages of the amiga or the st (and falcon) , but i really wish apple would
get their heads together on speed... ((((( they could take a real lesson in
muli tasking from the amiga os or the multitos in the atari falcons too (((

i'm still happy with my ci , but i do n't understand why the performance is
so bad (comparatively). they could have done multi tasking properly .
they could have done everthing else better but apple did n't.
(of course dos 6 and windows 3.1 are nothin to write home about either ! ! )

i just hope that someone comes out with a machine that does everything well
someday. if i had my choice , i would go with mac in most aspects , but add the
speed and superior multi tasking of the other platforms.

as for the original topic trying to compare just the chip in a machine seems
almost worthless. a fast 386 with a wiz bang graphics accelerator will be
faster in productivity for many applications than a even a stock quadra. add a
graphics accelerator to a 486 and you really fly . of course , add one the the
quadra and then you 're blowing the 486 away... etc...

oh well , y'all got 2.00 worth for the price of 0.02

i think mine was only worth 0.01.......

the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight ,
along with heat.

i wonder how hard it would be (i.e. what it would add to the cost)
to design desktop machines with a power saver feature built in which would
reduce power consumption automatically if the machine is idle for more than
some amount of time.

apple and several other manufacturers have already committed to a monitor
design that does just that. it was announced along with the new
administration 's efforts to cut waste and fuel consumption. i know that
in the buildings where i work , gigawatts are wasted by unused , always on

and display the desktop , but it is only a matter of time before it reboots
again. at times , the frequency is as high as several times a minute.

i wonder if your mac has those little reset interupt switches

are inside the mac. or mabey those switches are bad and need replacing.

i wish i caught the original post , but anyway ...


the problem is that the plus 's poor old power supply (sometimes referred to as
the analog sweep board) is on its way out. apart from a board swap (bikkies to
apple) , there 's not much the average joe can do to fix it.

you can , of course , try and re adjust the voltage levels (the 5v rail should

though , the newer mexican assembly line tv 's are not that reliable or

i believe that that would be the same as a system error 64. since there is no
error 64 , then i would guess that it would be a 64 error. which is a font
manager error of error during font declairation .

i would assume that the system that 's on the floppy that you are trying start

a rep at the dealer (actually it 's a university order center , so
they do n't have any immediate financial interest) , told me that
they have been having lots of problems with their centris 610.
he did n't go into details , but mentioned problems with the
floppy drive and intermittent problems with printing files.
it sounded to me like they were having both hardware problems
and software compatibility problems with the machine.
he 's not recommending the centris 610 to anybody he says to
consider a centris 650 or a iivx. (why he would recommend a
iivx over an lciii i do n't know , but that 's what he said.)
so , what does the net think \? did the dealer just get one flaky
machine , or did apple send the c610 out the door too early \?
is your c610 working just great , or is it buggy too \?

my 610 is working great. i have n't heard of any problems. sounds
to me like your dealer does n't know what he 's talking about. it 's
pretty irresponsible to not reccomend the centris 610 on the basis
of problems with one machine. recommending the iivx over the lciii
does n't make a lot of sense either. if this person is so convinced the 610
is buggy have they talked to apple about it or are they just assuming
it 's a problem with all of them \?

i believe the fpu on the lciii is always supposed to go on the logic
board , not in the pds board. i have heard of crashing problems with
pds based fpus on the lciii. asante may have fixed them but why
bother. why bother building an lciii card with an fpu anyway \? the
extra circuitry gives the card one more chance to fail. i say fpu on

scott

for the most part , this is a bunch of bunk. i 've got a computer engineering
degree , yet i 've spent the last 7 years writing software that people actually
use. moreover , the salary distinctions are incorrect i received 3 job offers
upon graduation the two jobs that actually used my hardware experience were
7000 year lower ! my advice is to decide which classes and projects most
interest you , and pick the major that allows you to take them.

emt

well here is my 0.02 worth. advice from a grad student.

i agree with the gentlemen who wrote the comment before me.
the important thing is pick what ever interest you the most and
learn as much as possible about it.

in my five years of education in this field , though brief
compare to alot of people , i had to think about this kind of
question a lot. did i make the right decision in going into
electrical engineering as opposed to computer engineering or
cs \? the more i go thru school , the more i believe that this
kind of question is irrelevant.


interesting , as i think computer technology is now
becomming widespread enough now that it is no longer a position
which must require a degree. i know of several people i work
with that make just as much as i do and they do n't even have
a bs degree in comp sci. yet they make 28 a year. they also
did n't have to pay 30 grand to thier local university either. (
i think computer programming is being reduced to a trade
practice , than a truly specialty field. it will be even more
so in the future.
if your interested in cutting edge type of stuff and you
choose cs as i did , i suggest checking out the emerging field
of software engineering. the difficulties for example of designing
scaleable design environments for individuals so that a single person
can handle 100 , 000 to 1 , 000 , 000 million lines of code all by himself
in a reasonable manner and then incorporate that into a teamwork enviroment
is truly a gigantic problem...not going to be solved any time soon
unfortunately...but hey you could be the person that provides
the missing key for some good groundwork !

i have come to believe that choosing cs because one
does not like hardware or choosing hardware because one does
not like to program is really doing an injustice of building
and computer and making it useful for something. everything
is interwoven and inseparable. cs , ce , and ee are all a
part of a really great discipline and do depend on each other.

my advice is do n't limit yourself , but make a decision
based on which major will give you the best opportunities to
learn. that of course depends on the curriculum at your
persective school. i would choose a major that allows me to
explore as much as possible. beside , i do n't know why the
school would make a student choose a major before her his
sophamore year.

hey you may be so interested in this field that you
decided to learn all about the making of computers in which
case , you suffer a little more and go to grad school.

about the money. do n't look at the averages , if you
are good , you are going to earn more money than anyone else.
if you are a superstar programmer , you will earn millions.
like wise if you are a hotshot computer designers.

well , if your like the poor slobs in the world..like me , you are
in no financial position to continue graduate work right out
of a top 10 comp sci school.

the trick is , to find some generous inc you work for to pay for the
rest of your education...trust me its the best way to go..even
if you do n't get a top salary. which i have always been a poor
slob throughout school but if you follow this rule book salary food shelter
you should always have a computer and you wo n't go hungry.

what else could a man want \? !

breedsa@wkuvx1.bitnet

according to macweek of 2 22 93

the cyclone will come in the same metal minitower case as the quadra
800 , while the tempest will share the low slung case of the centris
610. apple will offer a miniature video camera that can be mounted
above the user 's monitor or moved about on the end of its cable to take
pictures of objects or documents. taking advantage of the 32 bit
digital signal processor (dsp) built into the systems' logic boards ,
the camera will be able to put an image measuring 360 by 288 pixels ,
with 256 gray levels , on the screen.

users will be able to install supplementary lenses that can record
detail as fine as the wire bonds on an integrated circuit. the camera
is expected to cost between 150 and 250.

the systems will ship with all the software needed to put apple 's
casper voice recognition technology to work users apparently will have
to purchase an operational high fidelity microphone.

the two models will talk as well as listen. a new system facility
called the speech manager will convert text strings sent by
applications to phonemes and then pass them to a speech synthesizer.

the cyclone will include a 40mhz '040 , three nubus slots and support
for up to 128mb of ram. the tempest will use a 25mhz lc040 , lacking an
fpu , and hold up to 68mb of ram it will have a single slot that will
require a nubus adapter and have room for only 7 inch nubus cards.
users will be able to update the tempest 's process but not the
cyclone 's.

for more get the 02.22.93 issue of macweek.

very interesting are the graphics results (graphics 30.052) could n't belief this , but it is true. two points which my cause problems are the 4 mbyte ram solder on the board. the are only 80ns rams and run at the upperlimit with 33 mhz. the next part which may cause trouble are the video rams. i have the orignal 100ns vrams from apple in my quadra , here you are also at the upperlimit where most of the chips running but it is n't garantied to run. most of the other parts on the quadra board running on there o




wn clockspeed so they wont make truble.

the most importaned question is do i neat a new heat sink. i would say no. after running my quadra for more than 14 hours the heat sink is really cool. a 33 mhz 486 with heat sink is mutch warmer than the 68040 in the quadra , so i did n't see any problems. the room temperatur was 22 celsius (72 f). if you living in a area were it is hot 100 f (45 c) and your room temperatur is not mutch below i would suggest a new heat sink with a ventilator to stay on the safe side.


hope you will have the same success than i had ,

first of all , i would n't advise wasting your time with apple. they 'll

the safest thing to do is match the svga monitor 's scanning rates with

rewrites the driver or takes or the driver or something that allows it get
more space out of a normal hd floppy disk. it supposedly gets upto 1.6 megs

my question is whether its possible to do this on the mac and if its not

in this particular case i see no reason to go to the trouble

mode32 works just fine with 7.0 , 7.0.1 , and 7.1.

other than getting a 32 bit clean rom , what other features would a iici

there is probably a market for used mother

shreve sells them for about 450. i ca n't justify this for 32 bit

in the last two weeks i have the following problem on two 160 's

1 has a 8mb simm and the other a 6 mb simm
both are about 2 3 months old , bought from different vendors and installed
by different people.

both computers begin crashing frequently , locking up and ultimately the
memory chimes. crashes would almost always occur if you moved the screen
and sometimes would occur when you were n't even touching the computer. in
both cases , taking the machine apart , taking the memory out and putting it
back in solved the problem for awhile but then it would comeback , my
marginally educated guess as to what 's happening is that larger simms are
lopsided in that the insertion point is sort of a pivot point and after
time they begin to move about possible because of pressure on the
keyboard or something \?

anyway , has anyone else had such a problem or solution if somehow you
could support the other end of the simm to prevent it from moving.

i 've had no problem for the past 3 weeks by replacing my 8mb simm with a
2mbsimm although this is not desireble solution.

please email any resp and or post if usefull to the rest of the world.

interesting delema for all those out there.
my school is discussing installing a mac lab of 10 to 15 stations for our bio
100 to 103 classes to do a study with pig disections. (no joke) here is the
deal. we can get this grant to do a study on if it is more feasible to do a
disection via the computer or via the real thing. my problem is i was somehow
drawn into this project (being done by students who want to go mac but know
nada about them , being the man mac man on campus , guess who they came to \? ) so i
wnt to know what would probably be the best hardware to fill the follwoing
list \? right now we are looking at the c650 8 80 and the 2vx 5 80 platforms.
ok here it goes

we are using cd rom , so ought we go with the internal apple cd roms
offered as options in the 650 and vx or go external. it is a matter of price
and reliability , the second being very important.
how much ram \? i was thinking 5 8 more leaning towards 8 \? what do you
think \?
ok , called apple educational discounts and they said their keyboard
(extended) is 160.30. is it better to go with the apple and their long time
great wear and tear record , or is there a 3rd party extended keyboard that is
just a reliable \? price \?
printers one color printer we are presently leaning towrds the
thermal wax tektronic 200e or 200i (probably the e as we are going to limit
access so we do n't needed the i 's networkability) so , what do you think in
terms of color printers \? different brand \? kind (dye sublimation \? ink jet \? )
price \? companies \? 1800 s \? also , we are looking to get a laser printer or
such to network into the whole lab for noraml printing. the fornt runner is
the apple pro650 (is that right do n't have my notes here \? ) at 1650.
suggestions \? we have kids using these things all day if this lab goes through
and they know nothing about it for the most part. it has to be reliable , easy
to maintain , and economical (ie , not high priced paper cartidges , etc).
finally , and this is my little dig into the project. what about netting
these things \? we have ether nearby and i would like to slap the macs on the
net , but , server \? individual ether \? forget about it it is going to be
astronomically priced and the school is going to laugh at you when you ask
them \?

price differences are not that great about 5 .

maybe , but the end user price is more like 10 20 less. it is here in
canada anyway.

for what it 's worth , my experience has been that the educational
discount (which my s.o. has taken advantage of , as a teacher) is roughly
equivalent to the corporate discounts that i'm able to get as an employee of
a fairly large multi state corporation , which is usually at least as good as
what one can get at one of the discount computer chains (e.g. compusa).

the problem mentioned last is a known quadra scsi problem , it was heavily
discussed last year and an apple employee pointed out that there was a
one byte error in the scsi driver routine for the quadra 's (at least the
700
and 900). system 7.1 should not have that problem , for most people the
solution was to get an updated driver from the drive manufactor. in my
case mass microsystems wrote a new driver which fixed the problem on my
quadra
700 , all that occured early last year.

anyone know if there is an updated driver for sony dat drives \? i ca n't
get mine to work with our 950 (see sony dat retrospect problems

i vote for turning them off at night. the stress of off on is a little
harmful , so do n't turn it off , then back on an hour later , etc , but
turning them off for 4 5 hours or overnight is a good idea.

the electricy consumption will go down if you turn them off overnight , along
with heat.

hi
do any of you hardware gurus out there know what kind of memory architecture
apple uses in the powerbook duos \? or in the powerbook in general \?

what are the factors that make the duo 210 so slow compared to a desktop
machine running the same processor at the same speed (25mhz 68030) \? how many
wait states are in the memory system , etc \? what kind of a data bus does it
use \? 32 bit or 16 bit \?


huh \? where did you get this idea from \? i think you got this
backwards. the duo 's memory is faster than its equivalent desktop
machine by 5 10 (and the rest of the powerboks). i think the
explanation for this was that it can refresh faster (in 2 instead of 5
cycles i believe). things that could affect performance would be
factors such as use of functions enhanced in the fpu (which the duo
does n't have undocked). extensions and background applications can
slow your computer down too. real life differences in speed are likely
to be influence by the software you are running , what kind of screen
depth you are running etc.

ps ! the duo is 32 bit through out.

the performas are made to be low cost , widely distributed (sold at

compete with the retail outlet home computer market.

because they have no retail price you might be able to get a steeper
discount on them. shop around.

sears is probably going to have the best price around , most of the
time , based on the number they can purchase and stuff like that.

as far as the monitors go , buy 3rd party. much cheaper.

not really. the newer peformas (405 , 430 , 450) come with what is
really a third party monitor that apple has put their name on and
called it the performa plus display. essentially it is a vga monitor ,
quite cheap.

keywords quadra , clock , acceleration , oscillator
article i.d. shelley.1r577linnjks
organization university of washington
lines 149
nntp posting host carson.u.washington.edu

here is how i modified my quadra 700 for higher speed. previously i
had been using a variable speed overdrive for accelerating my cpu
but this modification is testing out as more stable at higher speeds.

your mileage may vary. the top speed you achieve cannot be predicted
before hand. my personal q700 has tested fine up to 32 mhz thus far.
i did n't have higher speed clock oscillators on hand to test higher
speeds.

parts

clock oscillators (4 pin ttl variety) you will need a selection of
speeds beginning at 50 mhz on up. the cpu will run at 1 2 the
oscillator speed. the original one is a 50 mhz unit. i recommend
getting a 50 mhz clock in case you damage the existing one.

i obtained my clock oscillators from digikey 1 800 344 4539 for
less than 5.00 each. some of their part numbers are

50 mhz ttl clock oscillator (part x121)
62 mhz ttl clock oscillator (part x136)
66 mhz ttl clock oscillator (part ctx137)

do n't get the half size clock oscillators. they wo n't fit.

there are also cmos clock oscillators. i have n't tried one in a
quadra. (they work fine in iisi 's)

socket obtain a 4 pin socket which is in the same form factor as
a 14 pin dip package. alternatively , use 4 machined socket pins
from an augat style socket. just cut them out of the socket.

cooling fan a very small 12 volt fan to keep the cpu cool is a
must. my vso came with a specially modified heatsink which had
a fan built onto it. it had a pass through connector which
tapped into the hard drive power cable. you should rig up
something similar or risk frying your cpu.

procedure

1) insert usual disclaimer and antistatic warnings here.

2) remove the top lid of the machine. you will see the floppy disk and
hard drive mounted in a plastic tower. follow the usual anti static
precautions and of course make sure the machine is off when you do
this. unplug all cables , wall and monitor power supply cords from
the back of the mac.

3) remove the power supply by pulling the plastic interlocking tab on the
tower forward and simultaneously pulling the power supply straight up.
the tab is a piece of plastic from the left posterior aspect of the
tower which extends downward to hook on to the power supply. you may
also feel a horseshoe shaped piece at the right portion of the power
supply. leave that alone. the plastic tab from the tower is all you
need release.

4) look at the rear of the tower assembly. you will see the flat ribbon
scsi connector to the hard drive , a power cable and a flat ribbon cable
leading to the floppy drive. disconnect all these from the motherboard.
the hard drive power cable connector has a tab which must be squeezed
to release it.

5) unplug the drive activity led from its clear plastic mount

6) look down the posterior , cylindrical section of the plastic tower. a
phillips head screw is at the base. remove it , taking care not to drop
it into the case. a bit of gummy glue on your screwdriver is helpful
here.

7) remove the tower assembly by pulling medially the plastic tab on the
right side of the tower. this tab prevents the tower from sliding
posteriorly. slide the entire tower assembly 1 cm posteriorly then
lift the tower assembly straight up and out of the case.

8) remove the interrupt switch assembly. it is a strangely shaped plastic
device at the left , front edge of the motherboard. pull the middle ,
rear plastic prong up and forward. the entire device will release.

9) unplug the speaker cable. squeeze the plastic tab on the speaker to
free it then swing it backwards to free it from the case.

10) remove the motherboard form the case. lift the front right corner of
the motherboard about 1 mm. this allows it to clear the clear plastic
power light guide. slide the motherboard forward about 1 cm. the
motherboard then comes directly out.

11) locate the 50 mhz clock crystal. it is a small metal box near the
cpu chip. note and remember its orientation. the new clock oscillators
must be aligned with pin 1 in the same orientation.

very carefully desolder and remove the old clock oscillator. some of
the pins may be bent over. simply desolder then unbend them. be sure
your desoldering iron is hot enough before heating the board.

i used a suction desoldering iron to accomplish this task. this is
not appropriate for a first soldering experience. the motherboard is
a multi layer design with very fine traces easily damaged without
proper care.

12) install your socket or socket pins where the old oscillator once was.

13) put a 50 mhz clock oscillator into the new socket. you could use the
old clock but it has solder on its pins. this may come of inside the
socket and cause corrosion problems later. i suggest using a new
50 mhz clock.

14) install your cooling fan system to complete the modification.

14) reinsert the motherboard and slide it into place.

15) snap in the interrupt switch assembly and speaker to lock the mother
board firmly. plug the speaker wire back into the motherboard.

16) reinstall the tower assembly by first placing the right wall of the
tower against the right wall of the case with the tower assembly about
1 cm posterior of its intended position. lower the tower assembly into
place while maintaining contact with the right wall of the case.
once fully down , slide the tower assembly anteriorly until it clicks
into place.

17) reconnect the motherboard ends of the cables. dont't forget the floppy
drive cable.

18) replace the phillips head screw

19) drop the power supply straight down into place until it clicks in.

20) plug the hard drive activity light back into its clear plastic mount.

21) reattach your cables and power cords. cross your fingers and turn
on the mac. it should make the usual power on chord. if it does n't ,
something is amiss. immediately turn of the power and recheck your
handiwork. if all is not well , you have my sincere condolences.

hopefully , all will work normally. turn the machine back off and
replace the 50 mhz clock oscillator with a faster one. reboot and
be astounded.

you will need to fully test the machine for many hours before deciding
a particular speed is truly usable. with my vso , a machine lock up
might take 8 hours of operation to occur. in the brief time since
modifying my clock oscillator (36 hours) i have not had a single
problem.

good luck to all who attempt this modification. there is a small but real
risk , but you could well reach quadra 950 speeds or higher with less than
50 in parts.

in article mdavis.735319596@crash.cts.com mdavis@crash.cts.com (morgan davis) writes

last week 's macweek article by ric ford indicated that david ramsey 's
mac iix has been running nicely with a mac iici rom in it , offering
clean 32 bit rom code (liberating his iix from the virtual memory
nightmare caused by apple 's 32 bit system enabler).

this would make me a bit suspect of mr. ramsey 's qualifications
as a self styled expert , in fact , when i read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly i kind of wonder ... )

yes , one can sometimes get away with running a newer rom (of the
correct size , obviously) in an older machine , but one should be
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine
type rather than rom trap availability and then draws incorrect
conclusions when special casing especially timing dependent
and driver related stuff.

in this particular case i see no reason to go to the trouble
of rom swapping. the apple 32 bit enabler has problems , but
mode32 works just fine with 7.0 , 7.0.1 , and 7.1.

does anyone know of a source for these roms \?

sure. buy a used iici motherboard. call pre owned electronics ,
shreve , or other parts dealers (see the back of computer shopper
or one of the mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a iici rom. everything has a price. if you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a iici with a dead motherboard , you might
get a decent price. there is probably a market for used mother
boards as well , so they might sell a rom anyway.

needless to say , i'm interested in purchasing such a rom. what would
be a reasonably price to offer \?

ask for a quote and then try offering less \? pre owned and
shreve have been known to dicker. their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the
same items , and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

still , i'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading
the rom in a iix.

my co worker has just attached a magneto optical drive to his mac.
works great for him. however , he tried to turn on file sharing , but it
would n't work. had some message about not all volumes are shareable
\? \? \?

so has anyone had success in sharing mos \? if so , please tell me how !

hi.

he needs insert the mo before filesharing get turned on , and the only one
that can see the disk is the owner of the machine. (i'm not sure but seems
that the check allow owner to see entire disk should be enabled too).

a bad thing you ca n't eject the disk until fs is turned off.

hope that helps.

is there a fix for this \? we have a quadra 900 that will not finish startup
unless there is a monitor connected. this would be no problem , but since
we 're running it as a file server , there is no need to have a monitor
connected all the time.

i 've seen a control panel made for this. i do n't remember the name , where i
saw it , or on what quadra models it will work. but i do know it exists )

subject re apple 8 24 gc video card
lines 18

a friend of mine recently acquired an 8 ! 24 gc card for his iisi
and was wondering why it always starts up in black and white.
i know there have been numerous reports about the worth of
the gc , but i was wondering if anyone could elaborate a little
more on the subject. any replies encouraged. thanks in ad
vance.

joe kasanic


i 've had similar problems w other board types , and the problem is not a
result of the 8 24gc board ! try zapping the pram by holding down
command option p r durring startup ! you will have to reset everything to
your previous preferences (the date time remain intact ! ) , but the video
board will start remembering it 's previous settings !

i need help identifying this board that i found stuffed away in a corner.

as the title says , all that is printed on it is national instruments nb dma 8.
it fits fine in my mac iici and snooper gives the very same name for the
board. it looks like it has an hp ib connector on the back of it and
another connector on the top (2 rows by 25 pins). it also looks like
it has an intel processor on it ( a82380 16 intel '86)

on an eeprom there is a sticker with the p n 700584 01.

anybody ever seen or heard of one \? or better yet , do you know what it does \?
we are all clueless here. our last option is to hook it up to our hp
workstations and see if any smoke comes out.

thanks a lot !

kevin

it is a data aquisition board for the mac ii series. it is called
the dma board with gpib interface. you may call ni at 800 ieee 488
to find out more about it.

hope this helps.

i do n't know of a better deal , but would you be willing to share your
deal with the rest of us. that certainly sounds like you 're getting a
great deal. i 'd be interested in that deal too.

ok , if i post where this comes from , will people stop sending email
asking where i negotiated the deal \? )

the deal is from international computer and networking in ca.
(i saw the ad int he back of macworld and macuser)...
phone number is 310 441 9181 and the deal may have changed since
a few weeks ago , since they change prices about every ten minutes )

alas , this is a funny system , it sounds like a good deal , but this is a
centris 650 , 4mb (on the motherboard) 4mb simm , 80mb hd , no ethernet
and no coprocessor (well , actually it 's a 68lc040 instead of a 68rc040 ,
'just had to say that to keep people from saying there is no such thing
as an '040 without a coprocessor , since the fpu is built into the chip )

ok , there ya have it , but if i were you , i would wait untill the cyclones
come out and buy a quadra 800 )
