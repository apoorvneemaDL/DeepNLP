what is immoral is people like you and the current president who do n't
have any idea why this country still exists after 200 years.

i do n't consider these ideas selfish i consider them rational.

i agree with the body of your post , but please reconsider your phrasing
here. i think these ideas are selfish and rational , which
is commendable.

do n't give selfishness a bad rap. if we were all selfless there would
be no moral reason not to have a draft. it the draft is the ultimate
in mindlessly serving your fellow man with no thought to the importance
of the self.

i note with insufficient emotion that amongst the five survivors of the
waco debacle , there were two brits and an aussie. the anglo saxon persona
really does n't lend itself to martyrdom for a spurious messiah.

i do n't see how you draw that conclusion. around 20 of the 80 inside the
buildings were british (one quarter). two out of the eight (latest count i
heard) survivors were british (one quarter). anyhow , british does n't equate
to anglo saxon.

what exactly are you trying to say \? and why were there no fire engines within
a mile of the compound \?

because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters.


what crap , phil. 50mm \? wrong. to give you a clue as to how big 50mm is , the
f 16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other
aircraft. a 50mm gun would be somewhere in the `cannon' realm. they might
have had .50 calibre but definitely not 50mm.

the situation in waco was similar to a hostage situation with
a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.
in such a situation , a person who provokes the madman and causes
him to pull the gun 's trigger is responsible for the death of the
hostage. janet reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
release the hostage. it 's no surprise that the madman would
pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.

just out of curiosity , what else was there to do in this situation \?
wait another 51 days weeks months years \? \? \?

was there anything indicating that these children and the other
people were going to get out alive \?

there was no attempt to simply serve a warrant. the batf had a

when did the batf say this \? everything i 've seen from the batf ,
from the official version to the dissident statements of batf

also , if the warrant is sealed , how do we know it was a 'no knock' \?

hey do n't confuse these guys with facts dude ! you might break some

of course by batf admits this they mean that the batf did not deny some

if anyone wants to understand the paranoid mindset of koresh i offer you

thirdly , it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given
the benefit of hindsight something that those who made the
decisions did not have the benefit of. why not give them the courtesy
of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the
data they had in a very , very difficult situation.

what is your proof that they did the best they could \? unless
they had strong evidence that the children were in immediate danger
then the best they could have done was to show restraint.

some of us did predict this outcome , or at least suggested a
strong possibility of it. i , for one , said that in the event of
an assault against the building the children were the ones in danger
either from the assault itself or from a jonestown (my phrase
a week after the seige started) style suicide. and as i pointed
out then , and repeatedly over the objections of people on the net
who disagreed with me , an adult may freely choose suicide but they
have no right to impose this choice on their children.

now , while i do n't expect the fbi to pay any attention to what i
have to say on this , i do expect them to figure it out on their
own or to take the advice of experts. the cult specialist inter
viewed in yesterday 's boston globe said he was repeatedly stonewalled
by the fbi when he pointed out to them that their confrontational
tactics played perfectly into koresh 's mad view of the world and so
increased the chance of a tragic outcome.

some responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were
done without regard for the lives of the people in the compound give
me a break.

give us a break ! pumping teargas for 45 minutes into a compound
filled with children \? ! ! this does n't seem to show much regard for
their lives or safety. nontoxic teargas is an oxymoron. children
have tiny respiratory passages which are easily blocked by the secretions
induced by teargas moreover teargas can easily cause fatalities in anyone
subject to laryngospasms , asthma , or heart disease.

if a madman is holding a gun to a hostage , someone who provokes the
madman by attacking him bears nearly as much repsonsibility for the
death of the hostage as the madman himself. these kinds of situations
have to be handled delicately not by surrounding a place with
tanks and heavily armed personnel and blaring rock music from loud
speakers at all hours. that approach is idiotic.


be part of the solution not the problem.

the solution is to greatly reduce the authority of the the authorities .
the feds showed themselves here , as they have so many times in the
past , to be a gang of trigger happy , impulsive , yahoos who cause more
trouble than they prevent. their confrontational approach reinforced
every single message koresh was giving his followers , virtually guarantee
ing that whatever crazy solution koresh proposed would be followed
willingly. this was pointed out here , on compuserve , in the press ,
just about every place except in the justice department where it seems
a n.i.h. philosophy prevails.

for immediate release april 20 , 1993


remarks by the president
in question and answer session with the press


the rose garden


1 36 p.m. edt


the president on february the 28th , four federal
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law
against the branch davidian compound , which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition , and placed innocent children at risk.
because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective , a 51 day
standoff ensued.

the federal bureau of investigation then made every
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without
bloodshed and further loss of life. the bureau 's efforts were
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were
dealing , david koresh , was dangerous , irrational , and probably
insane.

he engaged in numerous activities which violated both
federal law and common standards of decency. he was , moreover ,
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the
action against the compound in february. given his inclination
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages , no
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal
agents against the compound.

this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on
an operation prepared by the fbi , designed to increase pressure on
koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.
the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition , even
in the face of fire , and instead to use tear gas that would not cause
permanent harm to health , but would , it was hoped , force the people
in the compound to come outside and to surrender.

i was informed of the plan to end the siege. i
discussed it with attorney general reno. i asked the questions i
thought it was appropriate for me to ask. i then told her to do what
she thought was right , and i take full responsibility for the
implementation of the decision.

yesterday 's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
mr. koresh 's response to the demands for his surrender by federal
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his
captives , as well as all the other people who were there who did not
survive. he killed those he controlled , and he bears ultimate
responsibility for the carnage that ensued.

now we must review the past with an eye towards the
future. i have directed the united stated departments of justice and
treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to
uncover what happened and why , and whether anything could have been
done differently. i have told the departments to involve independent
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation. i
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required
to complete the review. finally , i have directed the departments to
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can
continue to be fully accountable to the american people.

i want to express my appreciation to the attorney
general , to the justice department , and to the federal agents on the
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult
circumstances.

again , i want to say as i did yesterday , i am very sorry
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end
of this tragedy in waco. i hope very much that others who will be
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david
koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over
the last seven weeks. and i hope very much that the difficult
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what
has been learned now.

q mr. president , can you , first of all , tell us why ,
after 51 days , you decided

q mr. president , can you describe for us what it is
that janet reno outlined to you in your 15 minute phone conversation
with

the president i ca n't hear you both. if one will go
first and then the other.

q sorry. can you describe what janet reno

q mr. president

the president i 'll answer both your questions , but i
ca n't do it at once.

q can you describe what she told you on sunday about
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it \?

the president yes. i was told by the attorney general
that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound. and she
described generally what the operation would be that they wanted
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause
permanent damage to adults or to children , but which would make it
very difficult for people to stay inside the building. and it was
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.

i was further told that under no circumstances would our
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon. they were going to
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and
there would be no exchange of fire. in fact , as you know , an awful
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.
there were no shots coming back from the government side.

i asked a number of questions. the first question i
asked is , why now \? we have waited seven weeks why now \? the reasons
i was given were the following

number one , that there was a limit to how long the
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there. they might be
needed in other parts of the country.

number two , that the people who had reviewed this had
never seen a case quite like this one before , and they were convinced
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to
be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult
members to come out.

number three , that the danger of their doing something
to themselves or to others was likely to increase , not decrease , with
the passage of time.

and number four , that they had reason to believe that
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused
significantly , as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.

so for those reasons , they wanted to move at that time.
the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and
evaluated them against what might happen that was good. she said
that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only
increase with the passage of time.

the third question i asked was , has the military been
consulted \? as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco ,
that 's the first thing i asked to be done , because it was obvious
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation. military
people were then brought in , helped to analyze the situation and some
of the problems that were presented by it. and so i asked if the
military had been consulted. the attorney general said that they
had , and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one
minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military
something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming
significance.

having asked those questions and gotten those answers , i
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do , that she
should proceed and that i would support it. and i stand by that
today.

q mr. president

the president wait. go ahead.

q can you address the widespread perception
reported widely , television , radio and newspapers that you were
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster \?

the president no , i'm bewildered by it. the only
reason i made no public statement yesterday let me say the only
reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to
add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into
custody. it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events
to unfold.

there was i have i ca n't account for why people
speculated one way or the other , but i talked to the attorney general
on the day before the action took place. i talked to her yesterday.
i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry
king show , and i talked to her again this morning. a president it
is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that
happen when the federal government is in control.

i will say this , however. i was , frankly , surprised
would be a mild word , to say that anyone that would suggest that the
attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves. (applause.)

i regret what happened , but it is not possible in this
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance. these
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty. they were
heavily armed. they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly ,
and they were never fired back on. we did everything we could to
avoid the loss of life. they made the decision to immolate
themselves. and i regret it terribly , and i feel awful about the
children.

but in the end , the last comment i had from janet reno ,
is when and i talked to her on sunday i said , now , i want you
to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more. and she
said , it 's because of the children. they have evidence that those
children are still being abused and that they 're in increasingly
unsafe conditions , and that they do n't think it will get any easier
with time with the passage of time. i have to take their word for
that. so that is where i think things stand.

q can we assume then that you do n't think this was
mishandled in view of the outcome , that you did n't run out of
patience \? and if you had it to do over again , would you really
decide that way \?

the president no well , i think what you can assume
is just exactly what i announced today. this is a the fbi has
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of
time. this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the
world trade center in lickety split , record time. we want an inquiry
to analyze the steps along the way. is there something else we
should have known \? is there some other question they should have
asked \? is there some other question i should have asked \? can i say
for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make
the outcome come different \? i do n't know that. that 's why i want
the inquiry and that 's why i would like to make sure that we have
some independent law enforcement people , not political people , but
totally non political , outside experts who can bring to bear the best
evidence we have.

there is , unfortunately , a rise in this sort of
fanaticism all across the world. and we may have to confront it
again. and i want to know whether there is anything we can do ,
particularly when there are children involved. but i do think it is
important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the
people who killed others and then killed themselves.

q mr. president , were there any other options
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from
february 28th until yesterday \?

the president well , yes , i got regular reports all
along the way. there were lots of other options pursued. if you go
back you all covered it very well. the fbi you did a very good
job of it. i mean , the fbi and the other authorities there pursued
any number of other options all along the way , and a lot of them
early on seemed to be working. some of the children got out , some of
the other people left. there was a at one point , there seemed to
be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the
authorities. and then he would say things and not do them and things
just began to spin downward.

whether there were other in terms of what happened
yesterday , the conversation i had with the attorney general did not
involve other options except whether we should take more time with
the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they
wanted to do this , because they thought this was the best way to get
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.
that 's what they thought.

q did the government know that the children did not
have gas masks \?

q congressional hearings once the situation are
you in agreement with that \?

the president that 's up to the congress. they can do
whatever they want. but i think it 's very important that the
treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring
in some outside experts. and as i said in my statement , if any
congressional committees want to look into it , we will fully
cooperate. there is nothing to hide here. this was probably the
most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the
country.

go ahead , sarah.

q there are two questions i want to ask you. the
first is , i think that they knew very well that the children did not
have gas masks while the adults did , so the children had no chance
because this gas was very she said it was not lethal , but it was
very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived
without gas masks. and on february 28th let 's go back did n't
those people have a right to practice their religion \?

the president they were not just practicing their
religion , they were the treasury department believed that they had
violated federal laws , any number of them.

q what federal laws

the president let me go back and answer i ca n't
answer the question about the gas masks , except to tell you that the
whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested they
were convinced that it would n't kill either a child or an adult but
it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside. and one of
the things that i 've heard i do n't want to get into the details of
this because i do n't know but one of the things that they were
speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that
the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have
escaped and that may be why it did n't have the desired effect.

they also knew , sarah , that there was an underground
compound a bus buried underground where the children could be
sent. and they were i think they were hoping very much that if
the children were not released immediately outside that the humane
thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace
where they could be protected.

in terms of the gas masks themselves , i learned
yesterday i did not ask this fact question before that the gas
was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks
themselves were to work. so that it was thought that even if they
all had gas masks , that eventually the gas would force them out in a
nonviolent , nonshooting circumstance.

ms. myers last question.

q mr. president , why are you still saying that

q could you tell us whether or not you ever asked
janet reno about the possibility of a mass suicide \? and when you
learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your
mind during those horrendous moments \?

the president what i asked janet reno is if they had
considered all the worse things that could happen. and she said
and , of course , the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the
public he had that had been debated anyway. and she said that
the people who were most knowledgeable about these kinds of issues
concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would
be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in
the future. that was the judgment they made. whether they were
right or wrong , of course , we will never know.

what happened when i saw the fire , when i saw the
building burning \? i was sick. i felt terrible. and my immediate
concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were
escaping or whether they were inside , trying to burn themselves up.
that 's the first thing i wanted to know.

thank you.

q mr. president , why are you still saying it was a
janet reno decision \? is n't it , in the end , your decision \?

the president well , what i'm saying is that i did n't
have a four or five hour , detailed briefing from the fbi. i did n't
go over every strategic part of it. it is a decision for which i
take responsibility. i'm the president of the united states and i
signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to
make the last call. when i talked to her on sunday , some time had
elapsed. she might have made a decision to change her mind. i said ,
if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow , i will support you.
and i do support her.

she is not ultimately responsible to the american
people i am. but i think she has conducted her duties in an
appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation i think as
well as she could have.

thank you. (applause.)

what exactly are you trying to say \? and why were there no fire engines within
a mile of the compound \?

because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters.


what crap , phil. 50mm \? wrong. to give you a clue as to how big 50mm is , the
f 16 fighter aircraft have 20mm gattling guns used to shoot down other
aircraft. a 50mm gun would be somewhere in the `cannon' realm. they might
have had .50 calibre but definitely not 50mm.



i think that phil needs to get out a ruler and see exactly how big 50mm rounds
are roughly 2 diameter. the type of stuff used in anti aircraft gunnery.
.50 calibre is much smaller , but the 3000m effective range ( 2mi) sounds about
right. maybe he just got the two confused..... the fbi 's reasoning was sound ,
but the note from ph b was factually wrong.

recent studies have shown that the number of men who have
engaged in homosexual activities in the last decade is 2.3
and the number of men who are exclusively homosexual is 1.1 .
these figures are much less than those that came from earlier
studies that showed that homosexuality among men is a lot
higher.

so , what can we deduce from these figures \? are there a lot
less male homosexuals than there used to be or are men
(perhaps women too) not as honest as they used to be about
there sexuality \? presumably , the people that were polled in

you mean , in the 1940s , men and women were much more open about
their homosexuality than today \? want to try that one again \?

this survey were assured of their anonymnity so they should
have answered the questions honestly i suppose. however , it
could be that gays feel so repressed and denigrated by society
that they did n't feel that they could be forthcoming about there
sexuality in something like a survey. if this true then is it
possible that there is a lot more gays out there than we are led
to believe \?

perhaps if americans were more open about there sexuality i think
most americans are n't then we might discover that there are really
quite a few more people out there who are orientated toward the same
sex men and women included. i 'd venture a guess that there is a
lot of people out there who have considered having a relationship
with someone of the same sex at some point in there life. maybe they
did n't take their longings seriously , but this does n't make these
longings any less valid. therefore , if americans were n't so
repressed about their sexuality in general as i believe they may be
then we 'd see a lot more people coming out of the closet .

you mean , ignore study after study , so that we can continue to
accept a study (kinsey 's) that is obviously wrong \?

as for myself , i'm a heterosexual and i 've never considered having
sex with another man. that 's just the way i am...i could have just
as easily of been gay i suppose. one of the big debates about
homosexuality is whether or not it 's a type of behavior that is
learned or if one is just born that way. imho , the more likely
explanation is that it 's some combination of the two.

based on what , besides your own warm fuzzy feelings \?

here 's something to ponder upon have any of you gay bashers out
there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual
orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an
intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do
about their own sexuality \? in other words , someone who is truly

alcoholics share that feeling , until they hit bottom.

gay may not be able to live any other way. even if they date someone
of the opposite sex or get married , in their heart they are still a
homosexual. likewise , if someone who is truly heterosexual forms
a relationship with someone of the same sex , then they are still
a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.

scott kennedy , brewer and patriot

unless , of course , the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder , caused by childhood sexual abuse , as a number of
recent works suggest.

if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children
alone , i would n't care in the least what they did in private. but
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of
government is to tell peaceful people how to live , i have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an alternative
lifestyle , but a sickness.

the fact that reno is actually taking responsibility (gee that 's a new
one for a politician) is a new thing for a member of clinton 's administration.
i actually respect her for having a backbone ( i never thought i 'd say
that about someone from that bunch).

the way i understand what happened is that she discussed with clinton
what was being planned for waco. clinton did n't say no , so gave de
facto approval for the operation. things got messed up , and a lot of
people died horrible deaths. (if i am incorrect about this , please
feel free to correct it. this is just what i 've been able to pick
up.)

i 've just got a couple of questions about this whole thing.
(1) why did the government feel they needed to assault that compound \?
(2) why did n't they try to flush them out in the first week of
this fiasco instead of waiting 50 days.
(3) janet reno jumped up to take responsibilty to take heat away
from the president. does this sound anything like what a couple
of reagan 's aides did \?

peope just doesn't get it. the current health care system is a cancer which is
killing our economic well being. costs are still rising 10 percent a year
even as americans by the tens of millions go without , or are forced into
managed care programs , which are certainly pretty socialized already if you
ask me.

a couple of months ago i posted a message asking any hillary bashers to please
come forward and present (no gimmicks , straight talk) just how they would set
about keeping costs down. i did n't get a single answer.

the first thing i would do would be to disband medicare and medicade ! they
are a primary reason why health care costs are going up. to cover the people
that are currently on these programs , i would sell their coverage in blocks
to insurance companies. the private companies would bid to get these large
blocks of people , and prices would go down.

to get away from strong federal control on health care , i would pass off
more control to the states. everyone is always spewing forth about how
wonderful hawaii is doing. well , how about giving some other states incentive
to try their own plans

what i would not do is try to implement some far reaching federal program
program to cover all americans , because this is the surest way to fail !


how can anyone read the news , live under our system , and not see these faults \?
how can we deal with the deficit , our cities , our educational system , our
infrastrucure , aids , modernizing our industry , etc. if we do n't quit throwing
away money which could be used to solve those problems \?

one sure way to stop throwing money away is to stop giving so much to the
federal government. our federal taxes should be slashed , and our state taxes
increased. a strong central government always fails. give power back to the
states counties cities , where it belongs.

america needs health care reform now. do n't just sit there and hillary bash ,
inform yourself !

the more i inform myself , the more i want to hillary bash.

critisism is too easy. what solutions do people have that would have been
better than what the fbi had been doing for the last few months \?

firstly , they could have backed off.

regardless of who was at fault in the first assault (the one in which
four atf officers died) , once that was over backing off was no longer
an option. the people inside , particularly koresh , were criminal
suspects. they could have made a case of self defense , if they wanted ,
in a court of law. until then the police had the responsibility to
capture and arrest them. i 've never heard of a case where the police
knew there was a criminal suspect in a building , and still decided
to back off. continuing the siege was one of the few alternatives
to what actually took place , and it 's a matter of debate whether any
of these would have ended any better.


how about letting in the press \?

how about letting koresh out to talk to the press \?

maybe if he had been allowed to talk with the press tv for a couple of
days he would have surrendered peacefully.


how about letting the relatives of koresh`s followers talk \?


seems to me when you isolate someone , try to send them crazy by playing
loudspeakers through the night of tibetan chants , etc. , you don`t have
much to stand on when they behave as if they are crazy. (i`m not too
sure of their sanity to start with.)

i am very suspicious when the government controls all communication ,
and sends the press 2 miles away.
i have a gut feeling that no knock warrant , which is sealed , would not
stand up to scrutiny.

i don`t think no knock warrants are what the constitution writers had
in mind when they gave us rights against improper search and seizure.
i don`t think an all powerful central , high taxing government was
what the constitution writers had in mind when it delagated rights
to the citizens and states and restricted central government.

i saw the film on cnn as it happend. it was clear from that tape that
the fire started in one location. right where the tank was attacking ,
and then had pulled back.

no , this is not true. the cnn pictures show two sites clearly and a third is
barely distinguished.

if you have a tape you should note that there are two towers at either end
of the building , a big one and a little one. what appears to be merely a
long shot of the big tower with the tank in front is in fact the little
tower. you can tell beacuse the flag in the foreground switches sides from the
right of the picture to the left.

the third site is visible as the flames clearly come from a point obscured by
the small tower. you need a tape and a good slow motion video to see this.

a very well put together post. i disagree with several key points , but the
post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse

i agree wholeheartedly. paul , you have handled this so well ,
i think that you could write ballot materials.

thank you. i 'd hoped to avoid the rancor that has characterized much
of the debate on this issue. i'm also not going to prolong the debate
on this. i wanted to respond to a couple of the points you make , but
this will be my last posting on this.

no , do n't stop !

right to equal opportunity (lets call it reo) involves coercion in all cases
(by definition).

one question is it your position that there is no reo \? or just that
this is a lesser right to foa \?

good question. it just depends. how 's that for an answer \? )
seriously , i believe that it depends on wether or not you are
talking about a governmental employer or not. in this case , i
believe that there should be absolutely no discrimination ,
direct or indirect , period. i feel this way not because it would
offend my moral sensibilities (which it of course would) , but
because the government is a coercive entity which we cannot
escape. it boggles my mind that in my lifetime , there were
whites only drinking fountains in some parks , but no fountains
for others , yet the taxes garnished to support those fountains
certainly were not applied to whites only. in essence , we
cannot escape the coercive state. even randy weavers have to pay
property tax. on the other hand , private employers are not a
monopoly , and their businesses should be run by them , and not by
the government , unless they elect to turn their affairs over to
that government.

why \? says who \? why can mom pop have foa , but ibm be forced , and force is
the correct word here , to have reo \?

in the case of the mom pop store , their foa is directly affected. they ,
as individuals , will have to associate with whomever they hire. in the
case of ibm , i ask again , whose foa are we protecting \? i do not accept
that ibm , as a corporate entity , has a right to foa.

but if the mom pop store is affected by who they hire ,
is n't ibm \? there is a slippery slope here. in santa cruz
(where a number of loony anti discrimination laws exist) ,
a guy sued a restaurant for not hiring him because he had
every imaginable kitchen utensil dangling from his earlobe ,
and his tatoos were very distracting.

suddenly , by arm waving , by magic , a landlord does not have foa. and on
what basis does the foa of the landlord disappear \?

it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice.

on the basis that the landlord has no contact with his her tenants. if
the landlord does n't associate with his tenants , then how can he complain
that his foa is being violated \?

i have a lot of interaction (all positive) with my tenants ,
so i guess that that is n't an issue. but say i were to buy
a unit in another town , and have it managed by a third party.
let 's say that i have a real aversion to christians because
of the stuff that they buy into hook line and sinker , and
because of the lunatic schmucks that they try to get elected.
i do n't want any of those fish symbols hanging in the window
of a house that i own. should the government intervene \? if
i was elie weizel and the only rental applicant was tom
metzger , should i be forced to rent this distant unit to him \?

the companies on the fortune 500 , for example , are all privately owned. they
can give you a list of all of their owners. they have no anonymous ,
unknown to them , owners.

publicly owned in the sense that their stock is publicly traded and that
the shares of stock are owned by a generic , and ever changing public .

yes , and the neat thing about this is that unlike the mom
pop store , you and i can buy shares in ibm , and have influence
over their decision making policies if we do n't like them.

anyway , paul , keep up the good work.

bzzzzt. thank you for playing , but obviously you are not reading the
material as it is presented. according to the report i 've got in my
hands , the newsweek article (which reported that 2 to 3 percent of the
population is gay) used the criteria of no heterosexual contact in the
past year. but at the same time , the university of denver study points
out , quite dramatically , that 60 of all self identifying gay men have
had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year.

i think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual
contact of any kind in the previous year , they are counted as heterosexual.
even if they did n't intend it that way , that 's how the figures are being used.

could someone please post some date such as what questonnares where used
and how they were distributed and returned.

there is still no proof that the branch davidians had illegal weapons.
nothing else was in the jurisdiction of the batf , unless they were

the stupidity was indeed related to this. but the stupidity may have been to
attempt to serve the warrant by ludicrously over armed , over protected

it was a tax matter ! you can t flush mgs down the toilet !
you don t need no knock warrants for everything.

their compound and lobbing grenades at them. the terms of the
search warrent are secret and the batf has yet to even reveal

they did not serve a warrent , they basically attacked the

janet reno killed the waco children. she is responsible for
their deaths. she should resign immediately. she should have
understood that david koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked. all the warning
signs were there and she ignored them. she provoked koresh
into killing the children.

the situation in waco was similar to a hostage situation with
a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.
in such a situation , a person who provokes the madman and causes
him to pull the gun 's trigger is responsible for the death of the
hostage. janet reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
release the hostage. it 's no surprise that the madman would
pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.

i am deeply saddened by the loss of life in waco today. my
thoughts and prayers are with the families of david koresh 's
victims.

the law enforcement agencies involved in the waco siege
recommended the course of action pursued today. the attorney
general informed me of their analysis and judgment and
recommended that we proceed with today 's action given the risks
of maintaining the previous policy indefinitely. i told the
attorney general to do what she thought was right , and i stand by
that decision.

actually , i bet you more gay bi men are as not as promiscuous as gay men ,
because more of them could have the option of living a straight life , and
with social pressures , probably would at least try.

geez , where have you been , ryan \? i proposed this theory months
ago. let 's take it one step further , even. if , as the surveys show ,
up to 33 of all men have had a homosexual encounter , then there must

cite a survey , other than the obviously bogus kinsey studies.

be an even larger percentage of people who have had homosexual erotic
fantasies. but if less than 10 of the population is gay , what can we
say about these people who do n't identify as gay but have demonstrated
gay potential. obviously , a large chunk of these people chose (or ,
more accurately , were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction) to put those feelings aside , to be heterosexual.

obviously , cramer and kaldis fall into this category.

why do n't you think generals have any place in law enforcement \?

if the atf fbi had proof that koresh was

a child molester
a child abuser
a wife abuser
bigamist
sexual deviant (not a crime in all 50 states , yet)
as well as
illegally modify weapons

why was n't he simply arrested during one of his morning jogs \? why did
the allegations of child wife sex crimes only come out after the branch
davidians repelled the initial assualt \?

was it because it became necessary to demonize david koresh \? do you
feel responsible for the deaths of over 80 people \? how many would be alive to
day if koresh had been arrested outside the compound \?


inquiring minds want to know.

although janet was installed after the siege began , her purge of the
justice dept. leaves only her people in charge.

its not plastic , its woven material.

but i think you miss the point.
its not about the five bucks in your pocket , its about supporting the
march and helping to pay for all the printed materail and scehdulkes and
organisation and...

all leading up to the literal birth of queer visibility in this country.

up to this point all our news coverage has been driven by events thatb
happen to us.
this event is happening by our direct action.
of course the last mow was the same thing but they ignored us.
i guess that was just labor pains.
perhaps they will ignore us again , in which case we will come in

lst night in dc there were so many queers out and about you could hardly get

i suspect thatb over the next two days that will become exponentially
larger.

to my mind this is a physical bsuting down of the collective closet of

the word some sums it up , alot of scientist have concluded that without a
doubt global climate will is occur(ring) and should be dealt with by source

without a doubt some warming will occur. however there is mucho disagreement
on how much warming will occur.
the original doomsdayers were claiming 10 to 15 degrees farhenheit. lately
they have been saying 3 5 degrees. newer studies hint that it might be less
than a degree.

of course , then there 's the other side. an article in yesterday 's atlanta
journal stated that there are many scientists who have misgivings that the
data being used to determine whether or not global warming is occuring is
faulty. the point that the article made is that all long term temperature
dataa collected has been in urban areas , and that any heat rise can be
attributed to the growth and urbanization of the area. they called it
the asphalt temperature trend . we have no real long term data on remote
areas , such as the middle of the amazon rain forest , or the top of mt. everest
or the gobi desert , for that matter. an accompanying article mentioned that
a group of scientists at nasa had developed a method for using a satellite
to collect temperature data globally , and that preliminary results showed
a slight downward trend attributed to the mt pinatubo eruption. it went
on to say that even with the current downward trend , there appeared to be
no change in global temperatures using trend prediction methods for at
least the next 50 years.

basically , i think this tendency for non african americans to believe that
something is wrong with us exists because non african americans do n't want to
deal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african
americans , and that this is about 80 of the problem.

there is something terribly wrong , however , with a culture which
condemns , attacks , and all too often kills any of its members who
attempt to get an education. my mother is an elementary school
teacher , and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
his her peers of trying to be white , and is beaten , bullied , and
tormented by them. it goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating. in my mother 's school , one of the most promising young
students , who happened to be african american , had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs.

nobody who buys into such a culture has any hope of being anything but
poor and or a thug and or dead , regardless of their color.

what has to be changed is the culture. if that culture ca n't be
changed , then those african american kids who are willing to separate
from it must be separated from it and the murderous thugs of whatever
color. otherwise , future bright young african american girls who
wanted to be doctors will end up dead on the school bus.

remarks by the president
during presentation of teacher of the year award

the rose garden


1 25 p.m. edt


the president good afternoon. please be seated. i
want to say , first , how delighted i am to be here with secretary
riley and with senator graham. the three of us served as governors
together during the 1980s when we worked constantly on strategies to
improve our schools , when we led often difficult and long efforts to
upgrade the standards in american education and to improve the
quality of instruction our children were receiving.

there were no two governors whom i admired more during
that period than the two who now stand on this stage with the teacher
of the year. and i think both of them would join me in saying that ,
after all the testimony has been heard and all the bills have been
passed and the funds have been raised and allocated , it all comes
down to what happens between the teacher and the students in the
classroom.

that 's why today 's ceremony honoring the national
teacher of the year is so important. tracey leon bailey is one
recognition all across our country for highly advanced and innovative
science programs. he 's developed and introduced into florida 's
classrooms cutting edge programs in molecular biology and dna
fingerprinting subjects usually taught only in college and , i
might add , probably only dimly understood here in the nation 's
capital. (laughter.)

within three years of being hired by a satellite high
school , mr. bailey 's institution had one of the strongest science
programs in the entire state of florida , and it won numerous national
and international awards. these advanced programs are n't just for a
favored few. tracey bailey has inspired all kinds of students ,
including those previously known as low achieving or at risk to reach
for excellence and to attain it. this is what our students need and
what our country needs.

today , we know that a good future with high wages and
rich opportunities rests on the foundation of quality education for a
lifetime. the basics are n't enough anymore. all our kids need
competence in math and science and advanced problem solving. that 's
why tracey bailey 's accomplishments are so important and why i am so
pleased and proud to participate in recognizing and honoring these
accomplishments.

tracey , you represent the best in the united states.
i'm glad to recognize you today and to formally present you with this
apple award as the teacher of the year for 1993. (applause.)

mr. bailey thank you , mr. president. it is indeed a
great honor and a tremendous responsibility to represent the nation 's
2.5 million teachers. and we appreciate the support that you have
shown for education , and we 're looking forward to working with you to
help redesign and improve our nation 's schools.

we know that the quality of our children 's education
will directly impact the future of our economic and social landscape
in the years to come. and we thank you so much for your continued
support and commitment to our children 's education. thank you again.
(applause.)

the president in closing , i would like to also welcome
the education leaders in florida who are here , those representing the
national education groups who have also come. i 'd like to recognize
tracey 's congressman , representative jim bacchus in the back , himself
a great advocate of education. and i 'd like to remind all of you
that the ultimate purpose of the national teacher of the year award
is to find a way for the rest of us to express our appreciation to
people all across this country who give their lives to our children ,
all of the teachers of this country who get up every day and do their
best to try to advance the cause of learning for all the children of
america. they are , in so many ways , our most important public
servants.

thank you very much. (applause.)

why is an accidental fire more plausible than a mass suicide ,
considering that the davidians were an apocalyptic cult with
a history of armed violence \?

because the place was a tinder box with straw bales for insulation , and they
would n't have time to die from smoke inhalation before the fire reached them.
those people burned to death , a truly horrible and agonizingly painful way to
die , which i do n't think even a fanatic would willingly inflict on himself , let
alone his family.

you do n't know much about the fall of diem 's government in vietnam.
or the traditional indian practice of suttee. people have been
burning themselves to death (or willing to go through such and end)
for political and religious reasons since the beginning of time.
also , death from smoke inhalation is little better than dying from
the flames themselves. think about breatning in searing toxic
gasses. it 's not pleasant.


to anyone who remembered jim jones and who thought that mass
suicide was a real possibility , self immolation would simply not be the method
of choice.

then again , to a buddhist monk , it might be. to each his own.

far more likely to be bombs , bullets , or poisoned kool aid. that 's
not to say they definitely did n't do it i do n't make claims either way but
i find the idea implausible enough to want to see the gov't thoroughly inves
tigated to determine if they started the fire by accident.

i'm waiting to see what the government has , too.

i ca n't really speak for mr. cramer here , but i can say that a
homosexual male is an entirely different animal than a lesbian.
there is virtually nothing that is analogous or related between the
aberrant behaviors practiced by these two groups of deviants.

the last time i checked homosexual men and women were both human.

i think mr. kaldis was using the expression in the slang sense ,
though i agree it is not an appropriate expression to use in this
context.

they both prefer to engage in sexual acts with people of the same
gender. there is nothing inherently wrong with the trademark behaviour
of either homosexual men or homosexual women , except in the minds of
misinformed folk , clueless folk , and bigots.

so what makes homosexual men and homosexual women different animals \?

michael d. adams (starowl@a2i.rahul.net) enterprise , alabama

1. that homosexual men are extremely promiscuous , and homosexual women
are , if any more promiscuous than heterosexual women , it 's not by

2. that homosexual men are overrepresented among child molesters
(about 30 of child molestation is done by homosexual or bisexual
men) , while homosexual women do n't appear to be similarly over
represented.

in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive
the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the
suicide murder of his other 80 followers. according to the account given
the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. the koresh gun supporter
claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up. if the
aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. for all practical purposes
they were unarmed , the b d followers had automatic weapons.

...
the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require
them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through.


i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the
government 's handling of the waco situation as gun supporters .
your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right wing
gun nuts , and just mixes up two issues.

i am one of the batf fbi critics , and yet i am a liberal
and just as anti gun as you are. i just happen to believe
that everyone has civil rights , even religious crazies.
they 're all human beings , not some nest of wasps that
you 're trying to exterminate.

the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled
the original raid. it was well known that koresh regularly
went jogging outside his property. he could have been served
with a search warrant then. he could have been arrested if
he had refused to comply. instead officers armed with grenades
invaded the property. this escalated into a shooting war
with tragic deaths on both sides.

those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of
asking for a no knock warrant , and the bad and probably
illegal way the already unwise warrant was served.

at this point , the situation escalated to where it was
described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.
that 's when the government started covering their traces ,
sealing the warrant , revising their reported history of
the incident , etc.

things were already building up to disaster. now the
government could have simply closed the supply routes
and waited. but according to janet reno , that option
had never been seriously considered . so , supposedly
because the agents were frustrated and fatigued , and
because there supposedly were no backups , they felt
they had to go in.

yes the govt handled it in the rambo hollywood type style
with extreeme machismo. perhaps thats not the way to handle
it.

it is a completely different thing to start asserting as many
have done that the government is primarily to blame. the comparisons
with the nazis in particular are purely gratuitous.

since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your
post desreves to be taken seriously. peter nelson also made some
very good points about how a low key approach might have been
more effective.

the point is though that you learn through mistakes. the govt
played the wrong card and lost. thats not a big deal. they
had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they
just were not prepared for wuite this situation. who could be \?

if the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps
be able to castigate the govt if they used the same tactics and failed
in the same way. as it is i ca n't say that i would not have made the
same mistake. maybee i would n't because i do n't as a rule go in
for a confrontational situation if i can avoid it. maybee i would
because with all those press about its very difficult not to try
the macho stuff.


the fbi had information from within the compound we had no access
to. they may have calculated that the b d followers resolve was
cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. they
knew that koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. this
may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have
been a weapon for breaking his resolve. again in panama they had used
the heavy rock music to great effect during bush 's invasion. funny that
few of the koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the
death of several thousand pananmanian civilians while the us govt attempted
to arrest their former ally.


and please let 's not turn this into a pro gun vs. anti gun
discussion. anti gun people do not believe that gun owners
deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government
agents. and koresh 's civil rights exist whether his
guns were legal , illegal , illegal but should have been legal ,
or whatever !

koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired
on the police helicopter. no matter whether the warrant was or
was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out
thought that it was. thus the assault on them was completely
inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to
employ.

of course we have to consider the guns issue. that is the whole
core of the question. everything else is a diversion.

1. people will start coming out.

2. they will commit suicide in mass at some point.


the thing to remember about (2) is that hysterical situations and assults
play into the hands of a leader who has picked this course. its
much easier to stampede people into something like suicide if there
is gas coming in and bullets in the air. let them be hungry and miserable
for longer and longer and it will probably be more effective.

the possiblity that they would all kill themselves at some
point would not bother me in the least or alter tactics. if people
are going to take their own lives , the best you can probably do is
prevent yourself from giving them the opportunity or an excuse to
do it.

if the fbi and attorney general vampira really were concerned

have turned the water to the compound off as a pressure tactic in

to explain my position on the war on drugs , i offer this

drugs and crime a new approach

by ken barnes


given that

1. the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for
much of the crime which afflicts our nation.

2. people who want drugs (particularly people who
are predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get
them , whether or not they are legally available.

3. despite current law enforcement efforts , drugs
are readily available to those who want them.

4. addiction to drugs , both legal and illegal , is
responsible for a significant drain on the productive
resources of our country , and this occurs in a variety
of ways , from the cocaine addicted babies who are
unable to learn , to the spread of disease among
addicts , to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse
and tobacco smoking.

5. a general economic principle of government is
that whatever is subsidized you get more of , and
whatever is taxed you get less of. to be most
effective in confronting the nation 's drug problem ,
some way must be found to utilize these additional
powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use
less attractive.

while this country 's current efforts to combat
legal drugs have succeeded in some respects , (there is
a greater awareness of the health consequences of
smoking , and designated driver programs have helped
reduce drunk driving , for example) , the same cannot be
said for the war on illegal drugs. there remains a
core group of illegal drug users which support
international networks of smugglers , pushers , growers ,
processors , kingpins , and gangsters. these networks
and their marketing activities , which include drive
by shootings , corrupting law enforcement authorities ,
and smuggling weapons , are directly or indirectly
responsible for a large proportion of the crimes
committed in our country every day.

clearly , illegal drugs and rising crime are
linked. it takes only a moment 's reflection to
recognize how they are linked. the link is money. as
with this country 's failed effort to prohibit alcohol
consumption , a black market has been created , in which
greedy local monopolies , like the gangsters of a
bygone era , have profited enormously from their
illegal trade. the victims of this trade include not
only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be
caught in the crossfire , but , i would argue , the drug
users themselves.

were it not for the black market , and the violent
monopoly of the drug lords , drug users might not be
the thieves , robbers , prostitutes and murderers they
have become in order to pay the high prices the drug
lords demand. in the absence of the drug lords , most
would be , i believe , simply people with a problem ,
either a moral problem or a medical problem , but not a
criminal problem.

let me be clear however , i am not advocating that
we let the criminals who have been preying on our
society for these many years of prohibition off the
hook. on the contrary , the new approach i advocate is
one which would not result in either the government or
private industry getting into the business of
promoting crack cocaine , or any other presently
illegal drug for that matter. neither is it an
approach which sees law abiding citizens handing over
more and more of their freedom and privacy in an
effort to track down illegal drug users , until the
land of the free and the home of the brave looks like
a police state.

here then is my proposal

1. possession and use of all presently illegal
drugs is decriminalized , but buying and selling them
remains illegal. 'potheads' can grow their own
marijuana (as many already do today) , other drug users
can legally import their poison of choice as long as
they pay the tariffs , and a barter economy of drug
experimenters develops.

2. because of the barter economy which supplies
the drug users , the black market profits that have so
enriched the drug lords dwindle. if these drugs can
be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing , why buy
them \? nevertheless , there will be those who will seek
to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively
low prices. therefore ,

3. law enforcement activity is concentrated on
those individuals who continue to buy and sell , and
also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to
afford even low prices. but here is where the
strategy begins to differentiate between the drug
dealers , the victimizers , and the drug users , their
victims.

4. upon arrest for any crime , suspects are
permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a
drug test. those who choose to cooperate are informed
that upon conviction for the crime they are accused
of , if they are found to be a drug user , they will be
institutionalized until they are clean , and only then
will they begin to serve their sentence. if they
choose to cooperate and are already drug free , they
can begin to serve their sentence right away. those
who choose not to undergo the drug test and are
convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer
sentences.

5. institutionalization of drug using criminals
serves several purposes

drug using criminals (and this includes drunk
and or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their
sources of supply , thus reducing the total number of
drug users in society at large , and consequently
decreasing the demand for drugs on the street , putting
more of the remaining drug dealers out of business.

institutionalization provides an incentive for
drug using criminals to straighten themselves out ,
before becoming part of the general prison population.

while helping protect society from crime ,
institutionalization could also serve to deter drug
users from becoming criminals , since drug using
criminals , unlike other criminals , would be delayed
prior to serving their sentences by the additional
time it takes for them to sober up.

institutionalization of drug using criminals
separate from the general prison population would also
provide a closely monitored pool of addicts who could
volunteer for research studies of new techniques and
treatments for addictive disease , with the potential
to benefit both themselves and others.

6. dealers in illegal drugs are generally not
drug users themselves , and this is particularly true
of the drug bosses or kingpins running large illicit
organizations. under this proposal , dealers would be
more readily identifiable , since upon arrest they
would presumably pass the drug test , or else decline
to take it in order to avoid having to explain why
they are in possession of drugs when it is apparent
they do not use them. declining to take the test ,
they would of course face stiffer penalties. while
each case of attempted sale of a noncommercial drug
would have to stand on own its merits , the outcome of
a suspect 's drug test could provide additional
evidence for the prosecution.

7. just as cigarette taxes have contributed to
the decline of smoking in our country by making
cigarettes more costly while at the same time
providing revenue for anti smoking campaigns ,
noncommercial drugs should be taxed , and the money
generated should be used to combat their use.
enforcement of this tax should be on a voluntary basis
however , and should not be used as an excuse to
infringe on the rights and privacy of noncommercial
drug users , since to do so would have the effect of
reintroducing prohibition.

instead , drug users will be encouraged to pay the
tax by reminding them that if untaxed drugs are ever
found in their possession during the course of routine
police operations , they will be required to pay the
tax immediately or else forfeit their untaxed drugs to
be destroyed. if drug dealers are found to be selling
noncommercial drugs on which taxes have not been paid ,
they will face additional prosecution for evading the
tax. the strategy of adding tax evasion to drug
dealing charges is already in use in some
jurisdictions , but its effectiveness is currently
limited by the illegality of drug possession.

revenue from drug possession taxes and import
tariffs would be used to fund anti drug advertising
campaigns , and provide support to private sector drug
treatment programs for those unable to afford
treatment.

8. taxpayer subsidies to all drug producers must
be ended. federal support of tobacco farming is both
immoral and wasteful in this era of tight budgets , and
the marijuana crops grown illicitly on federal lands
in many states must likewise be eliminated.

while my proposal would have the effect of
permitting the use of what are now illegal drugs , it
would hold the users of all drugs responsible for
their actions , and i believe , would reduce the harm
drugs have on our society , particularly the crime
caused by the illegal drug trade. so long as we
remain a free nation , with relatively porous borders ,
and freedom for our citizens to travel , we will always
have a drug problem. whether it takes the form of
heroin addicts dying in abandoned buildings , drunk
drivers killing and maiming others on our streets , or
emphysema patients struggling for breath after a
lifetime of smoking , the results are the same
needless suffering and death. as a society we must
recognize that while our society permits us to harm
ourselves with drugs , as we are already doing
(regardless of the drug laws) , we must take a stand
against the harm that drugs and drug users cause to
others. we must particularly oppose the vicious and
violent cartels which prey on the weakness of drug
users. by taking the profits out of their deadly
trade , my proposal goes a long way towards shutting
down these powerful criminal organizations.

the question of whether drug use is a moral or
medical problem depends on which group of drug users
you 're talking about. different drugs have different
effects , and some are more addictive than others. the
addictiveness of a drug also often varies between
individuals , and so we have some people who can drink
alcohol in moderation , while others find they cannot
resist the bottle. nicotine , which former surgeon
general c. everett koop declared to be as addicting as
heroin , is a legal drug with known harmful effects ,
and while some people can stop smoking by willpower
alone , others continue to smoke even after treatment
for lung cancer.

for those individuals who can stop taking drugs
on their own , we may argue that because they have
chosen to use them , this represents a moral failure on
their part , or an unwillingness to face the
difficulties of life. but for the addicts , while they
may have chosen to use drugs the first time , by the
time they discover their addiction it is too late. we
cannot hold them responsible for their disease , any
more than we would blame someone who is drowning for
an inability to swim. perhaps they should have known
not to go near the water , or perhaps someone should
have warned them of the danger , but in their present
circumstances warnings will not help. neither does it
help for the drug dealers on the shore to be tossing
them weights.

witnesses , and the batf has no tanks , nor am i aware of either the batf or
the fbi using any until yesterday. when they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.

these surviving witnesses being members of which cult pray tell \? \?


the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.

underarmed \? you flabberghast me , they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet proof vests ! they were using concussion
grenades and full auto weapons , what was missing low yield tac nukes \? this
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used , both initially and yesterday. you should be ashamed.

we were having a discussion about whether bush would have done anything
differently. on the basis of panama , grenada , tripoli , kewait etc we
decided that bush would have asked for a surgical airstrike or used a
cruise missile , some people suggested that he would have used the nuke
warhead cruise , others pointed out that he would be too cheap to use 'em.

what was missing \? armoured vehicles !


if anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.

they had a sure fire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney tune religious
stunt.

phil , i 've been reading your postings for months and i'm convinced that you
will back anything , no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else 's rights if you think it will hurt people you do n't like. it 's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the holocaust , a process
that is in place now in this country , even if the tattered , pitiful remains
of the constitution is slowing its progress. this is n't a libertarian issue ,
others may argue that line , but from a strictly constitutional view of a
democratic gov't , what the fbi and batf did was wrong , wrong , wrong , even if
their reasons for trying to arrest koresh were 100 right. anything that
leads to the deaths of 17 children , if nothing else touches your stoney
heart , is wrong no matter who pushed the button. for god 's sake , man , get
your morality back.

the person who murdered 17 children was koresh. he kept them there and
brought about their deaths deliberately.

you may consider that i am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
thats quite true. i do n't pretend to be. being nice is what amateurs
try to do. if you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children. anyone who has held the office of president
of the united states since fdr has held the threat that if the usa
or its allies were to be threatened then the usa would risk nuclear
holocaust in order to protect freedom. beleive it or not , that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make. do they have a gun nutters
section of the us version of cnd by any chance \?


there are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as koresh or hitler. if it were not for the consideration
of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance. it is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.

the latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by koresh loyalists during the fire. if proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote koresh as some sort of role model or hero.


i need hardly add that it is koresh that has created the holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.

critisism is too easy. what solutions do people have that would have been
better than what the fbi had been doing for the last few months \?

firstly , they could have backed off. when you put a power freak , like
david koresh , in that kind of situation he is going to explode. (no pun
intended). koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands.

if the government had n't given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened.

secondly , the davidians were expecting everything the government did.
they thought that they were facing the apocalypse , and that they were to perish
in fire. they were n't scared of the fbi. they are not the average hoods , they
are very devout followers of a religion. psyops did n't work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them.

the batf should have left at the beginning , they should have looked at
koresh 's personality. instead they thought , they have guns. we have bigger
guns. let 's go get 'em !

they botched it from day one. they should n't have been there in the
first place.


the above conveniently ignores the murder of four batf agents by the
branch davidians in an unprovoked ambush.

any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish. had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

the president on february the 28th , four federal

against the branch davidian compound , which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition , and placed innocent children at risk.
because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective , a 51 day

the federal bureau of investigation then made every

ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were

phill , the batf were in a firefight with the bd for forty five
minutes. i find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they would n't have shown up in live stock trailers and would
have retreated immediately.

not a smart move. unless meant to be part of the surprize cover. even so
the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea. a side opening
truck would have been much better , more like a covered waggon.


if they were expecting peacful citizens , why show up with over

sounds just about right to me. its the minimum amount of force that i
would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns

michael hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including

are all tort cases really eminent domain cases then \? what about
bankruptcy \? contract \?

eminent domain is a state mandated transaction in which one party is
required to sell a piece of property which it owns to another party ,
regardless of whether the first party wishes to sell at all , at a price
which is set by the state. i fail to see how this doctrine can be found
in tort , bankruptcy or contract cases in general. well , okay , sort of
in bankruptcy...



if so , so what \? since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements
from other parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts
by those other parties \? wdstarr

since you said that boomer 's reliance on economics led to an unjust
result. i'm pointing out that your alternative is far more unjust , in
the traditional sense of the world.

atlantic cement 's act was not wrongful. it did something that we as
a capitalistic society should want them to do build a factory , create
industry and jobs. the cost of compliance was grossly
disproportionate to the damage faced by plaintiffs.

bang. here 's one of the places where we widely diverge. you believe
that the courts , in deciding a civil dispute between two parties , should
consider as a factor perhaps as an overriding factor issues which
i believe the court should ignore as being irrelevant to the dispute.
boomer v. atlantic cement co. was an action brought by one party ,
boomer , whose property rights were being violated on an ongoing basis by
another party , the atlantic cement company. the facts supported
boomer 's contention that atlantic cement was wrongfully damaging his
property , and boomer asked the court to order atlantic cement to stop
doing so. end of story. there was no reason for the court to consider
such issues as what a capitalistic society would want atlantic cement to
do or whether the cost of compliance was disproportionate to the damage
faced by the plaintiffs. those issues had nothing to do with the case
before the court.

bill , if the government had stepped in and the epa made a regulation
requiring multi million dollar cement plants to be shut down because
of a smattering of cement dust , at a cost benefit ratio of 15 1 ,
you 'd be up in arms. why is it okay for the judicial branch to
interfere this way , but not the legislative or executive branches \?

i 'd be up in arms \? why do you assume that \? quite the contrary , i 'd
probably support the action , since it would be based on the same general
doctrine as the decision that i believe would have been correct in
boomer the idea that people 's property rights should not be violated
for reasons of economic efficiency. in boomer it was boomer 's
property rights which i believe the court should have protected in the
hypothetical epa ruling you 've presented , it 's the american people 's
collective property rights in a healthy physical environment. what
good is cost benefit ratio of 15 1 if you wind up with cement dust in
your air \?



your rule makes it per se illegal to ever operate a cement plant.
if the state of massachusetts came up with a similar regulation ,
you 'd be up in arms and complaining about interference with
property rights , and fifth amendment violations. once again why
is it okay for the judicial branch to interfere this way , but not
the legislative or executive branches \? or are you not the
libertarian you present yourself as being \? ted frank

how would it be per se illegal to operate a cement plant \? would n't
it just mean that when buying land for a cement plant , you would
have to either buy enough land so that most of the pollution would
stay on your land , or buy pollution easements from the surrounding
landowners \? tim smith

all it takes is one holdout out of hundreds of neighbors to scrap the
plant. furthermore , each of the neighbors is going to want the full
benefit of the bargain under the resulting bilateral monopoly. a
bonanza for lawyers , to be sure , who get to negotiate each of these
agreements , a windfall for homeowners who can extort away any profits
the plant would make , but not particularly good for society.

yes. so what \? the courts are supposed to protect the specific rights
of individuals , not the general interests of some nebulous society. if
society can have its cement plant without violating anyone 's rights ,
fine. otherwise society will somehow have to limp along with one less
cement plant. (see , ted , i really am a libertarian after all ! )

that 's the whole point behind the coase theorem. in a world without
transactions costs , the land will automatically be put to the best
use , as it is transferred from person to person instantaneously
without friction the legal regime will not matter , because the result
will be the same. in a world such as ours , one with transactions
costs , one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to
begin with , in order to minimize the transactions costs.

one wants the legal regime to approximate the end result to begin with ,
in order to minimize the transactions costs. \? \? \? which one are you
speaking of \? i want the legal regime to protect people 's rights.
besides , coase 's theorem only has real application in the never never
land of perfectly rational actors. in the real world (1) some people
are going to be stubborn , ornery , spiteful or otherwise irrational
from a economic point of view and (2) the purpose of the courts is to
protect their right to be so. i do n't care if you can show me logically
that your cattle are only doing 100 of damage to my property per head ,
so i should rationally sell you grazing rights to my land for , say , 150
per head i still retain the right to tell you that i just plain do n't
want any damned cattle on my property , not at any price.



and then you say everyone 's property rights were protected the
plaintiffs were made whole unnecessary settlement costs were
avoided. as above , i dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were
made whole. they were , in fact , by court action deprived of their
rights as owners of property to choose to sell or not sell that
property at a price acceptable to them. wdstarr

then , by your argument , no tort plaintiff is ever made whole , because
the award of damages in involuntary. why should we treat a nuisance
plaintiff any different than any other tort plaintiff \? we do n't
require specific performance in the analogous contractual situation
why in tort \?

last question first for the same reason as in contract law because
to do so would come dangerously close to treading on the thirteenth
amendment.

as to your then , by your argument , no tort plaintiff is ever made
whole , because the award of damages in involuntary claim , you 're at
least partially right. faced with situations in which the wrong has
already been done and the damage to the victim has already taken place
and cannot be reversed or undone , courts will try to set an equitable
price tag on the loss suffered by the victim and require the wrongdoer
to pay this price (rather than an inflated price which the victim might
prefer). in these cases , the sale has already taken place and is
irreversible , and the court simply tries to ensure that a fair price is
paid , under the doctrines that (a) only in certain circumstances should
even a civil wrongdoer be forced to pay punitive or excessive prices and
(b) even a genuine victim should not profit in an unjustified or
inequitable manner from his victimhood. both of these doctrines may be
worth discussing or debating elsewhere , but neither is relevant to cases
like boomer in which the wrongful act and the loss stemming from it
are still in the future and can be reversed undone (i.e. , prevented
from happening at all) by order of the court.

in these types of cases , all the court has to do is require that the
potential victim 's property rights are protected until and unless he
agrees to sell them at a mutually acceptable price. there is no need
for the court to guess at the equitable value of the loss and force both
sides to accept its finding. it can leave that operation up to the
parties themselves.

and again i ask since when are the courts supposed to be in the
business of ensuring that unnecessary settlement costs are avoided \?
(if so , i 've been miseducated i always thought that the courts were
supposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)

unnecessary settlement costs are unjust because they are punitive.

in cases like boomer , they 're simply a cost of doing business. the
fact that the proprietors of the atlantic cement co. got themselves into
a position in which they found themselves over this barrel is simply a
result of their own poor business decision to start up a cement plant
without first trying to negotiate with boomer and everyone else whose
property rights they 'd be violating via the operation of their plant.
there 's nothing punitive or unjust about it.

(2) it is completely sensible only if you believe that the alleged
right of the owners of atlantic cement to stay in business and avoid
losing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act , and
the alleged right of several hundred atlantic cement employees to
not have their jobs disappear , should trump the rights of people who
own property which was damaged by atlantic cement 's wrongful acts.

anybody who ever commits a wrongful act should disgorge their entire
set of possessions to wronged person \? were n't you complaining about
excess punitive damages before \?

anybody who wants to commit a wrongful act in the future should be
required to buy the right to do so from the victim , in advance. and the
seller should be allowed to set his or her price for the privilege. no
injustice , no punitive damages.



you 'd like posner , bill. he 's a libertarian.

really \? i did n't know that... what , if anything , has he had to say
about cases like boomer \? wdstarr

in eal , he cites it as an example of bilateral monopoly that the court
correctly avoided. i'm sure its covered in the landes and posner book
on tort law , presumably favorably , but i do n't have that book in front
of me.

does n't sound very much like a libertarian to me. libertarians tend to
believe in the rights of individual people , not societies.



i 've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred
to as law and economics is weak. if it advocates the use of
economical analysis as one of many tie breaker factors which
courts may use to help them reach decisions in cases in which the
dispute , as measured by the scale of justice , is evenly balanced ,
fine. but as illustrated by boomer , it is not fine when the
courts start viewing the economics of a case as being more important
than the justice of a case. wdstarr

in this case the justice of the case was intricately tied up with the
economics of the case. atlantic cement committed a tort causing 185k
of damage. should it pay in the millions \? or just compensate for the
damage it committed \?

as stated above , the tort was ongoing . atlantic cement wanted to be
able to continue to violate boomer 's rights. while the court may have
been justified in setting an equitable price tag on the damage already
committed , it had no reason and no need to set a price tag on the
future violations of boomer 's rights and to then force boomer to sell
at that price.

lower than in the general population (although it seems plausible).

is this an arguement against or for \? or simply a statement of agreeance
disagreeance. the fact that there are more homosexuals in prison does not
mean that homosexuals are immoral and more liable to commit crime. and one

there is also the question of cause and effect.

shows about 2

1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

i hate to be picky , but let 's do the math. if we take the cities of

million gay people...making about 1.75 million gay men.

what \? even in san francisco , the dept. of public health estimates

mind that attempts by cdc to determine homosexual percentage in
american cities have given numbers 3 .

1 of the american male population is about 1.25 million.

so what this study says is that all gay males live in new york city or

you could work for cnn. take a few lines from a story and

the police always close off the area around a major crime

by taking pictures \?

they leave foot prints , they may drop some trash on the

, and it is a misdemeanor
to enter the closed off area. one of the photographers also quickly
spun around with a long lens camera while the officer was approaching ,
a good way to get shot.

well , that (hopefully) depends on what country one is in.

it has nothing to do with the country. you are coming toward
someone in an area where there has been violent confrontations , and
one guy spins around quickly with an object that looks like a gun.
police are not trained to stand there and let someone gun them down.

there was also no indication in that story
that they would n't get their cameras and film back after getting out
of jail.

once goverment agents have had an opportunity to check

our government is not big enough to give you everything ,

directly contradicted by the nejm study that compared crime in seattle and
vancouver , b.c. the non gun rates were roughly the same for both cities. the
difference in violent crime rates was almost totally gun related.

and as was not pointed out in the study , but in critiques
of it , (two seperate articles by james wright and david kopel come
to mind) it was pointed out that the difference was also almost
entirely minority related. that is , the gun crime rate skyrocketed
for poor minorities (blacks and hispanics primarily) while when you
compared the white majority they were virutally identical.

many of the people who never read the nejm article believe that this
critique is valid. in fact , the study explores the minority issue at length
and cites studies to back up its contention that poverty , not minority
type , is the relevant factor in violence statistics.

perhaps i failed to make myself clear minorities in the u.s.
correlate with poverty. this is n't good and we should address it ,
but we shouldnt' ignore that minorities and poverty do tend to go
together.

does vancouver have a consistantly poor population drawn along
racial lines \? if it does n't , then assumptions of being able to compare
minority vs. majority in both cities is questionable at best.

...
post hoc ergo propter hoc. those areas implemented gun control because of
the high rates.

true only to a certain extent. take washington d.c. , where
gun control was instituted while it had crime problems true , but that
crime proceeded to explode afterwards. similarly for new york.

actually , i do n't know whether any serious studies have been done for both
cities. usenet style statistical arguments are not very serious , usually
involving people sitting by computers with the latest world almanac figures.
i had heard of a study on washington , dc , that seemed to indicate a significant
drop in gun related violence there after the laws were implemented. i heard
gary kleck comment on the radio that he thought the decline in suicide rates
was related to the new laws , but he doubted their affect on other gun related
violence. i have never seen a report on the study , nor have any of my pro gun
friends had much to say about that report. remember , you ca n't just say that
crime increases indicate a failure of the laws to affect crime rates. you do n't
know whether the rate of increase would have been different without the
laws.

if the rate of increase over a period of several years remains
unchanged , or increases , i think it 's not a far jump to say that the laws
are not effective. no , you ca n't sit down and say that things would n't
have been worse. i do n't have a crystal ball and neither do you. however ,
that road leads us to a place where it is impossible to critique any
action. if it gets down to be , it might have been worse without them ,
then there is no valid objection , which i'm sure would amuse certain
people to no end.

you do n't know whether the laws prevented a threefold increase or
failed to stop a two fold increase.

so we 've got a situation where we have several options

1) the crime rate decreased obviously gun control worked.

2) the crime rate remained the same it would have been worse
without gun control.

3) the crime rate increased perhaps the laws prevented an
even bigger increase.

cute testing ground we 've got. all responses support the proposition
that gun control works.

the question is this did washington d.c. experiance an increase
in its violent and or gun crime rate which was greater than the pattern
indicated prior to the implemented gun control laws. if it did , then
the suggestion that the problem the gun control laws were designed to
control did not exist in their entirety prior to the gun control laws.

background information

advancing u.s. relations
with russia and the other new independent states

april 23 , 1993


at the vancouver summit , president clinton and president yeltsin
agreed to pursue a number of measures designed to implement an
economic and strategic partnership between the u.s. and russia.
since then , president clinton has directed that a number of steps
be taken to move this process forward. the administration is
announcing a number of steps today in order to underscore its
deep commitment to a new and closer partnership with russia based
on its government 's commitment to reform.


executive review of cold war laws

president clinton and president yeltsin discussed the
desirability of reviewing and updating u.s. laws and regulations
to reflect the end of the cold war. congress has already acted
to revise many laws to reflect the fact that a communist soviet
union has been replaced by a democratic russia and other
independent states. however , many laws and regulations remain
that contain language and restrictions that fail to reflect the
end of the cold war and that unnecessarily undermine relations
with russia and the other new independent states.

the president today has ordered an executive review of laws and
regulations so that , where appropriate and consistent with u.s.
security and other national interests , such provisions can be
revised or removed. he has asked ambassador at large strobe
talbott to coordinate this review on an expedited basis. the
president has indicated that he will welcome congressional
efforts to help this review proceed as quickly as possible.

this review will weigh all considerations that pertain to
revision of such provisions , and the initiation of the review may
help to remedy some of the circumstances that have justified such
provisions in the past. for example , because the russians are
eager to have their status changed under the jackson vanik
legislation , president yeltsin personally assured president
clinton in vancouver that he would look into individual cases
involving continuing restrictions on emigration from russia. by
addressing such issues , this review can help strengthen the bonds
of trust and partnership between the u.s. and russia , and between
the u.s. and the other new independent states.


review of cocom

it is also time to consider expeditiously with america 's allies
the future of another cold war institution the coordinating
committee for multilateral export controls (cocom). the united
states has begun a thorough review of how to reorient export
controls to the post cold war world , in which russia is no longer
viewed as a potential adversary , but as a potential ally in
combatting the proliferation of sensitive technology.

steps to improve the security relationship

the president also has taken steps to move ahead on a range of
efforts discussed in vancouver that can strengthen u.s. security
and improve our security relationship with the russians and the
other states.


accelerated deactivation of nuclear weapons

in vancouver , the two presidents discussed accelerating the
process of deactivating nuclear strategic systems scheduled for
elimination under the start i treaty. president clinton has
directed the department of defense to complete this process well
in advance of the seven year reduction period outlined in start
i. in addition , the united states , together with russia and the
other relevant states of the former soviet union , will be
exploring programs under nunn lugar to help them to accelerate
this process.


multilateral test ban

the two presidents agreed at vancouver that negotiations on a
multilateral nuclear test ban should commence at an early date ,
and that the two governments would consult with each other
accordingly. the united states looks forward to beginning
consultations with russia , our allies , and other states , on the
specific issues related to this negotiation. the united states
expects to start this consultative process within the next two
months.


detargeting

the two presidents also began a dialogue on the issue of nuclear
targeting at vancouver. as the united states and russia move
into a new relationship of strategic partnership , there is a need
to reexamine many of the assumptions and means employed in the
past to safeguard u.s. security against a nuclear adversary. the
administration is beginning a comprehensive review of measures
that could enhance strategic stability , including recent
proposals for detargeting nuclear missiles.

other measures to create a new security relationship

in response to the incident involving a collision between us and
russian submarines last month , secretary aspin will be ready to
discuss ways to avoid such incidents in the future with russian
defense minister grachev during his visit to the united states in
late may.

secretary aspin will also be prepared to move forward with
defense minister grachev in may to develop a combined training
program between our two military forces and to prepare for joint
exercises in peacekeeping , such as that authorized by the un
security council. the united states looks forward to broadening
such training and exercises to include other peacekeeping
contributors , in order to improve inter operability , readiness ,
and planning for multilateral peacekeeping operations. the us
and russia are working together to convene a may ministerial
meeting of the un security council to discuss proposals for
enhancing the un 's peacekeeping capability and to move
consideration of the secretary general 's agenda for peace from
the discussion to the implementation phase. the u.s. is also
working with the russians to focus specifically on improvements
in the financing and management of un operations. the purpose of
these initiatives will be to cooperate on peacekeeping for our
participation in un or csce sponsored actions.


multilateral and bilateral partnership with reform

finally , the administration continues to move ahead on a range of
initiatives aimed at striking a partnership with economic and
political reformers throughout russia and the other states. the
administration is continuing work with our g 7 partners to
assemble the package of multilateral assistance that secretaries
bentsen and christopher recently negotiated in tokyo. and the
administration is continuing consultation with congress over the
further efforts the u.s. will take to assist the process of
reform in russia and the other states.



the administration believes these steps can increase american
security while improving the relationship between the u.s. and
russia , and between the u.s. and the other new independent
states.

well , the obvious point to make is would straight men fuck like rabbits
if the oppertunity presented itself \?

i reckon any man would go wildly promiscuous if presented with a
huge variety of willing partners.

if true , and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference , i would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than one tenth what it is for
straights. somebody correct (flame) me please !

i cannot believe i am posting in this thread , but what
the hell , he asked for it.

i had sort of the same reaction myself when i was first realizing
i was bi. so what , 90 of everyone else is straight , i 'd never
end up with a guy anyway. as several people on soc.bi pointed
out to me , this is true only if you find partners (for relationships
or just for sex) in primarily straight circles. nowadays with gay
culture quite visible in major cities and such , you can easily
find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so
choose. (about half my friends are bi , and that 's just from
hanging out in the science fiction club and going to ucbu once a
week , it 's not as if i have to go out of my way and hang out in
bars or something.)

so the available pool for dates can be the same size. unless of
course you 're trying to date a random sample of the us population.

as for promiscuity , i 've traded email with clayton on the topic ,
and he still does n't seem to want to admit that yes , gay males
are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they 're
closeted and ca n't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.
or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed up gender
roles in our society , and when males are dating males and they 've
all been trained to be the aggressor in sex , there 's going to
be more sex. or that what 's dysfunctional , what 's screwed up
is societal attitudes , not gay sexuality , and that 's what
encourages deviant behavior in gay males.

(also note that just because someone 's had 200 sex partners
does n't mean they 're promiscuous. yes , it sounds ridiculous ,
but it 's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily
closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with
strangers , and then come out , start forming real relationships ,
and be monogamous or nearly so...)

if this is what you saw , then you did not see the start of the video.
when the vidoe starts , king is lying on the ground , surrounded by cops.
noone is beating him. king then gets up and charges one of the officers.
(powell \? ) while falling back the officer pulls out his nightstick and strikes
king with it. the blow appears to land near the shoulders of the head.

the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.

they had a sure fire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney tune religious
stunt.

phil , i 've been reading your postings for months and i'm convinced that you
will back anything , no matter how damaging it may be to yours or anyone
else 's rights if you think it will hurt people you do n't like. it 's people
with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the holocaust , a process
that is in place now in this country , even if the tattered , pitiful remains
of the constitution is slowing its progress. this is n't a libertarian issue ,
others may argue that line , but from a strictly constitutional view of a
democratic gov't , what the fbi and batf did was wrong , wrong , wrong , even if
their reasons for trying to arrest koresh were 100 right. anything that
leads to the deaths of 17 children , if nothing else touches your stoney
heart , is wrong no matter who pushed the button. for god 's sake , man , get
your morality back.

the person who murdered 17 children was koresh. he kept them there and
brought about their deaths deliberately.

you may consider that i am a complete bastard and a not very nice chap.
thats quite true. i do n't pretend to be. being nice is what amateurs
try to do. if you want to talk politics you are talking hard decisions
such as whether the lives of the troops should be risked attempting
to rescue the children. anyone who has held the office of president
of the united states since fdr has held the threat that if the usa
or its allies were to be threatened then the usa would risk nuclear
holocaust in order to protect freedom. beleive it or not , that is not
the sort of threat that nice chaps make. do they have a gun nutters
section of the us version of cnd by any chance \?


there are cases where society has to be protected from
madmen such as koresh or hitler. if it were not for the consideration
of the 17 children in there the question of the tactics to be used would
not be a matter of anything but academic significance. it is not for
the govt to prevent people from commiting mass suicide.

the latest reports are that cult members were shot attempting to
leave the compound by koresh loyalists during the fire. if proven
that would entail the final nail in the coffin of those who want to
promote koresh as some sort of role model or hero.

i need hardly add that it is koresh that has created the holocaust in
this case by the deliberate arson of the ranch appocalypse.

let me see if i got this right.

group of religious plinter schismatics erect a compound
and after at least fifty years of peaceful co existance
with the outside community (having shoot outs only with
each other) this makes them dangerous. prior history
would seem to indicate they are only dangerous to themselves.

last i knew there was no national branch davidian party
blaming the debacle in veitnam on foreign meddlers and
three two beer , calling for the rounding up of meat packers ,
growers and slaughter houses.

you want tough political choices how about letting odd balls
be odd balls \? (i know , this requires tolerance for
those that go into government but we all know people
who have no useful skills.)


ith the death of the children everybody is getting
real upset what about the other 40 plus people \?
i suppose that you consider children to be property
of the state with the family as custodians. (in the
states its the other way around children are parental property.)
if what you consider a corrupt government demands that
you send you children into their tender care i
suppose that you will obey the state and turn you children
over to their care. sorry i am not as enamoured of the
womb to tomb cradle that is ingsoc.

i find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million
queers in the march on washington. the largest figure i 've seen in
the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers. )

for another thing , 1 of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6. maybe
that 's where you got the 2.5 million number. also , the number cited
in the actual report is 1.5 so that would be about 3.75 million.

as for this march on washington , i wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time. last time , for the
pro abortion rally , they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up. that and all the stories coming out of how
the press slants the news really makes one wonder who 's watching
the watchers.

why are you all playing these pathetic number games \? the number of people
showing up at the mow hardly constitutes the entire queer populace. i doubt
that it constitutes more than a handful of us. i'm queer , and i wo n't be
there , simply because i do n't have the time or the transportation. what the
hell makes you think the participants in the mow embody more than a minimum
number \?

face it , people , we 're everywhere. there are always more of us than you
think. our numbers are constantly growing , not diminishing...some of your
children will grow up to join us. hell , some of my children may grow up to
join us. the best way to deal with this phenomenon is not to fear it and
blind yourself to it , but to realize that you have nothing to fear. we 're
not perverts , we 're not dangerous , we 're just here , and we 're human just
like you er , most of you.

idiots like cramer and kaldis can rant all they like. it wo n't do them one
iota of good.

drewcifer

p.s. i still ca n't get over the fact that some people actually believe that
every queer in the u.s. would show up at the mow , and that these numbers are
meaningful. and , come to think of it , what about those of us in other
countries \? tree.

i completely agree with you. the illegal invasion of panama was
something mr. bush never did have to answer for. remember , not
only did a lot of panamanian civilians get killed , but more than
a few american soldiers died too. all this for arresting a petty
dictator. here 's the icing on the cake to my knowledge the flow
of drugs from panama has n't slowed down at all with the removal of
noriega. so , what good did it do to remove him from power \? the
cigarette cops and the fbi killing the branch davidians in waco is
equally reprehensible.

btw , i 've cross posted this article to t.p.d. because i want to
hear from knowledgable people on whether or not the arrest of
noriega affected the drug trade in any way.

the arrest of noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the
drug trade going through panama. money laundering continues to be
panama 's main industry. in fact , it is bigger now than before noriega
was arrested 1 . panama 's current administration also has ties with
the colombian cocaine cartels 2 . and large amounts cocaine still
flow through panama on a regular basis 3 .

in photo opportunity with vaclav havel


the oval office


5 00 p.m. edt


q mr. president , president havel is here for the
holocaust museum opening , and you toured the museum last night. all
this focus on the holocaust , how does that weigh on your decision
making process as far as bosnia is concerned \?

the president well , i think the holocaust is the most
extreme example the world has ever known of ethnic cleansing. and i
think that even in its more limited manifestations , it 's an idea that
should be opposed. you could n't help thinking about that. that 's
not to compare the two examples. they 're not identical everyone
knows that. but i think that the united states should always seek an
opportunity to stand up against at least to speak out against
inhumanity.

q sir , how close are you to a decision on more
sanctions on bosnia \?

the president well , of course , we 've got the u.n.
vote. ambassador albright was instrumental in the u.n. vote to
strengthen the sanctions and they are quite tough. and we now are
putting our heads at the business of implementing them and looking at
what other options we ought to consider. and i do n't have anything
else to say , except to tell you that i spent quite a bit of time on
it and will continue to over the next several days.

q following your meeting today , sir , are you any
closer to some sort of u.s. military presence there \?

the president i have not made any decisions.




q president clinton , why have you decided to meet
with mr. havel \?

the president well , i'm just honored that he would
come and see me. i'm glad he 's here in the united states for the
dedication of the holocaust museum. he is a figure widely admired in
our country and around the world , and a very important person in
europe , and a very important person to the united states. so i'm
hoping that we 'll have a chance to talk about the new czech republic
and what kinds of things we can do together to support the causes we
believe in.

press briefing
by george stephanopoulos


the briefing room


12 36 p.m. edt


mr. stephanopoulos as you know , the president is going
to come out at 1 15 p.m. with your indulgence , i think what we 'd
like to do is have the president award the national teacher 's award
first and then have the teacher leave , or whatever , and then he 'll
make a statement on waco and take a couple questions. so if we can
just hold off going live and all that until that 's done , it probably
will work out a lot better.

q if you 'll give us the time. that 's the problem.

q we 've got a two minute warning problem.

mr. stephanopoulos yes , it is a problem. it 's about
1 15 p.m.

q the teacher would walk off and then

mr. stephanopoulos i think that 's i'm just trying
to work this out here. i think that 's the best way to handle it.

q can i ask you a series of questions about the way
the president handled the notifications yesterday \?

mr. stephanopoulos sure.

q did you , for instance , talk to the justice
department about who would come out and discuss what had happened in
waco and whether it should be the attorney general or the president \?

mr. stephanopoulos why do n't we just take a step even
farther back from that and look at the whole sequence of events on
the contact between the justice department and the white house. as
you know and as we 've said , the president spoke with the attorney
general on sunday , sunday afternoon. they had a good discussion ,
about 15 minutes. the attorney general informed the president of
what she wanted to do. he raised no objections. obviously , she had
the implicit authority from the president to go forward. he raised
no objections. she went forward. they had a discussion of a general
nature about the incident.

again , yesterday morning around 11 00 a.m. , the
president spoke with the attorney general again. they had a brief
discussion over what was happening in waco. as you know , this was
before the fire broke out at the compound. and i think that was why
there was some just some confusion. i think that she was
confusing in her minds before and after the fire , not the actual day
when they spoke.

then there was a number of contacts at a number of
different levels in the white house yesterday afternoon between the
justice department and the white house. they were informing us of

their decisions , what they would like to do. there was an fbi
briefing in waco. the attorney general had her press conference.
the president then issued a statement after that.

frankly , yesterday afternoon , you know , there was a fair
amount of confusion over exactly what was happening on the ground in
waco , and i think that we wanted to be very careful not to have the
president say anything until we had a much better sense of what was
actually happening on the ground. once we were fairly clear on what
was happening on the ground in waco , the president issued a
statement. he spoke with the attorney general again yesterday
evening.

q at what hour was that \?

mr. stephanopoulos it was quite late. i believe it
was after he returned from the holocaust museum. he took a tour of
the holocaust museum last night.

q and he went out to dinner.

mr. stephanopoulos i believe briefly. yes , he went to
dinner and then he spoke with the attorney general last night. i
do n't know the exact time i think it was relatively late. and he
just said , i think as dee dee has reported , that he just wanted to
tell her that he thought she handled a difficult situation very well ,
that she did a good job in a tough situation , and that she should try
and get some sleep. he then , again , spoke with her this morning
about the follow up in waco , and about what they 're going to do this
afternoon. as you know , the president will have an announcement to
make at 1 15.

q did he ever talk with webb hubbell yesterday , last
night , or this morning \?

mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge , no.

q was webb hubbell the point man for the white house \?

mr. stephanopoulos webb hubbell is the general white
house liaison and several people talked to webb. the attorney
general was running the operation.

q did he tell her that she should sleep well , that
she had done a good job \? or he just tell her that she should get
some sleep \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think sleep well done a good
job i do n't know the exact words. i think that sounds right.

q i mean , sleep well has implications as to
conscience and whether she should feel badly about it or not.

mr. stephanopoulos well , i mean , i think everybody
feels badly when you have a situation when

q i understand that , but whether the issue of blame
is brought up in that phraseology.

mr. stephanopoulos i think that 's the spirit no , it
has nothing to do with that. the spirit with which it was offered
was that the entire administration and certainly the attorney general
had to face a very difficult decision , a very difficult situation
yesterday. and that he thought that she had handled it well , as best
as she could and

q well , does he think it was mishandled \?


mr. stephanopoulos it was just speaking of warm
words to a friend.

q does he think the situation was mishandled \?

mr. stephanopoulos the president

q in retrospect \?

mr. stephanopoulos the president stands by the
decisions of the law enforcement agencies , the decisions of the
attorney general. he accepts full responsibility. at the same time ,
i think that we all want to look to the future and figure out what
exactly happened , do a full review , and make sure we do what we can
to make sure this does n't happen this kind of thing does n't happen
again , or at least we know how to handle it.

q how much did he know about what she was going to go
ahead with \? i know that she made the case to him explained
outlined the case for action. did she say to him on sunday precisely
what action \?

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't think it was specific
operational detail as to what was going to happen. i think that they
had a general discussion about the action , about the advisability of
action. i think , as she noted , he asked a few general questions just
trying to get a sense of how things were considered. but it was n't
minute by minute detail of how the operation

q well , was it , we are going in. is it , we 're
going to use tear gas \? i mean , what \?

mr. stephanopoulos i believe it was that we want to go
in and take some action that would increase the pressure on those in
the compound , and hopefully spur them towards some sort of movement
out.

q george , was there ever a conscious political
decision made , or even a discussion about distancing the president
from

mr. stephanopoulos not at all. i mean , we were in
close contact with the justice department. the president accepts
responsibility for this. at the same time i mean , we just wanted
to be very , very clear about how this happened and be as factual as
we could be on how the decisions were made. it is the responsibility
of those on the ground to make recommendations. the attorney general
has operational control over this. the president obviously accepts
responsibility for all of this , and he stands by the attorney
general.

q george , there was a report on the television today
and i do n't know more than that one of the members of the cult
had said going into a courthouse that the fbi had started the fire
and not themselves. there was also a picture yesterday on the tv of
a smashing into the building where the fire broke out. and my
question is , is the white house absolutely certain that this fire was


mr. stephanopoulos all the evidence we have is that
this fire was started by david koresh and those inside the compound
every bit of evidence we have.

q did the president ask the attorney general why do
this now , why this particular date , and did he ask about possible
consequences of either death or injury \?


mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know the specific
questions. he had general questions about how the decision was going
about being made.

q those are general questions and did he ask
generally , why now \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think he asked , have you
considered all of the consequences have you considered the
recommendations \? i do n't know if he asked the question , why now \?
i do n't know if he asked that specific question.

q did she tell him why now in terms of the stuff
that 's come out since then about the information provided by the
listening device about koresh getting increasingly more violent \?

mr. stephanopoulos again , i'm not certain how much
specific detail they got into. i know that she generally said that
this is the recommendation she 's prepared to make , i mean , the
decision she 's prepared to make. it 's based on the recommendations
she was receiving from the field and after intensive questioning of
those involved. again , i do not know how precisely detailed it was
beyond that.

q what is the president 's understanding why
yesterday \? one of the people who went into the compound a couple
weeks ago came out over the weekend with some speculation that he may
have told law enforcement people something that precipitated this
action. why yesterday \?

mr. stephanopoulos this is the first i 've heard. i
think what we can go to is what the fbi and the attorney general has
said. there were indications that those inside the compound were at
some danger. it was clear that the negotiations had broken down and
it was the judgment of the experts involved in the negotiations that
the situation was not going to get any better at all.

there was also some concern over the vulnerability of
the agents themselves who had been working long beyond the time that
these teams normally have to work. and as the attorney general has
said , there was some concern over the fact that they did not have
replacements in place who could stand in for them , and there was a
concern over the safety.

all of these factors came into play. they also
considered the advice of a number of psychologists and other experts
on david koresh and those in the compound. i would just go back to
what the attorney general has said. you have to make the best
judgment you can , given the information you have at the time. they
did. obviously , we all regret the loss of life. it 's a terribly
unfortunate situation. we all wish it could have turned out
differently , but that does n't take away from the judgments that were
made at the time.

q george , when did the president know that they were
going to use tear gas \? was it before the assault on the compound \?

mr. stephanopoulos i just do n't know. i do n't believe
he was given a lot of detail on exactly how the operation would go.
i just do n't know.

q along that point , george , can you say whether the
plan was presented to the president by the attorney general as a way
to end the standoff one way or the other yesterday \?


mr. stephanopoulos i think it was presented as a way
to increase the pressure on those in the compound and , we all hoped ,
as a way to move some of those out and bring it in it was n't
presented as tomorrow is d day , this is it.

q is the president satisfied that , a , he had all this
relevant information necessary to make a decision , and b , that janet
reno had all the relevant information necessary to make a decision \?

mr. stephanopoulos oh , i think he 's satisfied that
they were acting on the best advice and the best information they
had , and he 's not second guessing it in any way whatsoever.

q george , was there a 12 hour gap between
conversations between the president and the attorney general \? in
other words , they spoke at 11 00 a.m. and they did n't speak again
until clinton got back from dinner at

mr. stephanopoulos i think that 's likely , yes.

q did he call her \? what time did she call \? was
there a gap between when she called him \? i mean , was he at dinner
when she called and

mr. stephanopoulos no , no , no. i think he called her
last night. i could n't swear to it , but i believe he called her last
night. he just wanted to talk to her.

q what was going on \?

mr. stephanopoulos not that i know of , no.

q what do you know about the situation now \? everyone
has perished who except eight or nine \? and do you know any of the
other details \?

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know any more details than
the fbi reported in waco.

q watching cnn or how was he keeping track of what
is going on \? if he was n't talking to his attorney general , how was
he keeping track of what was going on here \? i mean , with all due
respect to cnn , is that how he was doing it \?

mr. stephanopoulos no. there was also as i said ,
several people in the white house were in constant contact with their
counterparts at justice to have the full and complete information.

q who were those contacts \? i mean , was it mack
mclarty , webb hubbell \? how was the president being kept informed \?
that 's not a

mr. stephanopoulos i believe mack was in contact with
webb. i spoke with several people at the justice department. i
believe bruce lindsey spoke with people at the justice department.
either bernie or vince was also in contact at different times during
the day with people at the justice department. we were fully briefed
and fully informed.

q we were told this morning that the president may
have spoken a chance that he may have spoken with webb. do you
know if that 's true or not \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think there 's a chance he may
have. i do n't believe he did , but i think there 's certainly a chance
that he may have at some point. i do n't believe he did. i think
that the last contact he had during the day yesterday directly with

the justice department was the 11 00 a.m. phone call with the
attorney general. but the white house was fully informed on a
minute to minute basis of what was happening in waco and what was
happening at the justice department.

q george , who decided that the briefing would be done
by the attorney general \?

mr. stephanopoulos the attorney general.

q did you or did the white house communications staff
were you ever involved with that decision \?

mr. stephanopoulos no. we were told about it.

q did you ask her to go on nightline and macneil
lehrer and all that stuff \? was that part of

mr. stephanopoulos no.

q there was no advice from the white house at all
about her she was on all night , all day. (laughter.)

mr. stephanopoulos yes , and she did a very good job.

q why did you decide to have the president 's reaction
to the situation be only a written statement , which is traditionally
the white house 's way of distancing the president from the issue , not
having him appear as personally saying anything \?

mr. stephanopoulos well , that was n't the intent at
all. as i said , we had to we wanted to wait until we had all of
the information at hand. the president is also making a statement
today. the president made a statement yesterday morning. the
president has been fully involved

q after this turned into less than a successful
operation , the only statement from the president was what was on
paper after the attorney general had already given what amounted to
the major facts in this.

mr. stephanopoulos well , it was the first statement
from the president , not the only statement from the president , number
one.

q after the

mr. stephanopoulos number two well , the first.
number two , the attorney general

q he gave a statement early in the morning when the
thing was starting to move

mr. stephanopoulos right. and he gave one yesterday
and he 's giving one today. now , the second point

q it just happens this was a written statement with
no sort of communications policy or thought process involved \? it was
the president wants to put out a written statement \?

mr. stephanopoulos knowing what we knew at the time ,
we thought it was appropriate for the president and he thought it was
appropriate to put out a written statement expressing his regret and
expressing his support for the attorney general 's

q why was it not appropriate for him to personally do
something \?


mr. stephanopoulos well , he did personally do so.
that is his statement. it 's a statement under his name.

q george , yesterday during the briefing you did n't
say the president took full responsibility for what happened

mr. stephanopoulos i certainly did.

q no , what you said was

mr. stephanopoulos that 's just not right , susan.

q well , i think you can go back to the transcript , i
mean , unless i miss something

mr. stephanopoulos i 'd love to.

q janet reno said that she took full
responsibility and you said that she made the decision , that the fbi


mr. stephanopoulos and the president takes
responsibility. absolutely.

q took responsibility all right.

mr. stephanopoulos check the transcript.

q considering how little was known about what was
going on inside the compound and , even now , how little is known , why
is washington calling this a mass suicide \?

mr. stephanopoulos well , i think that knowing what we
know now and given all of the actions of david koresh before and
during , it is painfully clear that those there were under his
control.

q it 's stretching it a little bit where the kids are
concerned , though , is n't it , george \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think that that is an entirely
different matter. i mean , i think that david koresh must bear
responsibility for the deaths of those children , absolutely. but he
clearly was intent on creating some kind of an apocalyptic incident ,
and that 's what he did.

q you 're still operating completely on assumption ,
right \? i mean , you have no evidence , or you know of no evidence that
this was mass suicide.

mr. stephanopoulos we have evidence that those inside
the compound set fire to the compound , which led to the deaths of
those inside.

q i did n't quite hear it. this might be ann 's
question , i did n't quite hear it. but at what time did clinton
himself put out a statement on this \? i know dee dee said some stuff
on this at 6 00 p.m. , but the president put out

mr. stephanopoulos at 6 35 p.m. , 6 40 p.m.

q right after the evening news went on the air \?

mr. stephanopoulos no , right when we had all the
information. we were working on it.


q dee dee confirmed this morning that the
investigation the president is going to announce is going to be an
administration run investigation. why not have someone from the
outside to make sure that it 's not colored by those who would have a
political stake , particularly those at the atf whose actions have
already been

mr. stephanopoulos i think that clearly the atf and
the justice department will bear responsibility for the
investigation. that 's not to rule out , as is often in investigations
like this , having some sort of independent involvement as well. but
it will be run by the treasury and justice.

q are you confident that you will not have any
problem getting

mr. stephanopoulos absolutely.

q george , did the president reach out to anybody else
to get advice after the meeting with janet reno \? and who else in the
white house sat in on that meeting \? anyone else from justice \?

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't believe anybody else was
there at the time. it was a phone call on monday , it was n't a
meeting.

q sunday.

mr. stephanopoulos sunday. it was a phone call , it
was n't a meeting. i believe he might have been there with bruce , but
beyond that , i think he just talked to the attorney general.

q george , you said that in that phone call , she said
that we want to go in and take action , as you said , that will force
him out. what did he think she was talking about \? if he did n't know
about tear gas , what exactly was his idea of what he was approving \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think he was approving an action
to increase the pressure on

q q it did n't matter how she did that \?

mr. stephanopoulos no , no. i mean

q what information did he have in terms of how this
would proceed \? presumably he would have wanted to know , not minute
by minute , but in a general sense

mr. stephanopoulos i think he knew that this was the
recommendation of those on the ground and the recommendation of the
law enforcement agencies. i just do n't know

q what is this when you say that this was the
recommendation

mr. stephanopoulos the action to increase pressure. i
do n't know exactly what he was told whether he was going to be
told that the tank was going to go up to the left wall and punch a
hole in the window , or whether he was just told generally that they
were moving forward in a way that would increase the pressure. i
just do n't know.

q it 's hard to imagine him not asking , though.

q that janet reno presented him with as her best
advice about what they should go forward with , he would have agreed \?


mr. stephanopoulos he was he did ask some general
questions about the advice and recommendation he gave. at the same
time and i would repeat that this was based on the unanimous
recommendation of the law enforcement agencies involved.

q george , it would seem that this question about just
exactly in what detail the president was informed about the nature of
the operation is going to come up again here and elsewhere. can you
take that question and

mr. stephanopoulos absolutely. yes.

q get the answer and come back to us with all of
it \?

mr. stephanopoulos yes.

q can you tell us that there was never a meeting a
strategy session where you and others decided , we will put out a
written statement from the president and we will have janet reno be
on all of these television broadcasts \?

mr. stephanopoulos never. never.

q and you never called the justice department and
said to anyone or janet reno , you 're the one who needs to be out
front explaining this \?

mr. stephanopoulos not once.

q it just happened that way that she was the
spokesman , that no one ever saw bill sessions until

mr. stephanopoulos she made a decision as attorney
general that it was important for her as the operational officer in
charge , as the person who made the decision , to go out and take the
questions on this tragic incident.

q she had no guidance from the white house at all \?

mr. stephanopoulos we certainly did n't object.

q but did you (laughter) no , i'm sure you
did n't object , but did you suggest it \? was this a plan

mr. stephanopoulos no. absolutely not.

q a strategy \?

mr. stephanopoulos no.

q did she clear it \?

mr. stephanopoulos no.

q did she notify you \?

mr. stephanopoulos we certainly knew about it.

q what happened to this great detailed process you
have for clearing and talking to every public information officer and
every under every rock and every place in government that
something as major as this could have occurred without a discussion
between you and the public information people at least at the justice
department \?


mr. stephanopoulos the attorney general made the
decision and the attorney general wanted to go forward. it seemed
like a good decision. it was a good decision. she did a good job.

q let me ask it this way , george , if in hindsight how
you would handle it \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think it was handled very well.

q you would n't change a thing if

mr. stephanopoulos change what \?

q the way the white house handled any part of it
from start to finish.

mr. stephanopoulos well , i think that 's an awful broad
question and we 're certainly going to have a review. one of the
reasons for the investigation is to look for ways in the future that
something like this see what we can learn from an incident like
this and see what we can learn about how to handle them. if you 're
talking specifically about the issue of the press conferences , no ,
there would n't make any change at all.

q two questions first of all , on her going on tv ,
no white house people or outside media consultants came up with this
idea \? it 's just very reminiscent of what you guys did during the
campaign.

mr. stephanopoulos how so \?

q i'm thinking of like watching clinton on nightline
after the draft story watching clinton on

mr. stephanopoulos there 's absolutely no comparison.
yesterday there was a law enforcement incident. the incident ended
in tragic deaths of many , many people. the attorney general was
involved in that decision. the attorney general made the decision to
do that. she felt it was her responsibility in the interest of
public information to go out and take the questions of the press in
order to make sure that all of the questions were answered , and she
did a fantastic job.

q the second question is , did as someone who knows
clinton as well as you do , can you understand why it 's sort of hard
to believe that he might not have asked some detailed questions about
what she intended to do \? in other words , she came and she said , i'm
going to put pressure on them. it 's hard not to see clinton , who 's
fairly intelligent and inquisitive , asking how.

q what kind \?

mr. stephanopoulos both the attorney general said that
he did ask questions , he did ask general questions. i do n't have a
minute by minute account of the conversation.

q how long a conversation \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think it was about 15 minutes.

q telephone conversation \?

mr. stephanopoulos yes.

q george , was the federal cost of this standoff ever
a consideration in terms of stepping up the pressure


mr. stephanopoulos i do n't believe so , no.

q george , you keep saying that the president takes
full responsibility , but then you refer to it as her decision. does
the president not accept the fact that as commander in chief , it is
ultimately his decision \?

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know what this has to do
with commander in chief. this was a law enforcement action , not a
military action. and he clearly takes responsibility for the
decisions of the law enforcement agencies involved taken in his
government. i mean , i think there 's just no ambiguity about that.

q but is he accepting it as his decision as well as
hers , or is he saying it 's her decision \? there 's a difference.

mr. stephanopoulos as a matter of fact , it was her
decision. he did not object to that decision. he clearly takes full
responsibility.

q george , this briefing has gone on just a little
over 15 minutes , and as you can see a lot of things can be exchanged.
what exactly did they spend 15 minutes talking about if it was just
very general \? that 's a long period of time in a phone conversation.

mr. stephanopoulos it is an awful long phone
conversation. it was a very important phone conversation. i think
brit has asked that we take the question , and i 've said that i would.

q one of the things reno said last night is that the
buck stops here. i think that was her direct quotation. does the
president agree with that in this case \?

mr. stephanopoulos the president says he accepts full
responsibility. i think what the attorney general was saying is that
she made a decision , that she 's going to accept all the
responsibility that comes to her. and she 's not shrinking from that
at all , but neither is the president.

q at any point in the conversation last night between
the president and the attorney general or this morning , did she ever
offer her a resignation \?

mr. stephanopoulos not to my knowledge.

q even before the fire was out yesterday , there were
some republicans on capitol hill calling for an investigation. is
the white house at all concerned about the timing of those requests
trying to make political hay out of this situation \?

mr. stephanopoulos no. and i do n't want to cast any
questions about the motives of those who are requesting
investigation. we want an investigation , and we 'll have a full and
complete investigation.

q in what forum will you answer brit 's question \?
will you put out a written statement \? will you the wires \? how
will you answer the question that you 've taken \?

mr. stephanopoulos i'm just not sure.

q george , can you remind us what the president was
doing all yesterday afternoon , where he was , and what meetings he was
involved in \?

mr. stephanopoulos i 'll have to try and remember. he
had a series of meetings with different members of the staff during

the afternoon. he was certainly monitoring the situation in waco and
getting periodic reports on that as well. he did see some on cnn as
well. i believe he saw a fair amount of the fbi press briefing as
well.

q and those reports would have come to him from mack
mclarty , would they do you think \?

mr. stephanopoulos mack talked to him , bruce talked to
him , i talked to him.

q george , to follow helen 's question , in their
conversation this morning did they discuss at all her statement last
night in response to the question about whether she would resign \?
did he say , i do n't know why you felt the need to say that \? i'm here
to reassure you that you do n't have to do this \? did that come up at
all \?

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if it even came up
that specifically. i know that the bulk of the conversation was
discussing where do we go from here and what form the investigation


q the did n't talk at all about her kind of
remarkable comment last night about

mr. stephanopoulos well , i believe she was asked a
question.

q and her response was , if the president wants me to ,
i will.

mr. stephanopoulos which would be , i think , the
standard response that most cabinet members would give. i mean , it 's
a conditional statement.

q have a need to talk about whether personally
about whether the president wanted her

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know if they talked about
it. i mean , what i learned about the conversation was that it was
largely about the investigation itself. and this just did n't come
up. i did not ask the question if they talked about

q will you take that with the brit package \?

mr. stephanopoulos certainly. (laughter.)

q george , for the record , does the president want her
to resign \? i know dee dee answered this morning

mr. stephanopoulos absolutely not. he supports janet
reno. she 's a good attorney general. she 's done a good job. she
handled a difficult situation extremely well.

q george , does the president feel that he and janet
reno were let down by the unanimous professional advice from the law
enforcement experts on the ground \?

mr. stephanopoulos no. and the president is not
second guessing that decision and those recommendations in any way.
that is not to say that he does n't regret the loss of life.
everybody regrets the loss of life in this situation. but the best
judgments were made in a difficult situation based on the best
information we had.


q george , the 15 minute conversation was the one on
sunday , is that correct \?

mr. stephanopoulos yes.

q how long was the one at 11 00 a.m. yesterday
morning \?

mr. stephanopoulos i do n't know. i 'll take that
question , too.

q were these outside experts that they were
consulting with , or experts within the atf and the fbi \?

mr. stephanopoulos you 'd have to ask them. i'm just
not sure. i know that there were several experts.

q and also , why were n't there replacements for these
people \? is the unit that small \?

mr. stephanopoulos again , i think it is a very small
highly specialized unit. but i think it 's one of the kinds of things
that the investigation will examine.

q george , is n't there a factor here involving the fbi
director \? normally , a president , when he wants to get information ,
does n't only asks the attorney general. i know the chain of command.
but presidents talk to their fbi directors. in this case , throughout
this entire siege , he has not felt that he could pick up the phone
and talk to bill sessions , who is from waco , and get expertise from
him on what to do and what not to do \?

mr. stephanopoulos i think he talked to the fbi
director well in the beginning of the situation when it first broke
out in waco. at the same time , the attorney general bears the
ultimate responsibility and he was getting fully briefed from the
attorney general.

q do n't you think the ambiguous situation that
director sessions is in has some impact on the way the president is
briefed and on the way that all of this evolved \?

mr. stephanopoulos not at all. i mean , it 's perfectly
appropriate that he be briefed by the attorney general and that the
attorney general has supervisory authority over the fbi director , and
that 's following the chain of command.

the press thank you .

does n't seem like those responsible for the assault were very concerned
about the welfare of the children inside. seems like they were more
interested in flexing their muscle before the media. my reasoning \?
just ask yourself this one question

suppose the scenario was slightly different and we had chelsea clinton
being kidnapped by terrorists , holed up in a compound for 51 days.
do you think clinton , reno , the fbi , and the atf would be so eager
to use a show of force \?

kept up with this debate on the net for some months , just about all the
criticism of the canadian system has misquoted or misinterpreted even
the anti canadian propaganda put out by the american insurance industry

in a few cases , such as mr. case , the critiques are well reasoned and
worthy of response. most others are misinformed , illogical ,

in article c5qk7t.2qk@voder.nsc.com ,
matt@galaxy.nsc.com (matt freivald x8043) said

i like to call the form of government that i advocate fractal
federalism. with fractal federalism , there is a representative
national government that has only certain limited powers to do what is
absolutely necessary at that level. next there are the state
governments , again with only absolutely necessary powers. onward to
counties , cities townships , districts , and neighborhoods...

1) the lowest (read most local ) levels are the ones that have the
most power over individuals' day to day lives , which is good because
that is the level where individuals have the most voice.

you know , if you take all this to its logical conclusion , does n't it
seem that the real lowest level... the level where individuals have
the most voice is that of the single individuals themselves \? why have
you omitted that level from your model \?

yes , and the individual is not omitted i just did n't fully articulate the
principles of fractal federalism. all government powers derive from the
people each level can receive a new power from the level below through
the amendment process , where a true consensus (say a 3 4 majority) writes
that power into the constitution of the level above (in the case of the
lowest level , an amendement is passed by a 3 4 majority vote in the case
of higher levels , it must be passed by 3 4 of the legislatures. we can
of course haggle about the specifics of true consensus when we hold our
constitutional convention ). once a power has been granted , it may be
exercised by the legislature. powers not in the original constitutions must
percolate upward , starting from the individual. the ratification process
for the original constitutions should involve consensus and not simply a
plurality or majority.

granting a right in a constitution is of course the same as empowering
the government at that level to restrict the activities of the governments
at the lower levels , so it operates in the same way as the amendment process
(again , that crazy resemblance to the supposed but not actual u.s. government
structure).

this government structure is a very frustrating one for those people (read
liberals ) who would like to have concentrated power to use the government
to force people to do good (a difficult to define word , and one that it
is difficult to reach a consensus on). it is also a frustrating structure
for those who want to use the government to dictate personal behavior (read
big government conservatives ). i personally would rather see those types
of people frustrated than the incredible erosion of liberty (both civil and
economic) that is going on now.

this is imho a good government stucture for those who see the role of
government as the protection of individual liberties , while still recognizing
that individuals need to have some influence in the type of community that
they live in.


2) a free market works on government , not just economics. succesful
ideas propogate , unsuccessful ideas die.

what is your definition of a successful idea or a successful
government \?

one which maintains peace , liberty , and the opportunity for happiness for its
people , while working within the realities of human nature. you do bring
up the point (intentional or not) that a lasting idea is by no means
necessarily a successful idea. i believe that fractal federalism would
at least bring many ideas to light , and the people would have the opportunity
to democratically choose between good ideas and bad ideas. if the
docialists , er , i mean democrats are right and government activism fosters a
prosperous people , they will have a plethora of local opportunities to
check their thesis. if libertopia is possible , it will arise. if a balanced
conservative republic is democratically received as the best level of
government activity , it will become clear to the people that it is best.



as far as set the moral tone is concerned , if a community does not
collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of
their kids , why should they have to \? if a community does not want to
see proliferation of drugs among their kids , why should they have to \?

for the same reason that they have to put up with a church operating
right out in the open , where their kids can see it , and with the owner
of the house across the street flying an american flag right out there
in the open every day in front of their kids. it 's called freedom.
if they do n't like the ideas to which their kids are exposed , they can
try to educate and persuade their kids as to why the things that they 're
seeing other people doing are wrong or bad.

right , and people would not rescind any freedoms (read empower the
government ) except through the amendment process. that is how the federal
government is supposed to work now , but the supreme soviet , er , i mean the
supreme court put a stop to that republican government nonsense.

in my hypothetical government , if there were a constitutional provision
empowering the government to regulate churches the government (whatever
level we are talking about) could indeed ban churches. the constitutional
provision would be invalid if a higher level had a constitutional provision
protecting free exercise of religion. the uppermost constitution is still
the supreme law of the land.



(i find it interesting that you applaud the idea of free market
competition among various ideas , and yet support the right of he
majority in a community to suppress ideas which they do n't like.)

it is a matter of individuals being able to control their own associations
and environment , not a matter of suppression of ideas.

one dilemma of the human condition is that individuals need liberty , and
they also need to have some control over their environment. in my
fractal federalism government , certain rights are protected by the
constitutions. other rights are protected simply because the government
has not been empowered to infringe upon them. when a consensus is reached
that the government should have a certain power , then freedom is infringed
upon. this cannot be avoided murder statutes infringe upon freedom ,
but i think that the consensus of the american people is that murder statutes
are a good idea.

i am sure that many parents believe that they have a right to control
the environment that their children live in. people feel that they have
a right to sleep peacefully at night thus , there are noise ordinances.
there are zoning laws that keep businesses from overrunning residential
neighborhoods. i do not view these as bad things (certainly some individual
instances are bad , but the concept is not necessarily bad) , i view them
as the people in a community having some control over the type of community
that they live in. i see the alternative as near anarchy.

like i said in another post , if you can come up with a scenario where an
individual can do something truly autonomously with absolutely zero
effect on anyone else then no individual or government has the right
to restrict that activity. there are simply not very many behaviors that
fit into the category of the truly autonomous , so the whole thing becomes
an issue of one individual or group having power over another individual
or group. i think that the fractal federalism approach is a sound , if
not ideal , approach to limiting this restrictive power. the libertarian
scenario degenerates to might makes right , and the system we have right
now is one of lawyers abusing natural rights philosophy to decide what
powers the government should have by subverting the democratic process
though the supreme court.



the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the
fundamental dilemma of democratic government the people have a right
to exercise a voice in their community , yet individuals have the right
to be left to themselves. this is a serious dilemma precisely because
there is not much that takes place in a vacuum.

oddly enough , if what you say is taken literally there is little or no
conflict the people do indeed have a right to exercise a voice where
voice equals persuasive speech in their communities... it 's only
when they somehow get the idea into their heads that they also have a
right to dictate behavior in their communities that the trouble begins.

i think i answered this above already , but let me expand a little more
with an example. if i stand naked in front of your house and masturbate
in front of your children while they play , in your libertarian (small 'l')
scenario the only recourse you have is to yell at me. autonomous is
a value judgement 99.99 of the time , it is not a scientific reality with
a clear definition. exactly who would you empower to make that value
judgement \?



stuff deleted

certainly not the only cause , mike , but people in a local neighborhood
should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood. to deny
this is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the
locality from abusing its power in essence , using a pit bull to
keep a toy poodle from biting your leg. chances are , the pit bull is
going to turn on you some day , and you have much less defense against
it than you do against the toy poodle.

the argument here appears to be that tyranny of the individual by the
local majority is superior to having the federal government have and
exercise the power to protect the individual from his neighbors because
that federal government will eventually and inevitably become corrupt
and use its power to tyrannize everyone. okay , there 's a lot of truth in
that certainly we 're seeing something like that happening in the united
states today (though it 's unclear that he progression here matches the
model , since our beloved and benign federal government has n't
ever shown much enthusiasm for the idea of protecting any individuals...)

lots of people are long on complaints and short on practical solutions.
although i am pessimistic that my idea will ever bear fruit , i am at least
trying to be long on solutions also. i am truly interested if you have
any improvements to make on my ideas (i call them my ideas , but they
all come from an average guy reading of the u.s. constitution without
benefit of the indoctrination of constitutional law academia).



but i have to say that i think that your solution is at least just as
bad. trading the yoke of federal tyranny for the yoke of local tyranny
does n't cheer me up much... i think i 'd prefer to put my faith in a
larger government that at least might protect the individual from time
to time rather than place it in local mob rule. admittedly , it 's the
lesser of two evils , and it 's not less by very much , and they 're both
pretty damn evil...

sorry , the confusion was my fault. when i said that fractal federalism
resembles the u.s. constitution , i meant it and thought it was pretty clear.
i should have more clearly explained that the ultimate derivation of government
power is from the consensus of the people (although not the consent of every
individual a practical observation , not a moral judgement). it is certainly
better than having all government power derive from nine lawyers , which is the
situation we have now. that is why i think the supreme court should be
a jury court , with a different jury for each case.

it is certainly not perfect (no philosophy of government is) , but do you still
find it a repugnant idea \? if so , what is your solution \?



ideally , everyone would leave everyone else alone and no government
coercive power of any kind would be necessary. this will never work ,
because people are different and by their nature they will always want
to force their views on others. if this were not the case , nobody
would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else.

this is true... the question is , what we you going to do about it \? your
proposed solution seems to actually encourage these bozos to lord it
over their victims.

i think that you misunderstood the structure of the form of government i
advocate , and it was my fault for not being more clear.



oh , and by the way...

the majority does not make the rules. the majority (or possibly a
plurality) simply elects representatives to exercise limited government
powers those limited government powers derive from a large consensus ,
not a simple majority. and the federal government , in my scenario , still
has the power to protect freedoms.

i thumbed through the janus report in a bookstore recently looking
for a clue about their methodology. they were very unclear about
it , but as far as i could tell they relied on their professional
associates in the psychotherapy profession to provide the subjects ,
interviews , and numbers. if so , this would hardly represent an
average cross section. i posted to usenet at the time asking for
more data about their methodology but answer came there none. (i
must have been out of my mind for even asking for factual information

3. no one is presumably going to say they 're gay if they 're not. but
some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys. thus
the 1 2 is a lower limit.

this is the problem. people have to have a lot of confidence in
the anonymity of a study before they can counted on to speak
freely about stuff like that. but i agree that if someone 's
going to lie it will be in the direction of a gay person claiming
to be straight rather than the other way around.


i still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage
between 5 and 7 .

i do n't see why there 's any more evidence for this figure than any

the above conveniently ignores the murder of four batf agents by the
branch davidians in an unprovoked ambush.

that has not been demonstrated. had he come to trial , there was a very real
possibility that koresh would have gotten an acquittal on grounds of self
defense. all survivors of the debacle have sworn that the batf shot first.

any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

they rang the doorbell using a concussion grenade ! and if the bloody
warrants were legal then why were they sealed after the fight started \?
and if koresh had declared himself a private state and was just daring the
gov't to go in , then why did he surrender last year to a local sheriff who
served a warrant for his arrest (as opposed to the batf search warrant ,
which did not include arrest unless violations were found) by just calling
him up to tell him and then going out to collect him with his squad car \?
that does n't sound like a dictator to me , it sounds like someone who knows
he has a court battle. things might have gone very differently if the batf
had rung the doorbell .

the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish. had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

this is stupid. that is no paranoid assertion , it is testamony from surviving
witnesses , and the batf has no tanks , nor am i aware of either the batf or
the fbi using any until yesterday. when they use maximum force they do just
what they did that first day that got four officers killed.

the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.

underarmed \? you flabberghast me , they were loaded for bear and every
picture shows them wearing bullet proof vests ! they were using concussion
grenades and full auto weapons , what was missing low yield tac nukes \? this
is a transparent attempt to retcon a justification for the ridiculous amount
of force used , both initially and yesterday. you should be ashamed.

if anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.

they had a sure fire method keep them bottled up and talk them to death or
surrender without giving him justification for some looney tune religious
stunt.

phil , i 've been reading your postings for months and i'm convinced that you

with that attitude that set up the preconditions for the holocaust , a process
that is in place now in this country , even if the tattered , pitiful remains
of the constitution is slowing its progress. this is n't a libertarian issue ,
others may argue that line , but from a strictly constitutional view of a
democratic gov't , what the fbi and batf did was wrong , wrong , wrong , even if
their reasons for trying to arrest koresh were 100 right. anything that
leads to the deaths of 17 children , if nothing else touches your stoney
heart , is wrong no matter who pushed the button. for god 's sake , man , get

fury of mother nature

man 's contribution to environmental pollution are paltry compared to those
of nature. in her exceptional book trashing the planet , former atomic energy
commision chairman dr. dixie lee ray notes based on the available data , all
of the air polluting materials produced by man since the beginning of the
industrial revolution do not begin to equal the quantities of toxic
materials , aerosols , and particulates spewed into the air from just three
volcanoes krakatoa in indonesia in 1883 , mount katmai in alaska in 1912 , and
hekla in iceland in 1947. to which could be added mount st. helens in
washington state in 1980 (which pumped out 910 , 000 metric tons of carbon
dioxide alone). el chicon in mexico in 1982 (which sent more than 100 million
tons of sulfur gases into the stratosphere) , and mount pinatubo in the
philippines (which in 1991 hurled upwards of 30 million tons of material into
the stratosphere).
los ninos
many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the u.s. to global
warming , but researchers with the national center for atmospheric research in
boulder colorado reported that the freakish weather was actually due to a
natural phenomenon , the interaction of el nino and el nina , two massive
currents in the tropical pacific. el nino is a huge strip of warm water that
periodically appears off the coast of south america and disrupts the world 's
weather patterns. now and then , it alternates with el nina , a mass of cold
water that comes from the ocean depths along the equator and drifts for
thousands of miles.
chicago tribune's peter gorner summarized the phenomenon cold water along
the equator clashed with warmer than normal water southeast of hawaii. the
result was both the u.s. drought and the devastating floods that swamped
bangladesh...... nina 's cooler water disrupted tropical weather patterns and
distorted the path of the jet stream across north america. then the jet
stream shoved rain producing weather systems away from the interior of the
u.s. resulting in drought.
termite terror

sundry animals and insects also contribute their share to environmental
degradation. time for april 20 , 1992 noted that in the netherlands... manure
from pigs poses a major ecological threat , defiling water supplies with
excessive nitrites and acidifying local soils. sheep have permanently scarred
the landscape in spain and portugal , while in india ... bovines cows are
ravenous wraiths whose constant quest for food drives them to ravage
standing forrests.
the february 1983 issue of science digest reported that an international
team of researchers has discovered that termites generate more than twice the
carbon dioxide that fuel burning does. according to a study reported in
science for november 5 , 1982 , the estimated gross amount of carbon dioxide
produced by termites was more than twice the net global input from fossil
fuel combustion. in addition , termites are a potentially important source
of atmospheric methane they could account for a large fraction of global
emmisions. the wood eating pests have a bacteria that enables them too
digest carbon so efficiently that some 90 pe is converted too carbon dioxide ,
methane , and other gases they belch into the atmosphere.
ants are another natural source of pollution. in 1987 , an atmospheric
chemist with bell laboratories , and zoologists from cornell university ,
reported that ants of the subfamily formicinae make and store huge quantities
of the formic acid that contributes most of the acidity of rain that falls in
remote areas and is found in atmosphere gas and precepitation around the
globe. it is abundant , for instance , in the fog and mists that hang over the
rain forests of central africa. according to the july 6 , 1987 insight
magazine , the ants release the acid when defending themselves and
communicating with each other and upon dying. since 30 percent of the world
ant population belongs to this subfamily , there is significant concern about
the acid the ants release , an amount estimated at 600 , 000 metric tons
annually. which is equal to the combined formic acid contributions of
automobiles , refuse combustion and vegetation.
clearly , man has a long way to go to match nature as a despoiler of the
environment.

we 're hearing it. it sure rings true it 's consistent in a way that
mass suicide by fire is not. this survivor is also saying that they
were trapped inside by the damage done by the tanks.

why is an accidental fire more plausible than a mass suicide ,
considering that the davidians were an apocalyptic cult with
a history of armed violence \? if the fbi has reason to lie
about the cause of the fire , if it resulted from their own
negligence , then the bd survivors also have reason to lie if
they started the blaze.

the fbi claims the fire was set simultaneously in three places. they
claim the building was filled with tear gas. electricity was cut off ,
tanks were rolling all around. how did the bds co ordinate the
setting of the fire \?

it 's fairly simple. it was decided to burn the place down ,
and more than one agent was dispatched to set the fires in
separate parts of the compound. i doubt that simultaneously
means at the exact same time in this case. it likely means
close enough together to preclude them from being part of
the same fire.


the fbi claims that men with torches set the fires but have n't released
any evidence of this , though it seems inconcievable that they do n't have
any if it was true.

they might be waiting until the evidence comes in from the
site , and the investigation is at least well underway.


all of the bds
previous actions were aimed towards their survival , not their death.

the same could be said of jonestown.

the idea that kerosene lamps would be all over the place (with
electricity cut off) makes sense. the idea that ramming tanks into
the building would spill them and cause a fire makes sense. the
possibility that the fbi would n't know this is nil. it was n't simple
negligence.

maybe. then again , i 've been suprised at what folks have missed
in the past in similar situations. do n't jump t oconclusions.

again , they ca n't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.

so the government , by sheer economic force , has basically cleared the
basic care market for itself. the only way to test this would be for
some really daring person to start up , from scratch , in alberta and or
quebec , a health insurance company offering basic care.

crazy \? yes , but that 's almost how mci got started.

however , the concept of risks is well known by insurance actuaries
and no private firm can get the kind of amortization that the public
pools can get. and since health insurance gets spent , that does n't
sit well with the insurance ceo 's ... and you get a situation like
in the u.s. where rates keep going up to catch up.

see what i mean \? it 's a government monopoly.

sure ... because it 's a non market phenomenom and the free market
ca n't solve it. even our private insurance says that ....

and remember ... last year quebec proposed giving the least risky
parts of basic care to the private sector ... and they balked.

like you said...why should they \?

.... and wants no part of it.

by your own arguments , if you do n't want the provincial plan ,
you 're basically up a creek.

yes ... but in our culture , arguing against it is like arguing
for national defence by means of warlords.

true. according to polls i 've read (usually in the sort of simpleminded
stuff you were initally responding to) something like 60 of americans
would like canadian style health care , whereas only 3 of canadians
would like it our way. i 'd be interested to know why there are that
many (3 of canada 's population is about a million or so people).

canada is saturated by american media. while pundits come on cable
and talk about how awful our health care is supposed to be , what
people experience up north ends up not differing from what they see
portrayed on american television in movies (i.e. , same infrastructure ,
different insurance make up). yet they know not of any insurance
problems , and have no idea of what an hmo is ... but having lots of
british tv as well , they know that they do n't like nhs.

someone must have a reason to argue against it , valid or not what
kind of people are they \?

the polls that you refer to , for the canadian data , are from the
annual july 1st polls conducted for macleans (our major english
newsmagazine) by decima research ... decima president allen gregg is
considered one of the world 's top poll researchers , and mulroney 's
conservatives have relied on him to keep in power in the face of
impossible election situations. the american polls are harris polls ,
and have been reposted on usenet a few times and probably will again.
i'm sorta suspicious myself , 'cos maybe americans want universal
coverage like canada i honestly doubt that most americans realize
that we have private doctors and public and private hospitals (i.e. ,
similiar health care infrastructure) and our system is basically
pure insurance without hmo 's.

given recent turnarounds by the hiaa (endorsing universal coverage)
and hostility to corporatist hmo 's within the ama , and the complete
silence vis a vis canada bashing by the ama , i suspect that they 're
keeping the secret about canada up their sleeve.

exactly. would n't you \?

until the idea of managed competition arose , there was no direct
threat to stand alone private practice. in the 1960 's , the ama
fought hmo 's as corporatized socialist medicine ... part of the
reason why we have only insurance , and no hmo 's in canada 'cos
that was part of the deal cut with the cma.

i 've also read that the three biggest american hmos can be compared
straight up against some of the smaller canadian provinces (in the
maritimes) and they spend something like 300 500 less per patient.
maybe it does help.

the american hmo 's can still cream and they probably cover a smaller
geographic area than even our smallest provinces. geography , again.

some of them are spread out across the whole country , i think.

but each site is probably compact , and the clientele are creamed.
and do n't forget that hmo 's place caps on your coverage , and often
wo n't tell you about additional procedures you could get otherwise
(despite that you might be willing to pay for it).

the batf , in a letter they 've been sending out to people ,
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise , and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces.

it strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door.

there are at least questions that need to be answered.

the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish.

this paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original
assault who stated that the batf initiated hostilities by throwing
concussion grenades and reported by the associated press.

had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up

phill , the batf were in a firefight with the bd for forty five
minutes. i find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they would n't have shown up in live stock trailers and would
have retreated immediately.

if they were expecting peacful citizens , why show up with over
a hundred officers , some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying
sub machineguns , and 3 national guard helicopters \?

a very well put together post. i disagree with several key points , but the
post is an excellent one with which to engage in discourse

there has been much discussion recently about the right to
freedom of association. mr. cramer and mr. ronzone appear to
take an absolutist position on this right that it is a
fundamental human right , perhaps the fundamental human right ,
and that it supersedes other rights , such as the right to an
equal opportunity. others feel that a right to an equal
opportunity outweighs the right to freedom of association ,
and thus we have the never ending debate that flares up
repeatedly.

freedom of association (foa) involves the mutual and voluntary agreement of
two or more people.

right to equal opportunity (lets call it reo) involves coercion in all cases
(by definition).


a major problem is that neither of these rights are
explicitly declared or protected in the constitution or in
the declaration of independence , although both can be derived
from these documents. unfortunately , this means that the
debate will never end , because neither side can conclu
sively prove the validity of their view it becomes solely a
matter of personal philosophy.

yes , there is much debate. but no , it can end , with once and for all
recognition of these rights. (well , not totally 100 perfect end , but end
in the same way that there is no worldwide disagreement that say , murder , is
a crime).


my personal opinion is that the real answer lies somewhere in
between. i regard both of these rights as fundamental human
rights which , unfortu nately , come into direct conflict with
one another. which is stronger depends on the given
situation.

hmm , there is even more discusion about religion. should we take a
somewhere in between approach towards the state a state recognized
religion \? the first amendment , is so , uh , so absolutist you know.

for example , if the owner of a mom and pop store wishes to
hire an employee to help out , their right to freedom of
association outweighs the rights of their job applicants to
an equal opportunity. they should be free to hire whomever
they choose , using whatever criteria they choose , without any
government intervention at all.

similarly , if a family wishes to rent out a bedroom in their
home , or a garage apartment , or something similar , then their
right to freedom of association outweighs the rights of their
prospective tenants to an equal opportunity.

if , on the other hand , ibm , a multi national corporation with
275 , 000 employees , publicly owned , and operated by a board of
directors , wishes to hire additional employees , then whose
freedom of association are we protecting \? the board of
directors \? the other employees \? the owners of the stock \? in
this case , the applicant 's right to an equal opportunity
outweighs the right to freedom of association , and we , as a
society , can ask ibm to use only those criteria which are
relevant to the specific task.

why \? says who \? why can mon pop have foa , but ibm be forced , and force is
the correct word here , to have reo \? as purchase of ibm is voluntary , then
there are very well defined procedures on how ibm chooses to do some things
and chooses to do other things. why not let those same procedures work for
employment policies \?


similarly , if a landlord owns a number of apartment buildings
in which he does not live , and which are managed by an
independent management agency , then whose freedom of
association are we protecting \? if the owner does not live in
his buildings and has no contact with his tenants , then the
prospective tenant 's right to an equal opportunity outweighs
the right to freedom of association , and we , as a society ,
can ask the owner to use only those criteria which are
relevant to good tenants. (i 've put good in quotation
marks because i really do n't want to be drawn off into the
side issue of what constitutes a good tenant.)

why does this tenant have an option (i wo n't call it a right) to destroy
the foa of the landlord \? if the landlord and the tenant ca n't agree , then they
both can cease from using each other 's property.

suddenly , by arm waving , by magic , a landlord does not have foa. and on what
basis does the foa of the landlord disappear \?

it seems that vague terms like no contact with tenants suffice.

well , i think foa is one our most important rightts (in the top 2 3) , and by
golly , if the state is going to make it suffer , i sure would like to see the
heinous crime that justifies the removal of this right.

i do n't think no contact with the tenats is even a crime , much less something
that should cause severe interference with important rights.

i suspect that the majority of the people in this country
agree with my position on these extreme cases , particularly
if they are presented in this manner. i do n't know if mr.
ronzone or mr. cramer would agree i suspect not. in any
case , additional problems arise when we try to apply
guidelines for the middle ground. what if the company has 10
employees , or 100 , or 1000 \? where do we draw the line between
protecting the right to freedom of association and protecting
the right to an equal opportunity \?

rights are not defined by majority mob choice. foa is an absolute. reo
is a fancy name for thuggery , for racism , and coercion.

the difficulty is that any line we draw will , of necessity ,
be artificial. and any legislation resulting will be flawed.
in the past , the government has usually tried to pass laws
which referred to the number of employees hired by the
company e.g. , any company with more than xxx employees was
affected by the law. those with fewer were unaffected.

of course it would be. you dimly see that the line must be artifiacial , because
foa is the only right. just like a state religion you ca n't jsutify that
either.

generally , i believe that if we do not have any regulations
affecting these rights , then the right to freedom of
association will be stronger. on the other hand , many of the
regulations protect the right to an equal opportunity too
much , weakening the right to freedom of association.

i do n't believe there is a satisfactory solution which will
please everybody. a solution that i came up with is to use
publicly owned vs. privately owned as the dividing line. if
the company remains privately owned , then the owners should
be free to do whatever they want with their company. if the
company becomes publicly owned , then the public has a right
to ask the company to submit to additional regulation.

why \? i assume that when you say publicly owned , you are talking about those
quasi state companys that do not have shareholders.

the companies on the fortune 500 , for example , are all privately owned. they
can give you a list of all of their owners. they have no anonymous ,
unknown to them , owners.


by the way , the above analysis is based on the assumption
that the right to freedom of association and the right to an
equal opportunity are both fundamental human rights of equal
importance. since this is entirely a matter of faith , not
subject to any proof , i do not choose to even try to
establish this. you either accept it or you do n't.

any comments \?

foa can be derived by any two rational people , on a basis that neither has
evil , malicious , or murderous intent towards the others.

in short , agreement is mutual , or not at all.

your reo on the other hand , lives only by accepting coercion , the gun , into
the situation. and that is self destructive of the whole argument , because it
is based only on might makes right. sort of like saying , nobody has a right
to live , whereupon i whip out a gun and shoot you dead end of argument.



there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of
environmental disaster. weird , eh \?

these opinions are mine , and you ca n't have 'em ! (but i 'll rent 'em cheap ...)

i do n't want to attack anyone 's personal opinions and thus have not
included any articles but it seems to me incredibly ridiculous
and pompous for someone to sit back with the benefit of hindsight
and point fingers at clinton , reno , the fbi , or whomever.

first of all , it is a knee jerk judgement. the facts are quite
muddled at this point and will likely be for quite a while.

secondly , things do not improve by pointing blame and accusatory
fingers. pointing fingers is a destructive action. if everyone
sat around pointing fingers all the time , nothing would get done
and nothing would ever get any better. and despite the tragedy ,
we can learn something from this if it is approached in a
constructive manner. does n't it seem that working together is
more productive than working against one another \?

thirdly , it seems incredibly hypocritical to place blame given
the benefit of hindsight something that those who made the
decisions did not have the benefit of. why not give them the courtesy
of acknowledging that they did the best they could with the
data they had in a very , very difficult situation. some
responses have gone so far to suggest that the actions were done
without regard for the lives of the people in the compound give
me a break.

be part of the solution not the problem.

and that 's my opinion

certainly many religious beliefs seem to be positive principles for

avoids alcohol (i apologize if i name the wrong religion) and that
is certainly a physical positive in many respects. however , this
proves nothing. just because something is a basic , pragmatic
principle of day to day living today does n't mean it evolved from
the same. especially those beliefs and (mostly) positions held based
on interpretations of the religion.

religious beliefs come from many places but most will be backed up
(after many levels of arguments) to because that 's how it is written.
or god says... now i'm not faulting that but that is not a basic ,
pragmatic principle as you mean it in this context. it is a belief
based on faith , which by definition is not necessarily backed up by
logic. faith is a given. god is a absolute truth when arguing from
religion. also , many religions would reject your thesis that their
beliefs simply come from these day to day principles.

in summation , if you wish to use religious arguments be prepared to
back them up with it says in the fill in religious document here ,
because most religions (things which at least i denote as religions)
are based on the writings of or teachings of fill in religious

we used to live in a country where everyone enjoyed the free exercise of

tea , ladies and gentlemen \?

just maybe you wo n't be home. then you can come home to something
like this

well , it 's been a rough month , begins johnnie lawmaster. i
just get laid off , and my divorce became final. but i just was n't
ready for what happened this particular monday.

that particular monday was was december 16 , the first day of the
bill of rights' third century , the day when federal agents and local
law enforcement officer broke into the house in tulsa that always flew
the u.s. flag. when lawmaster drove into the driveway that bleak
afternoon , one of his neighbors had some news.

'ohmigod , john , you are in big trouble ! ' my neighbor tells me.
'sixty police , federal agents and the bomb squad busted in you house ,
kicked down the door , cut locks off your gun safe.' i could n't
believe it. then i walked inside. what a nightmare.

it was no nightmare it was horribly real life. apparently acting
on information the lawmaster possessed an illegal firearm , some thirty
agents of the bureau of alcohol , tobacco and firearms (batf) teamed up
with state and tulsa police authorities , search warrant in hand , to
search for a colt , ar 15 , .223 caliber machine gun , unknown serial
number. the warrant , issued by u.s. magistrate john leo wagner , also
authorized agents to seize any tools used in the alteration or
modification of firearms , such as files or drills documents , papers ,
books , records , and other tangible properties which identify occupants
or owners of the property to be searched....

reports vary , but according to neighbors , the joint task force
operation aimed at the unemployed warehouseman from a nearby hospital
involved some 60 agents and local law enforcement personnel against
lawmaster. they cordoned off the street took station with weapons
drawn in the back yard used a battering ram to break through the
front door kicked in the back door broke into his gun safe threw
personal papers around the house spilled boxes of ammunition on the
floor broke into a small , locked box that contained precious coins
stood on a table to peer through the ceiling tiles , breaking the table
in the process. then , they left. the doors were closed but not
latched , much less locked. the ammo and guns were left unsecured.

my front and back doors were pulled shut , but they were busted
through and could n't latch. anybody could have waltzed in there and
stolen everything i own. a child could have taken a gun. the guns ,
the safe everything was open and laying around. i keep all my
magazines empty , but someone had loaded them. while i was looking
around in amazement , the gas , electric and water companies show up to
turn the power off. they said they were told to shut things down.
then i found the note. nothing found atf.

they did n't make any attempt to notify me. i 've lived in tulsa
all my life and never got more than a traffic ticket. how come they
ca n't look that up , realize i 've been law abiding my whole life , then
come to the door when i'm home \? they did n't leave someone here to
watch over my private property. they did n't even come by to explain
what happened. they just raided my home , ransaked it , left it wide
open and left.

lawmaster placed a phone call to the local batf agent. i asked ,
'are you gonna' arrest me \? ' and he said , 'no.' i asken him , who is
going to repair and clean up my house \? ' and he said , if you 're going
to talk to me , come down to my office.'

'i ca n't come down ! ' i said. 'my doors are broken ! ' if i had
been on vacation and i did n't have friendly neighbors , i would have
lost everything i own. here i am a competent , responsible firearms
owner , and the government leaves them open , unlocked , with ammo strewn
around.

lawmaster said the agent advised him , if you want your door to
lock and your gun safe to lock , you 're gonna' have to pay for it
yourself.

'oh , i 'll come right down , alright , ' i told him. 'i 'll come
down , but i 'll bring my attorney.' and he said , 'well , you bring
your attorney , and we wo n't talk to you.'


so if you do n't want your tea party to be held in awkward silence , make
sure your lawyer is n't there , there 's a good chap.


it 's very sad all those people died , especially the kids , but that 's going
to happen in a free society whenever psychologically needy people hook up
with a charismatic nutcase.

what a repulsive outlook on society. followers of unusual religions
may be killed by the government it simply ca n't be helped in a free
society.

you and i have two different concepts of free.

geez , where have you been , ryan \? i proposed this theory months
ago. let 's take it one step further , even. if , as the surveys show ,
up to 33 of all men have had a homosexual encounter , then there must

cite a survey , other than the obviously bogus kinsey studies.

granted. pomeroy , bell , weinberg , 1967. national institute of
mental health paper 12353 , ''patterns of adjusment in deviant
populations.'' cited as part of the national institute of mental
health task force on homosexuality.

pomery concluded , the kinsey statistic of 37 is probably higher
than is realistic. according to these estimates , 33 is a more
realistic figure.

(i went out and bought lots of bell weinberg this weekend... can
you tell \? )

also , the janus report on sexual behavior (samuel s. janus , ph.d.
and cynthia l. janus , m.d. , john wiley sons (pub) , 1992) has the
following

table 3.14

39 of 22 is 9 . this number is consistent with kinsey , pomery ,
gebard (1953) , bell weinberg (1967 , 1974) , and rice (1987) in the
finding that 9 of the male population is actively homosexual , with
an further breakdown (bell wienberg , 1978) of 4 exclusively so and
5 self identifying themselves as bisexuals.

(pp 69 , 70)

as for debunking kinsey , the following article is an important
lesson for everyone to read

was kinsey a fake and a pervert \?
by philip nobile

far out on the grassy knoll of sexology , there is a cult of
prochastity researchers who claim that the late alfred kinsey was a
secret sex criminal , a hoosier dr. mengele , who bent his numbers
toward the bisexual and the bizarre in a grand conspiracy to queer the
nation and usher in an era of free sex with kids.

but what really riles these critics is kinsey 's towerin cultural
influence. his bestselling surveys sexual behavior in the human male
(1948) and sexual behavior in the human female (1953) tore the
sheets off the country 's erogenous zones and undermined midcentury
morals. his charts and graphs , based on detailed histories of 12 , 000
men and women , demonstrated that practices generally considered rare
and or 'abnormal' masturbation , extramarital relations ,
homosexuality , and even barnyard bestiality , were as american as
strawberry shortcake.

yet for a hard core of these heterosexual supremacists , aided and
abetted by pat buchanan and the religious right , the zoology professor
from indiana university remains the evil genius behind the sex
revolution and a target for character assassination.

judith reisman , the prosecution 's expert witness at the
mapplethorpe trial in cincinnati , is the leader of the anti kinsey
revisionists as well as his inspector javert. in 1983 , during a radio
interview with pat buchanan in washington , reisman accused kinsey of
having been inolved in the vicious genital torture of hundreds of
children. she speculated that he kidnapped and drugged ghetto boys in
order to carry out clandestine orgasm tests.

now , seven years later , reisman has revived her charges in a
different book , titled kinsey , sex and fraud , just released by the
small and religiously oriented huntington house in lafayette ,
louisiana. her coauthor is ed eichel , a manhattan psychotherapist who
has invented a new style of intromission ( the coital alignment
technique ) that supposedly triggers simultaneous orgasm with
considerable regularity and thereby increases compatibilty between the
sexes. in the book eichel contends that kinsey deliberately cooked
the gay stats because , being an oddball himself , he wanted to advance
the 'denormalization' of heterosexuality.

if the authors are right , then the world famous kinsey reports
are , as the introduction boldly asserts , the most egregious example
of scientific deception in this century. and if they are wrong ,
kinsey , sex and fraud is a shameful smear.

despite the less than stellar credentials of kinsey 's
detractors , legends are not what they used to be. martin luther king
may have committed plagiarism. bruno bettelheim slapped young mental
patients around. father bruce ritter , the founder of covenant house ,
preyed on runaway boys. closer to kinsey , masters and johnson have
been disgraced for faking it in one way or another.

so it should not surprise anybody that kinsey , who filmed strange
people having sex in his attic , may have had skeletons in the closet.
the problem is that reisman does not seem to have the intellectual
prowess to pull off the job.

as a thinker , the woman is no madame curie. the 55 year old
former songwriter for captain kangaroo has little professional
standing , no current university position , and no peer review
publications , though her creative 1983 resume was padded with phantom
accomplishments. for instance , it listed a book as her own take back
the night women on pornography that was actually written and edited
by others. then there is her ph.d. in speech communication from
cleveland 's case western reserve university. although reisman has no
bachelor 's degree , case granted her a master 's in 1976 and a doctorate
in 1979. her dissertation was on the commentaries of a local
octagenarian tv commentator. but on the resume , reisman gave this
piece of scholarship a fancy hautes etudes moniker to wit the
application of aristotelian and systems analytic theory to mass media
effects.

when reisman burst into prominence on buchanan 's program , it was
love at first sight for al regnery , the outwardly anti
porn head of juvenile justice and delinquency prevention in ed meese 's
justice department. regnery was a young law and order conservative and
amateur social philosopher who wanted to help change the sexual
climate of the united states.

after reisman 's sensational radio session , the sexual equivalent
of joe mccarthy 's wheeling speech , regnery summoned
her to meetings to discuss mutual interests. first he tried to shovel
her 800 , 000 for a quasi frankenstein study that was going to measure
the brain chemicals of men and boys who looked at arousing
photographs. guffaws on capitol hill killed the original proposal , but
734 , 000 in govemment money went to reisman anyway for plan b a probe
of child images in the cartoons playboy , penthouse , and hust
ler. (incredibly , this grant surpassed the entire budget of the
attorney general 's pornography commission.)

when the overpriced and oversold project was completed in 1986 ,
it was immediately shelved by an embarrassed justice department. that
spring , regnery resigned from his post only days before the new
republic carried this admission that he had kept porno magazines
around the house.

notwithstanding the six figure humiliation , reisman went on to
scratch out a niche on the ioony right. as the darling of the sex
cranks , she deplores subversive phenomena like shaved genitalia in
men 's magazines and blames aids on gays. kinsey , sex and fraud is
reisman 's latest grasp for respectability. pat buchanan , of course , is
putting his krugerrands on reisman 's ultimate vindication. this book
is social dynamite , he says in a blurb an the front cover. he
especially liked the antigay parts. smacking his lips in his
syndicated column , he declared , it may just blow the sewer cap off
kinsey 's monumental reputation , reestablish homosexuality as a 1 in 50
aberration , expose the gay rights movement as a paper tiger , and even
put at risk the enormous sex industry built upon dr. kinsey 's
'research.'

the blockbuster charge at the heart of the cluttered and
repetilive j'accuse is that kinsey was a sex mad pedophile who
molested little boys in nazi type experiments and recorded their
orgasms in his male volume a similar charge was first recited at the
fifth world conference on sexology in jerusalem in 1981 to no effect
before being recycled by reisman for buchanan in washington in 1983.

here is how reisman and eichel repackaged the mengele business in
kinsey , sex and fraud

mengele like 'scientific' experiments on infants and children
were the basis for kinsey 's conclusions... on childhood sexuality.

somewhere and sometime in the course of the project , kinsey
appears to have directed experimental sex research on several hundred
children aged from two months to almost 15 years.

this , of course , would implicate kinsey and his team in
promoting , and perhaps participating in , the criminal activity.

in the opinion of this book 's authors , that is exactly how part
of kinsey 's child sexuality research took place.


donning his psychohistorian 's cap and citing an fbi manual on
child molesters as a guide , eichel casually diagnoses kinsey as a
homosexual pedophile with the perfect motive for doing exactly as
reisman said


kinsey placed himself in professional and nonprofessional
positions where he had access to young boys , such as y.m.c.a. camp
counselor , boys' club leader , and boy scout leader activities he
kept up 'during his college and graduate yeaers , and even after his
marriage.


as crude as his analysis seems , eichel was more than happy to
elaborate even further in a recent phone interview. if you 've ever
been around boy lovers , pedophiles , they are absolutely compulsive ,
he averred. everything in his life is directed at getting children. i
did n't mention this in our book but the caption under kinsey 's high
school picture was a quote from hamlet 'man delights me not , no ,
sic nor woman neither.' what do you think they were picking up on \?

before weighing what reisman and eichel pass off as proof of
kinsey 's sex crimes , something must be said about kinsey 's scientific
modus operandi. he was a fiendish collector. as a young zoologist with
a d.sc. from harvard , he collected 4 million gall wasps and 1.5
million related insects. when he switched to sex exploration after
agreeing to teach a marriage course at indiana university in 1938 , he
was no less curious or acquisitive. nothing that mammals did in the
realm of reproduction was foreign to him. he compiled masses of erotic
materials including toilet wall inscriptions from male and female
johns that highlighted differences in sexual psychology and flms of
mating in 14 species of animals that showed an amazing similarity in
oral eroticism.

naturally , the sexual response of children , the genesis of eros ,
fascinated him. it was impossible to understand the sexual behaviors
of adults without examining their origins. and so with the fervor of
his bughunting days , kinsey collected information about kids , though
even his worst enemies until reisman and eichel refrained from
linking him personally to his data on preadolescent sex.

kinsey said plainly in the male volume that he got information on
the sex life of young boys from people who had sex with them some of
these adults are technically trained persons who have kept diaries or
other records which have been put at our disposal. although he
gathered much boyhood data from the memories of his subjects and the
observations of parents and nursery school teachers , he treated the
documentary materia ! of the pedophiles as pure gold. there was nothing
like it in the literature.

kinsey 's main source , a 63 year old govemment worker , was also
the most unforgettable character he had ever met. this man , whose
history took 17 hours to log , had sex with over 600 boys and 200 girls
as well as 17 of 33 family members including his father and
grandmother. a sexual hobbyist and passionate record keeper , he gave
kinsey detailed accounts of orgasms that he observed in preadolescent
boys. relying on the man 's meticulous research , which involved
following some boys for as long as 16 years , kinsey was able to
identify for the first time six distinct types of male orgasm some
of which involved violent contortions at the peak of release as well
as the speed and the capacity of climax.

what freud had only imagined about childhood sexuality , kinsey
had reported as fact. children were indeed erotic beings from the
cradle. these data on the sexual activities of younger male provide
an important substantiation of the freudian view of sexuality as a
component that is present in the human animal from earliest infancy ,
he concluded without raising eyebrows in 1948.

then along came judith reisman. ignorng the legitimacy of
kinsey 's inquiry , she beheld the ghost of mengele in bloomington. she
was appalled by the thought of infant ecstasy and read torture in the
portrayals of prepubertal orgasm rendered by the government worker.
and she dared to say that kinsey was a sex criminal.

well , was he or was n't he \? let 's go to the text. there is no
evidence in kinsey , sex and fraud no witnesses , no paper , noteven a
trace of hearsay that implicates kinsey in either planning or
partaking in child sex experiments. after 12 years on the trail ,
reisman has uncovered just two sources to back up her original charge
amazingly enough , kinsey himself and wardell pomeroy , kinsey 's
coauthor on both reports , to whom reisman has never spoken. it turns
out that her whole case rests on a few passages in the male volume
iand in pomeroy 's 1972 biography titled dr. kinsey and the institute
for sex research.

after frisking every the and and in both books , reisman came
up with what she believes are smoking sentences. to establish
kinsey 's alleged role in the planning , she says that there is a hint
in the fifth chapter of the male volume that kinsey directed the
orgasm studies on kids. she cites his tell tale quote from a critic of
armchair psychoanalysis demanding that writers...test their
theories...by empirical study and statistical procedures. then she
combines this quote with kinsey 's statement that some of the
observations of his pedophile sources were continued over periods of
months or years until the individuals were old enough to make it
certain that true orgasm was involved.

putting two and two together kinsey 's empiricism and lengthy
experimentation she arrives at her hint. but realizing this dog
would not hunt , she devoted but a single paragraph to kinsey 's
supposed planning before shifting to the issue of his personal
involvement. as for the alleged participation , after poring over
pomeroy 's biography , reisman found several hidden clues suggesting
kinsey 's likely hands on approach to kiddie sex. here the chain of
reasoning is more complex. she points out that kinsey was interested
in clitoral measurements , collecting sperm and filming sex in his
attic. since kinsey did indeed mislead indiana university about the
purpose of his cinematography he said that he was filming animal
sex reisman asserts that a similar misrepresentation may yet apply
to kinsey 's child sex experiments. catch the may !

reisman was also struck by kinsey 's doubting thomas attitude
toward the never before recorded climax of female rabbits kinsey ,
according to pomeroy , was the type of person who needed to see things
for himself. pomeroy gave the example of orgasm in the female rabbit.
because he had not personally witnessed this event , kinsey had
difficulty in accepting its reality , even on the strength of testimony
from a distinguished scientist. how then did kinsey testify to the
actuality of orgasm in a 5 month old infant from the mere 'history' of
a sex offender \? (but , of course , he did not he depended on their
records.)

from this fantastic alchemy of conjecture mixed with clitorides ,
sperm , attic cumshots , and climax in cottontail has reisman defamed
the legendary kinsey.

paul gebhard succeeded kinsey as the director of the kinsey
institute and now lives in retirement outside bloomington. reached by
telephone , gebhard defended the pedophile connection and denied
reisman 's nasty imputations. i do n't understand the resistance of
people like reisman to studying the sexuality of children , gebhard
said more in exasperation than anger. that is where sex begins. we
were happy to take data wherever we found it. even though pedophiles
commit criminal acts , they are usually not violent folks. they
would n't be very successful if they were. one of our best sources was
a headmaster of a boys' school who maintained a kind of alumni club
and sometimes went to the weddings of his former students. as for
directing experiments , that 's absurd. we never told any of our
subjects what to do. lt was against our principles. almost all of the
pedophile material was retrospective anyway. nor did we ever conduct
sex experiments with children ourselves. that would have been highly
inappropriate.

i asked gebhard if kinsey had ever seen a child in a sexual
situation. i think a mother once brought in a little girl who humped
her teddy bear and kinsey watched it.

as for kinsey 's sex life , it is still shrouded in
confidentiality. he was married to the same woman for 35 years and
fathered four children. apparently , there are no huge sexual
revelations , although rumors of homosexuality have persisted without
confirmation through the years. gebhard took his boss 's history back
in the '40s , but he refuses to discuss what he knows. we never
divulge anything about anybody 's history , whether dead or alive , he
says.

reisman said no to an interview for this article on the grounds
that i had once worked for penthouse not to mention the fact that we
have been debating each other in various forums for the past five
years. in keeping with our contentious history , she took a swipe at me
in her book for continuing the kinsey practice of euphemizing
incest. my offense was using the biblical variant lying with a near
relative in a 1977 article on the subject of incest. as a synonym for
intercourse , lying with appears eight times in genesis.

ed eichel is a different story. though seemingly obsessed by
kinsey like his coauthor , he was friendly in long conversations. he
told me that he began to smell a big baised agenda in sexology when he
was a student in new york university 's human sexuality program in the
early '80s. it was literally a gay studies program for heterosexuals ,
he says.

around 1985 , eichel came upon reisman 's critique of kinsey and
the conspiracy theory started to sink in the sex establishment was
ruled by a kinseyan bisexual bund advocating the overthrow of the
heterosexual norm. no wonder he was having such a rough time promoting
the joy of simultaneous orgasm anything that enhanced sexual
compatibility between men and women inevitably raised objections.

eventually , eichel exchanged philosophical fluids with reisman ,
and from this union kinsey , sex and fraud was born. eichel 's main
contribution to the book is discovery and analysis of a kinsey
conspiracy that supposedly seeks the establishment of bisexuality as
the balanced sexual orientation for normal , uninhibited people which ,
by destroying the traditional family structure and normal sexual
behavior , would open the way for the second and more difficult step
the ultimate goal of cross generational sex (sex with children).

when i pressed him for specific references to back up his
outrageous contentions , he said weakly , you do n't think kinsey is
going to come right out and say that everybody is basically bisexual
and should have sex with kids , but this is implicit in the kinsey
reports.

meanwhile , eichel is demanding a congressional investigation of
kinsey and his data. perfect. that 's just what the country needs a
house un american sexual activities committee , looking under beds and
asking people if they are now or have everbeen a reader , a sympathizer
or god forbid a subject of dr. alfred kinsey.

i heard about a guy in alberta who came down with some rare eye
disease that he had to take repeated trips to seattle to get treated.

well , what american private insurance plans cover travel expenses \? \? \?

well , it was n't just the travel expenses. it was the whole treatment.

when you buy insurance where you live , it is based on the local rates.
tourists coming from , say , utah will find that there is a difference
in what their insurance will cover fob provo and what they get stuck
with at lenox hill or mount sinai if they fall ill in the big apple.

but to what extent does it affect the system \? and why is an urgent
care list necessary in the first place \? it 's worth thinking about.

it 's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get
at what facilities. do n't americans have to arrange in advance for
operations too \? i think that there are two standards being applied
here , and that canada ca n't give beverly hills style treatment to
everybody. it 's not a big brother list ... it 's more like calling
around town for a table for dinner ...

but americans need far less advance time to book operations.

it would depend on where you live , downtown toronto or mile 101 ,
british columbia (just like cheyenne , wy vs. boston , ma). again ,
geography rears its ugly head.

since our health care providers are private , they depend on an
adequate market size in order to sustain enough business. since
our health care professionals have equivalent take home pay to
their american cousins , it 's not that they 're being paid too
little to provide services.

whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own
health services catering toward americans , who would be willing
to pay more than they do , is another issue entirely) , it must be
noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants
from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so
insubstantial , why the need to attract foreigners to make up the
difference \?

you answered the question yourself ... private nonprofit foundations
have to make money somehow , and i think that it 's about time that
they acted like the private hospitals that they are. personally ,
i'm fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that
their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance
(that 's one at you , bob rae ! ! ).

true , but i was thinking...does can anybody compete with the provinces
to offer basic health coverage \? i remember reading that that sort of
private health insurance is actually illegal in canada.

i have only hear americans say that it 's illegal ... but i could be
wrong , just have never heard it from a canadian source. our private
insurance has recently balked in quebec when the liberals proposed
privatizing some aspects of routine care ... also , our insurance was
put in place when no ndp (labour) governments were in power in any
province to derail the effort 'cos they wanted real socialized
medicine.

you 're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one
insurance plan.

no , it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.
there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for
exemptions (and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton
verified for me that it is indeed negative option). i guess that you
can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance , but
so far i 've not come across that up north ... and i take pains to keep
tabs with news from home.

and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an
effective cartel they do n't really need to compete because , as you put
it , they 're in a win win situation and they 're guaranteed to turn a
profit

believe me , they probably had orgasms when they figured that out. and
according to my sister the yuppie , they pat themselves on the back to
the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons.

(interesting side note have any new insurance companies started
up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada \?

i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i ...
no , scratch that ... there are a few in western canada , and quite
a few in quebec as part of the post 1980 quebec miracle (out with the
nationalism , in with the french capitalism). la groupe des cooper
antes built a new tower by the eaton( 's) store at les terraces , and if
you were able to catch urban angel on cbs 's crimetime you 'd see it as
the well lit one with double turrets at the top. as for ontario ,
which still dominates and anchors business up north ...

canada is a very old money kind of place , and the 1989 free trade
agreement saw a lot of odd alliances labour unions and establishment
old money who wanted to preserve their traditional monopolies on one
side , and entrepreneurs and internationally oriented businesses and
professionals on the other. the final trudeau administration and
the first mulroney government had a high percentage of nouveaux
riches who knew what it was like to make your own money , and that
motivated the mcdonald commission under trudeau which set up brian 's
initiative (macaroni was against free trade 'til he did a head count
of his caucus after the 1984 election).

it 's not really insurance if you do n't have alternatives

well , you have to realize that in our society that 's like saying
that it 's not really national defence because you ca n't hire
your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.
(btw , there are always pacifists in the news arguing about their
portion of taxes , but never people arguing over health insurance
alternatives ... and we 're talking about a press that is hostile
to whomever is in government , regardless of party one of their
few redeeming characteristics , it seems ( ).

also , in the april 14 globe and mail , there was a letter from the
director of trauma services at st. michael 's hospital in toronto
responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in
california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that
american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada
rationed vital services. the doctor (i ca n't recall his name) said
that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can
plainly see . he said that a system in which people are refused
treatment because they ca n't afford it is no different from a system
in which people are refused treatment because the government ca n't
afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health
insurance plan. in fairness , he did say that both the us and
canadian systems are in the same situation.

the only way to hit at the canadian system is transient periods of
high demand , which is more a function of the doctors monopoly 's tight
fist on the licencing. an obvious difference is that in such a
transient period , the rationing is of the nature of a mob battling
over cabbage patch dolls tm as we 've seen recently as opposed by
rationing by ability to pay ... but the former is a transient
situation and if a large body of insured patients were to deluge the
california health infrastructure , the same would result rationing
among the insured population. with smaller markets , there is much
less flexibility when dealing with our insured population than
california (which by the way , has 1 3rd more people than canada in a
much more dense area). so he is correct in that the resources are
fixed (for a particular time window , or as a function of the doctors
monopoly licencing according to the market steady state) in either
case. as for being refused treatment the government of the day
would be shredded to tatters if something like that were to happen
canadians can be geographically bad , too , not realizing that their
health care is private while only their insurance is n't ... too many
people have bought into socialist trype that we have socialized
medicine.

i know , i know , the monopoly power of canadian doctors often leads
them to overstate the problems with the system in order to get more
money from the government (another case of businessmen , once
scratched , becoming socialists).

right , as i 've pointed out above ...

but has n't that just shifted the locus of the problem from one place
to the other \? it has n't really solved it.

either way , the transient situations are hard to deal with since the
changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower
rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of
disasters (e.g. , chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart
disease). a doctor needs 4 6 years of training , plus internship
and specialty training.

people too often tend to put prescription cold medicine on their
insurance when they really do n't need to.

that 's why i 've argued for deductible and copayments rather than
education , which is what most canadian fiscal conservatives are
arguing for (the leftists \? ah , just let 'em spend ! yeah ,
right ! ). also , note that only a few provinces cover prescriptions
under some high dollar threshold ... in most , it 's your private
insurance that covers it just like in the u.s. still , it all
adds up in the oecd measures.

in fact , buffalo may be the only place in the us where people
get don cherry jokes ( ).

we get the sabres' feed as a replacement game on espn tonight (the
devils' local metro ny coverage supplants the main espn game).

(the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess \? and just when i thought
i understood canadian politics).

yeah , it 's a sad story and saskatchewan tory leader grant devine
has been on a nonstop pr campaign to save his sorry butt. the
sask ndp have taken a neo conservative turn like hawke , gonzalez
and mitterand did.

has anybody considered following singapore 's example and going to a
system where the company and the state buys basic and catastrophic
coverage for everybody , and then you also have an ira sort of thing
to which you and your employer can can contribute for medical
expenses only \? it would tend to discourage you from overusing it.

the medical ira would have limited use , as you 'd need a lower
catastrophic threshold else there 'd still be a drain on the public
purse if someone exhausts their ira. also , singapore has a much
more autocratic mentality which has seaped down into its masses
(if singaporeans that i 've met are any indication ... i do n't
mean any disprespect here) where they 'd let you just die.

one of the good things about being the last country to create a
national health care system , should we decide to , is that we have
everybody else 's mistakes to learn from.

that 's true ... the question is how much leeway is there between
the u.s. approach and the second most capitalist approaches of
canada , france and germany.

seriously , there are few areas that have sufficient population for a
two more tiered system like what the french have ... a health policy
prof , d.g. shea , has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having
a population of 500 , 000 is necessary for adequate competition ...
and in canada , there are only four cities west of the great lakes
with that population or larger.

but there are many cities in the us with that kind of population.

yes , many ... and pretty close to a lot of smaller towns or not too
far from a bigger town. just take a look at a detailed atlas ...
or better , take a flight from pittsburgh or rochester to toronto.
my first time across lake ontario to nyc , i was amazed by the
increase in density ... and the toronto region is the densest
in all of canada.

there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened
canada 's first us style mri clinic , as an alternative to the
provincially owned one.

it 's about time ! i 've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they
do n't invest in their own private practices ... in the end , it 's their
money. but they choose to spend it on america 's cup pipedreams , and
that 's none of my business. as for provincially owned ... for sure
it 's against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved
in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser
vations. what that term actually means is that the facility gets by
on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use ... no kidding.
medical practice itself is much more conservative up north. my own
best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester , mn ,
and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.

there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of
two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act.

no , it 's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have
private practices ... and always have. they can all take cash
anyways ... so why not have a particular facility \? the canadian
big government mentality often imagines government where it does
not even exist ...

since the french and germans have become more entrepreneurial and less
laidback without sacrificing their culture and values , then canadians
can do the same. as i 've pointed out above , the law states that it is
illegal for the government to provide any health services except for
the military and natives.

look , nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri ...
nobody stopped them when they bought it. nobody seems to be stopping
them from using it , either. much ado about nothing. thank goodness
that hockey playoffs have started ...

while it seemed currently unjustified , there was one anecdote told by
the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri. he showed an
image of an injured knee , which happened to belong to the manager of
the bank who approved the loan. he said that without it , the guy
might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri , then
another length of time for treatment , after which the muscles would
have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder
if that is n't the first whiff of two tiers , i do n't know what is.

i'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere , because the gao study
of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a
problem. i 'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened
to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.
there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without
relying on mri ... unfortunately , i 've had a few. ) and i'm not
a banker. (

steve proposes a system of checking what other nations are in to

i counter that the limits of the constitution might be a better
place to check.

gee , jim , if you 'll check the constitution you 'll find in order to...
promote the general welfare...do ordain and establish this constitution...
i'm surprised you missed it. it 's right there in the first paragraph. i
would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble.

you almost got it right , and it was a good try , but you should follow your
own advice. the preamble to the constitution does read as you have quoted
but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble. it is not
a binding part of the constitution and carries no weight in the law. that
poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages
in the english language witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who
think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land. do you
really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting
the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution \?

sorry , buddy , but some other blowhards managed to include the general
welfare in another portion of the constitution.

article i section 8 the congress shall have the power to lay and collect
taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general
welfare of the united states...

i guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble.

just to make sure you 've got the point , let 's do a little experiment. what
if the constitution read as follows \?
preamble we the people , to promote the general welfare , do ordain
and establish this constitution for the united states of
america.
constitution the federal government shall have one function and one
function only to provide for the defense of the nation.
the government would not then have two functions defense and welfare.

but since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in article i , section 8 , i guess you 'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions. right \?

steve i'm glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing. what did
you do a word search to find welfare somewhere else in the constitution \?

my comments and paraphrases in brackets

article i section 8 in some ways the guts of the constitution

the congress shall have the power

1. to lay and collect taxes , duties , imposts and excises ,
to pay the debts indebtedness as defined in the document
and provide for the common defence defence as precisely defined
and general welfare as defined through the document , mostly in ways
that limit the government.
of the united states but the above taxes shall be uniform through
out the u.s.

so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly

then ...

2. to borrow money ...
3. to regulate commerce with foreign nations , interstate and indian tribes
4. to do uniform naturalization and bankruptcies
5. to coin money , regulate the value thereof , and etc.
6. to punish counterfeiters
7. to establish post offices and post roads
8. to provide patents and copyrights
9. to constitute tribunals inferior to the supreme court
10. to define and punish piracies and etc.
11. to declare war , and etc.
12. to raise and support armies , but for no longer than two years at a stretch
13. to provide and maintain a navy , notice no time limit on this one
14. to make the rules for the army and navy
15. to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws etc.
16. to provide for training of the army except for some state stuff
17. to exercise exclusive legislation in d.c
18. to make all laws necessary to execute the foregoing powers .

your original instinct was right. looking to other nations for precedents
that support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the
slim pickins found in the constitution.

male sex survey gay activity low

note this contradictory title gay activity low.

not really. the percentage of gays was low. headline writers are n't
noted for accuracy.

a new natonal study on male sexual behavior , the most thorough
examination of american men 's sexual practices published since
the kinsey report more than four decades ago , shows about 2
percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and
1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.

the article also contains numbers on the number of sexual partners.
the median number of sexual partners for all men 20 39 was 7.3.

it 's a shame that we do n't have a breakdown for
straight men vs. gay bi men that would show even more dramatically
how much more promiscuous gay bi men are.


now let 's take a quick look at what you are saying.

the median of a distribution is that variate value which divides the
distribution halfway , i.e. 1 2 of the distribution (population) have
lower and half have higher variate values.

so for males 20 39 the median 7.3 , this means that half of these men
are higher than this and half are lower than this. now if the population
sample size is 3300 , and 1 of them are gay , 33 males are gay. if we

actually , 2 were either exclusively homosexual , or bisexual. you are n't
readiing very carefully.

say they are distributed equally then only 16.5 are greater than 7.3
sexual partners , of course , this means that 49.5 heterosexual men are
greater than 7.3.

interesting results.

since 1979 , the members of the european parliament (the parliamentary assemby
of the european community) have been elected directly by the citizens of the
member states. before , the members of the european parliament (meps) were just
members of national parliaments (mnps) elected by and from among their peers.

in the european parliament , every member state has a fixed number of seats ,
which increases less than proportionally with the population. once in five
years , a general european election is being held , in which the citizens of all
member states choose their representatives to the european parliament. next
elections are due in 1994.

now the voting system for these european elections still differs from one
country to another. although the european treaty enabling the direct election
of the meps requires a uniform voting system , up to now every country has just
used its own system , more or less the same one used for national elections.
british meps are elected in a first past the post system with one mep per
district nearly all other states have chosen a system with proportional
representation. but then in some countries (france , italy) meps are allowed to
be a mnp as well , whilst in others they are not (belgium , netherlands).

the european parliament is now working on a uniform election system for its
own members , so that every candidate should have the same regulations to
comply with , regardless of the member state (s)he wants to be elected for. i
would like to know what you people out there think of the following questions

1. do you think it is necessary to have uniform regulations or should every
member state continue to use its own regulations (for european elections that
is) \?

2. do you think a system of majority voting should be implemented , with one or
more meps per district , or would you prefer a system with proportional
representation (for the whole of the community or per state , per region , per
district \? ).

3. do you think the european commission (or just its president) should be
directly elected too , or should it be appointed by the european parliament , or
by the joint member state governments as it is now \?

4. the maastricht treaty allows subjects of member states to stand for
election in another member state they are residing in. do you think you would
or could vote for a foreigner if his her ideas appeal to you \?

5. do you think meps should be allowed to be a member of a national parliament
or a regional parliament too \? or a member of a national or regional government
body \?

6. the european parliament now has meetings in both strasbourg and brussels.
meps themselves are for a complete move to brussels in great majority , but
political compromises between the governments of the member states stick to
the status quo. do you approve of this or do you think the european parliament
should meet in one city only , and if yes , which \?

please post your answers to eunet.politics , to which all followups are
automatically directed. if you do not have access to that group , please mail
your answer directly to me and i will post it for you.

i hope many of you will take the time to post their views on this matter.

we have three options with respect to the constitution

1. abide by it.
2. duly amend it.
3. abandon those parts of which a majority disapproves.

of course , since the whole point of the constitution is to restrain the
will of the majority , and since even in unfettered democracy we have
nothing to fear from minorities , 3 amounts to abandoning the
constitution altogether.

what exactly does the american constitution say about the right

homosexuals , whether clayton likes it or not , are as much members
of society as he is. as such they have the right to participate and
have an equal opportunity to pursue their goals.
no one is saying that clayton should be forced to associate with
queerfolk in his private life (one suspects the gays in question would
object also 8 ) ) , but by proclaiming the general right not to associate
with them in the public sphere (which includes housing , hiring , etc) ,
he 's giving his right to non association priority over their rights to
equal access to opportunity.
historically , people can associate publically with disliked groups
with very little ill effect , however cutting a group off from normal
commerce has a severe impact on their lives.
clayton , why exactly should your right to non association in the
public sphere take priority over homosexual 's rights to equal opportunity \?

case that spawns garbled misquotes , false rumors and urban legends like

(irrelevant , prejudicial , inflammatory... take your pick) and that the
judge upheld the objection.

having watched most of the televised trial , i can answer that
when such statements were made by the defense atty , the prosecutor did
object , and the judge tended to sustain the ones that were obviously
falling under the self incrimination type of objection. there was
quite a bit of meta discussion during the trial over the use of graphic
language , with most folks asking the judge if she wanted to hear the
exact language. practically every time the defense tried to get the
plaintiffs to self incriminate by asking them such questions , there
were objections and sustains.

at one point the defense managed to get in a quip about
solicitation for a felony and the judge herself said sustained
before the prosecutor could get the objection stated.

(missing the entire point of my post)

kebarnes@msuvx1.memst.edu wrote

given that

1. the trade in illegal drugs is responsible for
much of the crime which afflicts our nation.

there is much evidence that it is the fact that the drugs are illegal , not
the drugs themselves that have caused the violence. witness prohibition
and the violence that surrounded the trade in alcohol.

no joke.

2. people who want drugs (particularly people who
are predisposed to addiction) will find a way to get
them , whether or not they are legally available.

this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal \?

no , you jumped to that conclusion. it 's actually an argument as
to how to accomplish the societal good of discouraging drug use
without violating individual rights.

3. despite current law enforcement efforts , drugs
are readily available to those who want them.

this is suppossed to be an argument for keeping drugs illegal \?

no. you missed the point. the point is , the war on drugs
is a failure , and is counterproductive.

4. addiction to drugs , boh legal and illegal , is
responsible for a significant drain on the productive
resources of our country , and this occurs in a variety
of ways , from the cocaine addicted babies who are
unable to learn , to the spread of disease among
addicts , to the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse
and tobacco smoking.

the crack baby scenario has been thouroughly discredited. it
just so happens that the symptoms seen in the crack babies are
identical to fetal alcohol syndrome. and the mothers who admitted
to taking crack also admitted to drinking heavily during pregnancy.

in this country people are free to be stupid if they want to.

but , they are not free to be stupid and injure other people.
admittedly , the fetal right to life is outside the scope of
this discussion. however , it 's ridiculous to assert , as you
apparently do , that cocaine has no effect on the developing
fetal nervous system. caffiene and nicotine have fetal effects
too , why should cocaine be any exception \?

5. a general economic principle of government is
that whatever is subsidized you get more of , and
whatever is taxed you get less of. to be most
effective in confronting the nation 's drug problem ,
some way must be found to utilize these additional
powers of government to make drug dealing and drug use
less attractive.

so make the drugs legal , tax them and use the tax money to fund a program
to tell people how studid drugs are. it has worked for the legal drugs.

if you had read my article before writing your knee jerk response
you would have seen that this is exactly what i advocated.

while this country 's current efforts to combat
legal drugs have succeeded in some respects , (there is
a greater awareness of the health consequences of
smoking , and designated driver programs have helped
reduce drunk driving , for example) , the same cannot be
said for the war on illegal drugs. there remains a
core group of illegal drug users which support
international networks of smugglers , pushers , growers ,
processors , kingpins , and gangsters. these networks
and their marketing activities , which include drive
by shootings , corrupting law enforcement authorities ,
and smuggling weapons , are directly or indirectly
responsible for a large proportion of the crimes
committed in our country every day.

each and every one of these problems is a direct result of the
drug trade being illegal.

no shit , sherlock.

...
clearly , illegal drugs and rising crime are
linked. it takes only a moment 's reflection to
recognize how they are linked. the link is money. as
with this country 's failed effort to prohibit alcohol
consumption , a black market has been created , in which
greedy local monopolies , like the gangsters of a
bygone era , have profited enormously from their
illegal trade. the victims of this trade include not
only the innocent people unfortunate enough to be
caught in the crossfire , but , i would argue , the drug
users themselves.

a great argument for making drugs legal.

thank you. how could you have missed the point so utterly \?
what have you been smoking \?

here then is my proposal

1. possession and use of all presently illegal
drugs is decriminalized , but buying and selling them
remains illegal. 'potheads' can grow their own
marijuana (as many already do today) , other drug users
can legally import their poison of choice as long as
they pay the tariffs , and a barter economy of drug
experimenters develops.

your solution has done nothing to eliminate the violence in
the drug trade. btw , how is someone going to import a drug
if buying it is illegal. i think you need to think your solution
through a little more thouroughly.

obviously , importers will not be buying drugs in the u.s. , under
u.s. jurisdiction. use your remaining brain cells.

2. because of the barter economy which supplies
the drug users , the black market profits that have so
enriched the drug lords dwindle. if these drugs can
be obtained for 'free' or next to nothing , why buy
them \? nevertheless , there will be those who will seek
to sell these noncommercial drugs even at relatively
low prices. therefore ,

you have failed to indicate how these drugs can be obtained for
free or next to nothing. you have stated that the sale of them
is illegal.

o.k. , i 'll spell it out for you. barter economy means that
drug users will be permitted to grow or synthesize chemically
anything they choose , or to buy it outside the u.s. and bring
it in , if it wo n't grow here. they will also be permitted to
trade with other drug users for drugs other than the ones they
themselves grow or manufacture. they will not , however be able
to legally sell their drugs for money. both manufacture and
importation of noncommercial drugs will be taxed , to discourage
their use. this is your brain on drugs. any questions \?

3. law enforcement activity is concentrated on
those individuals who continue to buy and sell , and
also on the crimes committed by drug users too poor to
afford even low prices. but here is where the
strategy begins to differentiate between the drug
dealers , the victimizers , and the drug users , their
victims.

in most cities , this is already the strategy. it has already
failed and is dragging the rest of us down with it.

pardon me , but possession use of these drugs is still a crime !
you cannot analogize the rates at which drug users would seek
treatment , and the comparative ease with which it could be
made available today , when these drugs are illegal to possess use ,
with what it would be were they not illegal to possess use.
decriminalizing possession and use makes treatment much easier.
drug dealers are exploiting the weaknesses of those persons who
are prone to addiction , and as such , the drug users should be
left alone , not thrown in prison along with their victimizers.
drug dealers are the criminals , and should be treated as such.
drug addiction does not absolve you of responsiblity for your
criminal actions , however.

4. upon arrest for any crime , suspects are
permitted to choose whether or not they will undergo a
drug test. those who choose to cooperate are informed
that upon conviction for the crime they are accused
of , if they are found to be a drug user , they will be
institutionalized until they are clean , and only then
will they begin to serve their sentence. if they
choose to cooperate and are already drug free , they
can begin to serve their sentence right away. those
who choose not to undergo the drug test and are
convicted face stiffer fines and serve longer
sentences.

this sounds a hell of a lot like self incrimination. which is
unconstitutional. if drug use is legal in your scheme , why should
the presence of drugs in anyones system influence the penalty they
receive \? much too big brotherish for my tastes.

the drug test of an arrested suspect is voluntary , not coerced ,
and does not therefore constitute violation of amendment v.
those convicted who are drug users , as evidenced by the test ,
are in need of treatment for their problem. institutionalization
of these adddicted criminals is , i would argue , the best way to
help them straighten out. if they refuse the test and are convicted ,
their sentence can be appropriately harsher , since they , unlike the
addict , have no excuse for their crimes.

5. institutionalization of drug using criminals
serves several purposes

drug using criminals (and this includes drunk
and or 'stoned' drivers) are separated from their
sources of supply , thus reducing the total number of
drug users in society at large , and consequently
decreasing the demand for drugs on the street , putting
more of the remaining drug dealers out of business.

why should drug using criminals be treated any different from
other criminals , you have already stated that drug use is legal.

mark.wilson@atlantaga.ncr.com

why not \? my objective is to discourage drug use and criminal
behavior. if fewer criminals do drugs out of fear of getting a
harsher sentence if they are convicted , why is that not a good
thing \? if fewer drug dealers (who are still criminals , btw)
can find victims , why is that not a good thing \? if fewer drug
users , such as drunks , 'potheads , ' etc. , commit crimes out of
fear of being cut off from their sources of supply , why is that
not a good thing \?

i'm certainly willing to debate my position.
you have to read it carefully though.

i do once upon a time i happened to be in a room when someone threw
a tear gas grenade in (that was supposed to be a joke ). the sensation

i remember us a bunch of young men in our early 20 's running out

out of the windows (thank g d we were on the first floor).

i ca n't imagine this kind of stuff being used against children.

for them , the worst effect might not be the physical effects so much
as the psychological effect of being incapacitated without fully
understanding the cause. many years ago , i was accidentally exposed
to a tiny dose of tear gas. (it was in athens , on the street leading
to the american embassy there 'd been a march that had been broken up
with tear gas i must have stumbled into a remaining patch of gas the
next day.) aside from the tears , feeling sick to my stomach , etc. ,
the really horrible psychological effect was that of suddenly falling
to pieces and not knowing why it had happened i was horrified and
wondered what disease or other health problem i had. (i did n't find
out about the march and the tear gas till hours later.) i can imagine
how horribly disorienting this might be to very young children
suddenly crying uncontrollably and feeling sick , weak , and out of
control of your body and not knowing the cause.

note this contradictory title gay activity low.

not really. the percentage of gays was low. headline writers are n't

but you stated that this study was presented in a very accurate and
dependable way. this is confusing to the issue.

and if you read this title it implies that gay sex (homosexual sex)
activities are low compared to the general population that they surveyed.


a new natonal study on male sexual behavior , the most thorough
examination of american men 's sexual practices published since
the kinsey report more than four decades ago , shows about
2 percent of the men surveyed had engaged in homosexual sex and

1 percent considered themselves exclusively homosexual.


actually , 2 were either exclusively homosexual , or bisexual. you are n't
readiing very carefully.

well let us quibble look at the above statement that you posted , i have marked
it with ' ' , it states that 1 are exclusively homosexual it states 2 are
or have engaged in homosexual sex.

and please not the use of adjective here homosexual sex .

now i stated that if we take 1 as homosexal this is a valid viewpoint.

many environmentalists attributed the 1988 drought in the u.s. to global
warming , but researchers with the national center for atmospheric research in

educated and open minded environmentalists do not.

one of the most effective come backs i have seen in a long time.

everybody who disagrees with me is stupid and closed minded.

no , what it means is that i , like a majority of environmental scientists researchers ,
agree that el nino la nina and the southern oscillations are the systems
involoved in that climatic phenomena categorized by humans as a drought(1988).

furthermore , in response to an earlier message , the 1992 u.s. est. output of
sulfur dioxide (20 mill. tons) was equivalent to the entire output by the recent
eruption of mt. pinautubo(sp.). currently world carbon dioxide levels set at approx.
360 ppm , in the past 120 , 000 years it has never gone above 280 (this info
was found using ice core samples from the joint french russian u.s. vostok
project). furthermore , the background emmisions of chlorine compounds into
the atmoshpere is about 0.6 ppb annually , it now sits at 3.5. this overwhelming
data info is found in the world resources doc. published by oxford university.

the ozone hole in the northern and southern hemispheres keeps getting bigger
and stickin' around longer whilst skeptics ponder how wrong or corrupt all this
data from government and international scientific institutions is. it is a pity , that ,
if the skeptics are wrong and we base our complacency on their limbaugh

also , in the april 14 globe and mail , there was a letter from the
director of trauma services at st. michael 's hospital in toronto
responding to an article on a study comparing heart surgery in
california and canada in which some canadian doctor worried that

that study which was in the nejm , i think , noted that the frequency
of heart surgery on patients over seventy increase with income in
california (i guess richer people have more heart disease in
california ) ) whereas the frequency of surgery on patients over
seventy in canada was relatively uniform across income distribution.
heart surgery was more frequent in california , but mortality and
outcomes were essentially the same.

american analysts would seize on the results as proof that canada
rationed vital services. the doctor (i ca n't recall his name) said
that canada is rationing vital services as any physician can
plainly see . he said that a system in which people are refused
treatment because they ca n't afford it is no different from a system
in which people are refused treatment because the government ca n't
afford it as a result of deliberate underfunding of the health
insurance plan. in fairness , he did say that both the us and
canadian systems are in the same situation.

(the ndp cleaning up a tory spending mess \? and just when i thought
i understood canadian politics).


there was one about a group of doctors in calgary who have opened
canada 's first us style mri clinic , as an alternative to the
provincially owned one.

it 's about time ! i 've ragged on my own doctor friends as to why they
do n't invest in their own private practices ... in the end , it 's their
money. but they choose to spend it on america 's cup pipedreams , and
that 's none of my business. as for provincially owned ... for sure
it 's against the law in canada for governments to be directly involved
in the provision of health care except in the military or native reser
vations. what that term actually means is that the facility gets by
on public grants to meet shortfall from lack of use ... no kidding.
medical practice itself is much more conservative up north. my own
best friend did two clerkships at the mayo clinic in rochester , mn ,
and is no stranger to high tech medicine ... but his boat comes first.

there were some people expressing concern that it was the first wedge of
two tiered health care and that it might violate the canada health act.

no , it 's probably socialist whiners who are offended that we have
private practices ... and always have. they can all take cash
anyways ... so why not have a particular facility \? the canadian
big government mentality often imagines government where it does
not even exist ...


the only potential problem i see with the private mri facilty in calgary is the
self referral problem to the facility for the doctors who have a financial
interest in it , which is basically unethical...but in canada because
of our small population , there is likely only to be a few private
facilities involving only a small number of doctors ,
and thus i do n't think the self referral problem , which is an epidemic in the
us , could ever get out of hand here.

look , nobody stopped the clinic when they planned on the mri ...
nobody stopped them when they bought it. nobody seems to be stopping
them from using it , either. much ado about nothing. thank goodness
that hockey playoffs have started ...


it is an experiment that will be certainly be watched carefully.

while it seemed currently unjustified , there was one anecdote told by
the head of the partnership to demonstrate the mri. he showed an
image of an injured knee , which happened to belong to the manager of
the bank who approved the loan. he said that without it , the guy
might have had to wait a month or more at the provincial mri , then
another length of time for treatment , after which the muscles would
have atrophied and rehabilitation would have been that much harder
if that is n't the first whiff of two tiers , i do n't know what is.

i'm certain there is exaggeration somewhere , because the gao study
of canada cited often on usenet did not find access to mri to be a
problem. i 'll bet the doctor is relying on people having listened
to american trash talk on cable so that he can puff his chest a bit.
there are already a few treatment regimens for knee injuries without
relying on mri ... unfortunately , i 've had a few. ) and i'm not
a banker. (


what likely happened is the sponsors of the private mri which include
doctors anticipated that alberta would need more mri 's , and instead
of waiting for the health planners to realize they needed another
one or two , saw a business opportunity...where they would have a
secure business from the public insurance side of things , and they
could supplement people and businesses who want to pay cash.

bzzzzt. thank you for playing , but obviously you are not reading the
material as it is presented. according to the report i 've got in my
hands , the newsweek article (which reported that 2 to 3 percent of the
population is gay) used the criteria of no heterosexual contact in the
past year. but at the same time , the university of denver study points
out , quite dramatically , that 60 of all self identifying gay men have
had some form of heterosexual contact in the past year.

i think the big mistake in that study must be that if one had had no sexual
contact of any kind in the previous year , they are counted as heterosexual.
even if they did n't intend it that way , that 's how the figures are being used.

i find it very interesting that you say there will be 2.5 million
queers in the march on washington. the largest figure i 've seen in
the press is 1 million and we all know how liberal the press is with
their numbers. )

for another thing , 1 of 250 million is 2.5 million not 6. maybe
that 's where you got the 2.5 million number. also , the number cited
in the actual report is 1.5 so that would be about 3.75 million.

as for this march on washington , i wonder how much the media is
going to inflate the numbers this time. last time , for the
pro abortion rally , they more than doubled the actual number of
people who showed up. that and all the stories coming out of how
the press slants the news really makes one wonder who 's watching

here 's a hypothetical question... if clayton said something like all
those niggers are really stupid. (please do n't be offended , i'm not racist
but merely using an example of clayton 's malign logic). and then said he
read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school , i
bet he would n't have your support. yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
dishonest , evil , lying child molesters without personally having a single
homosexual friend or acquaintance and you 'll sit there and support him.

god created a place for bigots. it 's called hell and clayton is going
to burn there for a long time. i pray for him to find in his heart the
christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers
and sisters , because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never
be righteous.

there is a difference between supporting claytons opinions and supporting
his right to speak. i want you to know that you cannot educate and or
elevate ones understanding by calling him names. clayton has an opinion
which in his mind is as valid as any opinion anyone else on the net has.
if you were to walk up to black person to talk about blacks in the inner
city and began the conversation with those niggers in th....... . you
would lose the attention of that black person by the time you spoke your
second word. all name calling and derisive remarks do is turn off the
audience you are trying to address. clayton is guilty of that and as
such has distracted attention away from his message to bits and pieces
of his conversation. i do n't understand why people want to repeat his

i'm curious why you think that particular adjective is important.

black is a descriptive adjective that describes mr. king. from many
of the newspaper , radio , and tv news reports i have seen , this adjective

is commonly in front of his name. i have never seen anyone complain about
the use of this adjective when used in a benign manner. i did not say that
mr. king was a no good black ! i do not know mr. king and would not make this
ascertian without some evidence to this effect. i used it purely as a
descriptive adjective in the same manner than many ( most ) news people have
used it in the past.

no one is questioning whether mr. king is black. the question arises
whether king 's race should make police officers afraid as hell. your
statement seems to imply that cops should have a different standard for
large black guys than for just large guys in general.

the original poster never said they were afraid of king because he was
black. in fact the officers were afraid of king because of what he did ,
not because of the color of his skin. it is you , mr. frank that read the
phrase large black man and cried racism in a typical knee jerk fashion.
when you (and others , i suspect) can get past this problem maybe the real
problems in this issue can be discussed.

that two posts later you do n't understand why anyone pointed out your use
of the adjective is almost as informative as your original use.

that people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might

there will always be conflicting ideas on what constitutes improving the

people will have a better chance of improving themselves in that environment.

let me try to put it another way. libertarians believe that an

any guarantee that a really good solution will ever be found to any

utopia is a myth (although we can do a lot better than what we have today).

others how to. are you in \?

i'm flattered by your invitation , but i'm afraid you have the wrong person.
although i completely agree with your civil liberties agenda , i'm not
in support of your economic agenda. what i do like about the libertarian
party is that you guys are so good at shaking up the tired ideas of the
past. i encourage you guys to continue your crusade , but i'm afraid i
ca n't ride along.

you should face the facts. love canal was not , and is not , an

not a problem \? would you move to three mile island \? i would
imagine there is some cheap property available !

no , because i do n't like the weather back east. however , it would bother me
not one bit to live in an equivalent area here. by the way , do you know what
the extra exposure to radiation from tmi was \?

the naturally occurring catastrophic events disasters that
destroy property (ie hurricanes , tornados , earthquakes) do
not usually leave toxic wastes that prevent people from
re building their lives there. the man made disasters (oil
spills , toxic dumping , radioactive waste dispersions) cause
death and make an area unliveable far beyond the initial
event.

o.k. , in the u.s. , tell me about some of these deaths and some of these
unliveable areas. oh , and if you manage to find some of these unliveable
areas , tell me what percentage of the total us land area they are.
(hint the total waste produced by all nuclear reactors in the us can be
safely stored in the area of three footbal fields.)



there are actually people that still believe love canal was some kind of
environmental disaster. weird , eh \?

these opinions are mine , and you ca n't have 'em ! (but i 'll rent 'em cheap ...)

the following statement was released
on february 27 , 1992 by the science
environmental policy project

as independent scientists researching atmosphere and climate problems , we are
concerned by the agenda for unced , the united nations conference on
environment and development , being developed by environmental and activists
groups and certain political leaders. this so called earth summit is
scheduled to convene in brazil in june 1992 and aims to impose a system of
global envionmental regulations , including onerous taxes on energy fuels , on
the population of the united states and other industrialized nations.
such policy initiatives derive from highly uncetain scientific theories. they
are based on the unsupported assumption that catastrophic global warming
follows from the burning of fossill fuels and requires immediate action. we
do not agree.
a survey of u.s. atmospheric scientists , conducted in the summer of 1991 ,
confirms that there is no consesensus about the cause of the slight warming
observed during the past century. a recently published research paper even
suggests sunspot variability (which is directly proportional to solar
activity) , rather than a rise in greenhouse gases is responsible for the
global temperature increases and decreases recoded since about 1880.
futhermore , the majority of scientific participants in the survey agreed that
the theoretical climate climate models used to predict a future warming
cannot be relied upon and are not validated by the existing climate record.
yet all predictions are based on such theoretical models.
finally , agriculturalits generally agree that any increase in carbon dioxide
levels from fossil fuels burning has beneficial effects on most crops and on
world food supply.
we are disturbed that activists , anxious to stop energy and economic growth ,
are pushing ahead with drastic policies without taking notice of recent
changes in the underlying science. we fear that the rush to impose global
regulations will have catastrophic impacts on the world economy , on jobs ,
standards of living , and health care , with the most severe consequences
falling on developing countries and the poor.

press briefing
by dee dee myers

the briefing room


9 47 a.m. edt


ms. myers okay , today 's schedule. as you know , the
president jogged this morning with senator wofford.

at 1 15 p.m. , he will have a photo opportunity in the
rose garden to present the teacher of the year award. at 1 30 p.m. ,
he will meet with his principal advisors on bosnia. and at 5 00
p.m. , he 'll meet with president vaclav havel. there will be a photo
op at the top of that meeting no formal press conference afterwards.

any questions \?

q is he moving towards some major decision this week
on bosnia \?

ms. myers as we 've said , he 's continuing to discuss
his options. he 's been talking extensively with his foreign policy
advisors , his bosnia advisors , as well as with other world leaders.
he 'll try to contact president mitterrand again today , and he 'll
continue to discuss it. we do n't have any specific timetable , but
obviously the situation there is very serious.

q has he called janet reno today or yesterday \?

ms. myers i do n't believe he 's spoken to her today.

q why does he have nothing to say about this publicly
except on the piece of paper that was put out last night at 6 40
p.m. \?

ms. myers he did. he answered a question about it
yesterday.

q before anything had happened.

ms. myers before anything happened. he put out

q since something has happened he 's had nothing to
say.

ms. myers he 's put out a statement on it last night.
and we 'll have more to say about it later today.

q in what forum is that going to be \?

ms. myers it will be at the photo in the rose garden.

q he will talk about waco at that \?

ms. myers yes , he 'll have something to say.

q is that something we can take live \?


ms. myers i think it will be brief. we can talk a
little later about the exact structure as we work it out. but i
do n't know if it 's something you 'd want to take live.

q will he take questions on waco at that time as
well \?

ms. myers he 'll probably take a few.

q is there any reason why he has n't talked to the
attorney general \?

ms. myers i 'll have to double check. i do n't know
that he has n't talked to her this morning.

q and she did n't come here this morning to see him or
anyone else \?

ms. myers no.

q and he did n't talk yesterday \?

q what 's the reaction to her resignation statement
that she made last night \?

ms. myers she was asked a question about it , and she
answered the question. the president has absolutely no intention of
asking for the attorney general 's resignation. he stands behind her
100 percent. as you know , he was informed about the decision. he
takes full responsibility for that , and stands 100 percent behind
attorney general reno.

q the question now arises yesterday we were told
that he was briefed on this , but we never got a firm idea of how much
he knew of what the plan was and the justification for the plan and
the justification of the timing. was he fully informed on all of
that , all of this about the increasing levels of violence inside the
compound that made them want to go now , the feeling that nothing else
was going to succeed , et cetera \?

ms. myers he talked with the attorney general about
the decision , about she talked to him about the factors that led
to her decision. he raised no objections. he supports her decision
to go forward with it. he was fully briefed.

q of course , hindsight is 20 20 , but looking back
now , does the president , does the white house feel that the decision
he signed off on proved to be the right way to go when you look at
what actually happened \?

ms. myers i think everybody feels bad when life is
lost. but i do n't think that that is reason to second guess the
decision. he stands behind the decision that was made. he was
informed about it. he was fully briefed about it and he stands 100
percent behind the attorney general , the justice department and the
fbi. it 's a difficult operation and there 's it had already gone
on for more than seven weeks. four federal agents had lost their
lives in the line of duty let 's not forget that.

this was a very difficult situation and all the
decisions involved were very difficult. but all the agents on the
ground , the fbi , the justice department all recommended moving
forward with this. they thought , given the circumstances , it was the
best possible course of action. there 's just no point in second
guessing those decisions. now , i think that there 's a reason

q why not \? they have to


ms. myers no , not to second guess the decisions. i
think it 's important to take a look at it , to have an investigation.
i think the president will talk some about that later today. but at
this from this vantage point , to second guess those decisions ,
it 's not useful.

q you sound like he 's going to order an investigation
of what happened and whether

ms. myers i think he 'll have more to say about that
later , yes.

q he will order an investigation \?

ms. myers he 'll have more yes he 'll have more to
say about an investigation.

q what kind of investigation \?

ms. myers he 'll have more to say about it later.

q but in the monday morning quarterbacking , surely
there is some soul searching now as to whether it was the right
decision. you ca n't say that we did the best we could when it turned
out to be a rather a debacle.

ms. myers i think we 'll obviously , we 'll review
the situation and all the factors that lead to a very tragic outcome.
i do n't think anybody disputes that the outcome was tragic. but ,
again , the president stands behind the decisions that were made and
we 'll take a look at the factors that contributed to that.

q what was the fbi director 's role in this \?

ms. myers well , he was obviously involved in setting
up the operation. he signed off on it , as did the agents that were
on the ground that were working with him. i do n't believe he spoke
to the president , but i 'll double check that.

q but he was very closely involved in every aspect of
planning and so forth \?

ms. myers i would refer you to the fbi on exactly what
aspects he was involved with.

q will janet reno be coming over to the white house
today \?

ms. myers there 's no planned meeting. i do n't believe
that she 'll be here.

q she wo n't be at this event at 1 15 p.m. \?

ms. myers no , no plans to be.

q do you think that there 's going to be a jumping on
on the part of political opposition to make something out of this in
terms of to the president 's detriment politically \?

ms. myers well , i would certainly hope that people
would n't try to use this tragedy for political reasons. obviously , i
think , again , that it 's useful to look at the facts , to reevaluate
the facts , and i think the president will move forward with that.
but i think people understand that this was a difficult series of
decisions that it was a very difficult situation that it was caused
by a man who was a cult leader who was involved in the death of four
federal agents. and i think it 's most tragic that a lot of innocent

children lost their lives in this. i do n't think anybody disputes
the tragedy of the outcome.

q dee dee , what was the white house role in handling
the , i guess , public relations aspect in the aftermath \? who was
talking who here at the white house was talking with people at
justice to set up reno 's news conference , to do all that sort of
thing \?

ms. myers i think the attorney general handled her end
of the situation herself and made the decision to go ahead with the
news conference once there was a point at which there was enough
information , i think , to talk with some accuracy about what had
transpired during the day. obviously , people here at a number of
levels were keeping in touch with people at the justice department
and at the fbi to try to keep informed about what was happening
there.

q but reno said that she did n't talk to the
president , and there seemed to be an indication she had n't talked to
anybody at the white house. so who

ms. myers there were people talking on a staff to
staff level.

q i understand. but who at the justice department
was handling that for reno \? who was talking to the white house \?

ms. myers there were a number of people. as you know ,
webb hubbell is the liaison to the white house , and i know he talked
to a number of people here. there were a number of people at a
number of different levels involved. i do n't want to get into
exactly who had what conversations with whom , but there were a number
of conversations. obviously , the justice department was working to
keep the white house informed , the press informed to the best of its
ability as events unfolded throughout the day.

q did webb hubbell talk to the president \?

ms. myers i do n't believe so. i do n't know if he
talked he may have at one point.

q and was the white house role just to seek
information about what happened , or was it to direct the public
information campaign that followed \?

ms. myers it was both to keep abreast of the situation
so the president could be on top of it , but i think the justice
department managed its press relations on it. we were obviously very
interested in what was happening there throughout the day , and the
president was following it very closely throughout the day.

q dee dee , on that , though , if the president was
following it so closely and he had talked the night before with janet
reno , why would n't he talk to her at all since then \?

ms. myers again , i do n't know if he 's talked to her
this morning. again , he 's kept fully aware of what has been going on
throughout the day. he stands 100 percent behind her decisions.
he 's been fully supportive of her , as he said yesterday morning
before events transpired and yesterday afternoon in a written
statement.

q but would n't he want to convey those thoughts to
her personally yesterday \?

ms. myers one more time , i do n't know if they 've
spoken this morning.


q no , yesterday.

q clearly there 's a perception that she was left hung
out to dry all day yesterday.

ms. myers that 's just not true. i think we said
throughout the day that the president takes full responsibility , that
he stands i do n't know how much clearer we can be. the president
stands foursquare behind the attorney general on this. he accepts
full responsibility for the events that transpired. he believes that
janet reno , the justice department , and the fbi acted as best they
could , given the circumstances and the facts that were evident at the
time. i do n't know what else he can say to show that he supports her
1 , 000 percent.

q one of the best indications of that is to pick up
the phone and tell her.

ms. myers again , i do n't know whether they 've spoken
this morning.

q why ca n't we find out \?

ms. myers well , we can. i ca n't do it standing here
right now.

q you 've got six people here. all they 've got to do
is pick up the phone.

ms. myers helen , we 'll get back to you.

q dee dee , when the president spoke with the attorney
general on sunday , is it safe to assume that either she volunteered
or he inquired about whether there was a possible downside to
increasing pressure on the davidians \?

ms. myers i think that they discussed the situation.
again , i'm not going to get into the specific details of what exactly
she told him , but i think that he was aware of the risks involved.

q dee dee , the president yesterday morning said it
was entirely her decision. she then said that she told him what was
happening and he said , okay. does the president regard it that he
gave the go ahead or that she gave the go ahead \?

ms. myers i think what they both said yesterday was
that she made a decision based on all the available facts. she
informed him about that and he raised no objections. again , i do n't
know how much clearer we can be about that.

q and he said , okay. the issue is over the
responsibility.

ms. myers he said , okay.

q does okay mean

ms. myers the president accepts ultimate
responsibility.

q dee dee , the president 's investigation that he 's
going to announce would that be conducted by someone outside the
administration \?

ms. myers no.


q it would be internal is it meant to preclude any
congressional investigation \?

ms. myers no , it 's meant simply to follow up on the
incidents that occurred yesterday.

q and you would , i assume , therefore , cooperate fully
with any congressional hearings that would be held \?

ms. myers to the best of our ability.

q dee dee , there are two reports out this morning.
one that the justice department , or fbi , or whomever , apparently had
a bug planted inside the complex. and the other is that the children
may have been injected with some kind of poison that may have either
left them unconscious or maybe even killed them before the fire.
what do you know about those two

ms. myers nothing more than i 've seen in news accounts
this morning. we may get more on it later , but at this point , i know
i'm not sure anybody knows any more than what was reported by
people who came out of the compound.

q has the president received any report today in
terms of fatalities and actually what was going on what they 've
been able to find out on in the compound now \?

ms. myers he 's been briefed. i do n't think that
they 've gotten into the compound yet. they were still waiting for it
to cool off. i do n't think there 's much beyond what 's been reported
in the news accounts. but he has been kept up to date on it.

q dee dee , the president stands behind attorney
general reno , but does he feel that she perhaps got bad advice from
the so called experts \?

ms. myers he believes that she made he stands
behind the decision that she made. it was the unanimous decision of
her advisors , of the fbi , of the agents on the ground , and he
supports that.

q what about the validity of the decisions made on
the ground \? does he back those

ms. myers he 's not going to second guess decisions
made.

q dee dee , you just said , he stands behind the
decision which she made. normally , in a situation like this , the
president says , i made the decision. but you 're saying she made the
decision \?

ms. myers i'm saying that the president was briefed
about the decision. he okayed it and he accepts full responsibility
for it.

q but then why do you keep using the terminology , the
decision that she made , rather than the decision that he made

ms. myers because , as he said yesterday , she evaluated
the facts based on evidence presented to her by justice department
and fbi , which is part of the justice department , and made a decision
and then briefed the president on that decision. that is how the
chain of command works. she briefed him. he signed off on it. the
operation went forward , and the president accepts full
responsibility.


q in that chain of command analogy there , i want to
go back to sessions a moment. do you know if this was a plan that
came through him to reno , or was it presented to her around him or
with his involvement \? what was his involvement \?

ms. myers again , you 'd have to go to the justice
department for the specific interaction between the attorney general
and the director.

q does the president stand behind director sessions \?

ms. myers he supports again , i do n't know how many
different ways i can say this he supports the decisions made by
the justice department and the fbi. he fully supports the attorney
general in this. i'm not stepping away from the director of the fbi ,
i want to but janet reno is the one who briefed him , the one who
made the decisions as the head of the justice department. as you
know , the director of the fbi reports to the attorney general. the
attorney general made the decision. she informed the president about
those decisions. he okayed it. he did n't raise any objections to
it , and he accepts full responsibility.

q do you have , based on what you know here at the
white house , any concerns about william sessions' performance during
this

ms. myers nothing to suggest that , no.

q along those same lines , just in your initial review
of the situation , how much do you think the problems might have come
from not having a justice department that 's fully staffed and having
an fbi director who is still quite uncertain about his status \?

ms. myers i just do n't think that had anything to do
with it. i think the agents on the ground the operation went
forward. i'm not going to speculate on that.

q did the white house express any alarm that janet
reno chose to speak to the live network media before she chose to
speak to clinton \?

ms. myers no. she was carrying forward her
responsibility to inform the public about the events of yesterday. i
think she did a very admirable job. the president agrees with that.

q before sunday , how often was the president briefed
on the situation in waco \?

ms. myers he was kept updated on a regular basis , on a
daily basis.

q who briefed the president \?

ms. myers well , i'm not going to get into exactly who ,
what conversations he had with whom , but he was kept up to date on
the events in waco. he has daily briefings on a number of issues.

q no , no , was this a regular briefing conducted by a
white house staff person , or was it by a justice department person \?

ms. myers he 's briefed regularly by a white house
staff on a number of issues. again , i'm not going to get into
exactly who briefs him on what subjects.

q another subject \?

q on another subject.



q now we 're going to do gays in the military.
(laughter.)

ms. myers i welcome it.

q how close are you to signing the biodiversity
treaty \?

ms. myers as you know , the president 's giving a speech
on earth day tomorrow. we 'll have more to say about it then.

q any details on where or when that speech is yet \?

ms. myers it 's at 11 30 a.m. and i do n't know where
yet.

q dee dee , is this a major policy address \? how would
you characterize the speech tomorrow \?

ms. myers i would characterize it as a earth day
speech. i would n't look for any major departures from his past
positions on these things. but , again , i do n't want to get too much
into what he 's going to talk about tomorrow.

q on or off campus \?

q is this at a location outside the white house \?

ms. myers it will be somewhere in washington. we
do n't know exactly where yet.

q dee dee , what foreign leaders has the president
talked to since friday on the situation in bosnia \?

ms. myers only prime minister major. and again , he 'll
try to reach president mitterrand again this morning.

q david owen said yesterday and joe biden said today
both of them agree that the peace process is not going to work ,
that the serbs are not going to sign on. does the administration
still believe that it can work and that they will sign on \?

ms. myers obviously , the ultimate goal is some sort of
peaceful resolution to the conflict in bosnia. as you know , the
administration is considering a wide variety of options at this
point. the situation there in and around srebrenica and the rest of
eastern bosnia is quite serious. and the president will meet with
his bosnian advisors today and continue to press forward on this.

q is that a question they 're going to try to be
deciding whether or not the peace plan remains viable \?

ms. myers again , they 'll be reviewing a number of
options , including the peace plan.

q does the group that he 's meeting with today include
reg bartholomew \?

ms. myers i do n't believe he 's here. but it will be
among the usual secretary christopher , secretary aspin , general
powell.

q dee dee , do you have anything on the apparent
encounter by u.s. f 15s over bosnia today some aircraft violating
the no fly zone \?

ms. myers no , i do n't. i 'll get back to you on that.


q will the president be meeting with every one of the
leaders coming to town for the holocaust museum \?

ms. myers he will. he 'll be meeting , as you know ,
with vaclav havel today and with lech walesa tomorrow , and then with
the rest of the group tomorrow afternoon.

q as a group , or one by one \?

ms. myers i believe it 's as a group. now , havel and
walesa asked for meetings early and these have been on the agenda for
quite some time. but he will meet with all of the foreign heads of
state that are here.

q dee dee , has the president decided whether he
supports the gay and lesbian civil rights act \? and has anything been
worked out for him to address the march on sunday \?

ms. myers i think he 'll probably have a letter or some
kind of a statement to the march. we have n't worked out the exact
details of that.

q not a live phone hook up \?

ms. myers probably not , given the logistics of getting
to boston. the speech , as you know , is at 4 00 p.m. the answer to
the other part of your question is , no , he has n't taken a position on
it.

q you said that speech in boston was at 4 00 p.m. \?

ms. myers i believe so , yes.

q do you know what it 's on \?

ms. myers we 'll still working out

q general vessey 's coming back tonight from vietnam.
when will he be meeting with the president \?

ms. myers no specific meeting is scheduled. we 'll
talk to him at some point and see. we look forward to his report ,
but exactly how he 'll make that report is unclear.

q so he 's not going to come immediately to the white
house \?

ms. myers no.

q the aids czar how close are you \?

ms. myers still working on it.

q drug czar \?

q do you expect it before the march \?

ms. myers i do n't have a time line on it.

q did the president ask senator mitchell to try the
lloyd cutler ploy to break the filibuster \?

ms. myers i do n't believe so.

q why not \?

ms. myers he 's just not going to.


q are senate democrats here at this hour \?

ms. myers no , that 's tomorrow tomorrow at 9 30 a.m.

q update on the stimulus , possible scaling down

ms. myers as you know , the senate will vote on
amendments today. we 'll continue to talk. the president is
committed to some kind of a jobs package we 'd like to see it passed.
and we 'll continue in conversations throughout the day and see where
we end up.

q when this briefing is over can you give us word
through the speaker or whatever whether the president 's talked to
janet reno \?

ms. myers we 'll be happy to.

q it 's become a pressing question for the last
several hours.

ms. myers no , just this minute that i 've been here ,
and i have n't had a chance to follow up on it , helen.

q does he have an opinion on hatfield \?

ms. myers i mean , obviously , he prefers he offered
a compromise package of 12.2 billion. he believes that that 's the
best alternative , believes that he 's obviously willing to take a
second look at the package. and i think the senate will vote on that
today , and we 're hopeful that the president 's bill , which will be the
mitchell amendment , will be the one that will be approved.

q dee dee , is there any white house official that
will be at the march on sunday \?

ms. myers somebody will be there representing the
president. i do n't know who yet.

q well , has it been decided how he 's going to
address \? is it going to be a videotape or a phone call \?

ms. myers i think it will probably be a letter , but
there has n't been a final decision on that yet.

q the official will read the letter , is that what it
sounds like \?

ms. myers correct.

q lloyd bentsen came in here this morning. do you
know what was that about \? was that about this waco thing \?

ms. myers no , actually it was n't. it may have come
up , but it was about economic issues.

q on health care is the 17th of may still the
target \?

ms. myers that 's still the target.

q and there 's talk about a joint session of congress
speech at the end of may

ms. myers we have n't resolved exactly how the
president will present the health care plan to the people. i
would n't rule that out as an option , but no decisions have been made.

okay , but do doctors willingly testify against each other in
malpractice cases when they do go to court (obviously , absolutely
essential to prove malpractice) \? it used to be impossible to get
doctors here to do that (a possible advantage of the us system
you wo n't hear about from the ama).

our doctors' monopoly is exactly the same as in the u.s. , if not
more powerful now that they can dictate insurance payment rates ,
but i do n't know an answer to this one. anecdotally , my friends
who are md 's (including my main buds from high school) talk about
how hard it is to turn state 's witness against someone else ...
no direct experience there , though.

also , in some circumstances you may have to sue the insurance plan
people here , after all , sue health insurance companies all the time.
i heard about a guy in alberta who came down with some rare eye
disease that he had to take repeated trips to seattle to get treated.
it cost him and his family something like 6000 and the province ,
years later , still has only reimbursed them for 500 or so.

well , what american private insurance plans cover travel expenses \? \? \?

since our public insurance plans are publicly accountable , one can
raise a stink in the media to try and extort benefits beyond which
one is entitled (hey , not alberta 's fault that he lives there) ...
if he lived in cheyenne , wy his private insurance would 've told him
to go to hell for the travel expenses and that 's that. an hmo would
have just kept quiet and let him go blind.

well , yeah , tell us about the national defense medical centre
outside ottawa.

it serves the same purpose as the bethesda naval hospital ... since
not all hospitals can provide everything , maybe they have some stuff
that others do n't \? (ottawa 's population is only a quarter million ,
if you include the surrounding counties.)

my point was that something that should necessarily remain
unpoliticized has become very politicized , to the detriment
of its mission.

i do n't think that this has been shown with the dmc ...

the problem is , in a system where hospitals' annual budgets are
approved by the government , how do you keep political considerations
out of medical decisions \? i bet that if you 're an mp or mpp , or good
friends with one , you 're put on any hospital 's urgent care list no
matter how minor your problem. which is ok unless you 're someone who
gets bumped off the list for some bigshot.

people of influence will get their way in any system , american or
european. it 's the golden rule he who has the gold makes the
rules. (

but to what extent does it affect the system \? and why is an urgent
care list necessary in the first place \? it 's worth thinking about.

it 's regular practice in a hospital to figure out who needs to get
at what facilities. do n't americans have to arrange in advance for
operations too \? i think that there are two standards being applied
here , and that canada ca n't give beverly hills style treatment to
everybody. it 's not a big brother list ... it 's more like calling
around town for a table for dinner ...

yeah , but private nonprofit foundations have to make money somehow ,
especially in the hospital business.

yes , and the tories in ottawa are trying to make them do that rather
than hope for a bigger grant from the feds and their province the
next time around. whether it 's using mop a couple of weeks longer
or even selling services to americans (remember , our system is cash
based and since our health care infrastructure is overbuilt except
in specialties that require larger populations to generate business ,
why not \? the alternative is closing unused wards ... business.).

whether canadians would be thrilled at the prospect of their own
health services catering toward americans , who would be willing
to pay more than they do , is another issue entirely) , it must be
noted that they said they were doing it partly because their grants
from the province were getting smaller if those grants are so
insubstantial , why the need to attract foreigners to make up the
difference \?

you answered the question yourself ... private nonprofit foundations
have to make money somehow , and i think that it 's about time that
they acted like the private hospitals that they are. personally ,
i'm fed up with canadian socialists trying to tell everyone that
their health care is free when we are actually buying insurance
(that 's one at you , bob rae ! ! ).

the gdp figures are combined public and private expenditures for total
outlay , and are compiled use the same methods by the oecd that yield
the 13 14 figure for the u.s.

but do n't the us figures include dentistry and optometry where the
canadian one (until recently , anyway) did n't \?

since we have always been evaluated in an oecd style , i do n't see
how ... remember , oecd counts both private and public funds , and
in canada like france and germany , 30 of health care spending is
private funds (i.e. , not the basic health insurance money).

so what happens if the health care systems financially collapse.

how \? they are collecting premiums ... and i'm an advocate of having
copayments like the french do in their system ...

well , if you spend more than you take in , you go bankrupt. it 's that
simple. if the provincial insurance systems find themselves paying
out more than they get in revenue , they wo n't be able to pay for
everybody 's primary care. yes , the infrastructure will be there.
but will everybody be able to continue using it at the same rate.

minor copayments can flush out abusers. remember that our system
is only an insurance policy. but our costs are n't rising fast
enough to ensure adequate copayments deductibles ... last year ,
quebec 's user fee proposal came out with the number of 5 as
the necessary hike that could be done through a copayment rather
than give the qma a raise. and it 's not contract time yet , as
far as i can tell from upi clarinet ...

even the new reform party , a breakoff of traditionalists from the
conservatives with a mildly libertarian faction , holds our public
health insurance as an untouchable but that just a few people have to
be reminded that it 's not free (the average canadian european is more
fiscally naive than their american counterparts on issues like these).
but no mention of copayments anywhere to be seen ... but cutting public
spending all over the place , and bringing back the death penalty , with
little haste if elected.

i know that , for pete 's sake , i live right on the border. i know the
canadian system is n't socialized medicine (unlike britain 's nhs).

sorry ! ( it 's just that i even run into people from buffalo
and from michigan who do n't know ...

the point is , that means that if the money runs low in the plan ,
you 're out of luck unless you can afford it yourself.

yeah , but there 'd be a lot of lead time and a health care crisis that
would preclude it. if provincial governments (as bad as some of them
are heck , we have the ndp cleaning up a spending mess made by the
conservatives in saskatchewan embarassing ! ) can be so irresponsible ,
there is still reallocation health insurance is so important that
it 's about the only thing that can inspire open rebellion and violent
insurrection outside of the hockey rink. right now , attempts to get
the system and its users to learn good habits are being treated like
cod liver oil ...

would the private insurers take up the slack \? they 'd be under no
obligation to. of course , they could eventually make money again ,
but if what you say is true , they 'd be loathe to do so (and out of
practice in handling such basic services , too).

some of the companies providing extra insurance are subsidiaries of
american companies , and their parents provide full insurance down
here. regardless , all firms up north can easily turn on cable tv
to see how well the american firms are doing by being involved in
basic coverage. the private firms are making too much money after
having gotten rid of basic coverage. they run around patting them
selves on the back for their own cooperation in providing extras
for those people who deserve it .

yeah , but eventually it 's going to create a kind of two tiered
effect that will be noticeable after a while , like in britain.

most americans are fearful of a single tier system ... (

seriously , there are few areas that have sufficient population for a
two more tiered system like what the french have ... a health policy
prof , d.g. shea , has cited studies in the nejm that indicate having
a population of 500 , 000 is necessary for adequate competition ...
and in canada , there are only four cities west of the great lakes
with that population or larger.

anyways , the numbers show that costs have held steadier than those
in the u.s. and barring any future chernobyl like crisis , sudden
transients in spending are unlikely. in fact , the health allocation
is one of the most well behaved sectors of spending up north so any
talk of bankruptcy is talk radio fodder far away from the border.

if the provinces hit fiscal rough spots and have to cut back , the
things private insurers have to offer will seem less and less like
luxuries and the gap will be more and more noticeable.

this wo n't be overnight , and something like this would force canada
to have a system more like the french one ... but that 's not a bad
thing , and the change will be minimal (i.e. , add copayments and
frustrate the socialists chanting hey , it 's free ! ).

mr cramer

you are on one hand condemning the news media as

the role of the national news media in inflaming passions that
was your message subject i believe.

then you turn around and actually take from the santa rosa (cal.) press democrat ,

you even use such a title for the san jose mercury news the murky news.

now which is it \? are you going to comdemn national media , then turn around
and use it to support some position you present \? seems somewhat contradictory
does n't it.

i believe that this is not contradictory on the basis that
the quality of media reporting varies greatly based on the
subject at hand. the media has proven itself very accurate
is the areas of presenting raw , undisputed data. one good
example would be the weather page in which high and low
temperatures of the previous day for a large number of
locations are posting. there is little evidence to show
that they are in error.

the american media has failed us in its analysis of complex
events , however. i'm sure that we can come up with many
news stories that have left us angry because so many facts
have been ommitted. cases that come to mind are the
invasion of panama , the war with iraq , the disaster in waco ,
the issues surrounding the acceptance of gays into the
military , the war on drugs , and many others.

the story that you bring to light was regarding the new
sex survey. while i'm sure that due to lazyness some of
the data was ommitted from the article , i would venture to
guess that the data that was presented did not deviate
from the survey. i do , however , think that it would be
folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter 's
analysis of this data. in this particular case , there was
little analysis , and the reader was left to draw his her
own convictions.

many netters , mr. cramer included , often forget that the
american media are merely a number of businesses , who 's
purpose in life is to make money for their owners and
stockholders. revenues come largely from advertisers
who merely want maximum useful exposure per dollar. the
media is like fast food the quality of the food (or of
the reporting) will improve only if the customers demand
as such. otherwise , it is business as usual.

i believe this true when we speak of physical data , in the
sense of pure science. but when we speak of data that revolve
around social sciences then we have to be careful.

i quite agree. but these are cases or 'news events' that contain
politics , social science information , sociology , etc. and at
best are reflections of the group that reports them.

as you have pointed out , it is difficult to report that the
temperature was 98 degrees when it was 60 degrees and have
people believe you.

the story that you bring to light was regarding the new
sex survey. while i'm sure that due to lazyness some of
the data was ommitted from the article , i would venture to
guess that the data that was presented did not deviate
from the survey. i do , however , think that it would be
folly to have blind faith in a single newswriter 's
analysis of this data. in this particular case , there was
little analysis , and the reader was left to draw his her
own convictions.

yes and no. the survey presented , according to mr. cramer ,
a value called the median which one used this makes us
believe that 1 2 of the males had 7.3 plus sex partners and
1 2 of the males had 7.3 or less sex partners. homosexuals
are purported to make up only 1 . in this case , the majority
of people with 7.3 plus sex partners are heterosexual.

it is my feeling that median was not the intended word usage.
but if it is then we have little evidence to support mr. cramer
claims about gay promiscuity hetero promiscuity.


many netters , mr. cramer included , often forget that the
american media are merely a number of businesses , who 's

the reporting) will improve only if the customers demand

very good this is a point that i have tried to bring out ,
and as any network news program will show you , it is true.

the news media is a business and as such becomes skewed because
of where its loyalties lie.

there is an old statement by a man ( and i cannot remember him
or his statment exactly) but it warns against the merger of
business and news reporting , because of the obvious consequences.
what master is news going to serve in the end... the advertiser
and the bias of the news group.

they certainly knew that there were pregnant women in there plus
children. i could not believe when they said that the gassing was
an attempt to save the children yesterday. i ca n't think of a much
worse sort of child abuse that pouring tear gas into a building.


2. have you ever seen a tear gas canister \? \? tear gas is produced by burning a
chemical in the can. the fumes produced are tear gas. the canister has a
warning printed on the side of it. contact with flamable material can result
in fire. now , how many of these canisters did they throw inside a building
they admited was a fire trap \? \?

i have heard two things recently explaining this

1. they pumped the gas into the building from outside via some
sort of pipe rather than by canister.

2. the sort of tear gas they are using was described as some
sort of powdery material that sticks to things. kind of
like a powder cloud.

and once again , these are government lacky explainations and
since government stories always change , none or all of the
information might not be true.


this whole thing was a case of over reaction by the officials at every step.
i hope it is thoroughly investigated and the responsible parties are held
accountable. but that is highly unlikely when you figure they are going to
be investigating themselves.

or better yet , the texas rangers will be investigating which is
probably worse than the fbi or atf investigating itself.

no cramer it does not. in this instance you are telling porkies to

when one more item , just a little different , with a new texture and

we 're number one in percentage of population without health insurance.


the main reason we 're number one in percentage of population without
health insurance is that we 're last in percentage of population
covered by public health insurance. only about one fifth of americans
qualify for the main types of public health insurance available in the
united states medicare , medicaid , and veterans' benefits.(2l)

of those who do n't qualify , many have private insurance.(22) but
almost one in seven americans (34 million people most living in
families with a working adult) have no insurance at all , and one in
four (63 million) have been without insurance for a substantial period
of time during the last two years. many more have inadequate coverage ,
meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness.(23) in fact ,
one health care expert says that because only 1 percent of the
population has private longterm care insurance , virtually any
american could be impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness. (24)
additionally , as many as 40 percent of those eligible for some forms
of public aid do not receive it. these gaps in health care result
directly from the fact that the united states is the only major
industrialized nation (other than south africa) without a national
health insurance plan providing universal coverage while controlling
costs.

somehow i doubt it , though....

hatemonger someone who reminds people of why homosexuals are dying
in such large quantities of aids because their sexual compulsions
prevented them from keeping their number of sexual partners below
four digits.

i 've got a few clues for you. (a) i'm not working to pass any laws. (b)

it 's being done in your name.

and that makes it my responsibility , i see. suppose i kill someone in the
name of clayton cramer. how does that make you a murderer \?

if i know about it , and do n't express my disapproval , it certainly
would make you suspicious about me , would n't it \?

my morals are n't yours. i would n't march in a parade with a group
that advocates child molestation. it does n't stop homosexuals.

i would n't march in a parade with a group like that either. and if you 're
talking about nambla , i think you 'll find that they do not advocate child
molestation. i also think you 'll find that the vast majority of homosexuals

they advocate sex between adults and children , with no lower limit on
age. but that 's right , homosexuals do n't believe that an adult sodomizing
a five year old is child molestation.

will have no truck with that group anyway.

fooled me. they march in a number of gay parades around the country.

americans take their religion too seriously to the point of trying to convert

never heard of arguement by absurdity , eh no \? also called
sarcasm. the usual procedure is to accept some part of the
'oppositions' arguement and run with it until one goes
beyond 'rational thought' and then ring the changes.

z.b. the idea of a minimum wage is considered a good one.
and in these times of economic difficulty , the washington
legislature is propossing to raise the state minwage from
4.25 (the federal level) to 4.90 (fifteen cents over
oregon 's).
it would seem to me that this increase does not
keep pace with inflation , that the minimum wage should be
to 6.08 by my figures , so it is proposed that we raise
the minimum wage to 6.50 per hour by 1 july and then give
a 10 cost of living increase every 4 july.

and anyone who does n't like it is obviously a country club

what is so supposed to signify \? i prefer the companionship of a

because if she heard

thankfully , you got the gender right. for i am not a deviant.

wow ! another clayton wannabe. typical response lack of logic.

define 'deviant' someone who deviates from the normal. ok , so far.
define 'normal' erm , umm. if you define yourself as normal then it is for
you to prove that you are (within limits , which then brings in the question ,
what are the limits \? for you we may have to broaden them to other 's intolerance
) ) 'normal'. difficult to prove. from what you have posted it must follow
that `normal` to you means someone without compassion and a sense of justice.
but it does look as if you went to the clayton school of logic , does n't it \?


how disparaging you are towards political minorities ,

sexual deviants do not comprise a political minorit y .

again an astounding lack of logic ! wow !

you must define what you say such that everyone agrees. here you have used
the phrase sexual deviant . how in the hell do you define that \? as someone
who does something sexually that you do n't \? by this definition you most
probably mean the majority of the planet. how do you know that your next
door neighbour does n't like custard to be spread over his genetalia then
have it licked off by his wife \? is this sexual deviancy \? how do we know
that you do n't like something sexually which others may find repulsive \? is
having sex doggy fashion a sexual deviancy \? please be more specific , and
where you do , back up your claims. or i may have to go to hospital due to
laughing too much at yours and clayton 's postings.

secondly , if we assume for the moment that the phrase 'sexual deviant' means
such people as homosexuals , bisexuals c. (basically everyone you do n't like) ,
i think that your phrase do not comprise a `political minorit y ` (why the
brackets \? ) is a non sequiteur. gay groups exist which lobby their governments.
that is a fact. prove it false. hence they are a politial group. you
state that they are not a political minority. are they therefore a
political majority \? i think you boobed really big on this one. try thinking
about your arguments.


and if she had any shred of self respect , she 'd be out the door.

i only associate with girls who do indeed have self respect. but were
i to find myself with the sort who would be inclined to head out the
door on account of my views regarding the aberrant behavior known as
homosexuality , i would encourage her to indeed do so , and i would
further advise her not to let the door whack her on the backside on
the way out. who needs such an airhead \?


prove the first statement please. dates , phone numbers , c.

again your logic fails. again you make statements which you cannot
(and most probably will not) maintain.

you state that a person (girl , in this context) who considers equal rights
for all humans to be an airhead \? as clayton (your best mate \? ) would say
it just shows how screwed up you are.

greater men than you have n't been able to do this. the above most
certainly will happen , no matter how much you may wish to pretend
otherwise.

proof please. proof that homosexuality is not part of the natural order.
proof that nature has always asserted itself. are you saying that nature
is a conciousness \? are you pretending that you have the ability to see the
future \? are you god(tm) \? in fact , by your arguement , are you waiting for
the black people to become slaves again \? because they were reviled as
sub human (nb not my view) at one time \? again your arguement falls
on its ass.



moreover , i'm not your sweetheart .

touchy touchy touchy !

right. i have shot holes in each and every one of your arguements. you are
most probably going to put me in your kill file because you have no answers
to my questions and challenges. since you cannot support your arguments it
merely goes to show that what you write is based upon your personal prejudices ,

primary parties should this knowledge not be able to help \?

a third party should be able to use persuasion to sway the transaction.
if , on the other hand , we condone the use of force or threat of violence
by the third party , then we are in trouble. a fourth party could say
that it knows better than parties 1 , 2 , and 3. and a fifth party... and
so on. who wins \? the one that can use the force or threat of force the
best. in other words might makes right. let 's abandon such
aggressive tactics and work from voluntary cooperation and respect from
others. that is what libertarians want.

that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close minded and that
his opinion should be ignored. clayton is stating that a group of at least
two million (1 ) american citizens are evil vicious malicious child molesters.

here 's a hypothetical question... if clayton said something like all
those niggers are really stupid. (please do n't be offended , i'm not racist

read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school , i

homosexual friend or acquaintance and you 'll sit there and support him.

god created a place for bigots. it 's called hell and clayton is going

if true , and if gays were the same as straights except
for sexual preference , i would imagine that gays would
have much less sex than straights because the available
pool for dates is less than one tenth what it is for
straights. somebody correct (flame) me please !


you miss the point. a lot more negotiation is needed to convince women
to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with
their sex. many of the women i know would do almost anything rather
than be known as a slag , slut or whore.

with men however there is status attached to being able to fuck
constantly. and with gay men , where both partners can prove status
through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation
where there is a lot of sex.

the difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity
and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the appetites of men.

straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned , gay men who
do not experience this bottle neck go to excess.

oops.

oops \? blue cross may well be the insurer for government workers in
massachusetts as it is for a number of state and local governments , i
do n't know. but blue cross is certainly not a government agency.
it is a private insurer.

yes it is a private insurer that has to deal with government
regulations concerning how it 's employees are to be covered processed , etc.
there are a mountain of forms that gov. employees have to go through.

sorry , but this is a red herring.

are you contending that the mountain of forms are processed by blue
cross \? having had blue cross insurance both as a government employee
and as an employee of a private corporation , i saw no difference between
the two sets of forms.

moreover , the administrative costs associated with medicare medicaid ,
the two primary forms of government insurance are considerably lower than
the average for private insurance companies. (5 versus 14 16 ).

if you have any evidence that blue cross bears a heavier burden in insuring
government employees than private employees , post it. otherwise , try
to stick to factual assertions.


and as the original post implied , it is private insurers in the us
whose administrative costs are significantly higher than the administrative
costs of tax supported health care systems in canada and elsewhere.

only those that remain paper bound and refuse to standardize.

well now , that 's an interesting defense of the free enterprise system.
are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents
private insurance companies from standardizing \?

in fact , it is true that some of the red tape burden stems from the
lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the us ,
but it 's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than
free enterprise at work.

by the way , barron 's , the bible of wall street , this week admitted that
administrative costs were significantly lower in canada because ....a
single payer system is always cheaper... . guess even the free enterprise
advocates are beginning to see the light.

try again.

why \? my hmo provides good service at a low cost. and i do n't have the
government telling my doctors what they can and can not say about medical
procedures.

sorry , but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care
reform with the bush administration 's gag order on federally funded family
planning clinics. there are no proposals that would control what your
doctor...can and cannot say about medical procedures.

of course it helps , but only if the decision to involve third parties

pointing out that they are corrupt and ignorant wo n't help , they either

it 's impossible (or at least beyond my abilities) to formulate a rule
that will always tell whether the involvement of a third party would be
good or bad , but there 's one that seems better than any other i 've ever
heard suggested voluntary good , mandatory bad. that is , a third
party should involve itself in a transaction only at the request of
the primary participants.

so we do n't formulate a rule that will always tell we try to use
knowledge about other properties of situations. to some of us , it
appears that trying always to apply voluntary good , mandatory bad
is not only less than optimal , it is in some circumstances seriously
damaging. the interesting question is to characterize those
circumstances as best we can.

look , somebody has to have the power to decide whether a third party
will regulate your transactions or not. that somebody is going to
be either you or the third party. you can argue until you are
blue in the face that regulators should n't get involved (in fact , people
have tried this) , they wo n't listen. the fundamental question you
have to ask is , whose decision is it whether or not to involve regulators ,
ours or theirs \? after you 've answered thed first question , you can
try to move on to such questions as should regulators be involved and , if
so , what regulations are appropriate \? although with your answer to
the first question , the second and third are taken out of your hands.

critisism is too easy. what solutions do people have that would have been
better than what the fbi had been doing for the last few months \?

firstly , they could have backed off. when you put a power freak , like
david koresh , in that kind of situation he is going to explode. (no pun
intended). koresh wanted to be a martyr and the government played right into
his hands.

if the government had n't given him the attention he wanted nothing
would have ever happened.

secondly , the davidians were expecting everything the government did.
they thought that they were facing the apocalypse , and that they were to perish
in fire. they were n't scared of the fbi. they are not the average hoods , they
are very devout followers of a religion. psyops did n't work and the government
got frustrated so they murdered them.

the batf should have left at the beginning , they should have looked at
koresh 's personality. instead they thought , they have guns. we have bigger
guns. let 's go get 'em !

they botched it from day one. they should n't have been there in the
first place.


the above conveniently ignores the murder of four batf agents by the
branch davidians in an unprovoked ambush.


the above statement ignores reality. the bd were provoked.



any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.


damn , phil. you must have seen a different tape of the initial raid than
i did. your `doorbell' happened to include lobbing percussion grenades and
attempting to storm the compound through the windows. i can honestly say
i have never seen a `doorbell' that works like that.




the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish. had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.


think , man. the batf are serving a warrant on someone who they feel might
have illegal automatic weapons. if they expected , as you state , that `the b d
to be anything other than peaceful citizens' they could have sent one , maybe
two agents up to the front door , knock , and attempt to serve the warrant on
the person answering the door. scenario one , that person lets them in to
perform the search and no one gets hurt. scenario two , the person answering
the door pulls a weapon aand kills both officers. now you have two dead batf
agents instead of four , the batf knows exactly where they stand with regards
to the bd and began to formulate a plan of action to arrest those responsible
without harm to the innocent people children within the compound.



the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.


no , the stupidity was the attempt to serve the warrant swat style.




if anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.


sure , do it within the law. the batf is there to uphold the law , not
circumvent it to fit their needs.....

motor voter stuff

my friend , after the election , brought up the point that it
would enable more people to vote , however , since it makes it easier to
get to the place of registration. he brought up the analogy that if
there were only one place to vote , say , in alaska would it be
excessive and wasteful to petition to have more places to vote \? this
is a similar idea a way to encourage more people to vote by making it
more easily accessible. i , not knowing where i stood , played devil 's
advocate and said well , would you have the taxpayer 's money go to
busing for those people that have trouble making it to dmv , then \?
where does the right to vote merge with the right to vote easily \?
where should we draw the lines \?

well , there does have to be a line. and to be honest , extending
voter registration to dmvs is hardly analogous to having only one
place for registration in alaska and opening a new one in atlanta. more is
not always better once you 've passed a certain point.

my friend said that that is obviously an extreme and that
actually the motor voter bill would save money because no longer would
the city have to pay someone to sit in the town hall and spend all
his her time filing those things they 'd just be at the push of a
button or the filling out of an x at dmv. so i (actually someone
else , but there 's no need to confuse this anymore) countered again
saying that would n't congress , as always , get exorbitent budgets and
fund committees to orchestrate and oversee the implementation.... the
argument went back and forth forever ranging from whether or not it 's
better to have more people voting , whether that is even relevant ,
etc....

just looking for some more opinions. anybody got 'em \? \? \?

i thought the motor voter bill passed.

in any case , my experiance with tennessee 's voter registration
system (which you can register with by mail , by the way) is that nobody
who is interested in voting is being denied access to registration.

do it in private , and it wo n't be a problem. but the reason that
the homosexual activists are so hot on antidiscrimination laws is
that they want

1. to be able to wear that lovely chiffon evening gown to work , and
not have people get disgusted

2. to be able to wear their nambla t shirt and not worry about
getting fired

3. to be able to have access to young boys , so that they start
making the next generation of homosexuals.

if your right to privacy is what makes sodomy laws unconstitutional
(a position that i agree with) , then keep it private , and there
wo n't be a problem.

any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

the batf , in a letter they 've been sending out to people ,
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise , and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces.

it strikes me as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door.

presumably the b d did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen
ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell.

let 's try that again why was the batf concerned about surprise
when they intended to serve the warrant by knocking on the door \? the
batf appears to be inconsistant in their own description of events.

and in any case , how does one mount an ambush if one is n't
on alert \?

had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

phill , the batf were in a firefight with the bd for forty five
minutes. i find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they would n't have shown up in live stock trailers and would
have retreated immediately.

not a smart move. unless meant to be part of the surprize cover. even so
the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea. a side opening
truck would have been much better , more like a covered waggon.

so , were the batf fired on before or after they left the trailers
to knock on the door to serve the warrant \? every description i 've
heard indicates the batf did not hang around in the trailers once
they decided to open them up.

for that matter , if they expect peaceful citizens , why come in live
stock trailers to being with \?

if they were expecting peacful citizens , why show up with over
a hundred officers , some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying
sub machineguns , and 3 national guard helicopters \?

sounds just about right to me. its the minimum amount of force that i
would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns
annual dinner.

ok , just to make sure we 've got this straight you consider
armed troops in disguised vehicles and multiple helicopters to be
used to serve search warrants on peaceful citizens. (and just so
we do n't have one of those entertaining shifts , you described them
as the batf expecting them to be , peaceful.)

michael hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including
members of the parachute regiment to remove approx 250 hippy peace
protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles. he
even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings. just about the
most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener. that single
action probably cost him the position as prime minister. one of the elders
of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of toryism.
hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke.

i do n't see how past abuses excuse present ones. hell , you 're

gee , jim , if you 'll check the constitution you 'll find in order to...

i'm surprised you missed it. it 's right there in the first paragraph. i
would have thought you would have made it at least through the preamble.

you almost got it right , and it was a good try , but you should follow your
own advice. the preamble to the constitution does read as you have quoted
but let us not forget that after all it is only the preamble. it is not
a binding part of the constitution and carries no weight in the law. that
poor tortured paragraph has got to be one of the most unfortunate passages
in the english language witness the legions of blowhards like yourself who
think those vague flowery phrases are part of the law of the land. do you
really believe that a politician only has to give lip service to promoting
the general welfare to be within the limits of the constitution \?

sorry , buddy , but some other blowhards managed to include the general
welfare in another portion of the constitution.

article i section 8 the congress shall have the power to lay and collect
taxes...to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general
welfare of the united states...

i guess they wanted to make sure everyone understood they meant what they
said in the preamble.

...but since it explicitly includes both the general welfare and defense
in article i , section 8 , i guess you 'll grant that botha are constitutional
functions. right \?

james madison , federalist paper 41

it has been urged and echoed , that the power ``to lay and
collect taxes , duties , imposts , and excises , to pay the debts ,
and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the
united states , '' amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise
every power which may be alleged to be necessary for the common
defense or general welfare...

no stronger proof could be given of the distress under which
these writers labor for objections , than their stooping to such a
misconstruction. had no other enumeration or definition of the
powers of the congress been found in the constitution , than the
general expressions just cited , the authors of the objection
might have had some color for it ... but what color can the
objection have , when a specification of the objects alluded to by
these general terms immediately follows , and is not even
separated by a longer pause than a semicolon \? ... nothing is
more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase , and
then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars.

in this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down

other terrorists and hostage takers.

not an accurate analogy. david koresh did not take a bunch of
hostages and then call the batf with a ransom note. you make

okay claytoon , let us say that hypothetically i agree with you that
gay men are much more promiscuous than straight men. why does
this indicate they are screwed up people \?

btw it occurs to me that since , in my experience , men are much more
interested in sex than women and want to have sex much earlier
in a relationship than women do , that homosexuals would have
sex more often simply becuase their partner is of a like mind.
i.e. heterosexual men would be more promiscuous if they could.

it 's my observation that women are more likely to me more strongly
indoctronated into now wanting sex that are men.
also there are definite double standards for men and women who are
promiscuous.

could there also be a factor of communication being more direct in

do n't forget that 25 had 20 or more partners....

not surprising. remember , that study includes homosexuals as well.


hmm... tell me , did you go to the mickey mouse school of logic \? you have
just stated that there are not many homosexuals as kinsey reported in his
survey (and the surveys of the kinsey institute since). then you say that
the reason many young people are promiscuous is because homosexuals form
a large part of that group , or there are some homosexuals whose lives
consist of having sex , with no gaps for eating c. using your logic
it would seem to suggest that on average gay men have about 2000 partners each
a week ! try to think through your arguments carefully. or then again , not ,
because i like to laugh every now and then.

compared to the table i have already posted from masters , johnson ,
and kolodny showing male homosexual partners , it is apparent that
homosexual men are dramatically more promiscuous than the general
male population.

and what did this study show for number of sexual contacts for those
who said they where homosexual \? or is that number to inconvient for

it was n't published.


hence the argument cannot be resolved using this data. next point , please.

that probably is not true. but today it may not be much better for

you mean , ignore study after study , so that we can continue to
accept a study (kinsey 's) that is obviously wrong \?


where are all of these studies \? you have cited a few , and my research
shows that there are not that many. do not confuse a survey as a
study , there is a big difference. asking people outside of a polling
booth and adding up numbers is not a study.

as easily of been gay i suppose. one of the big debates about
homosexuality is whether or not it 's a type of behavior that is
learned or if one is just born that way. imho , the more likely
explanation is that it 's some combination of the two.

based on what , besides your own warm fuzzy feelings \?

but this is what you base most of your conclusion upon. warm
fuzzy feelings.

maybe he has stated an educated opinion based upon the studies
that involve genetics and psychological influence. there are a
lot of those types of studies , are n't there \? try reading some.

here 's something to ponder upon have any of you gay bashers out
there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual
orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an
intrinsic and natural part of their life as heterosexuals do
about their own sexuality \? in other words , someone who is truly

alcoholics share that feeling , until they hit bottom.

this is a crap statement and comparison. many people use this sad
and stupid argument. there is not relationship between alcoholics
and people 's sexual orientation except that some may find what it
really is when they are drunk (repressed inhibition released).

unless , of course , the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder , caused by childhood sexual abuse , as a number of
recent works suggest.

nonsense this simply is not true. i suppose it is a waste of time
to try and tell you to understand what a study presents. most of
what you cite does not extrapolate anything , you do.


if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children

if people in general would stop using irrational position to oppress
other 's and leave our private lives to ourselves , i would have no
support for laws and rules to protect people form this. but we need
only look at post such as yours to see that they lack rational
thought and intelligent outlooks.

alone , i would n't care in the least what they did in private. but
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of
government is to tell peaceful people how to live , i have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an alternative
lifestyle , but a sickness.


remember that peaceful people are not necessarily doing the right
thing. peaceful , tolerant , enlightened , educated , rational thinking

as far as set the moral tone is concerned , if a community does not
collectively want to put up with prostitution going on in front of their
kids , why should they have to \? if a community does not want to see
proliferation of drugs among their kids , why should they have to \?

by what right \? and do tell , from the standpoint of the drug
dealer or prostitute , what is the difference if the gun is pointed
by the local hick city council or the feds \?
if something is wrong , it is wrong. period. if it is not
sustainable at a federal level why should it be ok just because
the geographical unit is smaller \?


peter nelson posted a very eloquent response to this point in
talk.politics.misc , so i need not consume more bandwidth here.



the problem with the egalitarian view is that it tries to deny the
fundamental dilemma of democratic government the people have a right
to exercise a voice in their community , yet individuals have the right
to be left to themselves. this is a serious dilemma precisely because
there is not much that takes place in a vacuum.

you are seriously misusing the word egalitarian. you should
look the word up before you use it. there is a vast difference
between equal justice under the law and egalitarianism.

what i meant , if it was not clear , was the intersection set of liberal
and libertarian philosophies of natural rights and how the government
(and constitutional interpretation in particular) fits into that
philosophy. this philosophy engages in the very serious practical
error of endowing the nine lawyers on the supreme court with an almost
totalitarian authority , completely outside of the consent or consensus
of the people. this is why supreme court nominations are such amazing
political fist fights these days , because he who controls the court
rules the country. the people on the court may well be trying to do
the best job they can , but they are at best a benevolent oligarch , even
if you approve of every supreme court decision ever. eventually , an
oligarch will arise that will decimate that which you hold dear. try
supreme court cases by jury , and the problem would be mitigated a great
deal.

those who would create broad , non enumerated government powers at any
level (as in european parlamentary democracies and the current de facto
standard in the u.s.) have essentially engaged in the same fundamental
mistake , except that it is some different body that has the totalitarian ,
virtually unchecked (except by plurality election , death , or retirement) ,
government power.


and why should your community be allowed to stop my activities
when i'm not picking your pocket or defrauding you \? just because
you do n't like it \? because you find it morally repugnant \?

this is like asking why the wind blows , unless you can prove that
the fact of your engaging in certain activities has absolutely no
effect whatsoever on any other human being who has not consented to
your engagement in those activities. very few human activities indeed
fit into this category.

even for those few that do , who would you empower to make the judgement
of what is and is not a fully autonomous activity \? who defines picking
my pocket and defrauding \? are economic assets a person 's only assets ,
or are peace of mind , stability , confidence in a child 's emotional
environment , security , and many other things not also a part of a person 's
assets \? what gives you the right to create a moral environment that a
parent strongly objects to \? what gives you the right to create an
environment of social unrest and instability \? if you say that what you
do does not have those effects , by what authority do you say that \? who
is empowered to make these value judgements \?


how
would you feel if i got a gang together and found xtianity
(or insert your favorite cause here) morally repugnant and
passed laws to outlaw its free exercise \? (all at a local
level , since that seems to be a ok with you)


if the federal constitution explicitly prohibited you from doing so , the
federal government would prevent you from doing so. if it did not , and
you could muster enough local support to pass an amendment to the local
constitution (by , say , a 3 4 majority) empowering the local government
to do so , then i would have to vote with my feet and move to a neighborhood
more friendly to my own system of values. this is not an ideal situation ,
but it is far better than the mess we are mired in right now.


as to the gang of pitchfork and torch wielding friends , there are very
few restrictive local laws that i personally would advocate or vote for ,
since i am of the view that exercising government power over your neighbors
should be done with extreme care and only when absolutely necessary. but
i do believe in protecting children from victimization by people who have
callous disregard for the effects they have on others. i would certainly
leave a well behaved massage parlor alone , so long as it had no
detrimental effects on the neighborhood.

you just do n't get it. the debate is not whether you or a
communitity would or would not vote away my rights it is
the propriety of whether that should even be an option .

when you define rights very broadly , there is no practical choice about
whether people will or will not infringe upon your rights since these
rights overlap. even when rights are defined very narrowly , the government
has been empowered to prevent others from infringing on your rights. the
fundamental question is , by whose authority is that power created. if you
support the current situation with a natural rights supreme court (rather
than an original understanding supreme court or , even better , supreme
court by jury) , you are consenting to having nine lawyers in washington ,
d.c. create those powers out of the air. in my fractal federalism scenario ,
it is a broad consensus of the people (i.e. the amendment process) that
creates those powers.


certainly not the only cause , mike , but people in a local neighborhood
should have a voice in what goes on in that neighborhood. to deny this
is to create another concentrated centralized power to keep the locality
from abusing its power

! ! ! you mean that horrific centralized power , the individual \?

no , i mean the federal government that comes trucking in with guns to
tell the locals how to run their neighborhood. waco , tx is a nice example.



in essence , using a pit bull to keep a toy poodle
from biting your leg. chances are , the pit bull is going to turn on you
some day , and you have much less defense against it than you do against
the toy poodle. ideally , everyone would leave everyone else alone and
no government coercive power of any kind would be necessary. this will
never work , because people are different and by their nature they will
always want to force their views on others. if this were not the case ,
nobody would try to force their view that murder is wrong on anyone else.

fine. when they force their views on others prosecute them.
until then leave them alone. this is such a simple concept.
how do you feel about speech codes \? hate speech certainly
could be considered an indication that the pit bull is
going to turn some day . should the community be allowed
to limit it too \? if not , why not \?

if you create a community where public masturbation is permitted in the
cause of personal autonomy , have you done anything different \? what
precisely are these autonomous activities you are referring to \? if you
list them , perhaps we can get enough people to agree that they are truly
autonomous and pass a constitutional amendment protecting them.



and how do you feel about david koresh \? did he deserve
it \? should the batf (or a local version of same) be allowed
to toss him in jail just because they think he 's off
his rocker \?

the koresh incident appears to be a horrendous abuse of government power ,
power possibly illegitimately obtained through a means i would abolish.
the constitutionality of no knock warrants seems very dubious to me , not
to mention the mere existence of batf and the government 's propensity to
ignore the word infringe in the second amendment. this power is upheld
by the same body , with its incredible concentration of power in the hands
of nine people , that has upheld much so called civil rights (read affirmative
action) legislation despite the fourteenth amendment.



who said anything about the public till \? get rid of it , and
get out of my face.


i agree about getting rid of the public till. are you still sure you do n't
want to come over for coffee \? you might not especially like my neighborhood ,
and i might not especially like yours , but at least we can agree to let each
other live the kind of life we want to.

at the point you get rid of the public till , you lose all
credibility as to why you should have a say about my private
affairs. are you sure you are ready for that \?


money is certainly not the only asset i have in this world. if it were ,
this would be a bleak existence indeed.

i want to know that i have a competent doctor when i am ill. government
regulations have driven up costs and decreased quality by providing a
monopoly for licensed m.d.s. many procedures could be performed by
qualified nurses but doctors are forced to do them. the common cold
must be diagnosed by a licensed doctor who is the only one who is
allowed to write a perscription. doctor 's are spending much of their
time on such mundane cases that they cannot have the time to spend on
the really tough cases. this results in higher cost , lower quality
medical care.

here in georgia , the state legislature in 1992 accidentally passed a law
lobbied for by opthamologists prohibiting anyone but a licensed md from
giving shots. they were trying to limit optometrists from competing with
them.
they inadvertantly forbade nurses , emts , dentists , and tattoo artists
from piercing the skin. (probably diabetics too). the secretary of state 's
office announced on june 30th that they would n't enforce it pending
reconsideration in the 1003 legislature. in the hassle over the state flag
i heard nothing about repealing it.

yes we 've heard that the survivors are now saying that. we 've also
seen the videotape which shows that the fire started in two or
three different places which were n't near the tank.

i have not seen the tape on cnn. which network did you see it on \?

tim i saw the film on cnn as it happend. it was clear from that
tim tape that the fire started in one location. right where the
tim tank was attacking , and then had pulled back. there were not
tim several spots where the fire started , it started in one
tim location and was spread in the direction of the heavy wind.
tim the fbi claims to have seen or filmed several starting
tim points. yet they keep this hidden. they have spread so much
tim lies. well i guess if i was responsible for the mass murder
tim of 80 people who were exercising constitutional rights , i
tim would lie about it too...

gosh , tim , you must have seen a different live broadcast than i did. while
the smoke did emerge from one place initially , it was a considerable
distance from the tank , and in a very short time , fire appeared at several
places a good distance apart from there.

then there 's that nagging question about why , out of all those people ,
only a few made any attempts to escape or save the children. if it were
me , with my child , and i was n't committing suicide , i believe i would have
made some attempt to at least save the child. as it was , at least one of
the survivors was attempting to go back into the fire when they were
physically removed. no one lifted a finger to bring out a child , apparently.

how do you explain that \? and the two survivors who claimed to have doused
the place with lantern oil and set the fire (no doubt on david 's orders).
at least until the lawyers talked to them.

tim and also , why have they not yet released the search warrant \? \? \? \?

that is a good question. maybe because it would be a further
embarrassment , seeing as how the atf went in there in dirty harry mode
initially.

as stupidly as it all was handled , i find it difficult to believe that the
entire fbi has completely gone corrupt under a new administration less
than 100 days old. stupidity and bad decisions and plans have always been
with us. they just had an alignment at waco.

press briefing
by dee dee myers


the briefing room


10 35 a.m. edt


ms. myers at 1 00 p.m. , we 're having a press
conference , bill , in the east room. and then saturday the president
will leave here at roughly 8 00 a.m. and fly down to jamestown. he
will spend the day there , overnight at camp david.

on sunday , it 's unclear exactly what time he 'll leave
camp david and fly to boston. he 'll leave from hagerstown. the press
plane will leave from washington.

he will meet with some

q what kind of a plane is that he 's taking \?

ms. myers that he 's taking \? he 'll probably take a c
20.

q from hagerstown \?

ms. myers from hagerstown. air force one does n't fly
out of hagerstown , apparently.

q how will the pool travel \?

ms. myers the pool will have to meet him ahead of
time. so i guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait
for him at the airport. there is currently no provision and i 'll
double check , because there 's currently no provision i think
that 's standard operating practice.

q the pool is not going to meet him and watch him get
on the plane at hagerstown \?

ms. myers i do n't believe so.

q what time does he have to be in boston \?

ms. myers he 's going to meet there with a group of
citizens , mostly people who supported us during the campaign , at
around 1 30 p.m. we 're still working out the final times.

q at the airport \?

ms. myers no , it will be at the boston harbor hotel.
and then he will also meet with some a youth group
that authored something called project 21. the speech to the
publishers is actually at 3 15 p.m. it will be followed by q a. and
then after the speech and q a , he 'll attend a reception with the
publishers , and then return to washington from boston. and that 's it
for the weekend.

q has the president seen the report from or the
letter , communication from the foreign service officers also ,
obviously , the communication from madeleine albright \? and what is
his reaction to their call on him \?

ms. myers well , obviously , the letter was written to
secretary christopher. i believe secretary christopher received the
letter on saturday. he reviewed it and met with the authors on
monday to discuss their views. he believes it 's an important part of
the policy making process and is taking their views into account as
we go forward in the development of the bosnia policy.

q what is the president 's reaction \?

ms. myers the president has n't seen the letter. it
was something that was directed towards secretary christopher. in
terms of he has n't seen specifically the letter , but in terms of
their concerns generally , what the president has said is that there
are a lot of options on the table now , including ones that were n't
there before. and i think he 's , as is everybody , gravely concerned
about the situation in bosnia.

q is he influenced by that \? i mean , how does he feel
about the fact that all of the specialists in that area those desk
officers

ms. myers many of the specialists in that area i
think that that is clearly part of the process. it 's something
their views will clearly be considered. i think secretary
christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views. i
think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that
those opinions ought to be considered , particularly from people who
work closely on the issues.

q what do you mean , there are options on the table
that were n't there before \?

ms. myers i think the president said last week that
there were options , such as lifting the arms embargo to the bosnian
muslims , that had been previously off the table that are now being
considered.

q dee dee , in terms of those options , madeleine
albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action
by the u.s. if the europeans did not go along. is that on the table \?

ms. myers well , i ca n't discuss anything that would
any conversations that would have happened between ambassador
albright and the president. but i think the president has said he
would certainly is working with our european allies. he 's had a
number of conversations with european leaders and is trying to build
some consensus there.

q will he reach a decision will he have anything
specific to say today \?

ms. myers no. i mean , in term of there will be no new
announcement of policy today.

q does your statement mean he has ruled out
unilateral action \?

ms. myers he 's continuing to consult with our allies
at this point. he has said i think he 's been fairly clear about
it , that the he believes that the u.s. needs to act in concert with
its allies on this.

q on that point , does he believe that the u.s. ,
though , does have built in authority from the united nations already
to take unilateral action \?

ms. myers well , i think the u.n. resolution 770 makes
it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian
relief effort. i think the broader point is that anything we do , any
options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is
consistent with u.n. authority , and if it 's not , we 'll work with our
allies to make sure that we get it.

q dee dee , then how does the white house someone as
distinguished as elie wiesel , who says that not enough is being done
to stop the atrocities going on in bosnia \?

ms. myers i think that that 's why we 're considering
additional options. i think that mr. wiesel 's comments yesterday
were quite compelling. the situation in bosnia is tragic. the
president is very concerned about it. he has i think president
clinton has worked very hard to take further actions to continue to
isolate serbia in the world community. clearly , we 're considering
other options because the president is concerned that perhaps it 's
not enough.

q in terms of what you were just talking about , it
sounds like resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the u.s. to
protect humanitarian

ms. myers i do n't think it i would n't use the word
justify. it permits unilateral action by any country in protecting
the delivery of humanitarian relief. but i think that 's just an
explanation of the resolution. i think any action that we take will
be consistent with u.n. resolutions or we 'll work with our allies to
make sure that it is permissible or we 'll get further action.

q the president and other officials have ruled out
unilateral u.s. action in bosnia in the past. you 're declining to do
that this morning.

ms. myers no , i said the president has said repeatedly
that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.

q that does n't mean that he wo n't act alone , which
has been said before explicitly.

ms. myers i do n't mean to imply a change in policy.
the president has said all along that he wants to act in concert with
our allies on this.

q one other little question. did he know about this
letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers \?

ms. myers i do n't believe so. secretary christopher
they may have had a private conversation about it. the president
has not seen it.

q they met on monday , right \? christopher met
surely , he must have brought that up

ms. myers again , they may have talked privately about
it , but

q dee dee , what you 're saying is that the albright
recommendation has been rejected , is that correct \?

ms. myers no , i did n't say that at all. i said i
wo n't i said i would n't comment on any conversations or
communications.

q she 's advocating unilateral action and you 're
saying , in effect , that we will not take unilateral action.

ms. myers i am not confirming anything that madeleine
albright may or may not have recommended.

q given the sometimes delicate , complicated and
frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue ,
does the president find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service
officers of the state department helpful to that process , hurtful to
that \?

ms. myers i think that their views are obviously being
considered. the secretary received that memo on saturday and two
days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing
of their views , of the basis for their views , to discuss in greater
detail the options that they had presented in the letter.

q does n't it put some kind of pressure on
additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to
act regardless of what the allies may or may not do \?

ms. myers i think clearly there 's a broad policy
review underway now. and the president and his advisors are
considering a number of options , including some of those outlined in
the letter from the folks over at the state department. now , no
decisions have been made on that yet , but i think that there is a
through review underway , and that their opinions are being very
seriously considered.

q if i can just follow up , i guess what i'm looking
for is what was his reaction to this letter \? did he say , good , this
bolsters my position \? or did he say , damn , this is just what i do n't
need right now \?

ms. myers i think he said this helps contribute
substantively to the debate. it 's important that all views be
considered and aired thoroughly , that before he makes a decision he
wants to have the best possible advice and information possible , and
this , i think in many ways , furthers that goal.

q so internal advice to a cabinet official or the
president it 's all open now , and you would n't take any umbrage or
say that they were out of line \?

ms. myers i think that the fact that secretary
christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they
had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is
conclusive evidence that their views are welcome.

q does the policy review include what madeleine
albright has suggested , and what joe biden and others have suggested ,
which is that the previous u.n. resolutions authorize unilateral
action military action for the delivery of humanitarian

ms. myers i think all options are on the table.

q the unilateral option is on the table \?

ms. myers i think all options are on the table.

q we 've had two different

q is n't that a change , dee dee \?

q that would be a change of policy.

q particularly if it includes ground troops , which
has been specifically ruled out.

ms. myers i think the president has been well , no.
i do n't that is not

q are you talking about all options \?

ms. myers all options i think the president has
been fairly clear about that. so let me just review again what he
has said. he has said that the president has said all options are
on the table , with the exception of the introduction of ground
troops , which he has never suggested. he has ruled that out from the
beginning.

q has n't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort \?

ms. myers he has said that he does n't believe the u.s.
can solve the problems in the former yugoslavia by itself. i think
that there are a number of very complicated options on the table
right now. i do n't think that again , i do n't want to comment on
specific options that are being considered other than in the broad
categories that we 've already said things like lifting the arms
embargo against the bosnian muslims , things that i think we 've talked
about in broad terms. this is a very complicated situation. the
options being presented and considered are very complicated.

q air strikes on the table \?

ms. myers again , i think that 's been fairly clearly
pointed out that that 's something that 's being discussed.

q dee dee , are ground troops on the

ms. myers no , ground troops are not being considered.

q you said there was not going to be you said you
were not announcing a change of policy. then you said everything is
on the table. we 're confused. are unilateral actions on the table \?

ms. myers all i can tell you is what the president has
said that he does n't believe that he wants to act in concert
with the allies on this.

q wants to , but he 's willing to i mean , if they
do n't go along

ms. myers he 's continuing to consult with our allies
on this. he 's continuing to have discussions. he 's continuing to
press them for further action. and i think that 's clear. the
conversation is ongoing. we 're going to continue to work with them
to find the best possible solution and next step on this.

q dee dee , the allies have taken the position that to
conduct any kind of air strikes in bosnia would have the opposite
effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid that they feel
that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid
would become vulnerable and the bosnians

ms. myers i'm not sure that 's the consistent i
mean , i'm not sure who you 're referring to.

q the british and the french.

q yes , the british and french. they 've taken the
position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized
by any kind of air strikes against the bosnian military. does the
u.s. believe differently from that \?

ms. myers the president has had conversations with
both mitterrand and major , as you know. i think that there is a
thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well. and i
do n't want to comment on the nature of the president 's discussions
other than to say that he 's continuing to consult with our allies as
we move forward and he 's continuing to press them for further action.
and i think that process is ongoing.

q the other day voted against any military
intervention yesterday. does the president regard that as the end of
the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of
unilateral action \? the allies have been very , very plain that they
do not want to do anything.

ms. myers the consultations are ongoing. that 's all i
can tell you at this point.

q are you saying that there wo n't be any announcement
on bosnia today in the press conference \?

ms. myers no , that is not the intention of the press
conference.

q what is the intention \?

ms. myers it 's an opportunity to take questions. he
may have a brief i'm sure he 'll have a brief opening statement ,
but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on bosnia. that
will not happen.

q can you tell us what the subject of the opening
statement is \?

ms. myers it 's sort of a general statement of where we
are.

q after the first hundred days , you mean \?

ms. myers it 's not a long statement. i mean , this is
just generally. do n't look for any major policy pronouncements.

q do you know what the opening statement is \?

ms. myers but it 's perhaps later today i 'll be able
to tell you with more certainty i think that 's still under review.
but the overriding purpose of this it 's not a mystery it 's not
meant to be. it 's just to take questions.

q it would be helpful to know whether what the
opening statement is on.

ms. myers since the major purpose here is just to take
questions , it 's not completely resolved yet.

q dee dee , one policy that was expected last week and
that the white house , you and george seemed to indicate we might get ,
would be an aids czar. will he announce that today \? and what 's the
delay on that \?

ms. myers i do n't think we meant to imply i think
we said it would happen soon. i do n't think we meant to imply with
any certainty that it would be this week. it is coming soon. i
do n't anticipate that happening today.

q what 's the delay \? is n't this the perfect time to
announce an aids czar \?

ms. myers i do n't know that it 's a delay. i think the
process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through
the necessary background checks , and to make sure that we 've crossed
the t 's and dotted the i 's before we make an announcement.

q dee dee , what are zoe baird 's qualifications for
the foreign intelligence advisory board \? and why was n't her
appointment announced here \?

ms. myers the qualifications i do n't know if
there 's a specific list i 'll have to check and see. i think there
are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.
many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government
service. i think there 's a broad variety of views across political
spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there. we never
made a formal announcement other than the chairman of the board ,
which is admiral william crowe.

q why would he appoint her , though , if the american
people and many in the senate rejected her for another government
job \?

ms. myers i do n't believe that the american people
ever had voted on her. and i certainly she was never rejected
in the senate. she never went up there for a hearing. but the
president believes she 's a very competent person. he 's said that
zoe baird do you understand what the question is \? zoe baird is on
the president 's foreign intelligence

q you said she never went up there for a hearing \?

q her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage
over violating federal laws \?

ms. myers right , she never she was never but you
said she was rejected by the senate. i was just simply trying to
point out that she was never voted on by the senate.

q so you do n't think that is any problem \?

ms. myers i do n't think there 's any problem.

q she has been appointed to this board , is that a
fact \?

ms. myers yes.

q does she need confirmation for this \? does she need
confirmation to be a member of the

ms. myers no. it 's a presidential appointment.

q usually , announcements are made here at the white
house. was there a decision not to announce her publicly \?

ms. myers we did n't make an announcement. people who
asked were told who the members of the board were. we did n't make
an official announcement. if anybody 's interested in that we can
certainly put out the list of names.

q i 'd like to know.

q do n't such board members do n't you normally as a
matter of routinely put out releases on all these boards and
presidential appointment regardless of their dimension \?

ms. myers not always. but , again , i'm happy to put
this out.

q is n't that the standard practice \?

q that was past practice.

ms. myers again , i'm happy to put it out. we 'll put
out a list of the members of the board today.

q dee dee , i do n't want to try to fail to let you get
out of this swamp but (laughter) all i really want to know is
has n't it been the practice in this administration for such
announcements to be made routinely \?

ms. myers i think generally but not always. and we 're
happy to put that out today.

q what is the board , what is her title , what is the
size of the board \?

ms. myers there is roughly a dozen members on the
board. it is a civilian board , although their are some , obviously ,
retired military personnel on the board that provide input into
intelligence policy for the president. again , the chairman of that
board is admiral william crowe.

q and did he recommend baird \?

q what 's the name of the board \?

ms. myers it 's the president 's foreign intelligence
advisory board , pfiab.

q what 's her qualification that she had employed
an illegal alien \? is that (laughter)

ms. myers do you want an answer to the question or you
just want to make a joke \?

q let me phrase it another way. why should n't this
appointment be viewed as a pay back for the difficulty she had a
couple of months ago \?

ms. myers because it 's not.

q what 's her experience in foreign intelligence \?

ms. myers she 's an experienced attorney , someone who
the president believes is very competent and qualified. and i think
part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input. not
everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert that
is not the board 's mission. it is to provide civilian input for the
president as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters. he
believes she 's very qualified , very competent person , enormously
talented and has said that throughout.

q is this just a figment of my overactive
imagination , or was there discussion early on about abolishing the
president 's foreign intelligence advisory board \?

ms. myers i do n't think so. on december 24th , when he
announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he
would had appointed admiral crowe as the head of the board. so i
do n't believe there 's ever been any

q earlier than that , during the transition.

ms. myers no , i do n't believe so. it was announced ,
again , on december 24th. admiral crowe could n't be there , but it was
announced.

q are members paid \?

ms. myers i do n't believe so , but i 'll double check.

q on another subject , on waco , how do you explain the
discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the
bodies that are coming out of waco and the state \? i guess it 's the
texas ranger reports.

ms. myers most of the information is coming the
federal information is coming from the site. clearly , there 's been
some discrepancies and the justice department is looking into it.
officials in the justice department were told , i believe the day
before yesterday , that there were several bodies found with bullet
holes. i think there 's some discrepancy about that , and the justice
department is looking into it.

q is the president going to get involved in trying to
sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down
there , with some people withdrawing , others saying they 're in charge ,
but others justice , fbi , texas rangers all grabbing a piece of
this \?

ms. myers i do n't know that he 's going to try to
mediate the dispute. i mean , i 'll let you know if there 's anything
he intends to do about it. but as you know , there are several levels
of investigation ongoing , and we 're hopeful that they can work
together.

q is there any one agency or official down there in
charge of everything \?

ms. myers i do n't know. i 'll have to get back to you
on that.

q what is the subject matter of sunday 's speech \?

ms. myers it 's going to be fairly general. i do n't
think it 's going to be any specific announcements. i think it 's
going to be sort of a

q does he have a topic that he 's going to talk about \?

ms. myers we 're still working on it. but i would n't
look for any announcements of , like , the drug czar or something like
that.

q is it sort of a 100 days speech , sort of my
excellent adventure for 100 days \? (laughter.)

ms. myers not exactly , but i think he 'll take a little
bit broader look about what 's happened in the last

q foreign , domestic \?

ms. myers a little bit of both , but i think a lot of
domestic.

q and overview.

ms. myers yes , more of an overview than a specific
policy announcement.

q has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which
the president will address the gay rights march on sunday \?

ms. myers it will be a letter read to the crowd by
congresswoman nancy pelosi.

q is that available \?

ms. myers not yet , but it will be. sure.

q are you going to put it out here or

ms. myers we 'll probably put it out here on sunday.

q travel next week \?

ms. myers unclear.

q what was the question \?

q likely \?

ms. myers i do n't

q likely \? possible \?

ms. myers possible.

q what 's possible \?

ms. myers travel.

q george mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform
and national service legislative proposals next week. do you have
days yet for them \?

ms. myers not yet.

q can you tell us which order \?

ms. myers campaign finance reform first national
service later in the week.

q is there any coverage tomorrow in williamsburg \?

ms. myers no.

q and any report in the aftermath of the day \?

ms. myers any readout from the day \?

q readout.

ms. myers it 's possible. jeff eller will be down
there. i think he can go through what the president did during the
day. we do n't expect any photo op or anything , other than departure
here in the morning.

q dee dee , the president has not made a regular
practice , as some of his predecessors have , of going to camp david.
in fact , he 's been there what once or twice \?

ms. myers twice.

q why this weekend \?

ms. myers he went two weekends ago , as you know , on
the way home from his father in law 's funeral. i think that they
found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend
some time together as a family. and this is just an opportunity to
do the same.

q there 's no march there.

q it has nothing to do with the march here \?

ms. myers no.

q since he 's going to be in town sunday morning now
instead of in jamestown , have you thought about him making a quick
pass by , fly over (laughter)

ms. myers he 'll fly straight to boston.

q flying straight did you say \? (laughter.)

q george took a question yesterday on waco. the
president had said on tuesday in the rose garden that there was a
minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the
fbi. and the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and
whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas. do
you have an answer on that \?

ms. myers i do n't. i 'll check.

the press thank you.

pointing to canada 's vaunted socialized medical care program , he
contends that it is failing even while the cost is catching up with
angry taxpayers. he notes americans do n't go to canada and
elsewhere for medical care it 's the canadians and others who come
here. why should the united states duplicate what does n't work well
in other countries \? we have the world 's best medical care let 's not
mess it up with hillary clinton 's plans for socialized medicine.


john f. mcmanus , national president of the john birch society



when mcmanus says , we have the world 's best medical care , i can hardly
believe he 's referring to a system

1. that costs us 14 percent of our gdp , while there is n't a
single other country in the industrialized world that spends more than
10 percent.

2. that leaves 37 million of us with no coverage , even though all
the other systems in the industrialized world cover virtually everyone.

3. yet , americans rank near the bottom of the list in terms of life
expectancy , childhood immunization rate , infant mortality , and many
preventable diseases.

4. we pay , on average , about 1000 each for mris. (to put that in
perspective , they cost 177 in japan.)

5. the average us company spends over 2500 dollars a year per employee on
health benefits. seven hundred to 1500 is the range just about everywhere
else.


how can anyone say that such a system is the best in the world \? the only
thing the usa health care system is good at is showering well insured patients
with a champagne treatment of care and outrageously overcharging for it. and
the private system of insurers and paperwork is so bloated and inefficient
that it itself sucks up over 100 billion dollars a year in money from every
other sector of society individuals , government , and industry.

of the 800 billion dollars americans threw into the bottomless pit of health
care costs last year , the consumer 's union estimated that at least 200 billion
was thrown away on overpriced , useless , and even downright harmful tests and
procedures , and the most bureaucratic , regulated insurance system in the world.

there are more than 1200 different private insurers in the usa. but did the
private competition stimulate more efficient paperwork \? ask any doctor
who 's had to hire a full time clerk to deal with it all !

the competition among hospitals is driving costs up , not down. the
competition among hospitals for both doctors and patients has encouraged the
hospitals to traffic in expensive superfluous equipment. spending millions on
expensive machines of dubious value that spend 80 percent of the day idle
is n't my idea of the world 's best health care system.

competition among specialists is driving them to perform dangerous and
expensive procedures where they are very marginally helpful. i'm especially
thinking of heart surgery and some women 's surgeries like hysterectomy and
cesarean section. sound like the world 's best health care system \?



ever notice how , every time someone tries to bring about some real change in
health care , the libbies start bashing canada 's system \? first of all , hillary
clinton is not advocating another canadian system. i think that 's been made
abundantly clear in the news for the last couple of months. where did john f.
mcmanus get that idea , anyway \?

let 's say you 're a canadian living in a small town near the usa border. your
child needs a complicated procedure only available in city hospitals. the
nearest canadian cities are 6 hours west and 20 hours east , and there 's an
american city one hour south. which way are you going to go \? is it because
the american system is the best in the world , or just for convenience \?

it still amazes me that people ca n't seem to see more than just black and
white on health care reform. there are a million different ways we ould
restructure the system. it 's not just a choice between total government
control and total private control. i wish the people screaming socialized
medicine every time soemone wants to change the current syste would inform
themselves on health care issues.



the current system sucks. i want to keep providers private but that does n't
change the fact that we will never be able to deal with the deficit if we
do n't reform the health care system. purely private health care without any
government intervention does n't work. hillary clinton is not thinking of
nationalizing providers or evern insurers. how can you scream socialized
medicine at her programs \? do n't you even know what you 're talking about \?



ever see clinton 's graphs of projected deficit versus year for the rest of the
decade \? notice how the line falls , then starts increasing \? why \? i 'll give
you one wild guess as to which component of spending will overwhelm us if we
do n't do something about it.



peope just doesn't get it. the current health care system is a cancer which is
killing our economic well being. costs are still rising 10 percent a year
even as americans by the tens of millions go without , or are forced into
managed care programs , which are certainly pretty socialized already if you
ask me.

a couple of months ago i posted a message asking any hillary bashers to please
come forward and present (no gimmicks , straight talk) just how they would set
about keeping costs down. i did n't get a single answer.

the only thing i keep hearing from libbie organizations are press releases
filled with evasive platitudes like give health care back to the people.
just do you expect to do that without serious reforms \? what is it about the
current system that you would change and how would that help \?


how can anyone read the news , live under our system , and not see these faults \?
how can we deal with the deficit , our cities , our educational system , our
infrastrucure , aids , modernizing our industry , etc. if we do n't quit throwing
away money which could be used to solve those problems \?


america needs health care reform now. do n't just sit there and hillary bash ,
inform yourself !

any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

of course they did , otherwise they would n't have staged the
raid in the first place.

the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish. had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.


if anyone on the net cares to suggest a sure fire method of bringing
the murderes of four police officers to justice perhaps we could
hear it.

napalming seems a bit redundant.

the stupidity was in the batf mindset 'we 're from washington
we know better execute plan a storm the compound in a no knock

the main problem with trying to get the military involved in police work
is the differences in the missions.

the police take names , try and find out what happened ,
stop suspects (thats the meaning of 'arrest') and
turn them over to the custody of the judicial branch
for the adjudication of their case.

the military 's mission is to kill the enemy before

well , they never should have gotten into this situation.

look at the history of this group. david koresh has been arrested
\? twice \? by local police. both times , he accepted the arrest warrant
and went peacefully. so , the feds decide to arrest him. how do they
choose to arrest a person with a record of peaceful obedience under
arrest \? they throw a concussion grenades at his building.

in addition , we know that we 've been lied to. initially , we were told
that they suspected him of molesting children and having several
wives. but these are not atf offenses , were they \? so they changed
their story , several times. and the original warrant is still sealed.
and we were told about the rockets and ammunition they had... but did
anyone notice any ammo exploding in the fire \? they claimed that koresh
had n't left the compound in months... but people in town report seeing
him just a week before the raid.

how would i have handled it differently \?

well , first , i have n't seen any evidence that the bds did anything
wrong. there 's a sealed warrant , and a collection of stories which
keep changing about what they did. so i might not have done anything.

ok. now , supposing that i know what the bds are being arrested for.
well , they 've got a history of accepting arrests... so , i send
officers to the door with a warrant. wearing bulletproof vests.
covered from a distance by sharpshooters. now , there 's no good reason
to suspect that these people will do anything , right \? why did n't
anyone try serving a warrant \?

ok. going further. they refuse the warrant. it becomes necessary to
raid. you plan a raid. you hear an hour before that there was a leak ,
and they know your coming. so what do you do \? well , change your
plans , right \? nope... they go ahead with it anyone... including
sending in unprotected men to break into the place. it was idiotic. i
do n't know what i would have ended up doing. but that original raid
should never have happened.

the shit that came later should never have happened.

the full record of the raid should be released to the public to let us

the median of a distribution is that variate value which divides the

so for males 20 39 the median 7.3 , this means that half of these men
are higher than this and half are lower than this. now if the population
sample size is 3300 , and 1 of them are gay , 33 males are gay. if we
say they are distributed equally then only 16.5 are greater than 7.3
sexual partners , of course , this means that 49.5 heterosexual men are
greater than 7.3.

not quite. first , the median does not imply that half of the men are
above and half below 7.3 it simply means that 7.3 is the mid point
between the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most
likely zero). however , assuming your implication to be more or less
correct , your final result is still invalid. if 50 of all males
have had more than 7.3 partners , and you deduct the assumed 1 of
homosexual males , what remains is not 49.5 , but still 50 of all
heterosexual males. which is to say hey , we 're all human.

you 're not buying insurance so much as being coerced into one
insurance plan.

no , it is optional ... as it is optional for doctors to accept it.
there are isolated religeous communities in particular that ask for
exemptions (and one e mail from a christian scientist in edmonton
verified for me that it is indeed negative option). i guess that you
can argue that there is a right to having a particular insurance , but
so far i 've not come across that up north ... and i take pains to keep
tabs with news from home.

it 's optional , but what if you do n't want basic coverage on the
government 's terms \? you said before that if you opt out , you 're
basically uninsured.

there are two things at work here ... the public insurance is very
wide in what it will cover , as the amortization is also universal.
no private plan can boast of a plan that fits a gaussian curve ...
and as our private sector has discovered , they 're better off not
offering insurance coverage that their customers are going to use.
(

and that turns the private insurers offering the frills into an
effective cartel they do n't really need to compete because , as you put
it , they 're in a win win situation and they 're guaranteed to turn a
profit

believe me , they probably had orgasms when they figured that out. and
according to my sister the yuppie , they pat themselves on the back to
the point of ungraciousness at chamber of commerce luncheons.

so , in a sense , they 've stopped being truly capitalists if they do n't
have to worry about competing anymore. you might say that the total
effect is one of socialized medicine a government providing the basics
and a cartel providing the extras. there is no alternative to the system ,
desirable or not.

the alternative to the system is no system at all (patients opted out ,
doctors opted out , or both). but that only for insurance ... and you
ca n't force a private insurance company to sell you a plan that they
will not offer. and remember that the actual health care is delivered
by private entities who collect from the public insurance voluntarily.
again , they ca n't force a private entity to spring to life to pay them.

plus , there is the matter of culture and values ... i'm basically
anti tax and anti government , by canadian standards ... yet i ca n't
bring myself to make the same arguments as you do , despite that i
understand where you 're coming from. up north , you 're so much more
likely to find someone protesting taxes going to defence than health
insurance premiums to only one fund for basic coverage ...

(interesting side note have any new insurance companies started
up from scratch since medicare became standard in canada \?

i actually have doubts that any new ones have emerged since ww i ...
no , scratch that ... there are a few in western canada , and quite
a few in quebec as part of the post 1980 quebec miracle (out with the
nationalism , in with the french capitalism). la groupe des cooper

the well lit one with double turrets at the top. as for ontario ,
which still dominates and anchors business up north ...

i meant new companies , not new buildings.

yes , primarily in quebec and in alberta. sorry , i musta lost you in
that verbose blurb ...

it 's not really insurance if you do n't have alternatives

well , you have to realize that in our society that 's like saying
that it 's not really national defence because you ca n't hire
your own rambo squad instead or even opting out as a pacifist.

true , but i would be more comfortable with a system in which basic
care provided by the government was optional , not mandatory.

in canada and germany , it 's not mandatory. however , it is negative
option in that you must request the exemption. that the private
sector will not provide private basic coverage if offered the option
(as in the quebec case) tells me something about what they know ...

either way , the transient situations are hard to deal with since the
changes in the private medical care resource take place at a slower
rate than the ability of people to fall sick esp. in the light of
disasters (e.g. , chernobyl) or bad luck (a sudden wave of heart
disease). a doctor needs 4 6 years of training , plus internship
and specialty training.

another problem with the us system that should be resolved. does n't
canada have something like ten times the proportion of gps to specialists
that the us does \?

yes , but part of the reason is that our most of our markets are
too small to sustain many specialists , sometimes not even one , so
you pretty well have to be a gp to get paid. and if you do get
the training , the doctors monopoly might block your getting of a
licence because there is already someone in the business and who
cannot fill his her appointment book. that we have a cma doctors
monopoly is something that the american ama oriented medical lobby
never tells you down here ...

the problem is , in a specialty your skill often directly correlates
to your pay (a good cardiologist makes more than a merely adequate
cardiologist) more than it does in general practice. in that
circumstance , it 's hard to blame people for going into specialties.

no , i respect people who do specialties (okay , all of my md friends
are ( ) but there 's the question of our small market dynamics up
north ... if anything , that our private doctors and hospitals sell
their services to americans to generate more business will inflate
their effective population served , and thus make some specialties
finally viable (i.e. , there will be enough customers). we just do
not have enough sick canadians in absolute numbers otherwise.

i personally think an approach like germany 's would be best where the
companies compete for batches of people. rochester , a little east of
us , was able to get almost all of its population covered that way.

uh ... germany basically uses our method , with their many sickness
funds. the competition is fake if it exists at all , because they 're
all interlinked. look in der spiegel or stern (my girlfriend is in
our german department and her uncle is a private practicioner in
saarbrucken) ... no ads for health insurance. while canada organizes
by province , germany organizes the paperwork around big corporations
and regional offices. but remember that we have provinces that have
the same population as some major german corporations. germans have
public health insurance , just that it is brokered by smaller entities
(actually , brokerage of basic by private firms who 'll sell extra
insurance to fill out their policies , sort of a voucher system ,
was one of the first ideas floated in canada , too).

remember , the germans do n't have hmo 's ... a telling sign , 'cos
rochester does and they 're also a company town.

but there was a washington post article recently about that that said
canadian doctors often use myelograms instead of mris , which require
spinal injections and can cause seizures and headaches. mickey kaus ,
in the new republic , probably spoke for most americans when he said
who needs that \? i think people here generally like to believe they
can easily get the most high tech treatment even if they really ca n't
afford it.

i 'll have to let a canadian md jump in to verify that claim , but
i 've come to learn to suspect anything in the american press about
our system . if much or some of it were true , you 'd have to take
us for idiots for tolerating it. and given that our insurance was
installed during a period when there were only liberal and tory
governments federally and provincially , and the socialists are still
chafing , they would 've pressed for real socialized medicine to fix
things ... think about it. after all , we are using the u.s. as a
metric to make comparison ... both for keeping up with the joneses
as for confirming that we did something right.

first , the median does not imply that half of the men are
above and half below 7.3 it simply means that 7.3 is the mid point
between the maximum number of partners and the minimum (which is most
likely zero).

actually , the median is defined as the 50th percentile. if the
median number of sexual partners for men is 7.3 , it means that
at least 50 of men have had 7.3 or fewer sexual partners , and
at least 50 of men have had 7.3 or more sexual partners.

(question what is 0.3 of a sexual partner \? )

to confuse matters more , take the following data set

5.0 , 6.0 , 6.0 , 7.0 , 7.0 , 7.3 , 8.0 , 9.0 , 9.0 , 9.0 , 250.0

the mean (arithmetic average) of the above set of numbers is 29.4.
the sample standard deviation is 73.2.
the mode is 9.0.

good point , brett. it might merely be proof that basic health care
markets operate differently , with certain nonmarket phenomenom that
the private sector ca n't handle well (like armies vs. warlords). in
that respect , the effects on american society vs. canadian european

it is , for example , of no relevance that blue cross

blue cross is the government health insurance provider.

good point again. blue cross in the u.s. is quite convoluted compared
to the canadian and german insurance funds , which have a minimal
organization to coordinate it. if anything , bureaucracy now needs to
be built up in canada to combat fraud , such as americans crossing the
border individually to use insurance cards borrowed from friends and

them in blocks. our private practices are now recording insurance

in a letter to the fbi , david koresh said ``do you want me to
pull back the heavens and show you my anger \? ! ... fear me.'' the 51 day
standoff between federal agents and the branch davidians ended on april 19
in what appeared to be a mass suicide by fire. now that the multi million
dollar standoff is over , a few things remain cleaning up the mess , and
assigning blame.



from the onset of the april 19 tear gas attacks by federal agents , president
clinton already started passing the buck by saying ``talk to the attorney
general or the fbi... i knew it was going to be done , but the decision was
it entirely theirs . it they made the tactical decision.'' enter
attorney general janet reno. after most of the branch davidians died ,
reno said she took ``full responsibility'' for the decision. ``i approved
the plan'' she said adding that she ``did not advise him clinton as to the
details.'' in fact , she told clinton that it was ``the best way to go.''
as the fire was roaring through the branch davidian 's compound clinton said
that he was ``deeply sadened by the loss of life'' and in the same breath that
``the law enforcement agencies involved in the waco siege recommended the
course of action pursued today.'' later he went on to say ``i stand by that
reno 's decision.''



how did this all begin \? at 0930 on february 28 agents of the bureau of
alcohol , tobacco and firearms (batf) launched a full scale , high profile
assault on the branch davidian 's compound. this raid was much
more than an assault on a group suspected of possessing illegal weapons. the
assault was a planned media circus used as a propaganda device of the batf
to show their might and just purpose.



at the onset of the ``no knock'' raid , gaggles of heavily armed batf agents
made their way inside the compound without identifying themselves or state
that they had a warrant until long after the shooting began.
silently , the agents made their way to the compound 's buildings and started
their ``search'' by charging at the buildings and throwing concussion grenades
and ordering the cult members to come out of the buildings.



if unknown persons dressed in black ninja costumes and combat fatigues
were to attack you , throwing grenades and brandishing firearms , would you not
assume that these people are criminals and attempt to defend yourself \? the
tactics employed by the batf provoked the battle.



the initial assualt by the batf was not successful. unfortunately , lives
were lost on both sides. but , had the assault been a success , the liberal
media would have praised the batf by showing the footage of batf agents
carting away a bunch of gun wielding religious nuts. of course , any
violation of the cult 's rights would have been overlooked and the media
would proclaim america 's fortune in having super cop organizations like the
batf that can systematically ``take out'' terroristic groups such as the
branch davidians.



as far as i can see , the batf and the fbi dropped the ball just like
philadelphia did in the 1985 move crisis which left 11 dead , 250 homeless ,
and a city block razed.
it appears that the batf has adopted the shoot first tactic of no knock
raids to execute search warrants. do n't let the batf convince you that
the no knock raid was justified. no knock assaults make sense when looking
for , say , drugs that can easily be hidden or disposed of in a few seconds.
the batf was looking for illegal weapons , not drugs that could be hidden or
flushed down the toilet in a matter of a few seconds. what ever happened to
``this is the police ! you are surrounded...'' \? it this policy of no knock
raids , by federal and local agencies , should be restricted . further , the use
of military firepower against presumed innocent citizens is a very scary idea ,
and is why the davidians were justified in using lethal force to ensure that
their fourth ammendment rights ``the right of the people to be secure in
their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches
and seizures'' are not denied.

i'm not saying i'm satisfied with the outcome , it 's very upsetting.
you are simply blaming the wrong person.


oh are we jill \? let me tell you a story then...

one evening not long in this country a man , a parolee , a convicted known
violent crimminal lead police on high speed chase after breaking another law.
he decided that police had no right to do their jobs and enforce the law
and assualted two of while attempting to resist arrest. when police use
metal sticks to force him into submission we heard all the reason why certain
people in this country have and excuse when they refuse to obey the law ,
how this was a perfect example of police oppression , how all the police
had to do was behave a certain way and all would have been finei , how nothing
the victim did could have possibly warranted the response some blows with
a few sticks he got from the authorities.

funny , how when it 's bloodbath billy or his hitwench calling the shots ,
a group of people who were bothering no one , were not know to have broken
any law , who asked only that they be left alone to practice their religion
as they fit , how it is now that the government is justified in assualting
those people with 100 heavily armed commandos simply because the gun
grabbers in dc thought these people had more guns thay they thought they
should have. now when it 's the clinton administration that has the blood
of dozens on its hand aaaall of a sudden it 's the people who refused to
have their civil rights violated , it 's their fault , those evil fanatics
provoked it...

how is it in the mind of the liberal democrat clinton supporter that a
crimminal puke , scum bag , piece of garbage like rodney king could not have
possibly provoked the beating he got , but this bunch of wierdos could cause
a fifty one day stand off that ended with the burning deaths of all of them
and their children , all by themselves with no help from the the police.
and to here people say they deserved what they got , to hear clinton say
the blame rest solely with koresch , what a cowardly piece of work that
man has shown , again , himself to be.

we're blaming the right people. it is you and others that defend any of the
actions of the batf , fbi or justice department in this matter , that with
each word prove again and again the depth of the hypocrisy , the double
standard that people like the clintons would hold certain americans to.
while at the same time allowing others to do as they please with only
excuses to offer their victims. it 's all to clear these days , from the
comments of the president and the rationalizations of his supporters
in these groups , that in a liberal democratic vision of america only
a certain select few people can expect to have civil rights enforced ,
and this administration intends to enforce laws , apply the constitution
and obey the laws only when it suits them to do so.

i ask this question because there is a tradition , and one that

elected to throw themselves off a cliff at masada rather than
submit to roman rule. the circumstances at masada and those at
waco would seem in general terms quite similar , and yet so far
as i'm aware nobody has seriously suggested that the jews were
insane.

as has already been pointed out , the jews faced a totally
different fate at the hand of the romans than did koresh
at the hand of the feds. the jewish men would most likely
have been crucified , the the women and children sold into
slavery. one can well argue that koresh may have thought
that a similar fate awaited him , but there was scant rational
basis for that fear , so insane seems to describe any such
belief.

what is the penalty if convicted of murdering 4 federal agents
in texas \? the death penalty.

none of which excuses the reckless action of the feds , who
allegedly believing they were dealing with a nut , should
have exercise much more restraint. indeed , given their
stated goals of saving the children , one might also apply
the moniker insane to the feds' actions.

understood that david koresh was a madman who would do anything
against the children if he became provoked. all the warning
signs were there and she ignored them. she provoked koresh
into killing the children.

janet reno , the fbi , et al were nothing but pawns in koresh 's game.
he was a madman who was going to hurt the children , and everyone
else in the compound no matter what the fbi did.

the situation in waco was similar to a hostage situation with
a madman holding a gun against the head of an innocent person.
in such a situation , a person who provokes the madman and causes
him to pull the gun 's trigger is responsible for the death of the
hostage. janet reno blindly stumbled in there and basically
threw a tear gas container at the madman hoping that he would
release the hostage. it 's no surprise that the madman would
pull the trigger in response to that kind of provocation.

such a hostage situation has taken place on numerous occasions
with the result of the police trying to take the place by
force and the result being the death of the hostages and the
gunmen. however , this is the first time i 've heard of
the blame landing squarely on the police.

in this country we have a policy of not negotiating a back down

of your research supports this no mental health expert has taken this

according to one survey , done in san francisco , the number of heterosexual

conclusions that can be drawn from this none.

if homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their

but if less than 10 of the population is gay , what can we say about
these people who do n't identify as gay but have demonstrated gay
potential. obviously , a large chunk of these people chose (or , more
accurately , were forced to choose by force of religion and social
sanction) to put those feelings aside , to be heterosexual.

obviously , cramer and kaldis fall into this category.

i ca n't speak for kaldis but force of religion and social sanction
played no part in my sexual preferences. neither had much influence on
me as a teenager.

i have n't recognized any names from previous discussions , but i do
notice that there are a few who blame clinton for the actions of the
batf in waco. unless you felt the same way about what we did under
bush 's direct command in panama , it 's just partisan whining. which is
what i expect most of it to be. i can see no way to condemn one and not
the other.

but i'm sure some limbot will tell me how killing thousands of
panamanian civilians to serve an arrest warrant is much better than
allowing 80 religious fanatics to commit suicide following a botched
attempt by the batf to serve a search warrant.

so \? what does this prove \? i do not object to property ownership i
just think property ownership should be limited to what an individual
person family needs . i do not need 200 , 000 acres to survive , i
need about 3 acres at most and could get by on less. i argue that
by having all property tied up and thus cutting people off form
the basic level of subsistance that the property owners must bribe
the rest of us to respect their ownership rights by providing
alternative means of subsistance. when we are expected to give
these peoperty owners (lets call them thieves) bribes in order to
be able to subsists then we have a sick situation. the property owners
are then parasites.

i want people to be able to live happy and prosperous lives. property
owners cannot maintain a monopoly in the free enterprise system unless
they have help from a coercive government. when a few land owners get
together and try to control all the land without selling , land prices
will go up. at some point it will be to the advantage of the land owner
to sell some of his property. trying to put a group of people to
distribute land fairly would give them monopoly control over the
land , and would have the consequences you speak of. let 's keep the land
out of the grasp of a monopoly and let it exist in the free market.

it 's already in the hands of a monopoly of the rich because of capitalism
of land. other than government land , saved for posterity and the eco system
as well as government function , the remaining land is owned by a smaller
percentage of the people than ever before. the game of capitalism is almost
won. the game has only to be declared over and we will have to take matters
into our own hands and redistribute it again fairly , or else be enslaved in
return for a place to live. here in central california , already , fewer than
30 own all the property and 5 of them own 90 of it. that 's twice what it
was twenty years ago. rents are so high that you pay 60 of your income for
rent. if you just have a mcjob , all you can afford is one room , if that.
some 30 of minimum wage workers are homeless. unless you both have degrees
in technical fields and are working in them , (in the midst of 30
unemployment in high tech jobs ! ) , you will never own anything but a used
car if you choose to have more than one child ! ! ! and everywhere else you
could afford there are no jobs. the only way to get there is to save and
not consume any more than you have to , clothing used , food poor. no movies ,
no entertainment , , ect. for about five to seven years , and then , if you 've
saved 20 , 000 , if you can get together that much , and that 's ignoring your
kids and working two jobs , then you can buy a home in arkansas or missouri
outright and live somewhere where they flood every other year ! that 's an
exaggeration if you pay close attention to the flood lines on other
people 's houses and find a sturdy hill , then you can buy one up there ! also
buy a rowboat. missouri 's not so bad , if you like the sensation of sleeping
in a sweatbox in summer and your car freezing solid in winter. they really
do put those heaters into the dipstick hole to keep them warm enough to
start with ether ! ) shit , kill the rich and redistribute the livable
property. kill all of them !

paul schmidt advocates for self government , davy crockett chapter president

the land is simply granted to people who live on it now. extra is kept for
the future. you get to stay where you are without paying rent. land that
supports others becomes property of the state. farmers are welcome to plant
crops that people need according to demand and ability and soil quality. if
you want to grow sourgum because you always did , and you are n't doing a
good job , then we let another farmer grow sorghum , and you grow something
else. when people die the land they were entitled to use goes into the
public holdings. no one can sell land , but they can trade places with
anybody. no one can lease land. the government will locally distribute the
use of the land not used for residences. residences that are insufficient
to the families living there can be traded to the public for a larger house
and yard according to need and availability. the local land council who vow
to live on their land till death to avoid profit ties will decide fairness
subject to review by the state and federal land councils. it will cost no
more than any fucking thing costs now with fucking assed rent going down a
deep dark hole to the owners ! anyone can submit a request for a larger
house or land to start a business on , depending on a valid business plan
and community needs. heavy equipment is subject to seizure for the public
good or as needed. heavy equipment operators are encouraged to keep and
maintain their own machine and to operate it at a reasonable salary in
service to the community. companies who own many machines are to be divided
among the appropriate equipment operators and the rest to be let to valid
operators on a need basis. cost of upkeep is charged. a guild of heavy
machine operators is recognized for safety and training 's sake. their
council is a subcouncil to the community council. etc. etc. etc. it is n't
so hard to think of a better system than we have. all you have to do is
realize that the system we have now is not sacrosanct , in fact it 's a
rigged game that steals you blind and is the most unfair any system could
be already ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! the trick is to realize that the old rich have been
making the rules behind your back and that it 's time to kick them off the
merry go round. tax the rich to death. they are the ones that converted
your 60 's school lunch program into the joke it is today. they are the ones
who always cut education. they are the ones who always raise the rent when
you get a raise. they are the ones who should be not just dislodged but
killed for their abuse. i have trouble justifying the death penalty for a
poor kid who killed and did n't know why not. i have no trouble justifying
the death penalty for the rich who steal countless human lives to feed
their greed ! have you paid rent most of your life \? then you have been
enslaved , percentage wise , most of your life. we used to be serfs. now we
are called renters , and we are still enslaved to somebody who claims to own
land they do n't use and make us pay them for it when they did nothing to
own it. most rents in california are enough to buy the apartment house ,
paynthe taxes and the insurance and have a little left over to travel with !
i have seen the books ! i know what my landlord pays and to whom ! i know
what i pay her. i am being forced to buy her a building and then i will be
let out at the other end with nothing , when i had as much right as her to
live on this planet ! and her child will have the money to likewise
enslave my child. i hope i find out when i am going to die. i can make
things just a little happier form me to be able to destroy her life as she
destroyed mine. and maybe i can take a few other landlords with me , and
their heirs. that would be worth it. then to be able to die before they can
do anything to me. that 's a poor man 's dream. sleep tight , bastard

the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require
them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through.

what 's despicable is that this sordid incident is being glommed onto by all
sorts of people desperately trying to get a revolution. it makes
ambulance chasing by lawyers seem like a harmless pastime.

for the last few months , benighted souls have been calling c span on issues
as mundane as budget resolutions , saying that i do n't know , i just have
the feeling there is going to be a revolution in this country , and so on.

get real ! for a real case study in revolution , go to blockbuster video
and check out underground , a film made about the weather underground in
the 70 's. even with all the strife back then , the revolution never did
come. and waco is supposed to be the spark of the end times \?

in the tape , it is interesting to see the way the weatherpersons dance
around the issue of one of their defining moments , which was when a few
of their comrades managed to blow themselves up manufacturing bombs in
a greenwich village townhouse. the problem , one of them said , was that
they were so caught up in their armed struggle that they forgot about
their own personal safety and were n't careful. but of course that was
society 's fault , a society that did n't instill a sense of worth in
the people , so they neglect their own safety.

current apologists for koresh may pick up some important rationalization
tips from this tape !

assuming , for the sake of argument , that the branch davidian
people immolated themselves in the manner described by the
federal authorities , why does the general consensus appear to
be that they the bd were insane \? is it the manner of their
behaviour before they died , or the fact they chose to kill
themselves rather than submit to the government \?

i ask this question because there is a tradition , and one that
is highly regarded by many people , that several hundred jews
elected to throw themselves off a cliff at masada rather than
submit to roman rule. the circumstances at masada and those at
waco would seem in general terms quite similar , and yet so far
as i'm aware nobody has seriously suggested that the jews were
insane.

the point of this comparison is to question the use of the word
'cult' in discussing the events at waco. why were the davidians
a cult , and not the jews at masada \? what constitutes a cult \? is
it the size of the membership , or a matter of respectability , or
perhaps the length of time it 's been in existence \? are the
catholics a cult \? how about the mormons or the calvinists \? is
a sect a respectible cult \?

dictionary definitions aside , since popular usage seems to carry
more weight , i suspect that the word 'cult' is used in a perjorive
sense when speaking of groups like the davidians. it is rather
like the word 'boss' when used to describe someone unpopular
or someone the government wishes to make unpopular like , say ,
castro the communist boss of cuba. one does n't hear clinton
described as america 's democratic or capitalist boss.



well , for one thing most , if not all the dividians (depending on whether
they could show they acted in self defense and there were no illegal
weapons) , could have gone on with their life as they were living it.
no one was forcing them to give up their religion or even their
legal weapons. the dividians had survived a change in leadership
before so even if koresch himself would have been convicted and
sent to jail , they still could have carried on.

i do n't think the dividians were insane , but i do n't see a reason
for mass suicide (if the fire was intentional set by some of the
dividians.) we also do n't know that , if the fire was intentionally
set from inside , was it a generally know plan or was this something
only an inner circle knew about , or was it something two or three
felt they had to do with or without koresch 's knowledge blessing , etc. \?
i do n't know much about masada. were some people throwing others over \?
did mothers jump over with their babies in their arms \?

what i saw on tv and what you claim are two different things. the

genades in the windows and started shooting themselves.

also , if the warrant is sealed , how do we know it was a 'no knock' \?

easy ! if you see federal agents in body armor with sub machine guns
going in throught windows , that is a no knock warrant. also since the

you can safely assume that they did n't ring the doorbell.

the above conveniently ignores the murder of four batf agents by the
branch davidians in an unprovoked ambush.

any government that allows tinpot dictators to set up shop and declare
a private state has drifted into anarchy. there are laws to control
the ownership of guns and the batf had good reason to beleive that
they were being violated. they set out to obtain a legal warrant and
attempted to serve it only to be met with gunfire when they rang
the doorbell.

the paranoid assertion that the batf fired first in an unprovoked
assault assumes that the batf were on a death wish. had they
expected the b d to be anything other than peacefull citizens who
would accept a search authorized by a court they would have turned up
in a tank and broken the door down on day one.

the stupidity was the attempt to serve a warant on the place by
ludicrously underarmed and unprotected police.

you 're a member of a rather paranoid religious organization. someone

they throw a concussion grenade at the place , and try to break in.

i would not allow anyone to enter my home without first identifying
themselves. if someone attacks my home by firing weapons or throwing
explosive , i think i 'd be entirely justified in defending myself.

and this search procedure must also follow the rule of law.

the us constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to

it may , if necessary , when the search is executed in an illegal and

the govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases. attempts to

these criminals were threatening the lives of no one they were fired

in this case they used sub lethal force.

wrong. firing a gun at someone is lethal force , even if no one is hit.
of course , they did hit and kill people.

the children were held hostage. the adults were wanted variously for murder
and conspiracy to murder.

you are silly. there are no such warrants in existence , phill.

they should not have called the fire dept at all. there was no role

two groups that the government insure are the elderly and the medically an

guilty of having again used an inappropriate level of force , and would have
been able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate. no , they
would not have looked good on the news in six months or a year. but they sure

can people please stop the 'i think know the batf fbi are completely
responsible but they 'll cover it up so that the investigation will
show that koresch is responsible' bs. in an investigation of this
size with the feds , state , and civilians involved in the
investigation it would be practially impossible to cover up.
and with republicans like arlen spector calling for investigations ,
this is n't going to be handled with kid gloves.

in article 1993apr21.104744.1@happy.uccs.edu , etbeteille@happy.uccs.edu writes

here are several shreds of evidence that prove the waco disaster
is the government 's fault

1) they raided an american 's property because of rumors about
koresh 's intentions with some converted , yet still 2nd amendment
protected , firearms (a judge approved warrant justifies nothing)

in a democracy under the rule of law a search warrant justifies a
search.

the us constitution does not justify murder of those attempting to
mount a search for illegally held weapons.

a search for illegally held weapons (if there were any , no evidence yet
produced to this effect) does not justify firing into a house with
women and children , either. it also does not justify shooting first
without identifying oneself (the atf and fbi have done this before , so
do n't say they have n't , please) or producing a warrant.

guess it depends on whose story one believes , huh \?


2) it took them 51 days to think of a basic terrorist tactic , i.e.
tear gas (and this could only be justified in support of rescuing
any supposed `hostages' inside)

the govt has a right to use lethal force in certain cases. attempts to
capture dangerous criminals who are armed and threatening the lives of others

which others are we talking about here \?

is one. in this case they used sub lethal force.

sub lethal \? excuse me , but those people are dead ! ! !

3) the gov't immediately imprisoned these so called `hostages'

the children were held hostage.

evidence \? so far the fbi has produced none. do n't hold your breath.

the adults were wanted variously for murder and conspiracy to murder.

only a few of those being held in chains and s(hackles are wanted .
the rest are being held for the crime of being material witnesses .

4) it took hundreds of gov't agents with tax funded cellular phones
ten minutes to dial 9 1 1 for the fire department

they should not have called the fire dept at all. there was no role
for them to play in a situation where those that might be rescued might
well shoot at them.

it was not the feds decision to make , but the firefighters.

calling the fire dept meant that waco was deprived
of a resource that might have been needed elsewhere should a situation
where it could have been used arisen.

this is true of any answer to a call for help from a fire department by
any citizen. since fire departments do answer calls that deprive
resources that might be needed elsewhere it is not a valid reason for
not calling them.

further , since the davidians had not been found guilty of any crime in
a court of law , they are subject to the same protection as any other
citizen. and las far as i know , even criminals in prison are not left to
burn to death in a fire.

5) by cutting off the water supply in the surrounding area , the gov't
guaranteed that any fire at the compound would be fatal

any fire started deliberately uising lamp oil is likely to be fatal.

i guess this is a matter of religious faith with you \? the government
says it , so it must be so \? or have n't you been reading this thread well
enough to notice that some of us here do n't beleive their story \?

6) no one had the foresight to station rescue vehicles nearby in the
first place

they are a scarce resource. a bunch of psychos cannot deprive the neighbourhood
of a resource that might be required in a genuine case.

patients in psychiatric hospitals are not left to die in fires , either.
besides , as i explained , some of us here believe their distress might
have been genuine. are you so certain it was n't \?

7) the gov't conveniently forgot all that `freedom of religion' stuff

freedom of religion does not include human sacrifice. nor does it
include other forms of murder.

there is no evidence that the davidians committed human sacrifice
either before of after the initial raid. and self defense is not
murder.

8) the gov't arguably started (or at least fanned) the fire themselves

the govt arguably is run by communists or the trilateral commission.

he did not say it was deliberate. accidents do not require conspiracy
theories , only wanton disregard for human life. the initial raid alone
(agents firing blind into walls against all standards of law enforce
ment procedure) proves they did not mind killing people.

10) finally , and this may be a stretch for some of you statists out there ,
but koresh 's original reasons for holing up in such a compound may
have something to do with the continual interference from the gov't
new taxes , new regulations and increasing involvement in every
aspect of our personal and economic lives life on a compound might
become the way of the future ... it might have to be

let us hope that those who support koresh are not allowed to enforce this upon
the rest of us.

no one here is supporting koresh . we are opposing the illegal use of
excessive violence by our government against our citizens. that is all.

their reasons for supporting the ownership of high power
weaponry are clear enough they hope that this will be the catylist for
the destruction of the fabric of society and allow them to enforce their
nightmare vision of the future.

a society that believes it is ok to terrorize people for their religious
views will destroy itself in due time. it is the feds who disrupted the
fabric of society in waco , not koresh. it is the feds who forced a
nightmare onto the people of mount carmel.

it would be a good thing for people to study history.

on what basis do you assume we have n't \? do n't you really mean
it would be a good thing if people drew the same conclusions from
history that i do \? )

in particular a group of militant...

militant implies acts of aggression against one 's neighbors. the
davidians left their neighbors alone.

.religious heretics who left to set up such a community
some time ago. a few years latter they had captured medina and destroyed
the idols in the kabba. within ten years the whole of arabia was under
islam.

so what \? the mormons were considered a cult for years , and were chased
out of one place after another on much the same thinking as you are
advocating. when they finally got to set up a community they left
people alone. so far americans have n't been put to the sword by mormon
hordes crying to avenge joseph smith. )

just because a group of people start by saying that all they want is to be
left alone does not mean that that is how they will stay.

it does n't mean they wo n't either. anyway , the whole purpose of a
system of laws is to punish people for what they do , not what they
might do.

the pat robertsons ,
oral roberts and jimmy swaggarts of this world are quite telling other
people how to run their lives.

telling is not the same as forcing . when the police knock at my
door , i cannot make them go away by changing the channei. as for pat
and friends , i do n't even watch their channel , since i am an atheist.
so far , not watching them tell me what to do has n't gotten me killed )

if you allow such people to get guns and
point them in your face you are likely to find that they are running your
life.

right now , the only people sticking guns in anyone 's faces is the
government. and they are trying very hard to run my life. or
have n't you noticed \?

not surprising. remember , that study includes homosexuals as well.

implying , no so tacitly , that homosexual men are more promiscuous than
heterosexual men. interesting , especially in the wake of a news report
last week about a group of high school seniors (heterosexual , i might
add) who boasted monthly conquests of up to 67 girls each . it
seems that promiscuity is not limited to homosexuals.

this is a sad fact of life no matter what you look for whether it

there is something terribly wrong , however , with a culture which

attempt to get an education. my mother is an elementary school
teacher , and she tells me that she and her african american collegues
are frustrated to tears by the fact that any african american child who
attempts to do well in school and get an education is accused by
his her peers of trying to be white , and is beaten , bullied , and
tormented by them. it goes beyond each passing grade on a test earning
a beating. in my mother 's school , one of the most promising young
students , who happened to be african american , had her throat cut by
one of these young thugs.

you know , you have a point here , but do n't stop with african americans...
when i was in high school in the early 1980s , on various occasions i had
knives pulled on me , had friends who were stabbed , and i was beaten up
repeatedly by those that could n't accept me as different. and do n't
let the teachers off the hook either. on many many occasions , there
were teachers that either resented me or were too scared out of their
wits by the bullies to even stop the people who attacked me and they
would just watch quietly... all of this was in a nice white middle
class high school. in fact , we were so nice and white that we made
sure that the one black kid in my class was unable to go to the prom
with his white girlfriend... this is n't a race thing , it 's the
way public schools seem to be run...

i 'd hate to be in high school right now... at least i did n't have

i note with insufficient emotion that amongst the five survivors of the
waco debacle , there were two brits and an aussie. the anglo saxon persona
really does n't lend itself to martyrdom for a spurious messiah.

i do n't see how you draw that conclusion. around 20 of the 80 inside the
buildings were british (one quarter). two out of the eight (latest count i
heard) survivors were british (one quarter). anyhow , british does n't equate
to anglo saxon.

what exactly are you trying to say \? and why were there no fire engines within
a mile of the compound \?

because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm amunition that
has a range of 3000 meters.

next question.


the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters
to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place.

the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to
attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention. if the fbi had
had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type
raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults.
it really was a no win situation. koresh had plenty of opportunity
to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf officers. instead
he ordered the murder of the children.


in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive
the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the
suicide murder of his other 80 followers. according to the account given
the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. the koresh gun supporter
claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up. if the
aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. for all practical purposes
they were unarmed , the b d followers had automatic weapons.


the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely. the b d were
quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any
time. a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have
achieved that objective , that would have been very risky , orders of
magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige. airplanes
and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch
apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties
than 80.

allowing the siege to go on was not an option either , besides the serious
risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the
question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over
a prolonged period. the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared
koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege. rather than go
in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon.


can you think of a better way of getting the children out \?

a 100 certain way \?


the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require
them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through.

this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got 4 of its
agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the
middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters.

still the conspiracy theory is comforting , it allows them to pretend that
waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in
resolving a hostage crisis. no govt in the world has ever faced a
comparable situation , quite probably there was no manner in which it
could be peacefully resolved. the blame does not rest on the fbi , it
rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far , in particular
the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of 4 atf
agents and 17 children on his or her conscience.


there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society
preach salvation through armed security. the fact is that these are the
very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. the next waco
may not be religious nutters but a political movement. a splinter group
of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example
and holding several hundred children hostage.

the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent
them arising. no other government in the world has faced such a situation.
this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power
weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah
to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire.

in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive
the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the
suicide murder of his other 80 followers. according to the account given
the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. the koresh gun supporter
claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up. if the
aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns. for all practical purposes
they were unarmed , the b d followers had automatic weapons.

...
the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire
government story. this is simply rationalisation. it is not enough for
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent. that would require
them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them
to get gun control legislation through.


i must object to the characterization of those opposed to the
government 's handling of the waco situation as gun supporters .
your argument tries to paint the batf critics as right wing
gun nuts , and just mixes up two issues.

i am one of the batf fbi critics , and yet i am a liberal
and just as anti gun as you are. i just happen to believe
that everyone has civil rights , even religious crazies.
they 're all human beings , not some nest of wasps that
you 're trying to exterminate.

the batf created the crisis situation by the way they handled
the original raid. it was well known that koresh regularly
went jogging outside his property. he could have been served
with a search warrant then. he could have been arrested if
he had refused to comply. instead officers armed with grenades
invaded the property. this escalated into a shooting war
with tragic deaths on both sides.

those were the first two mistakes the bad judgment of
asking for a no knock warrant , and the bad and probably
illegal way the already unwise warrant was served.

at this point , the situation escalated to where it was
described as an armed standoff and a hostage crisis.
that 's when the government started covering their traces ,
sealing the warrant , revising their reported history of
the incident , etc.

things were already building up to disaster. now the
government could have simply closed the supply routes
and waited. but according to janet reno , that option
had never been seriously considered . so , supposedly
because the agents were frustrated and fatigued , and
because there supposedly were no backups , they felt
they had to go in.

now it 's entirely possible that koresh was responsible
for the fire. if that 's so , he deserves the blame
for the deaths of the people in his compound.

but the government 's hands are far from clean.
their first raid demonstrated bad judgment plus
contempt for the 4th amendment. the motivations
for the second raid are just too unbelievable.
and their coverup of the events of the first
raid undermines their credibility in anything
they do thereafter. we have only some very
biased fbi agents' word for what happened.

and please let 's not turn this into a pro gun vs. anti gun
discussion. anti gun people do not believe that gun owners
deserve to get frontally assaulted by armed government
agents. and koresh 's civil rights exist whether his
guns were legal , illegal , illegal but should have been legal ,
or whatever !

statement by the press secretary

...

the initiative will involve the creation of new products to
accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

...

a state of the art microcircuit called the clipper chip has
been developed by government engineers. the chip represents a
new approach to encryption technology. it can be used in new ,
relatively inexpensive encryption devices that can be attached to
an ordinary telephone. it scrambles telephone communications
using an encryption algorithm that is more powerful than many in
commercial use today.

this new technology will help companies protect proprietary
information , protect the privacy of personal phone conversations
and prevent unauthorized release of data transmitted
electronically. at the same time this technology preserves the
ability of federal , state and local law enforcement agencies to
intercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals.

while also allowing law enforcement agencies to intercept phone
conversations of criminals and non criminals unlawfully. ( no , rev.
king , we are n't spying on you. )

i wonder how long it will take for the wrong people to put their
hands on the equipment necessary to read this stuff. it 'll probably
be as safe as weapons locked safely in evidence rooms.

keys , numbers that will be needed by authorized government
agencies to decode messages encoded by the device. when the
device is manufactured , the two keys will be deposited separately
in two key escrow data bases that will be established by the
attorney general. access to these keys will be limited to
government officials with legal authorization to conduct a
wiretap.

and people to whom they sell them to. all it takes is corrupting

wow , i had n't realized how venomous this was getting ! be careful here...the
problem is n't the rich but the values and the systems that make the rich
rich.

but the values and systems that make the rich rich all basically
amount to freedom of choice.

in new england in 1800 the entire economy was based on the small family
farm. farm economy households were economically diversified , producing
not only agricultural goods but also manufactured goods , especially
cloth. many farm women carded , spun , and or wove , producing not only
cloth for their own family but also to sell , generating extra income.

but about this time the industrial revolution was underway in england
and by the 1820 's it had moved to the us , in both cases in the form
of textile mills. these mills could produce cloth far more efficiently
and cheaply than people at home.

the result was that an important source of home income was wiped out
and many of these women were compelled by economic circumstance to
go to work in these same mills in lowell , mass , or nashua , nh , where
they worked 73 hour weeks in deafening , dangerous conditions , living
regimented lives and being exposed to cotton dust and infectious dis
eases due to the work.

now people did n't have to buy the cheaper factory made cloth.
they were free to keep buying the home made variety and support
their local economy . . .

things are designed in such a way that in order to go with the system
and make money , everything else we care about goes to shit.

. . . but (sorry for the cliche) , it takes two to tango . the big
rich corporations achieved that wealth because we buy their stuff.
it used to be the case that the business center of a town was also
its social center. you knew the merchants you did business with
or even local kids working behind the counter. you would see
people on the street whom you knew and you could stop for a chat.

nowadays local merchants are going out of business and people shop
at huge anonymous malls serving regional populations of hundreds of
thousands or millions. you have no particular relationship with the
companies you do business with , and feel no particular commitment
to them , nor they to you. major components of what defines a com
munity have been destroyed. on the other hand the products we buy
at these malls are a lot cheaper due to economies of scale and foreign
manufacture , and they are probably of better , or at least more consistent ,
quality.


i have to
constantly remind myself that the goal of human society is not to make
money. money does n't make us happy it just prevents certain things making
us more unhappy.

therefore , do n't shoot the rich. shoot the conservatives !

do n't blame the conservatives for this. everyone makes their own
individual choice and the liberals and the fence sitters are just
as guilty of pretending there are no social and cultural consequences
to economic choices.

notice the definition of war (from the american heritage dictionary)
1) a state or period of armed conflict between nations or states.
this qualifies the invasions of cambodia and laos as wars.

excuse me , but neither of these refer to personal gain.

power \? naw , that would be too obvious.

so now , you 're big thing that you have been flogging me with

for starters , they could have gone on waiting and negotiating. the davidians
were n't going anywhere , and their supplies had to be limited. large , perhaps ,
but limited. if they had simply fired the compound by themselves without
gov't tanks smashing down their walls , then at least the gov't would not be

been able to use the meantime to continue to pressure and negotiate. no , they
would not have looked good on the news in six months or a year. but they sure
as hell do n't look very good now.

true. today 's boston globe interviewed a former unification church
leader who is now a consultant on cults. he said the fbi 's approach
was totally wrong. he said they should have tried to break down the
bd 's loyalty to koresh through psychological means. koresh 's whole
theology was based on an approaching confrontation with the forces
of evil in the world and a seige mentality based on this. the feds
played into his hands perfectly . by surrounding the compound
with tanks and playing loud rock music and glaring lights at them
they strongly reinforced koresh 's message that the outside world was
evil and threatening. he said instead they should have set up
a picnic atmosphere , and acted inviting and friendly. if they
broadcast anything over pa systems it should have been loving
relatives reflecting on pleasant events from the cult members'
childhoods. the idea is to make the outside world and surrender
seem like a pleasant , desirable alternative. interesting comments.

looks like the branch davidian is out of buisness.

this morning the police (fbi batf) started ramming
holes in the walls of buildings and shooting in tear gas.
shortly there after , a fire began that has now engulfed
all the buildings in the compound. only one brach davidian
member has come out.

authorities are saying that branch davidian members were
seen starting the fire. it looks like there will no
witnesses to dispute that claim.

there were 90 adults an 19 children in the compound.



funny , how the fire seemed to start on the right hand side of the
building just next to where a tank was backing away , though !

probably just a coincidence.

watch the videotape carefully , the cnn coverage was fairly decisive.

the first fire starts in the tower , this is three storeys high and there
is a flag to the right of it on the picture. the second fire starts
in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high.
the flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire
starting.

thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate
locations. the fbi report a third. i was not able to verify it from the
videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind
the small tower in the second (flag on left) camera angle.


the flames coming out of the building are yellow orange. this is the
normal colour for carbon compounds burning. the flames were those of a
solid or confined liquid burning , not of a gas exploding.


the explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an
explosive though. the cloud itself is on fire. this would seem to
be most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than
the explosion of a magazine.


funny , how considering there was to be a great cache of explosives
ammunition , etc in the compound , i did not see any series of explosions.

depends entirely on how they were distributed. you would not be able
to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage
from a mile away. if and when the fbi release pictures from cmeras
on the armoured vehicles (which presumably exist) it might be possible to
get a clearer picture.

if anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka rambo movies then
remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs.

just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades
going off. since the building was designed to be blast proof to some
extent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off from
the collapse of the building due to the fire.


and , oops , the automatic weapons were probably burnt up in the fire
with the other witnesses.

paranoia.

unless , i see videotapes showing the davidians starting the fire , i
guess i may have a problem believing the feds saying they saw them
doing it , but couldn`t or didn`t manage to tape it. they have
been taping everything else.

you would n't beleive the fbi if they showed you a picture of koresh himself
setting light to the place. your mindset is such that you are simply
unable to accept as true anything that might suggest that a group of
heavily armed weapons fanatics might indeed be in the wrong.

the gun lobby ca n't accept that the b d set light to the place because
that would mean that koreh had murdered 17 children , that would mean that
their taking his account of the murder of 4 batf agents would be even
less credible than it was to start with.

koresh had 51 days to come out with his hands up and face a fair trial.
instead he ordered the murder of everyone in the place.

in article c5uqsm.3i9@encore.com , rcollins@ns.encore.com (roger collins) writes

let me explain some possible means to libertarian style government
one last time.

if the dominate philosophy of a society held that it was ok to kill your
neighbor for sport , no government system (except a strong tyranny by the
minority) could keep the people from killing each other.

the dominate philosophy in our society holds that it is ok for people to
steal and coerce each other as long as it 's done by vote or through the
government machine. libertarians realize what this legal stealing and
coercion does to a society.

so just as a society of non murderers would not vote for the right to
murder , a society of non coercers would not vote for the ability to
coerce.

if libertarianism became the dominate philosophy , the people would do a
good job of restraining government (to the extent that libertarianism
was dominate).

so means 1 is educating the people to become libertarian.

well , that 's the obvious conclusion , given your train of logic. the
corollary then is that it must be a waste of time for the party to run
candidates until the educational program has shown some results.

press conference by the president


the east room


1 00 p.m. edt


the president terry , do you have a question \?

q mr. president , there 's a growing feeling that the
western response to bloodshed in bosnia has been woefully inadequate.
holocaust survivor elie wiesel asked you yesterday to do something ,
anything to stop the fighting. is the united states considering
taking unilateral action such as air strikes against serb artillery
sites \?

the president well , first let me say , as you know , for
more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for
further action. and i want to say , too , let 's look at the last three
months. since i became president i have worked with our allies and
we have tried to move forward , first on the no fly zone , on
enforcement of it , on the humanitarian airdrops , on the war crimes
investigation , on getting the bosnian muslims involved in the peace
process. we have made some progress. and now we have a very much
tougher sanctions resolution. and leon fuerth , who is the national
security advisor to the vice president , is in europe now working on
implementing that. that is going to make a big difference to serbia.

and we are reviewing other options. i think we should
act. we should lead the united states should lead. we have led
for the last three months. we have moved the coalition. and to be
fair , our allies in europe have been willing to do their part. and
they have troops on the ground there.

but i do not think we should act alone , unilaterally ,
nor do i think we will have to. and in the next several days i think
we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and
which has taken a lot of my time , as well as the time of the
administration , as it should have , over the last 10 days or so. i
think we 'll finish that in the near future and then we 'll have a
policy and we 'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.

q can i follow up \?

the president sure.

q do you see any parallel between the ethnic
cleansing in bosnia and the holocaust \?

the president i think the holocaust is on a whole
different level. i think it is without precedent or peer in human
history. on the other hand , ethnic cleansing is the kind of
inhumanity that the holocaust took to the nth degree. the idea of
moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely
because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing. and it is
especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic
groups live side by side for so long together. and i think you have
to stand up against it. i think it 's wrong.

we were talking today about all of the other troubles in
that region. i was happy to see the violence between the croats and
the muslims in bosnia subside this morning , and i think we 're making
progress on that front. but what 's going on with the serbians and
the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other
conflicts , both within the former yugoslavia and in other parts of
the region.

q mr. president , by any count , you have not had a
good week in your presidency. the tragedy in waco , the defeat of
your stimulus bill , the standoff in bosnia. what did you do wrong
and what are you going to do differently \? how do you look at things \?
are you reassessing \? (laughter.)

the president i do n't really believe that the
situation in bosnia it 's not been a good week for the world , but i
do n't know that the administration could have made it different.

on the stimulus package , i 'd like to put it into the
larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already
fundamentally changed the direction of an american government. we
have abandoned trickle down economics. we 've abandoned the policies
that brought the debt of this country from 1 trillion to 4 trillion
in only a decade.

the budget plan , which passed the congress , which will
reduce the deficit and increase investment , has led to a 20 year low
in mortgage rates , dramatically lower interest rates. there are
probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages
in the last three months , or who have had access to cheaper credit.
that 's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this
economy in ways that are very , very good for the country. and so we
are moving in the right direction economically.

i regret that the stimulus did not pass , and i have
begun to ask and will continue to ask not only people in the
administration , but people in the congress whether there is something
i could have done differently to pass that. part of the reason it
did n't pass was politics part of it was a difference in ideas.
there are really people still who believe that it 's not needed. i
just disagree with that.

i think the recovery the economists say it 's been
underway for about two years , and we 've still had 16 months of seven
percent unemployment , and all the wealthy countries are having
trouble creating jobs. so i think there was an idea base an
argument there , that while we 're waiting for the lower interest rates
and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years
to take effect , this sort of supplemental appropriation should go
forward.

now , i have to tell you , i did misgauge that because a
majority of the republican senators now sitting in the senate voted
for a similar stimulus when ronald reagan was president in 1983 , and
voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this. i
just misgauged it. and i hope that i can learn something. i 've just
been here 90 days. and , you know , i was a governor working with a
contentious legislature for 12 years , and it took me a decade to get
political reform there. so it takes time to change things. but i
basically feel very good about what 's happened in the first 100 days
with regard to the congress.

q waco

the president well , with regard to waco i do n't have
much to add to what i 've already said. i think it is a i want the
situation looked into. i want us to bring in people who have any
insights to bear on that. i think it 's very important that the whole
thing be thoroughly gone over. but i still maintain what i said from
the beginning , that the offender there was david koresh. and i do
not think the united states government is responsible for the fact
that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves. and i'm sorry
that they killed their children.

q mr. president , to follow up partly on helen on your
stimulus package and on your political approach to capitol hill , ross
perot said today that you 're playing games with the american people
in your tax policy. he was strongly critical of your stimulus
package. he said he 's going to launch an advertising campaign
against the north american free trade agreement. how are you going
to handle his political criticism \? will it complicate your efforts
on the hill with your economic plan \? and do you plan to repackage
some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to
resubmit them to the hill \?

the president let me answer that question first.
we 're going to revisit all of that over the next few days. i'm going
to be talking to members of congress and to others to see what we can
do about that. with regard to the economic plan , i must say i found
that rather amazing. i do n't want to get into an argument with mr.
perot. i 'll be interested to hear what his specifics are , but i
would go back and read his book and his plan. there 's a
remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts ,
we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.
but , otherwise , the plans are remarkably similar.

so i think it would be i 'll be interested to see if
maybe perhaps he 's changed his position from his book last year and
he has some new ideas to bring to bear. i 'll be glad to hear them.

q to follow up , sir , how do you plan to handle his
political criticism \? he 's launched a campaign against you. do you
think you can sit back and just

the president well , first of all , i will ask you to
apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me. and if he 's
changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last
year , then we need to know why and what his ideas are. maybe he 's
got some constructive ideas.

i think the american people have shown that they 're very
impatient with people who do n't want to produce results. and the one
thing i think that everybody has figured out about me in the last
even if they do n't agree with what i do is that i want to get
something done. i just came here to try to change things. i want to
do things. and i want to do things that help people 's lives. so my
judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good , that is
constructive , that takes us beyond some idea i 've proposed that will
change people 's lives for the better , fine. but i think that that
ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this
debate and not just to the president.

q mr. president , to go back to bosnia for a minute.
you continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action , a
criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many
options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of
paralysis. the united states is the last remaining superpower. why
is it not appropriate in this situation for the united states to act
unilaterally \?

the president well , the united states surely you
would agree , that the united states , even as the last remaining
superpower , has to act consistent with international law under some
mandate of the united nations.

q but you have a mandate and

the president they do , and that is one of the things
that we have under review. i have n't ruled out any option for
action. i would remind all of you , i have not ruled out any option ,
except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the
introduction of american forces into continuing hostilities there.
we are not.

so we are reviewing other options. but i also would
remind you that , to be fair , our allies have had the french , the
british and the canadians have had troops on the ground there.
they have been justifiably worried about those. but they have
supported the airdrops , the toughening of the sanctions. they
welcomed the american delegation now in europe , working on how to
make these sanctions really work and really bite against serbia. and
i can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely
reassessing their position , and i would not rule out the fact that we
can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where
we have been. i do n't have any criticism of the british , the french
and others about that.

q would that be military action \?

q mr. president , several of the leading lights in
your administration , ranging from your fbi director to your u.n.
ambassador , to your deputy budget director to your health services
secretary , have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which
are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you 've taken in
your administration. why is that \? are you losing your political
grip \?

the president give me an example.

q example \? judge sessions said that there was no
child abuse in waco. madeleine albright has said in this morning 's
newspapers , at least , that she favors air strikes in bosnia. all of
these are things you said that you did n't support.

the president first of all , i do n't know what we
know that david koresh had sex with children. i think that is
undisputed , is it not \? is it not \? does anybody dispute that \? where
i come from that qualifies as child abuse. and we know that he had
people teaching these kids how to kill themselves. i think that
qualifies as abuse. and i'm not criticizing judge sessions because i
do n't know exactly what he said.

in terms of madeleine albright , madeleine albright has
made no public statement at all about air strikes. there is a press
report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed
her or memo in which she expressed her views about the new
direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior
members of my administration to let me know what they thought we
ought to do next. and i have heard from her and from others about
what they think we ought to do next. and i'm not going to discuss
the recommendations they made to me , but in the next few days when i
make a decision about what to do , then i will announce what i'm going
to do. so i would n't say that either one of those examples qualifies
speaking out of school.

q how about the value added tax , mr. president \?

the president what was that \?

q the value added tax mrs. rivlin and miss shalala
both said that they thought that that was a good idea.

the president i do n't mind them saying they think it 's
a good idea. there are all kinds of arguments for it on policy
grounds. that does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it
in the health care debate. no decision has been made on that. and i
have no objection to their expressing their views on that. we 've had
a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they
thought that tax would help make their particular industries more
competitive in the global economy. i took no that was n't taking a
line against an administration policy.

q mr. president , a week ago a group of gay and
lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed
in the most ringing terms , their confidence in your understanding of
them and their political aspirations , and their belief that you would
fulfill those aspirations. do you feel now that you will be able to
meet their now enhanced expectations \?

the president well , i do n't know about that. and i
do n't know what their it depends on what the expectations are.
but i 'll tell you this i believe that this country 's policies
should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination. i believe
when you tell people they ca n't do certain things in this country
that other people can do , there ought to be an overwhelming and
compelling reason for it. i believe we need the services of all of
our people , and i have said that consistently. and not as a
political proposition. the first time this issue came up was in 1991
when i was in boston. i was just asked the question about it.

and i might add it 's interesting that i have been
attacked obviously , those who disagree with me here are primarily
coming from the political right in america. when i was governor , i
was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights
of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to
practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards. i just have
always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect
the rights of american individual citizens to live up to the fullest
of their capacities , and i'm going to stick right with that.

q are you concerned , sir , that you may have generated
expectations on their end and criticism among others that has
hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis
on this issue \?

the president yes , but i have not placed a great deal
of emphasis on it. it 's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters
and in the press. i 've just simply taken my position and tried to
see it through. and that 's what i do. it does n't take a lot of my
time as president to say what i believe in and what i intend to do ,
and that 's what i 'll continue to do.

q mr. president , getting back to the situation in
bosnia and we understand you have n't made any final decisions on
new options previously considered unacceptable. but the two most
commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable
the bosnian muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited
air strikes , perhaps , to cut off supply lines. without telling us
your decision presumably , you have n't made any final decisions on
those two options what are the pros and cons that are going
through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final
decision \?

the president i'm reluctant to get into this. there
are those are two of the options. there are some other options
that have been considered. all have pluses and minuses all have
supporters and opponents within the administration and in the
congress , where , i would remind you , heavy consultations will be
required to embark on any new policy.

i do believe that on the air strike issue , the
pronouncements that general powell has made generally about military
action , apply there. if you take action , if the united states takes
action , we must have a clearly defined objective that can be met. we
must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear. the
united states is not , should not , become involved as a partisan in a
war.

with regard to the lifting of the arms embargo , the
question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to
fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace \? will
it lead to more bloodshed \? what kind of reaction can others have
that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy \?

but i think both of them deserve some serious
consideration , along with some other options we have.

q do you think that these people who are trying to
get us into war in bosnia are really remembering that we have n't
taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and
we could n't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from
vietnam \? and now many of them are coming up with bills for
treatment of agent orange. how can we afford to go to any more of
these wars \?

the president well , i think that 's a good argument
against the united states itself becoming involved as a belligerent
in a war there. but we are , after all , the world 's only super power.
we do have to lead the world and there is a very serious problem of
systematic ethnic cleansing in the former yugoslavia , which could
have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences and
goodness knows there have been many but also could have other
practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts
of ethnic tensions exist.

q did you make any kind of agreement with boris
yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive
action against the serbs until after sunday \? and in general , how has
his political situation affected your deliberation on bosnia \?

the president no , i have not made any agreement , and
he did not ask for that. we never even discussed that , interestingly
enough. the russians , i would remind you , in the middle of president
yeltsin 's campaign , abstained from our attempt to get tougher
sanctions through the united nations in what i thought was the proper
decision for them and one that the united states and , i'm sure , the
rest of the free world very much appreciated.

q do you wish , mr. president , that you 'd become more
involved in the planning of the waco operation \? and how would you
handle that situation differently now \?

the president i do n't think as a practical matter that
the president should become involved in the planning of those kinds
of things at that detail. one of the things that i'm sure will come
out when we look into this is the questions will be asked and
answered , did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions
we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten \? and
i look forward to that. but at the time , i have to say , as i did
before , the first thing i did after the atf agents were killed , once
we knew that the fbi was going to go in , was to ask that the military
be consulted because of the quasi , as least , military nature of the
conflict given the resources that koresh had in his compound and
their obvious willingness to use them. and then on the day before
the action , i asked the questions of the attorney general which i
have reported to you previously , and which at the time i thought were
sufficient. i have as i said , i'm sure i leave it to others to
make the suggestions about whether there are other questions i should
have asked.

q mr. president , what is your assessment of director
sessions' role in the waco affair \? and have you made a decision on
his future \? and if you have n't , will you give him a personal hearing
before you do decide \?

the president well , first of all , i have no assessment
of his role since i had no direct contact with him. and i mean no
negative or positive inference. i have no assessment there. i stand
by what i said before about my general high regard for the fbi. and
i'm waiting for a recommendation from the attorney general about what
to do with the direction of the fbi.

q mr. president , since you said that one side in
bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the holocaust carried to
the nth degree , why do you then tell us that the united states cannot
take a partisan view in this war \?

the president well , i said that the principle of
ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against. that
does not mean that the united states or the united nations can enter
a war , in effect , to redraw the lines , geographical lines of
republics within what was yugoslavia , or that that would ultimately
be successful.

i think what the united states has to do is to try to
figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the
people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop
ethnic cleansing. and that is obviously the difficulty we are
wrestling with. this is clearly the most difficult foreign policy
problem we face , and that all of our allies face. and if it were
easy , i suppose it would have been solved before. we have tried to
do more in the last 90 days than was previously done. it has clearly
not been enough to stop the serbian aggression , and we are now
looking at what else we can do.

q yesterday you specifically criticized the roosevelt
administration for not having bombed the railroads to the
concentration camps and things that were near military targets.
are n't there steps like that that would not involve conflict direct
conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider \?

the president there may be. i would remind you that
the circumstances were somewhat different. we were then at war with
germany at the time and that 's what made that whole incident so
series of incidents so perplexing. but we have as i say , we 've
got all of our options under review.

q the diplomatic initiative on haiti is on the verge
of collapse. what can you do to salvage it short of a full scale
military operation \?

the president well , you may know something i do n't.
that 's not what our people tell me. i think mr. caputo and
ambassador pezzullo have done together a good job. the thing keeps
going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the
de facto government there. it 's obvious what their concerns are.
they were the same concerns that led to the ouster of aristide in the
first place , and president aristide , we feel , should be restored to
power. we 're working toward that. i get a report on that we
discuss it at least three times a week , and i'm convinced that we 're
going to prevail there and be successful.

i do believe that there 's every reason to think that
there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to
guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on
both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of
ongoing civilized society. but i believe we 're going to prevail
there.

q mr. president , would you care to make your
assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you \?
(laughter.)

the president well , i 'll say if i believe , first of
all , we passed the budget resolution in record time. that was the
biggest issue. that confirmed the direction of the administration
and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both
bring the deficit down and increase investment , and that we could do
it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes , almost all of
which come from the highest income people in this society reversing
a 12 year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the
middle class , whose incomes were going down when their taxes were
going up , while the deficit went from 1 trillion to 4 trillion , the
total national debt , and the deficit continued to go up.

we have a 20 year low in interest rates from mortgages.
we have lower interest rates across the board. we have tens of
billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people
refinance their debt.

we have established a new environmental policy , which is
dramatically different. the secretary of education has worked with
me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach
in education that focuses on tough standards , as well as increasing
opportunity. we have done an enormous amount of work on political
reform , on campaign finance and lobbying reform. and i have imposed
tough ethics requirements on my own administration 's officials.
these things are consistent with not only what i said i 'd do in the
campaign , but with turning the country around. the vice president is
heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal
government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens
of this country.

we are working on a whole range of other things. the
welfare reform initiative , to move people from welfare to work. and ,
of course , a massive amount of work has been done on the health care
issue , which is a huge economic and personal security problem for
millions of americans.

so i think it is amazing how much has been done. more
will be done. we also passed the family leave bill. a version of
the motor voter bill that has not come out of conference back to
me yet. and everything has been passed except the stimulus program.
so i think we 're doing fine and we 're moving in the right direction.
i feel good about it.

q sir , a follow up. would n't you say , though , that
one of your biggest initiatives , aid to soviet russia , is now
practically finished if we ca n't pass a stimulus bill in our own
country , how can we do it for them \?

the president let me recast the question a little bit.
it 's a good question (laughter) it 's a good question , but to be
fair we 've got to recast it. we have already the first round of
aid to the soviet to non soviet russia , to a democratic russia , is
plainly going to go through , the first 1.6 billion. the aid that we
agreed with our partners in the g 7 to provide through the
international financial institutions , which is a big dollar item , is
plainly going to go through. the question is , can we get any more
aid for russia that requires a new appropriation by the united states
congress \? and that is a question i think , mary , that will be
resolved in the weeks ahead , in part by what happens to the american
workers and their jobs and their future. i think the two things will
be tied by many members of congress.

q the tailhook report came out this morning ,
documenting horrendous and nearly criminal conduct on the part of the
navy. how much did you discuss the incident and what might be done
about it with your nominee to be the secretary of the navy \?

the president first , let me comment a little on that.
the inspector general 's report details conduct which is wrong and
which has no place in the armed services. and i expect the report to
be acted on in the appropriate way. i also want to say to the
american people and to all of you that the report should be taken for
what it is , a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to
be thoroughly examined. it should not be taken as a general
indictment of the united states navy or of all the fine people who
serve there. it is very specific in its allegations , and it will be
pursued.

the only thing i said to the secretary designate of the
navy and the only thing i should have said to him , i think , is that i
expected him to take the report and to do his duty. and i believe he
will do that.

q mr. president , to back to russia for just a minute.
the latest poll show that mr. yeltsin will probably win his vote of
confidence. but there seems to be a real toss up on whether or not
voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.

the president i understand that.

q can you live with a split (laughter) can you
live with a split decision , though , or do you need both passed in
order to then build support for russian aid \?

the president i believe the answer to your question
is , for the united states , the key question should be that which is
posed to any democracy , which is who wins the election. if he wins
the election , if he is ratified by the russian people to continue as
their president , then i think we should do our best to work with him
toward reform.

you know , we had a lot of other countries here for the
holocaust museum dedication their leaders were here. leaders from
eastern europe , leaders from at least one republic of the former
soviet union all of them having terrible economic challenges as they
convert from a communist command and control economy to a market
economy in a world where there 's economic slowdown everywhere. and
in a world in which there 's economic slowdown and difficulty , all
leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll
because they have n't produced the results that the people so
earnestly yearn for. you can understand that.

but if they have confidence in the leadership , i think
that 's all we can ask. and the united states will if the russian
people ratify him as their president and stick with him then the
united states will continue to work with him. i think he is a
genuine democrat small d and genuinely committed to reform. i
think that we should support that.

q mr. president , mr. perot has come out strongly in
what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement
nafta. how hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement
and when do you expect to see it accomplished \?

the president i think we 'll have the agreement ready
in the fairly near future. you know , our people are still working
with the mexican government and with the canadians on the side
agreements. we 're trying to work out what the environmental
agreement will say , what the labor agreement will say , and then what
the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.

the mexicans say , and there is some merit to their
position , that they 're worried about transferring their sovereignty
in enforcement to a multilateral commission. even in the united
states , to be fair , we have some folks who are worried about that
about giving that up. on the other hand , if we 're going to have an
environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means
something , then there has to be ultimately some consequences for
violating them. so what we 're trying to do is to agree on an
approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations
if you keep on violating it past a certain point maybe not an
isolated incident , but a pattern of violation there is going to be
some enforcement. there must be consequences. and we 're working out
the details of that.

but i still feel quite good about it. and this is just
an area where i disagree with mr. perot and with others. i think
that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more
closely the mexican economy and the american economy and leads us
from there to chile to other market economies in latin america , and
gives us a bigger world in which to trade. i think that 's the only
way a rich country can grow richer. if you look at what japan and
other countries in the pacific are doing to reach out in their own
region , it 's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry
about how to build those bridges in our own area.

so this is an idea battle. you know , you 've got a lot
of questions and i want to answer them all , but let me say not every
one of these things can be distilled simply into politics you
know , who 's for this and who 's for that , and if this person is for
this , somebody else has got to be for that. a lot of these things
honestly involved real debates over ideas , over who 's right and wrong
about the world toward which we 're moving. and the answers are not
self evident. and one of the reasons that i wanted to run for
president is i wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating
these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.
so i just have a difference of opinion. i believe that the concept
of nafta is sound , even though , as you know , i thought that the
details needed to be improved.

q mr. president , there was a tremendous flurry of
interest earlier this month in the russian document that purported to
show that the vietnamese had held back american prisoners. general
vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was
authentic , he believes that it was incorrect. do you have a personal
view at this point about that issue \? and more broadly , do you
believe that , in fact , the vietnamese did return all the american
prisoners at the time of the paris peace accord \?

the president first let me say , i saw general vessey
before he went to vietnam and after he returned. and i have a high
regard for him and i appreciate his willingness to serve his country
in this way. as to whether the document had any basis in fact , let
me say that the government of vietnam was more forthcoming than it
had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to
undermine the validity of the russian documents claim.

i do not know whether that is right or wrong. we are
having it basically evaluated at this time , and when we complete the
evaluation , we 'll tell you. and , of course , we want to tell the
families of those who were missing in action or who were pows. i
think that we 'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of
the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last
interchange , but i cannot say that i'm fully satisfied that we know
all that we need to know. there are still some cases that we do n't
know the answer to. but i do believe we 're making some progress. i
was encouraged by the last trip.

q i 'd like to follow up on that. before the u.s.
normalizes relations , allows trade to go forward , do you have to be
personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be
willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to
resolve these cases , the vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to
us to confirm good faith \?

the president a lot of experts say you can never
resolve every case , every one , that we could n't resolve all the cases
for them and that there are still some cases that have not been
factually resolved , going back to the second world war. but what i
would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward
resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time ,
and that there was a complete , open and unrestricted commitment to
continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving
those cases. and we 're not there yet.

again , i have to be guided a little bit by people who
know a lot about this. and i confess to being much more heavily
influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there ,
or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and
the other things which seem so compelling in this moment. i just am
very influenced by how the families feel.

q your economic stimulus package , are you doing
some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans ,
your legislative plans for the coming year , including the crime bill ,
the health care initiative and other things \? are there any plans to
do that \? and also , did you underestimate the power of senator bob
dole \?

the president no , what i underestimated was the extent
to which what i thought was a fairly self evident case , particularly
after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this congress ,
including the republicans who were in this congress last year when
we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over 500
billion in deficit reduction. when they had voted repeatedly for
supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments , i thought at
least four of them would vote to break cloture , and i underestimated
that. i did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.

i also thought that if i made a good faith effort to
negotiate and to compromise , that it would not be rebuffed. instead ,
every time i offered something they reduced the offer that they had
previously been talking to the majority leader about. so it was a
strange set of events. but i think what happened was what was a
significant part of our plan , but not the major part of it , acquired
a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits , so
that a lot of republicans were saying to me privately , mr.
president , i 'd like to be for this , but i ca n't now. and we 're all
strung out and we 're divided.

and i think we need to do a reality check. as i said ,
what i want to know let me go back to what i said what i want
to know from our folks and from our friends in the senate on and
republicans or democrats is what could i have done differently to
make it come out differently. because the real losers here were not
the president and the administration. the real losers were the
hundreds of thousands of people who wo n't have jobs now. we could
have put another 700 , 000 kids to work this summer. i mean , we could
have done a lot of good things with that money. and i think that is
very , very sad. and it became more political than it should have.
but the underlying rationale i do n't think holds a lot of water
that it was deficit spending. that just wo n't wash.

q and redo

the president no. i mean , you know , for example you
mentioned the crime bill. i think it would be a real mistake not to
pass the crime bill. i mean , the crime bill was almost on the point
of passage last year. and they were all fighting over the brady
bill. surely , surely after what we have been through in this country
just in the last three months , with the kind of mindless violence we
have seen , we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a
waiting period before they buy a handgun. and surely we can see that
we need more police officers on the street.

that 's another thing that i really believe that once
we move some of that money not all , but some of it up into this
jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the
street who 'd been laid off , that would be a compelling case. i mean
people are scared in this country and i think we need to go forward.
i feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.

q mr. president , back to the tailhook report for a
second. that report contained very strong criticism of the navy 's
senior leadership in general , but did not name any of the senior
officers. do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated
in this , including admiral kelso who was there one night in las
vegas , should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a
right to know the names of the senior officers \?

the president you should know that under the rules of
law which apply to this , i am in the chain of command. there is now
an inspector general 's report and the law must take its course. if i
were to answer that question i might prejudice any decisions which
might be later made in this case. i do n't really think i think
all i can tell you is what i have already said. i was very disturbed
by the specific allegations in the inspector general 's report , and i
want appropriate action to be taken.

until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and
appropriate action is taken , i have been advised that because i am
the commander in chief i have to be very careful about what i say so
as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action
might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or
con. so i ca n't say any more except to say that i want this thing
handled in an appropriate and thorough way.

q mr. president , could i ask you for a clarification
on bosnia \? you said that you were not considering introduction of
american forces. does that include any air forces as well as ground
forces , sir \?

the president i said ground forces.

q you said ground forces. could i ask you , sir , if
you fear that using u.s. air strikes might draw the united states
into a ground war there \?

the president i just do n't want to discuss our
evaluation of the options anymore. i 've told you that there 's never
been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of
ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.

q with hundreds of thousands of gays in washington
this weekend for the march , did you ever reconsider your decision to
leave town for this weekend \? did you ever consider in any way
participating in some of the activities \?

the president no.

q why not \?

the president because i and , basically , i would n't
participate in other marches. i think once you become president , on
balance , except under unusual circumstances , that is not what should
be done. but more importantly , i'm going to the american society of
newspaper editors , a trip that presumably most of you would want me
to make , to try to focus anew on what i think are the fundamental
issues at stake for our country right now. and i expect that i will
say something about the fact that a lot of americans have come here ,
asking for a climate that is free of discrimination asking ,
basically , to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be
treated like other american citizens if they do that , and just that.
and that 's always been my position not only for the gays who will
be here , but for others as well.

thank you very much.
