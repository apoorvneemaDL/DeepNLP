is this public domain \? if yes , where can one obtain a copy from \?
yes , it is. it is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu , probably
in pub xkernel.

in response to the earlier gentlemans question , you could
theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4. the binaries available are
for the sun3 50 , but the author says it could be used on most
architectures , and he does have a 'do it yourself' type distribution.

we use xkernel for about 7 machines here. email me if you

i recently corrected the resolution on my sparcstation by changing
usr lib x11 xdm xservers from
0 local usr bin x11 x 0 ar1 500 dpi 100
to
0 local usr bin x11 x 0 ar1 500 dpi 85

i determined that my 19 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the
active screen area and dividing by resolution.

however , this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.
after some research , i believe this is caused by my applications
requesting fonts by family , weight , slant , and pointsize. i believe
that x is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
and displaying it. since i have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my
path , the results are inaccurate. i do have some speedo fonts , but
not for the family i am using (helvetica).

i think this is incorrect. the fonts should always be provided in the
resolution of the display. this never seems to happen unless you
explicitly request fonts by xres and yres ! this is true of both the
scaleable and bitmapped fonts ! for instance , the command

xfd fn ' bitstream charter 240 '

will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a speedo font).

the command

xfd fn ' adobe courier 240 '

will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).
despite the fact that x knows my display is 85 dpi , and that it can
generate an 85dpi font for me ! unless i my applications specifies a
resolution , x appears to pick a stupid default.

is this a bug \? is it a feature \? if so , why \? is there anything i can
do to get around this problem \? people have suggested that i lie about
my resolution , and specify a single font path (75 or 100 , not both).
this would at least make my app consistent , but i like being able to
look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say yup , thats
an inch . anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts i can use \?

in article 1993may10.134631.14364@taylor.uucp , mark@taylor.uucp (mark a. davis) writes

oh boy have i wanted this too. however , i believe that the cursor will
be under the server 's control (could be wrong) \? on an xterminal , for
example , if the server was not the one controlling the cursor , then trying
to get the xterm application to do the blinking would cause needless and
yucky network overhead (consistantly).



most people who write cursor blinking code just implement the simple case a
straight 500msec (or so) on off cycle. however , the cursor will work much
better if cursor blinking is suppressed (i.e. the cursor is made visible) any
time the cursor moves and for .5 to 1 sec thereafter. if you do n't do this , the
cursor will be hard to track when in motion.

you allways could port and use emu from export.lcs.mit.edu contrib emu.tar.z.
we 've implemented a blinking text cursor for the very reasons people mentioned.
you can even configure the actual size of the text cursor (horizontal ver
tical line cursors , smaller block cursors) , turn on and off blinking ,
set the blink rate and so on. you even get blinking text ok , enough
advertising.

i have n't looked at the xterm code in this respect , but from the memories
i have when we had to decide whether to start with xterm and make it do
what we wanted (mostly the blinking text) , i 'd say it wo n't be easy , since
xterm is a hairy mess (understandable if you follow it 's roots back to
x10).

the actual task to get the cursor to blink is n't that difficult if you
provide the right hooks. as antonio mentioned , you 'll have to show the
cursor directly after it has moved , or people will become confused.
since it 's a good idea to take the cursor off the screen when you
do anything on screen anyways , this is n't very complicated. you 'll just
have to start the blink process with the cursor showing directly after
it 's mapped.

as for the portability of emu and it 's newest version. the one on export
is still the same as on the r5 contrib tape. we wanted to get out a new
release for over six months now , but unfortunately we 're drowning in work.
but since the changes are n't affectiong emu 's behavior much , i 'd say
whoever wants to try emu should n't wait for a new version.

as is , emu wo n't work on bsd derived systems (e.g. suns) with anything else
than a csh. there is a fix to this , which is very short (remove one line
of code). i 'll put this on export today.

i think your performance will depend upon the x server.

i'm running linux and xfree86 on a 33mhz 486dx with 4mb of ram (8mb swap) and
it runs just fine. its a lot better than some of the crappy old xterminals
in the labs at school anyway.

you could probably outfit a 386sx with a minimal linux x setup for 900
and be better off than with an xterminal. imho.

bitmap a bitmap to display instead of the label.

one way round this might be to make use of the button 's backgroundpixmap

to set it from a resource file. also , the button wo n't automatically be the

me anything else than a csh. there is a fix to this , which is very
me short (remove one line of code). i 'll put this on export today.

it 's more than that actually. in the version on export one cannot just
specify a posix tty behaviour , the posix config files are incomplete
without those of some specific platforms like suns and decs. i looked
twice at porting emu to linux , but stopped short becuse of the tty
part. is there a `cleaner' version of emu that supports posix tty
explicitly \?

hmm , depends on how you define 'clean'. jordan implemented the system
dependent stuff in a way that you have basic implementations for ,
call it , operating system types , then you go ahead and write a include
file for your specific machine or operating system using the basic
implementations. since both jordan and i have n't encountered a
os flavor yet , that is fully posix , we have n't gotten around to
really implement (and test) a top level include file specifically
for just posix. the posix routines are used in the sun specific file
tty sun.i for example , but here we also use some bsd stuff. all in all
it still is probably better to implement a include file for each and
every operating system than ' ifdef'ing in existing ones. the type
of mess that can result from that can clearly be seen in the xterm
sources. even if quite a bit of code gets copied almost unchanged a
couple of times , this only uses up some disk space , since only the
drivers actually included from the toplevel include file will be
compiled into emu.

it should n't be hard to come up with a tty linux.i file that fully
relies on the posix stuff , but unfortunately i do n't have a linux
system available to me , so i ca n't do the port myself. i would suggest
you read the readme in term sysdep and if you have any problems or
questions , contact me and we could try to sort this out. unfortunately
we have to rely on help from the net on this part of emu , since we
just do n't have access to that many different systems.

my problem is this when i resize the window , only the original part of the
window that was part of the window creation gets drawn into. everything else
is a grey..the oval tries to redraw itself but gets clipped. i can see that
it would be the right size if i could see all of it , but it only shows up in
the region that was the original size of the window when created.

for example , i start out the window at 200x200 in width and height. if i
resize it to 400x400 , the only part that has any color drawn into it is
is from the origin out to 200x200..the rest is grey. further the oval
only shows up in that 200x200 area.

desqview x is a multitasker for dos computers , that uses a standard

windows standard mode are converted on the fly to x protocol , allowing
you to display them , or any r4 compatable x program from any machine
on the net to display to the pc 's local display (or to any other display
on the net).

free tools are available for devloping x applications for the dvx platform
many x programs have been ported between dvx and unix with little or
no modifications. (often , you only need to create a new makefile ! )

if you 're interested in more details , you can check out the usenet group

need help on resource bindings for tvtwm. here 's what i 'd like to
see the icon manager do.

say i iconify a window and this shows up on the icon list. now when i
pan into another section of the virtual desktop and try to deiconify
the window that i iconed (sp \? ) earlier , i 'd like this window to
deiconify in the current region.

any resources that i can use to do this \? or more important , can i
do this \? rather find it painful to remember where i iconified a
window , go back there and deiconify. or simply , it is a pain to
pan around to get to a deiconified window.

subject re button 3 popup menus with athena widgets
organization the internet
lines 42
to koblas@netcom.com
cc xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

ok , i'm being driven batty.

trying to create popup menus (ie. button3 press , and a menu
appears). i would really like to use the standard athena
classes to achieve this goal , but for my best attempts
i cannot get the menus to come up without using a menubutton
as the parent of the widget tree. i know this should be
possible to to with an xtpopupspringloaded() and a
little twiddling , but something is escaping me.

read the documentation for the simplemenu (4.2.3 positioning the simplemenu).
the reference is to the r5 documentation.

i had not done this before but in less than 10 mins i knocked up the following
wcl application that does what you want using a command widget. even if you are
not familiar with wcl the example is so simple it should be pretty obvious what
is going on. the crucial thing is the use of the xawpositionsimplemenu and
menupopup actions.


ari.wcchildren app

app.wccreate command

subject axe 5.0 is available
organization the internet
lines 89
reply to j.k.wight@newcastle.ac.uk
nntp posting host enterpoop.mit.edu
to xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

i have placed a new release of my axe editor in axe 5.0.tar.z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

the significant change this time , and the justification for the hike
in the major version number , is

o undo has been implemented.

by default only the last change can be undone , but a resource is
provided to allow the user to specify how many , including unlimited ,
levels of undo information should be kept. also , undo of undo is
supported.

there is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be emaxe 19 )



for those who have not encountered axe before here is a summary of
what it is all about

axe is a simple to use text editor for x that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. also built around the athena text widget it
features , amongst other things ,

o multiple windows
o multiple buffers
o default menu interface
o optional button interface , with choice and layout of buttons
under user control
o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
o provision for defining a keyboard macro
o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
o file selection via a browser
o knowledge of line numbers
o parenthesis matching
o regular expression searching
o restricted or unlimited undo
o ability to change font
o easy entry of control codes
o xterm like keymap feature
o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
o both brief and comprehensive on line help
o server mode with cooperating client programs
o optional extension language using tcl
o optional xaw3d widget set compatability
o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of axe

i have personally built and run core axe , i.e. without the tcl and
xaw3d options , on the following systems

sun sparc sunos 4.1.x mit x11r5
sun sparc sunos 5.1 mit x11r5
encore multimax umax 4.3 mit x11r5
dec 5000 120 ultrix 4.2 mit x11r5
hp 9000 710 hp ux 8.07 mit x11r5
mac iici au x 3.0 mit x11r5

but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. i have
only tested the tcl and xaw3d options on the first.

a number of ' ifdef sysv' isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

although axe will probably build under r4 run time problems have been
encountered in the past. i have not bothered to try this version under
r4 , and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems. therefore , if you are at r4 you very much take pot luck. if
it does n't work the only alternative is to try the last release ,
2.1.1 , of version 2 which should still be around. it does n't have as
many features and uses the widget creation library (wcl). not only
that , it requires an old version of wcl , 1.06 or 1.05. version 3 of
axe was nearing completion when version 2 of wcl came out so axe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

axe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially , and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites. check your nearest using
xarchie.

if you ca n't ftp , try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word help alone in your message body. you will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

and looking in the appropriate manuals listed in the bibliography below
before posting to the comp.windows.open look , comp.windows.x or

special notes
i have not updated this faq for the recently announced openwindows 4 ,
due to ship later this year.
yes , sun is moving to motif , along with all of cose. but the motif to
which they move will be a new motif , with some of the open look ui
features added.
yes , openwindows 4 will use dps instead of news. news is dead.
this means tnt is dead , too.
xview and olit will be supported , but probably not enhanced after the
next release. i do n't know if there will be a source release of
xview 3.1 or not.
the cose environment will include at least some of sun 's deskset ,
ported to motif. look for calendar manager and mailtool , at least.
yes , the new mailtool will be mime compliant.

subject terminology open look , openwindows , x11 , xview , olit , moolit , motif

@ what is open look \?
open look is a specification of a graphical user interface (gui).
a gui determines the `look and feel' of a system the shape of
windows , buttons and scroll bars , how you resize things , how you
edit files , etc.

the open look gui is specified , developed and maintained jointly by
sun microsystems and at t (or usl \? ).

see also
bibliography

@ what is openwindows \?
openwindows is a windowing environment that conforms to the open look
graphical user interface specifications. it 's compatible with the
x11 window system from mit as well as (currently) sun 's news and sunview ,
so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.
it comes from sun and also with system v release 4 from certain vendors.
openwindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews , after the
program used to start it and the main executable itself , respectively.
it should not be called `windows' or 'open look' or `openlook' , as
these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.
a commerical openwindows source licence costs about 5 , 000 for the server ,
plus about 25 , 000 for deskset , and another 40 , 000 for tooltalk.
the current versions of openwindows for various platforms are
sunos 4.1.1 on sun 3 2.0
solaris 1.x (sunos 4.1.x) on sparc 3.0
solaris 2.0 (sunos 5) on sparc 3.0.1

see also
mixing x11 and openwindows
where can i get it \?

@ what are olit , xview and tnt \?
these are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs
that conform to the open look specifications. see the bibliography
for documentation on the individual toolkits. here 's a brief summary

olit was at t 's open look intrinsics toolkit for the x window system
it used a widget set , and was probably the easiest for people who were
already x11 xt programmers to learn. you could buy the source from at t ,
although you did n't get the same version tht sun ship. sun includes the
olit library in openwindows (q.v.) it is also often included in
system v release 4. it was written in c. the release of olit in
openwindows 3.0 was olit 3.0. olit support passed to usl (then a
division of at t , now owned by novell) , who replaced it with moolit (q.v.).
note that because of the nature of xt subclassing , you will probably
want or need olit source in order to develop a large application or
anything else that uses subclasses.
see the proceedings of the 1991 x technical conference

xview is sun 's toolkit for x11 , written in c. xview is similar in
programmer interface to sunview. there 's even a shell script to help
migrate source code from sunview to xview. xview is often said to be
the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with x windows.
the xview toolkit is included in openwindows , and full source is
available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).
the current version of xview from sun is 3.0.
despite rumours to the contrary some even from within sun the
xview toolkit is not about to be dropped by sun. xview will be
included in the next release of openwindows , unlike news.
on the other hand , the xview toolkit is not likely to receive as much
attention from sun in the future as olit.

the news toolkit (tnt) was an object oriented programming system based
on the postscript language and news. tnt implements many of the
open look interface components required to build the user interface of
an application. it 's currently included in openwindows.

the current version of tnt from sun is 3.1 release 3 contains some
incompatibilities with `tnt' 1.0 and tnt 2.0 , but sun are committed to
supporting the api , at least until they stop news support some time
later this year and replace it with display postscript. wail.
you might ask what `is committed to' means in this context the
answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.
sun currently asserts that it is committed to olit , however.

the c user interface toolkit (uit) consists of an object oriented c
class library layered on top of xview and a tool to generate code from
devguide 3 gil files. the uit also includes features that simplify
event management and the use of postscript and color. it is said to be
compatible with openwindows v2 and v3 , and presumably v3.0.1 , since the
release mentions that it works on solaris 2.
uit is not an official sun supported product but an ongoing project of
various people within sun. it can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in
the mit contrib directory as uitv2.tar.z (use binary mode ! ).

@ where does motif fit in \?
it does n't ). motif is an alternative graphical user interface that
is being developed by osf. it has a `look and feel' reminiscent of
microsoft windows and the os 2 presentation manager. there are no non
commercial motif toolkits available , although the motif source is sold
reasonably cheaply by osf. although motif is currently available on
more platforms than openwindows , the open look gui is almost certainly
used on many more machines , simply because sun (and sysvr4) have such a
large installed base.
sun 's cd ware volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving motif
applications by converting them to olit ) there are also notes in
the `periodic table' olit demo , openwinhome demo olittable.

@ what is moolit \?
moolit is a version of olit from at t usl that lets users choose between
a motif and an open look ui feel at run time. it will be part of system v
release 4.2.
contact joanne newbauer , jo@usl.com , (908) 522 6677

@ what about that display postscript thing \?
sun and adobe have agreed that sun will include the dps extension to x
in the next release of openwindows. dps is essentially a badly designed
hack on top of a slow level 2 postscript interpreter intended to give a
very small subset of the functionality of news whilst simultaneously
being harder to use , as i understand it. the only real advantage it
has over news is that the manual is much smaller , being generally less
complete dps is also available on more kinds of machine.
performance on our rs 6000 is not suitable for interactive work
what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be seen.
note that whereas x news fonts are shared by both subsystems , the dps
extension to x does not make type 1 postscript fonts available to
ordinary x11 programs. it is not like atm on a pc in this regard.
(there is at least one third party version which does make fonts
available , however)

subject window managers olwm , olvwm

@ what are olwm and olvwm \?
they are window managers. a window manager is the part of the x window
system (e.g. x11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows
on the screen , and for managing the user 's interaction with the windows.

olwm is the standard open look window manager.
it 's included with all of the openwindows (q.v.) implementations , and
you can also get the source by ftp , since sun donated it.

olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop' (hence the
`v' in its name). it shows a little map on the screen , with the
currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle. you can
move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys. this
lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around
from one to the other. olvwm was derived from the openwindows 3.0 olwm
by scott oaks you need to have xview 3.0 to compile it.
get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib
directory there are three patches).

@ can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm \?
yes. if you use twm , for example , or mwm , you wo n't be able to use
the pin and unpin feature of olwm , and you (probably) wo n't see the
footers some windows use to display certain messages.

if you use twm , you 'll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus
and get rid of programs that do n't have a `quit' button when not run
under olwm.
for twm , put this in your home .twmrc
lefttitlebutton target f.delete
where target is a 16x16 icon from usr include x11 bitmaps.
alternatively , try
add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm
lefttitlebutton menu f.menu ol.menu

menu ol.menu
quit f.delete


for mwm , you can double click on the menu icon on the left of the title
bar to dismiss a pop up window (i am told).

see the manual page for your window manager (twm , etc).

subject openwindows , terminals , and other displays

@ can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal \?
the openwindows xnews server combines sunview , news (postscript) and x11.
this means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.
unfortunately , it means that some openwindows programs need either news
or sunview support , and thus wo n't run on an x terminal. this includes
pageview in particular.

you can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an x terminal or a non open
windows display , and most open look clients (e.g. olit or xview ones)
will work perfectly well. you may find that you get complaints about
fonts not being found. if so , see the fonts section below.
if you are running the window manager built in to an ncd terminal , you
may have problems with input focus setting input true in the terminal 's
xdefault file in usr lib x11 xdm may or may not help.


subject configuration files getting started with openwindows

@ what configuration files do i need to know about \?

.xinitrc and .xsessionrc

the first time you run openwindows , a .xinitrc file will be created in
your login directory ( home). if it already exists , you might have to
edit it somewhat it 's simplest to move it and any other old x11 files
you have to another directory , and then merge the old and new files.

if your site uses xdm , you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc ,
since xdm does n't look at your .xinitrc file.

.openwin init , .openwin menu and .openwin sys

these are optional files you can create in your home directory ,
depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.
look in openwinhome lib (normally usr openwin lib) for these files
without the leading . and copy any you want to change. you may need
to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized. if you are not on an
x terminal , you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool c ,
shelltool c , xterm c) or chuck musciano 's contool program so that
system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.
note that .openwin sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.

.xdefaults

you can put x windows resource specifications in here. in particular ,
it is a good idea to include at least
openwindows.focuslenience true
input true
these allow non icccm compliant programs to receive input even if they
forget to ask for it.

props , the program that runs when you select `properties' from the default
root menu under olwm or olvwm , writes your choices into .xdefaults.
do n't put comments in .xdefaults , since `props' deletes them.

.startup.ps

this is the news user profile file , read by openwindows (actually xnews)
on startup. this is documented in the news programming manual , near the
back. the most useful thing to put here is postscript code to change
the keyboard repeat rate , although you must be very careful , since a
syntax error in the postscript means that xnews will either not start up
at all or will get broken in strange ways. the news manual gives code
that is both incorrect and insufficient.
warning things in this file rarely work on both openwindows 2 and 3.

note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m see
the man page for xset ( man xset , and xset help ) for more information.

here 's what home .startup.ps should look like if you want a delay of
about a third of a second (300000 microseconds) , and a repeat rate of
twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for
openwindows 3. you 'll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime
is the delay between keys sent , and thus does n't include the time to
process each key , which is probably higher on my 4 110 than on your
supersparc 10 51 gti injection ) again , this is for openwindows 3...

do n't want the demos see p. xxxii of news toolkit reference manual
includedemos \? false def

userprofile begin
keyrepeatthresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def
keyrepeattime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def
note 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...
end

you must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory , like this

news 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
tntcore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage
tnt 3 0 findpackage beginpackage

classrepeatkeys pop force repeat.ps to autoload

endpackage endpackage endpackage

if you change these parameters , you can test them without restarting the
openwindows server like this
psh i .startup.ps
welcome to x11 news version3
psh i
welcome to x11 news version3
classinit classrepeatkeys send
now press control d

you can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make
the root window be retained , so that a postscript drawing on the
background wo n't be erased when you move windows
frambuffer retained true put
will do this. note that this may increase the amount of memory used
by the news server (xnews) dramatically.

trouble shooting it wo n't let me type
trouble shooting is there an easy way to edit xdefaults \?
environment variables

@ how can i configure open look for a left handed mouse and keyboard \?
you can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons , but be prepared for one
or two occasional surprises. see also man 7 xview for a list of
keybindings you can change , at least for xview programs.

with openwindows 2.0 , you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings
and then let sunview handle them. the status returned by svenv should
tell you whether your server is running under sunview or not put this
in your .xinitrc

if eval `svenv env`
then
xmodmap e pointer 1 2 3
input from defaults
else
xmodmap e pointer 3 2 1
fi


@ how can i get the screen to go blank when the system is idle \?

run screenblank from etc rc.local if you can it 's a boring but
effective screen saver. see `man screenblank'.
under solaris 2 you 'll need to copy screenblank from an older system , as
it 's not supplied. then add a new file in etc rc2.d to make the system
run screenblank automatically.

subject key bindings , cut and paste

@ how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindows programs \?

to go from xterm to textedit (say)
select the text you want to copy by dragging the select mouse button
in xterm
press copy in the xterm (this key is l6 , or meta c (the o'reilly
xview manual gets this wrong)
move to the textedit window , and press paste (l8 or meta v)

if this does n't work , see trouble shooting cut and paste

to go the other way , from textedit to xterm
select the text in textedit. no need to use copy
move to the xterm window and press adjust (the middle mouse button).
you can also use the copy cut and paste buttons.

@ copy paste is boring. what short cuts are available \?

quick copy within textedit , mailtool , etc
click select to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go
press and hold down the paste (or cut) button
select the text you want to copy move. you 'll see that it 's underlined
or crossed out , as appropriate. (in the jed demo it goes grey)
let go of the paste (or cut) button.
the text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret.

drag and drop to move a selection
select the text you want to copy or move , by dragging or multiple
clicking the select or adjust mouse button
put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection
press and hold down down the select mouse button , and move the mouse
pointer a little to the right you 'll see the cursor changes to be the
first 3 letters of the text (or some other icon).
still holding select down , move the mouse over the point where you want
to drop the text
you may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle sight or target , to show
that it 's ok to drop things here
let go of select , and the text is moved. this works in text fields of
dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows.

drag and drop to copy a selection
this is the same as using drag and drop to move a selection , except that
you must hold the control key down as well as the select mouse button.

@ what are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere \?

see the man page for textedit(1) for some of them.
in general , the editing moving commands go in the opposite direction when
shifted e.g. ctrl w deletes a word , and ctrl w deletes the word to the
right of the insert point.

meta i include file meta f find selection (forward backward)

ctrl a start of line ctrl back word
ctrl e end of line ctrl forward word
ctrl w delete word ctrl u delete to start end of line
ctrl return move to end start of document

see the o'reilly xview reference manual for a list of some of the default
keys see also the olwm or olvwm manual page.

@ what can i put in my .ttysrc \? where is it documented \?

see the manual page for shelltool.

subject applications finding out...
contact sunsoft (or sun) and ask for the catalyst open look guide ,
which lists over 200 pages of applications , and also the huge
catalyst listing of products for suns , updated six monthly.

sun 's free cdware cd roms each contain demo versions of several popular
open look applications. often you can simply contact the vendor
concerned to have the license upgraded from demo , and receive the full
product documentation.

sunpics produces a cd rom for newsprint users , printer 's pallate , which
contains newsprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters , as
well as 600 scaleable fonts that you can license.

there is a separate faq posting in comp.windows.open look that lists
a number of free and commercial aplications mail lee@sq.com for a
copy , including open look ui application list in the subject for a
faster reply.

subject deskset , mailtool , calendar manager , etc.

@ is there a tty based interface to cm (calendar manager) \?
yes , cm delete , cm insert and cm lookup these all have manual pages.
if man cm delete does n't work or gives strange messages , see under
trouble shooting strange error messages , below.

@ how can i arrange to have my .signature included in my outgoing mail \?
the best way is
cd
cp usr lib .textswrc .
chmod w .textswrc
edit .textswrc (use vi , textedit , or whatever you prefer)
add the follwing
key right(3) filter
cat .signature
(you might need to change to home)

now pressing r3 will insert your .signature file.



subject fonts

@ does openwindows support type 1 postscript fonts \?
yes , under either solaris 2.0 or 2.1 (i'm not sure which).
or , not yet , in other words.

if you have framemaker there is a utility to import them , i'm told.
the 57 fonts supplied with openwindows are fully hinted , though , and
comparing them to the microsoft windows and apple truetype fonts is
interesting... the f3 font format is described in a publication from the
sun openfonts group , listed in the bibliography below. documentation on
the unbundled version of typescaler is also available from sun openfonts.

you can buy f3 fonts from sunpics , monotype , linotype , urw and probably
other major foundries.

sunpics' newsprint software supports type 1 fonts.

@ improving font rendering time
although the sun type renderer (typescaler) is pretty fast , it 's not as
fast as loading a bitmap ). you can pre generate bitmap fonts for sizes
that you use a lot , and you can also alter and access the font cache
parameters. if you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the
font cache size.
psh i
welcome to x11 news version3 psh will say this at you
currentfontmem type this line ...
300 and here 's whai my server was using 300 kbytes
1024 setfontmem
just to check
currentfontmem
1024
see pp. 328ff of the news 3.0 programmer 's guide. you need to say psh i
so that the postscript packages are loaded see the psh man page.

@ making bitmap fonts for faster startup
mkdir home myfonts
cd home myfonts
makeafb 20 m openwinhome lib fonts bembo.f3b
creating bembo20.afb
convertfont b bembo20.afb
bembo20.afb . bembo20.fb
chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied.
ls
bembo20.afb bembo20.fb synonyms.list
bldfamily
bembo . bembo.ff (encoding latin)
cat . compat.list no such file or directory
xset fp `pwd`
xset fp rehash

if you want the server to see your new font directory every time ,
add this directory to your fontpath environment variable in one
of your start up files , e.g. .login or .profile.

@ converting between font formats (convertfont , etc.)
you can also use folio fonts with an x11 server , by converting them to a
bitmap (x11 bdf format) first. your licence forbids you from using the
fonts on another machine , and unless you have newsprint you should n't
use them for printing. having said all that... you can use makeafb and
convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or
bdftopcf.

use mftobdf (from the seetex distribution) to convert tex pk fonts to
x11 bdf format , which you can then use with either x11 or oenwindows.

you can also use der mouse 's getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running
x display server ftp larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) x getbdf

@ xview olit fonts at 100 dpi
there are n't any. more precisely , the various text fonts , such as
lucida typewriter sans , are available at 100 dpi , and in fact are
scalable under openwindows. the glyph fonts are bitmaps , and do n't
scale very well.

subject trouble shooting strange error messages

@ no manual entry for cm lookup

if man does n't seem to find openwindows commands , even though you are
running openwindows , try setting the manpath environment variable
manpath openwinhome share man usr man export manpath
or
setenv manpath openwinhome share man usr man
for csh users. openwinhome should be usr openwin on most systems.

@ window window creation failed to get new fd
@ window base frame not passed parent window in environment
@ cannot create base frame. process aborted.

these messages all come from sunview programs. sunview was an
earlier windowing system for suns , and was not networked. some of
the sunview programs are still around in usr bin , and have names
that are the same as their openwindows counterparts. you almost
certainly want to run the programs in openwinhome instead.

set your path so that openwinhome bin (and openwin bin xview for
openwindows 2) come before bin (or usr bin , they 're the same) , or
you 'll get the sunview versions of mailtool , cmdtool , shelltool , etc.

@ memory fault core dumped
if you get this from the binder , or if binder vanishes suddenly ,
get the following patches
100493 02 binder
100524 03 cetables
100626 03 tooltalk

@ trouble compiling xt , xmu or olit programs get wmshellwidgetclass

if you are using openwindows 3.0 (x11r4 based xt) , contact your local
sun office and request the following patches
100512 02 4.1.x openwindows 3.0 libxt jumbo patch
100573 03 4.1.x openwindows 3.0 undefined symbols when using shared libxmu

if you ca n't install the patch , a workaround is to add
u get wmshellwidgetclass u get applicationshellwidgetclass
on the link (ld or cc ... o ...) line. an alternative is to add
assert nodefinitions
to cflags in your makefile , or even in imake.tmpl.


subject trouble shooting it wo n't let me type

@ when i try to type into some programs , i just get beeps or nothing happens
it is a good idea to include at least
openwindows.focuslenience true
input true
in your .xdefaults file , as these allow non icccm compliant programs to
receive input even if they forget to ask for it.
see the next item for editing .xdefaults

subject trouble shooting cut and paste not working

@ i ca n't paste from xterm to xview (including sun deskset) programs
under openwindows 2 , you need to add the following either to your
home .xdefaults file , or to openwinhome lib app defaults xterm instead

xterm vt100.translations override
key l6 select set(clipboard) n
key l8 insert selection(clipboard)

you must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing
l8 (the paste key) !

under openwindows 3 , this is already in the app defaults file , so if it
is n't working , check that xfilesearchpath is set to
usr openwin lib t n s
and if it is n't , either set it or copy merge the above lines from
openwinhome lib app defaults xterm into usr lib x11 app defaults xterm.
see also environment variables

this version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard
xterm vt100.translations override n
ctrl meta btn2up insert selection(primary , cut buffer0) n
ctrl meta btnup select end(primary , cut buffer0 , clipboard) n
keypress l8 insert selection(clipboard)
note be sure that the n is at the very end of the line , there must
be no following spaces , and any or signs showing that this faq file
was altered must also be removed !

if you are using x11r5 , you may find that adding the lines
key l10 start extend() select end(primary , clipboard , cut buffer0) n
keyrelease l10 kill selection() n
before the keypress l8 line will make l10 (cut) work as a cut key !

if you alter home .xdefaults instead , you must use what x calls a
`more specific' resource name
xterm.vt100.translations
will do.

@ i ca n't paste from xview (including sun deskset) programs to xterm

if you do n't have the sun l keys on the left of your keyboard , you can
use meta x , meta c and meta v for cut , coy and paste respectively.
you can change the keys by adding the following two lines to
your .xdefaults file , edited as you wish (the values shown here are the
defaults)

openwindows.keyboardcommand.copy c meta , l6
openwindows.keyboardcommand.paste , v meta , l8

lists of resources are in the manual page for xview , and also in the
thinnish blue book `companion to volume 7 , xview reference manual' from
o'reilly , and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages.

@ i always get the same piece of text when i press paste (l8 , meta v)
remove the file tmp textsw shelf and see if that helps see also the
next item.

@ cut copy and paste do n't work at all (openwindows only)
oh dear. use ps xuaww grep xv to check that sv xv sel svc is running
and that either you or root started it , depending on whether you started
openwindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm.
if not , start it. if it dies , check that there is no tmp .sv xv sel svc
before restarting it you may need to be root to remove it , or you can
reboot your workstation.
check that there is space in tmp (use df tmp ) , and also see if there
are a lot of files there with names like tmp tty.txt.a01246 if there are
several hundred of them , cut and paste may take so long that it times out.

quit any deskset tools such as mailtool , filemgr and cm (calendar) , start
a terminal emulator and remove and tmp tty.txt and tmp text files
that are still there. it 's simplest to quit openwin and start it again
after doing that , if cut and paste was broken , but if it starts working
again you can just carry on. note that files in tmp not owned by you
might be in use by another worker comrade , so do n't remove those without
checking first !

subject trouble shooting not authorized to use display

if you get error messages that look like
xlib connection to 0.0 refused by server
xlib internal error during connection authorization check
error ca n't open display
try , on the machine running openwindows or x11 ,
xhost machine
where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed.
if you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you ,
using your display , you will have to type the bizarre looking
xhost `hostname`
(or xhost happyboy , if happyboy is the name of your workstation).
this lets any user on `happyboy' access your display.

with openwindows 3.0 you can also use xauth , and the programmer 's guide
describes how to do this in chapter 8 , p. 101. this is more secure.
also check the man page for fbtab(5) to stop other users accessing the
framebuffer directly !

also note that there is a sun patch for openwindows 3.0 under sunos 4.1.1
to fix a serious security problem. it is available through your local
sun answer center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net
192.48.96.2 system in sun dist
fix patchid filename checksum
loadmodule 1076118 100448 01.tar.z 04354 5


on an x terminal , there may be a setup menu that lets you change or
disable the list of hosts that can access the display.

if you start getting this message after you 've been logged in overnight ,
there might be a cron job that 's removing the unix sockets in tmp
that are used to communicate with the server when display does n't have
a hostname before the , or is empty. have the system administrator
change the cron script to skip sockets.

subject trouble shooting other common problems

@ i get console error messages on my screen and they do n't go away (sun 3 or 4)
if refresh makes the messages vanish , but new ones come along later ,
you need to run xterm c from your .xinitrc , or start one up in
the background and then choose save workspace from the
workspace utilities menu. better still , pick up contool and run
that. get it from export.lcs.mit.edu in the contrib directory. it
will monitor the console and open , flash its icon or beep when a
message appears it 's very easy to configure.

if refresh from the workspace utilities menu does n't make the messages ,
go away...
a sun with a cg4 frame buffer has two screens you can move the
mouse off the right hand (by default) edge of the screen and onto
a whole new (but monochrome) display , called 0.1 . see the man.
page for openwin i have a shell script that checks for this and ,
if there 's a dev cgfour0 , does
openwin dev dev cgfour0 dev dev bwtwo0
if you are running x11 or openwindows 2 , you might need to add this
to your .xinitrc or other startup file
(
eval `svenv display unix 0.1 env`
olvwm display unix 0.1
)
later releases of olwm and olvwm do this automatically.
you can also run switcher e 0 to get rid of the messages. also , see
the note about contool , above.

@ is there an easy way of editing .xdefaults \?
use `props' , which appears in the default root menu as `properties'.
this starts `props' , a property editor which will re write your
.xdefaults after removing comments. it then applies any changes.
keep comments by using comment. instead of ! , for example ,
comment. .font palatino italic 37

@ how do i get the file manager to use emacs instead of textedit \?
set the default editor to
sh c exec emacs font lucidasanstypewriter 18 file
(you can change the font if you prefer a smaller one)

@ how do i run openwindows in inverse video \?
this tends not to work under openwindows 2. with opwnwindows 3.0 ,
there are various ways , including using bg and fg options. if you 're
using openwindows 2 on a sun 3 , probably the best you can do (short of
upgrading the workstation to a sparc ! ) is to use xterm instead of cmdtool.

@ why do n't flat check boxes work \?
a known bug may make guide 's output dump core if you use these.
a workaround is to edit the guide output , as it 's only guide 's output
that 's broken , not the actual check box code.
this applies only to versions of devguide before devguide 3.0. if you 're
still using an ancient devguide , you should upgrade as soon as possible
the new one is fantastic !

@ when i leave openwindows , my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays
on the screen.
try running clear colormap if this helps , put it as the last line in
the shell script you use to start openwindows (e.g. `openwin').

@ when i use snapshot , the system crashes , or the server hangs , or something.
this was a bug related to some systems only. the only work round was to
use some other screen dump program , such as xwd , xv 2.21 or xgrabsc.

@ why have some of my function keys stopped working \?
keys f11 and f12 changed from sunf36 and sunf37 to sunxk f36 and sunxk f37
respectively in openwindows 3. applications must be recompiled , or you
might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to
change your keyboard layout back again.

@ when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit , i get the sunview version
see under trouble shooting strange error messages below.

(see also next item)

@ mixing x11 and openwindows
(see also next item)

note that openwindows 3.0 includes the x11r4 core distribution (to patch
level 18) , but not the contrib directory. these notes apply to
openwindows 2.0 , although you could also the do same sort of thing with
openwindows 3.0 and x11r5.

install the x11 libraries in usr lib x11. you can intermix openwindows
and x11r4 or x11r5 , they 're all compatible in this respect.
put the x11 binaries in (for example) usr bin x11.

put usr bin x11 last in your path , so that you get openwindows versions
of programs instead of x11 ones where appropriate , although this is a
matter of preference. in any event , put the openwindows bin directory
first see the preceding item for more details on that. if you have
bin (or usr bin , they 're the same directory on sunos) earlier in
your path than openwinhome bin xview , you 'll get sunview programs instead
of openwindows ones !

set ld library path so that usr openwin lib is last , after the x11
library directory. this does n't matter with openwindows 3.0 , but with
older versions you 'll get error messages from x11 programs if you do n't
do this. the messages are generally harmless (see next item) , although
xdm core dumps if this is n't right.

set openwinhome to the directory containing openwindows if it is n't
usr openwin.

see also
environment variables (especially xfilesearchpath).

@ i get error messages on my screen about ld.so libx11.so.4 not found
set ld library path to be usr openwin. if you also use x11 , use
usr lib usr 5lib usr openwin lib
if you put this in a shell script or your .profile , use
openwinhome usr openwin lib instead of usr openwin this is for
bin sh for csh it is different.

@ i launch my filemgr and i get ld.so map heap error (9) at dev zero
your system needs to be patched. look in openwinhome lib ospatches
and install the patch.

@ why does n't answerbook run for me \?
you must be running openwindows to use answerbook. it wo n't run under
x11 (on an x terminal or on anything else) because it uses news to draw
the postscript text and pictures.
if you are using openwindows 3.0 , you need to use the openwindows 3.0
compatible navigator it 's called .navigator.ow3 on the answerbook cd rom.
if all answerbook users are using openwindows 3.0 , you can replace
navigator wih .navigator.ow3 altogether (rename the old one first to
satisfy your sense of paranoia ! )
the navigator.ow3 binary is also on cd ware vol 2.
note that the data files are in postscript , so you can look at them with
a postsript viewer (q.v.).

@ why are n't there any fish in realxfishdb \?
a fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from
ftp.eng.auburn.edu 131.204.10.91 as pub realxfishdb.z

@ why is the properties choice disabled in the window menu \?
it is n't implemented yet. many programs do respond to the properties
key (l3) , though , or have a pop up menu with properties on it.

@ file completion in the c shell is broken in cmdtool
sadly true , but use shelltool or xterm instead and it 's fine. it also
works if you run command tool on a remote machine.
fixed in openwindows 3.0.1 shipped with solaris 2.

@ when i run olit programs , some of the widgets are red !
release 3 of olit added mouseless operation action widgets can be
selected via the keyboard. the currently selected item is highlighted
in red (the `red stain') to show that it has the input focus.
to disable it in most places , add this to your home .xdefaults file
traversalon off
textedit.traversalon on
textfield.traversalon on
you can change the color using (for example)
inputfocuscolor grey50
input focuscolor green
list inputfocuscolor your background color
see the man page resources(3w) , at the start of the olit 3 widget set
reference manual included in the openwindows 3 programmer documentation.
meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id 100451 30 , the
olit 3.0 cte jumbo patch.

@ when i run several programs , the colors on the screen all change when
i move into a different window ! ( colormap flashing )

this is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time.
however , you can minimise the effect with the following procedure
start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve.
run
cmap compact save
to create the .owcolors file
put the line
cmap compact init
near the start of your start up file (.xinitrc)
exit and then restart the window system.
cmap compact init will push those colors .owcolors to the end of
the colormap and reserves them.

also note that control l2 locks the colors of the current window , and
control l4 unlocks them this is described in the olwm manual page.

@ pageiew uses the wrong colors , or makes the colormap flash (see above)
this problem was reported by people for some reason running the motif
window manager (mwm) with openwindows.
try running pageview like this
openwinhome bin reservecolors svmono
openwinhome bin pageview
openwinhome bin reservecolors discard

@ xdm breaks things
command tool does n't like being run without a unix `controlling terminal'.
use etc setsid to start your command tools and all will be well.
sunview applications may need to be run with svenv , as in
svenv exec usr bin traffic
because xdm wo n't set the necessary environment variables.
note that the mit xdm starts up the x server as root , which is a security
hole for openwindows use the openwindows 3.0 xdm or be aware that your
users can access files and start unix processes ass root...

@ function keys 11 and 12 stopped working
in openwindows 3.0 , the x11 names ( keysyms ) for these keys was changed
to sunxk f36 and sunxk f37. code which uses them should be recompiled ,
or you might be able to get away with
xmodmap e 'keysym sunxk f36 sunf36'

subject trouble shooting xview problems
this section is here only until an xview faq appears , which has been
promised , but has n't reached here. note that there is also a usenet
newsgroup , alt.toolkits.xview , although it does n't sem to have very
wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles
per month. you should also look at the faq in comp.windows.x.

@ how do i set the font of individual scrolling list items \?
panel list font takes an int row number and an xv opaque font handle.
panel list fonts take a null terminated list of xv opaque font handles.
there is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font.
you have to make sure that you always specify panel list font when you
insert a new row into that list , or write a convenience function
insert row(list , row , string) that hides the nasty bits.

@ how do i keep an xview pop up window displayed after a button is pressed \?
in the button callback , do
xv set(button , panel notify status , xv error , null)
this will keep the window visible.
you might also need to investigate the menu notify status attribute.

@ how do i make an xview button look pressed \?
call panel begin preview() and panel cancel preview() these are
documented in er the xview 3 source...

@ openwindows 3 imake does n't work properly
here is greg earle 's patch , to be applied in openwinhome note that you
should edit lib config sun.cf afterwards to get osname and
osminorversion right (minorversion is 1 in sunos 4.1.2 , for example).
i have edited the patch a little , so any bugs are mine lee@sq.com )

environment variables , and plausible values to use this list does n't
take into account any local changes that you might have made , of course.
this list is for openwindows 3.0 differences for openwindows 2.0 are
marked , and i 've added some comments for users of x11r4 and x11r5 , too.

display the name of the x windows display to use
0.0 (on the local machine , the one actually running x11 or xnews)
0.1 (on some machines for a second , monochrome screen)
machine running unix 0.0 (on other machines)
(you may need to do xhost other machine to let programs on other
machines use your display see also under trouble shooting , and see
the section on xauth in the openwindows version 3 programmer 's guide ,
pp. 101ff)
see also console messages , under trouble shooting
fontpath where xnews searches for fonts
usr openwin lib fonts
(you can also use xset fp dir to add a directory to the font path ,
but you may have to do xset fp rehash afterwards. this is fine
under openwindows , but many x11 servers have font problems)
helppath where xview looks when you press the help key (or f1)
usr openwin lib locale usr openwin lib help
(on sunos 4.0. , or with openwindows 2.0 , omit the first entry , which
is for sites using a local other than c or usa ).
ld library path where to look to find shared c libraries
usr lib usr 5lib usr openwin lib usr cc `arch`
(the usr cc `arch` lib entry is only needed if you use c programs)
openwinhome where openwindows lives
usr openwin
keyboard , mouse serial devices to use instead of the console
(do n't set these for normal use dev kbd and dev mouse)
path where the shell searches for programs to run
(openwinhome) bin (openwinhome) bin xview usr local bin .
home bin.`arch` usr ucb usr bin usr bin x11 usr hosts
(you will certainly want to change this example ! there is no
(openwinhome) bin xview in openwindows 3.0)
xfilesearchpath where programs look for app defaults files
usr openwin lib t n s
(this is set automatically by openwin in openwindows 3.0)
you might want to use usr lib x11 t n s , or perhaps both ,
separated with a , for example (for sh users)
xfilesearchpath openwinhome lib t n s usr lib x11 t n s
export xfilesearchpath
if you use x11r5 , you might instead want
usr lib x11 l t n c s
usr lib x11 l t n c s
usr lib x11 t n c s
usr lib x11 l t n s
usr lib x11 l t n s
usr lib x11 t n s
openwinhome lib t n s
(put all this on one line , though , with no spaces ! )

together with the following in lib xinitrc
xrdb merge 'end xrdb'
customization
end xrdb

xrdb merge 'end xrdb'
ifdef color
customization color
endif
end xrdb

you automatically get a color oclock , editres , bitmap , xcalc , and
xlogo since they use the customization resource appearing as c in
the xfilesearchpath. (see oclock (n))
according to rainer sinkwitz sinkwitz@ifi.unizh.ch .


subject where can i get it \? ftp , implementations , etc...

xview 3.0 is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu and
elsewhere.

moolit can be bought from at t in source form.

openwindows can be obtained from sun , or you can get the source from
interactive systems inc. it is also included in some vendors' system v
release 4 implementations , although that 's not always the latest version.
the current release of openwindows from sun for supported architectures
is 3.0 for the sun 3 series it is frozen at openwindows 2.0.
note that sun includes openwindows with sunos , and it is also included as
the windowing system for solaris.

there are said (by sun) to be over 35 ports of openwindows either
available now or in progress. unfortunately , none of them seem to
be available from anywhere. contact anthony@ovi.com for more information.

there 's at least one book on using solaris (i.e. sunos).

sun also supplies a large amount of documentation with openwindows ,
although you may have to order it separately. here 's what i have they
are each a little over 21 cm square (wider than a4 paper) , and vary from
about 1 cm to about 3cm thick. they say `user 's guide' or `programmer 's
guide' on the front. the user manuals have a red stripe on the bottom ,
and the programmer ones have a green stripe.

800 6006 10 openwindows version 3 release manual
800 6029 10 openwindows version 3 installation and start up guide
800 6231 10 openwindows version 3 deskset reference guide

800 6198 10 xview 3.0 reference manual converting sunview applications

800 6854 10 f3 font format specification order separately

there are also some other sets of documentation , including the typescaler
documentation from the openfonts group , for example. there does n't seem
to be a complete list anywhere.

there might be documentation about the link manager somewhere , too.

at t includes several large thorny bushes' worth of paper with olit.

sun 's answerbook cd rom contains a lot of the above documentation ,
including some of the o'reilly books (not the xview 3 volume 7 , though).

volume 8 of the o'reilly series is about x administration , and mentions
openwindows , although it is primarily aimed at x11r5.

several other books are in the works...

help ,

i 've got an applications with a series of pushbuttons across
the top (a toolbar). i wanted to add eventhandlers to these
pushbuttons on enterwindowmask and leavewindowmask so that
i can put up some descriptive text about the function of each
pushbutton as the pointer crosses over it.

i 've done this fine , but i 've turned up the following problem

when the pushbuttons are sensitive i get callbacks on both of
the above events , but when they are not sensitive i only get
callbacks on leavewindow events. this seems odd. i would
expect this to be an all or nothing type of thing.

is this a bug \? if not , can someone explain this behavior \?

thanks ,

sorry , that 's a feature. the icccm specifies how the app should set its title , so the wm is obliged to do it. if this bothers you , complain to the app writer.

...who cares if it 's not 'nice' to the application

write your own wm that does n't support the icccm. or write an program that you give a window id and a title. the your program can set the windows title for the app and then if the app changes it , your program switches it back again.

lines 23


i have the task to program a x application for the first time and have some severe difficulties creating a window in which i can draw something.
unfortunately some basic books on the topic of x application programming are not available to me for the moment.

i am running a hp720 with hpux 8.07 , vue and x11r4 using xt anbd xaw.

what i did until now
i initialized the x intrinsics cxreating a top level widget with xtappinitialize. i passed as a application class name 'commandwidgetclass'.
then i set the argument values for window height and width using xtsetarg and
passed it to the toplevel widget with xtsetvalues.
when i call xtrealizewidget , i get a window of the specified size , but i have no idea how i can draw something in it.

can anybody send me some help and perhaps some basic information how to use the widgets \?
in which situation it is useful to use them and in which not \?

thanks very much in advance

after looking at the scaling code i realized the follwing

1) my problem with the resolution 100x100 foints is due to an installation
problem.

2) that the x server or font server will rescale the best font it can find
to meet your requirements.

this means that if you server return a response like the following

adobe helvetica medium o normal 0 0 75 75 p 0 iso8859 1

you can ask for the follwogin

adobe helvetica medium o normal 14 100 90 90 p 0 iso8859 1

and it will generate it for you. you should try to always use
known pixel sizes.

be supported. i already know of

wind u by bristol technologies

mainwin by mainsoft

are there any others \?

i will post a summary if it 's wanted.


i got a few requests asking for a summary , so i 'll attempt one
here


here 's the ones i know of

wind u bristol technologies

hunter sdk hunter systems

mainwin mainsoft

libwxm visual solutions


hunter

the company is going through some big changes. i expect
to eventually see the hunter sdk pop up with a new name. at the moment , it
is difficult to get phone calls returned and otherwise obtain info.
hopefully they will post something about themselves once things settle down.

visual solutions

libwxm is a product that i just heard about. they do n't
yet support mdi or mfc. libwxm was used to port vissim , a mathematical
modeling package. does native motif widgets , like wind u from bristol.
contact carrie lemieux at 508 392 0100 for more info. she 's very helpful.

mainsoft

this translates windows source to a unix executable that
can switch off between a windows or quasi motif look and feel at
runtime. they skip the xt and xm (motif) x toolkit levels and go
straight to xlib. they do n't yet support mfc. they 're at 415 896 0708.

bristol

this company that seems to be on the right track. wind u uses
xlib xt xm to give a real motif app. they seem to be doing the most work
in trying to support things like dde , common dialogs , and more on the horizon.
my contact there is knowledgeable , responds to my email , and wrote an example
program for me showing how to obtain x widgets from windows handles.
they 're at 203 438 6969 , or you can email info@bristol.com.

i am using xdm on x11r5 with ow3 and xview3 on sun3s and sparcs running
sunos 4.1.1. prior to using xdm , i used to set path and other environment
variables (like manpath , helppath , arch , etc) in my .login file. with xdm ,
the .login file does n't get executed and therefore neither the olwm
root window nor my applications know about these variables.

one usual suggestion is to put everything into your every time shell rc file
instead of your login only one , which is fair enough if you only have a few
users who know what they 're doing. if you have several hundred users who do
what the books tell them , though , then it 's confusing at best. another is to
have your xterms run login shells , but that still leaves the window manager
and the things that get started from its menus with the wrong environment.

our alternative is that instead of having xdm run the client startup scripts ,
it runs the user 's favourite shell as a login shell , and has it then run the
rest of the startup scripts. that way the user 's usual environment gets set
up as normal and inherited by everything. you can find an almost current copy
of our scripts and things in contrib edinburgh environment.tar.z , available
from the usual places.

(a.. john cwikla@morrison.wri (4620)

the problem is that we need solutions for applications now. and although
i would love to have most of the things mentioned here , somebody has to write
it.

what i 'd like to see is this scenario

each widget , view , whatever , describes it 's colors via a palette.
palettes can be shared and they only contain descriptive information.
they are not directly tied to the object that uses them. palettes are
held in the server. a palette can accomadate , up to , the number of
hardware color cells of color descriptors.

when the input focus is in a particular widget , that widget has access
to all of the colors that are described in its associated palette. all
other widgets , transiently , get the closest approximation that can be
generated by a union of the colors from the current palette and any free
colors that are left over.

a widget specifies a color for imaging by providing an index (pixel)
into its associated palette.

the bold part above is hard and would need to be done in the server.

and i'm having a little trouble with make imake. specifically , make bombs
when it needs to use any xaw file. this is n't surprising since x11 files
on suns with the standard ow 2.0 distribution are in various places under
usr openwin (xaw files are in usr openwin share include x11 xaw ! ! )
actually , the real problem is that i know squat about imake , and i do n't
know how to tell imake where the x11 files are. i can see from the
makefile that it 's looking in the wrong places , but the first line of the
makefile reads

makefile generated by imake do not edit !

help ! is there some way i can edit the imakefile to tell it where to
look \? (i have set defines dopenwin bug , as it said to in the readme
file.)

email and post are both fine.

thanks in advance ,

as quoted from 1993may13.212321.2563@moepi.do.open.de by bernward@moepi.do.open.de (bernward averwald)

back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i does n't
seem to be changed 'til now.
but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
xtappaddtimeout or similar .

the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous , though (see also desqview x ,
which does this in its dos windows). do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt \?

so what \? i'm running emu on a 25 mhz 68020 box. i cannot make out any
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not (if you think about it a bit , a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest pc). since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus , this
application is active anyway. to repeat it , a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance , it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software.

which is running an x terminal emulator (exceed w). the display can be set
to the gateway workstation with no problem but when i set the variable to

back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i does n't
seem to be changed 'til now.
but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
xtappaddtimeout or similar .

the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous , though (see also desqview x ,
which does this in its dos windows). do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt \?

most dos x servers are terribly slow to use in my experience and no , i guess
performance would be pretty bad. i believe the discussion is valid for an x
server on a decent workstation.

i have been using a hds x terminal , and really like it. what
is really powerful is that it can run the x server without
running a window manager. one can then run a special client
x program called a window manager , either (1) run
motif or openlook from it 's own firmware (limiting the network
traffic but having no home). or (2) run motif or openlook
from some home place (like a sparc , or vms).

this is powerful , especially since i can exit one window manager
(without killing windows) and then start up another manager.
(some of my vms tools need special meta mouse combos that work in
one manager and not the other).

well the question is

on a sparcstation running openlook , does anyone know how to
break apart olwm from the olwm slave program \? basically i
want to run only the server , and go somewhere else to run
the window manager.


please respond my e mail (as well as posting) because of the
large volumes in window.x)

the colormap element of setwinattrib must be a legitimate truecolor

and the inevitable caveat i usually use widgets , setting the visual

wrong. but , i think this is the general difficulty.

subject buying x terminals
organization technical university of nova scotia
lines 18

we are planning on buying 15 20 x terminals. i have the article from jim
morton regarding prices , etc. , and am looking for any other information
that will help me decide which to buy.

the terminals will be connected to a dec 3000 400 axp with 96mb ram ,
running osf 1. from what i have found out so far , it would be best to run
as much as possible in the terminal itself (x11 , window manager , xterm ,
etc.) , and that in order to do this we need n mb ram in the xterminal
(where n ranges from 4 to 10 , depending on who i talk to).

what should i be looking for \? what sort of questions should i be asking
the salespeople \?

thanks

i have the following problem on x11r5 servers.

when a window of my is obscured by a pop up window which has
the save under attribute set , the subwindows of my window are not restored.
normally , the subwindows are redrawn when the parent window gets an expose
event , but because the save under attribute is used for the pop up window
that obscured my window , no expose event is sent.

we had the same problem and on most of our machines it works if we use
backing store instead of save under.

i am having the problem of ensuring point to focus when the mouse
cursor enters a window in my application. i'm using interviews ,
but that may not matter , this seems to be a generic problem in x.
for example , i use openwindows on a sparc2 , with point to focus
set , and that generally works , but not always , depending on what
was going on in some window when i move the cursor from one shell
tool window to another. or so it seems...

my question , then , is what can i do within x to guarantee point to
focus within my application \? thanks for any response.

hello ,

i want to prevent the user from hitting cntl alt bkspc to exit x.

i 've tried invoking x with 'xinit t' , but that does n't work.
xinit appends the t to the call to .xinitrc , and not to the
call to x.

the man page to xinit is no help. in fact , it tells
me that xinit is a script when it is really a binary file.

so far , the only way i 've been able to accomplish this feat is
to add the t to the call to x in usr lpp x11 defaults xserverrc.
i would rather not do it this way. does anyone have any other ideas \?

i'm trying to turn on xauthorization using mit magic cookie on my servers

first , at least one of our applications (maple) does n't seem to understand

turned on.

second , we have people with client software on remote machines , and i
really do n't want to hassle them with having to copy their .xauthority
file to the remote machine... assuming that the clients there support
xauthorization.

so , what i would like to do is turn on mit magic cookie by default , with
non privileged users able to turn it off dropping back to host based
authorization.

(yes , i know how to turn it off by changing the xconfig file for the
heads and the client authorize setting for the xterminals , but
non privileged users ca n't do this.)

i 've checked with the hp support line , and there does n't appear to be a way.
can anyone confirm this , or do you know of a way to accomplish what i
want \?

it really bums me out that xv went shareware.

xv 's been shareware for about a year ... had n't you noticed \?
i do n't have a problem with this. john bradley has put a hell
of a lot of work into xv , and if he feels that it 's time to get
some monetary reward from it , that 's surely his right.

can the author legally sell xv \? xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed
by others. did the author get permission to sell these works \?

had you bothered to consult the distribution terms of the ijg jpeg
code (which are right there in the xv distribution) , you would have
observed that we specifically grant permission for use in shareware
and commercial software. sam leffler 's libtiff copyright also grants
permission for unrestricted use including resale.

my guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author
maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product ,

commercial \? there 's a big difference between a polite request
for a voluntary donation and commercial , it 's illegal to copy this
and we 'll sic our lawyers on you software.

i do agree that john 's readme file could be a little clearer about
what he means by personal use.

we have several vxt 2000 windowing terminals and associated software on our

we have customized the terminal security to allow all lat connections.

trying to invoke a lat x session from the vxt 2000 results in the following
message being displayed in the terminal manager window message area

host does not support x sessions

(the host is a vax4000 model 60 and does support x sessions)


opening a lat terminal window and logging into the server node , setting the
display variable as follows

set display create node lat transport lat

and then trying to create a decterm on the vxt as follows

create term decterm detach

fails and gives the following error message

dectermport failed to find language , xopendisplay( ) returned null
decw f cant open displ ca n't open display

the vxt 2000 is using its system defaults (ie. default font(s) , language , ...)
except for the security options to allow all connections and options enabling
lat protocol.

we have vt1200 windowing terminals and the above things were enough to allow
lat x sessions.

sunview command pw rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that
(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down or
(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both ! my question is , what
is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump 8 plane image data to

running on the same machine as the server \? or am i stuck with
xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...) \?

all help appreciated...thanks !

derek


the fastest way is to use an x server with shared memory extension. it uses
shared memory if it is a local x server (hence images do n't have to be duplicated) ,
and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension
is not available , or if it 's not the localhost.

made the offending call. is this safe \? do i have to
longjmp , or can i just return \?

badwindow is an x protocol error. if you write a custom error handler
which does not do exit(1) the error handler will return and let
your program carry on. so , using a xseterrorhandler is the way to
go , but never mind the longjmp.


3. register for destroynotify on all the windows returned from
xquerytree. ...

too hard....

hi all ,
this is the first time i 've posted to the net , so i hope this is
going to the right people.
i'm looking for software packages that run on an ibm pc clone that
allows me to display openlook and motif windows on the pc.
the idea is to use the pc as a cheap x windows terminal for use by
process engineers at work.

here 's a listing that i came accross a while ago. this question seems to
come up often enough that i figured this would be of interest. note that
the server x appeal for dos is available in demo form on the internet via
anonymous ftp. this is one way of quickly checking out the feasability of
using your system as an x server. enjoy !

this is a monthly guide of x servers that can be used on non unix
networked machines to display x clients running on unix machines. i
use the name unix loosely here. i know others can run x.

the sources for this information come from many places the faq for
comp.windows.x , blurbs and info packets from the vendors , user manuals
for the products themselves , conversations with sales representatives ,
personal experience , comp.windows.x articles , etc.

please forward any corrections or updates to the above address.

subject re blinking cursor in xterm \? \? \?

in article 1tbpi9innfp3@early bird.think.com barmar@think.com (barry margolin) writes
in article 1993may18.130845.6859@taylor.uucp mark@taylor.uucp (mark a. davis) writes
you are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop ! what if you are on an
xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine \? that is when the
load problems occur. if you had a machine with 20 xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm 's , this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste.

ethernet certainly has enough bandwidth for a few blinking cursors. my
lisp machine blinks the cursor twice a second and updates the time in the
status line every second. this uses under 1k bytes second , or about .1 of
the bandwidth of ethernet. a hundred of them on a single ethernet might be
a problem , but a couple dozen should be fine.

bandwidth is unlikely to be the problem , except over a wet string network.
one of major flaws of x is the horrendous number of transactions (and
hence process switches) that it forces upon a host. actual measurements
(hourly average) are 5 per second per logged in user , which can lead to
20 50 or more process switches (depending on whether each event is
filtered by the window manager as well as the applications and how
many processes are needed for each character.)

while a blinking cursor needs only the application and the networking
process , and does not add any transactions , it will add something like
10 process switches per second per user. this is a significant increase
in overhead , especially as the application may have quite a large working
set. if you want a rapidly blinking cursor , there could be as many
as 50.

if you want to go there , i would n't start from here !

bristol technology announces the availability of
its hyperhelp(tm) and xprinter(tm) demo for downloading.

this demo showcases the two products in the form of a
diagram editor called de.

download the demo and see some of these exciting features for yourself

o complete on line context sensitive help system.

o printing support for pcl5 and postscript.

o rotated text support !

o source code for the demo is provided.

the demo is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9).

there are two versions of the demo located in the vendor bristol directory
sun sun4.demo.tar.z (sunos 4.x)
hp hp700.tar.z (hp ux 8 9)

if you have any questions about the demo , send an
e mail to support@bristol.com.

if you want another version of the demo (rs6000 , etc...)
please send an e mail to info@bristol.com.

remember to use binary mode !


what are hyperhelp and xprinter \? read on......

bristol technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
its popular hyperhelp product and version 2.0 of xprinter.

hyperhelp 3.0

hyperhelp is the de facto standard for on line context
sensitive help in the unix marketplace. through a one
line function call , application developers can access the
full features of hyperhelp and cut down drastically on
their development time. hyperhelp can use the same rtf ,
project , and bitmap files as the ms windows help facility.
this allows a documentation department to maintain a single
set of help documents portable between ms windows , motif and
open look. hyperhelp can also be authored in framemaker.
and with hyperhelp 3.0 bristol introduces its sgml compiler !

new features in hyperhelp 3.0 include secondary windows , a character
based viewer , segmented bitmaps , sgml support , and an improved history
window.

xprinter 2.0

xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
printer support to their existing new x based applications
very easily. xprinter uses the xlib api for both the
display and printer. this lets you use the exact same code
for drawing and printing. take a look at the source code for
our demo and see xprinter in action.

if you are interested in adding postscript and pcl5 support
to your application , xprinter is the tool for you ! earlier
this year bristola dn usl signed an agreement that
resulted in xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
for unix svr4.2.


feel free to run the demo and let us know what you think about
hyperhelp and xprinter.

if you have any questions or comments , send them to us at
info@bristol.com or call us at (203) 438 6969.

happy demoing ,

organization loral instrumentation

lines 35

hi ,

i'm trying to get my program to monitor resize position events ,
so that when the program exits , i can save the last known geometry in
some sort of 'preferences' file.

i am adding an event handler for structurenotify to the toplevelshell

xtaddeventhandler(toplevel , structurenotifymask , false , configurecb , mydata)

this works fine , and my callback is called whenever the window is resized
or repositioned using the window manager (mwm).

however , when i'm just resizing the window , using any resize handle on the
window manager resize decoration , the x and y are set to zero in the
xevent passed to the event handler callback. i'm accessing the xconfigure
structure , like the x11 manual says. (xev xconfigure.x , xev xconfigure.y).
the width and height memebers are correct.

when i reposition the window , using the window manager , the xevent 's xconfigure
structure contains all the correct x , y , width , height member settings.

q1 anybody know why , when just resizing , the x and y are being set to zero \?

q2 any other way to handle detecting and saving geometry changes \?

i 've tried using xtgetvalues() on the toplevel widget when exiting my
application (before destroying any widgets) and all i get is garbage values
for the x , y , width , height resources.

thanks

i have a problem which many of you might have run into. we use lots of
ascii terminals and use them to the max. meaning lots of attributes , line

this means needing all attributes to work , including bold and line drawing.
the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in
which one is bold and the other normal , while both have linedraw , fixed
spacing , and several sizes.

the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 9x15 and 9x15b under
misc . they work great , except i need a font one size larger , 10x20. now
10x20 works well , but there is no bold counterpart !


you do n't need a 'bold' counterpart. from `man xterm`

fb font
this option specifies a font to be used when dis
playing bold text. this font must be the same
height and width as the normal font. if only one
of the normal or bold fonts is specified , it will
be used as the normal font and the bold font will
be produced by overstriking this font. the
default is to do overstriking of the normal font.

i have tried that with one font , if your xterm terminfos termcaps are set up
to not remap bold (which they are be default) to reverse , then nothing happens
when bold is displayed. it would appear (at least in x11r4) than you cannot
display bold in an xterm without specifying two fonts a normal and a bold.
i wish someone would prove that incorrect.

say that the shareware notice is unenforceable. all you need to do is
make minor changes to create a derivative work which is explicitly allowed
under the first part of the copyright notice. of course , this would be
circumventing the author 's wishes on the subject , but i 'd say if you 're
not going to pay him no matter what , you 'd be on relatively safe ground
with that approach... in fact , given the internal contradictions of the
copyright notices , i 'd guess none of it could ever be enforced , but not being
a lawyer , i ca n't be positive.

regardless , the fees he 's asking are not excessive , and i would encourage
anyone who wants to use the program to pay them if at all possible. even
though it is unlikely that you have actual legal obligations to pay the

distribution world
nntp posting host eedwsa.itwol.bhp.com.au
lines 27

i 've found a problem in the use of xlib functions regarding re entrancy. i
decided to implement an animated cursor (using 6 created cursors) by calling
xdefinecursor from a sig alrm signal handler. this is used to indicate we are
waiting for a operator request to complete. (on a production control system).
i was redrawing the screen underneath the animated cursor and then restoring
the standard cursor when complete. i found dumped core , and upon analysis
it was when the sig alrm handler was called during a xdrawstring call. xdrawstring
was doing a bcopy (presumably an internal structure) when the xdefinecursor
was called. presumably the (internal) structure that xdrawstring was manipulating
was not in a stable state and sent xdefinecursor to where it should n't have been.

has anyone else experienced this \? is there any official documentation that
says you should ensure this does n't happen \? or should bcopy() be atomic.
we are running on sgi irix 4.0.1 with x11r4.

yes. do n't confuse the mouse cursor with the text cursor in the xterms.
the latter is only controlled by the application.
back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i does n't
seem to be changed 'til now.
but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
xtappaddtimeout or similar .

xt(app)addtimeout does n't work in xterm , because , despite appearances
to the contrary , xterm is not really an xt based application. other
sources like timeouts and inputs are never checked in xterm 's main
loop. so do n't be surprised when you try this and it does n't work.

i 've been able to configure xterm so that i can type in accented characters.
i'm using x11r5 , with iso8859 fonts , my shell is tcsh with the following
definitions
setenv lc ctype iso 8859 1
stty pass8

then , i add the following in my .xdefaults file

xterm eightbitinput true
xterm eightbitoutput true

xterm vt100.translations override
meta key ' keymap(aigu) n
meta key ` keymap(grave) n
meta key keymap(circ) n
meta key , keymap(ced)
xterm vt100.aigukeymap.translations
shift key e string(0xe9) keymap(none) n
key e string(0xc9) keymap(none) n
shift key c string(0xe7) n
key c string(0xc7)
xterm vt100.gravekeymap.translations
shift key e string(0xe8) keymap(none) n
key e string(0xc8) keymap(none) n
shift key u string(0xf9) keymap(none) n
key u string(0xd9) keymap(none) n
shift key a string(0xe0) keymap(none) n
key a string(0xc0) keymap(none)
xterm vt100.circkeymap.translations
shift key e string(0xea) keymap(none) n
key e string(0xca) keymap(none) n
shift key u string(0xfb) keymap(none) n
key u string(0xdb) keymap(none) n
shift key i string(0xee) keymap(none) n
key i string(0xce) keymap(none) n
shift key o string(0xf4) keymap(none) n
key o string(0xd4) keymap(none)
xterm vt100.cedkeymap.translations
shift key c string(0xe7) keymap(none) n
key c string(0xc7) keymap(none)

this makes the meta ' , ` , keys behave as dead keys.

of course , this only works for xterm. for emacs , my solution is to install the
lucid version of gnuemacs 19 , and to load the x compose library.


hope this helps ,

subject x screen saver
organization comdisco systems inc.
lines 15


hi !

i have a question which is not directly related to x screen saver.

what x screen saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
some time. i do n't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
xlock program.

is there a parallel call to xsetscreensaver() which locks my screen
or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time \? or is there a
way to find out how long the server has been idle \?

thanks

hello ,


our application requires us to capture keypad presses for all windows
in a number of applications. we are trying to use action translation
tables to implement this. we have only succeeded by assigning the
translation table to every individual widget in all windows in a single
application. the xt calls we make are included below.

it would be much more convenient if we could assign the translation
table to a class of widgets rather than individual widget instantiations ,
and also accomplish it for multiple applications. if someone could
describe how do this it would be greatly appreciated.

...why did x designers decide to not associate
the color with the object being drawn , and instead associate it with the
display it is being drawn on \?

in x10 , the drawing attributes were bundled into drawing
requests that is , the server 's drawing model was stateless.

this caused problems with performance and network traffic ,
so the x11 redesign included the graphic context to codify
the drawing state. most application designers who want to
draw things in several different colors create a gc for
each color during initialization , then pass the gc id in
each drawing request.

in the 1986 acm transactions on graphics.

hi all ,
this is the first time i 've posted to the net , so i hope this is
going to the right people.
i'm looking for software packages that run on an ibm pc clone that
allows me to display openlook and motif windows on the pc.
the idea is to use the pc as a cheap x windows terminal for use by
process engineers at work.

if anyone can e mail me any recommended packages horror stories etc
i would be greatful.

subject axe 5.0 is available
organization computing laboratory , u of newcastle upon tyne , uk ne17ru
lines 89
nntp posting host enterpoop.mit.edu
to xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu

i have placed a new release of my axe editor in axe 5.0.tar.z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

the significant change this time , and the justification for the hike
in the major version number , is

o undo has been implemented.

by default only the last change can be undone , but a resource is
provided to allow the user to specify how many , including unlimited ,
levels of undo information should be kept. also , undo of undo is
supported.

there is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be emaxe 19 )



for those who have not encountered axe before here is a summary of
what it is all about

axe is a simple to use text editor for x that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. also built around the athena text widget it
features , amongst other things ,

o multiple windows
o multiple buffers
o default menu interface
o optional button interface , with choice and layout of buttons
under user control
o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
o provision for defining a keyboard macro
o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
o file selection via a browser
o knowledge of line numbers
o parenthesis matching
o regular expression searching
o restricted or unlimited undo
o ability to change font
o easy entry of control codes
o xterm like keymap feature
o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
o both brief and comprehensive on line help
o server mode with cooperating client programs
o optional extension language using tcl
o optional xaw3d widget set compatability
o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of axe

i have personally built and run core axe , i.e. without the tcl and
xaw3d options , on the following systems

sun sparc sunos 4.1.x mit x11r5
sun sparc sunos 5.1 mit x11r5
encore multimax umax 4.3 mit x11r5
dec 5000 120 ultrix 4.2 mit x11r5
hp 9000 710 hp ux 8.07 mit x11r5
mac iici au x 3.0 mit x11r5

but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. i have
only tested the tcl and xaw3d options on the first.

a number of ' ifdef sysv' isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

although axe will probably build under r4 run time problems have been
encountered in the past. i have not bothered to try this version under
r4 , and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems. therefore , if you are at r4 you very much take pot luck. if
it does n't work the only alternative is to try the last release ,
2.1.1 , of version 2 which should still be around. it does n't have as
many features and uses the widget creation library (wcl). not only
that , it requires an old version of wcl , 1.06 or 1.05. version 3 of
axe was nearing completion when version 2 of wcl came out so axe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

axe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially , and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites. check your nearest using
xarchie.

if you ca n't ftp , try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word help alone in your message body. you will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

i tried to send this as private mail , but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was

same here


here is an extract from the readme file that comes with macx

users of remote commands with sun machines may find that their remote commands
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the sun machine. this is due
to a feature of the sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from
requesting machines that are not known to the sun s network address ( etc hosts
or nis hosts) database. to successfully use remote commands with a sunos based
machine , there must be an entry in the network address database for the
macintosh which is running macx.


i received similar information advice about what appears to be the same problem
benjamin has (and i still have).
nis has all the information about the macs
(i even put explicit entries in etc hosts to no avail).
monitoring with 'snoop' on my classic , the initial rexec packet is sent to
the the sun , which sends something to the correct mac , but nothing appears
at the mac.
'rexecd' is number one suspect , but it 's more suble than the readme suggests and
i have n't yet looked into it further.

i am almost done porting xfree86 1.2 to a new piece of display
hardware , but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat
commonplace , so i'm sending a net feeler.

i have a display that is a non interlaced , memory mapped , 1 bit
720x280 display. the server 's view of the world , (obtained via xwd
xwud) , seems to be exactly what it should be. however , the displayed
version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is
using scanlines that are too long. after a bit of experimentation , it
seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to
a word boundry , but the scanline size in the buffer is 90 bytes , which
is n't exactly divisible by four. changing the following defines in
mit server include servermd.h



define bitmap scanline pad 32
define log2 bitmap pad 5
define log2 bytes per scanline pad 2



to



define bitmap scanline pad 16
define log2 bitmap pad 4
define log2 bytes per scanline pad 2



was not exactly the right solution. how do i tell the server either
(a) do n't pad the scan lines at all ('cause this server is only being
built to run on this particular display) , or to pad only to byte
boundries \?

i'm using a customized version of xfree86v1.2 , under mach 3.0.

who has called xtmovewidget() , immediately checking the x , y after the move

and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border.

any help would be most appreciated.

darcy
darcy mccallum@mentorg.com

i have done this before , but i'm not sure i used the best approach (although
i tried several methods...).

you have to run up the window heirarchy (using xquerytree()) until you get
to the root window. now , this is not so simple because some window managers
slap a window over the root window that is the same size as the root window ,
so be sure to take that into account for further calculations.

calculate the position and width height offsets for each window using
xgetgeometry(). be sure to take the border width into consideration.
remember a windows border width is on the outside of a window , so the
windows x , y , width , height must be adjusted accordingly.

all of this should give you pretty good numbers for how much space the
window manager is using.

now , to place the new window , you have to use the same numbers to calculate
where you want to place it , because the window manager will re parent it on
the outside of where you place your window (if i remember correctly).

disclaimer all of this is from memory , and i no longer have the code. but
i did get it working under several window managers correctly. feel free to
call or e mail for further info.

i have a problem i am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes.
... gave badmatch error on the createwindow request.

as far as i can tell from the manual , the only attribute which may give
a badmatch , is the colormap , if it belongs to a wrong visual. but the
visual was correctly matched

i got several answers , the most complete was from errol crary
(errolc@tv.tv.tek.com)
i have just looked at the r4 server listings (... mit server dix window.c )
and there are several ways in which you can get a badmatch error , even
though my o'reilly book only says borderwidth is nonzero for inputonly .

1 if ((class inputonly) ((bw ! 0) (depth ! 0)))


2 find out if the depth and visual are acceptable for this screen


3 if (((vmask (cwborderpixmap cwborderpixel)) 0)
(class ! inputonly)
(depth ! pparent drawable.depth))


4 if (((vmask cwcolormap) 0)
(class ! inputonly)
((visual ! ancwopt visual) (ancwopt colormap none)))


so ,
case 1 is inputonly which is not your case it seems to be the
o'reilly case.
case 2 should not be the case since you got the visual for the screen.
case 3 looks suspicious you are giving no cwborder... in the attribute
mask , and since the visual is not the parent depth , i would suspect you
need to supply a border pixel from the new colormap you are going to use
for this window.
case 4 does not seem to be the problem since you do supply the cwcolormap
in the attributes.

thanks for your help

back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i does n't
seem to be changed 'til now.
but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
xtappaddtimeout or similar .

the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous , though (see also desqview x ,
which does this in its dos windows). do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt \?

the sun 4 5 keyboard and the numlock plus various alt meta etc. modifier
requirements.

that 's not all it says. the coverage of modifiers is in chapter 8
of volume four (or chap 7 in older athena editions) , where there is about
10 pages on how to specify translations to capture
various combinations of keys or buttons.

the xlib route uses xlookupstring and there is a lot of coverage
of how that works in volume one , chapter 9. you should read this

i use it all day every day (maintaining our ftp site and answering mail

manager instability. (of course , i 've crashed my machine quite a few times

portion is quite stable...)

however , keep in mind that dvx and the network managers are only going
to be as stable as the software they sit on top of (so if your underlying
network kernel is flakey , you ca n't expect dvx to be terribly stable...)

2) how does it send the information from a ms windows app over
the x11 protocol \? does it just draw everything as graphics into
one window , or does it use multiple windows and essentially work
more cleverly \?

it just goes as a window that has graphics drawn into it. (to vastly
over simplify what goes on , we just take the windows graphics api calls ,
and translate them directly to x protocol unfortunately , windows was
not really written to be network aware , so sometimes we see a speed
penalty when an app does something stupid , like sending a big white bitmap
to erase something rather than just drawing a white box fortunately ,
that sort of thing is rare...)

3) if i want to run ms word , for example , remotely , do i have to
run a separate copy of ms windows remotely , and then start ms
word from that , or can ms word be started remotely on its own \?

you need to run ms windows , which word then runs inside. you could run
multiple windows programs within the one winx window , and windows has
ways to automagically start winapps when you start windows , so in practice
it 's not really a major problem. i have my system set up so that i can
run winx , which automatically starts word full screen (for windows) , so
i never see any part of windows but word...)

yes , that is a bug in the x11r5 port of xterm. you sometimes get this when
you start from xdm. i have reported this to casper but do n't know whether
it made it into his set of patches yet.

basically in mit clients xterm main.c , there is a test at line 1598 which
checks errno after attempting to open dev tty. add the errno einval
case to it and you should be fine.

it 's actually a bug in the solaris 2.1 kernel. we could add a workaround to
xterm. open should never return einval , but it does (

i did n't have time to update the r5.sunos5 patch lately , but non

evolution of sco newsgroups and mailing lists


many readers enjoyed the opportunity to obtain and contribute useful
information on sco open desktop since 1990 through the ancestral usenet
newsgroup sco.opendesktop or it 's companion mailing list. similarly ,
there was a demonstrated need for an information and discussion forum
for sco products in general.

with the increasing demand for accessibility and for additional sco
newsgroups , many current contributors including those who have been
active in circulating sco related newsgroups and mailing lists felt
that the readership would be best served by creating a biz.sco.
hierarchy to improve propagation (and hence availability) worldwide.

biz.sco. opendesktop , general , announce were newgrouped may 1 , 1991 in
accordance with accepted procedure within biz . given the content ,
this change relocated the opendesktop newsgroup to a more proper place
within the established usenet news hierarchy and adds the new announce
and general groups. on aug 1 , 1991 , the former sco list@uunet.uu.net
became scogen in keeping with established biz.sco. naming conventions.

biz.sco.binaries and biz.sco.sources were newgrouped on june 1 , 1992
to respectively accommodate sco xenix , unix and opendesktop specific
binaries and source code. the binaries and sources news groups are
moderated , with moderator and submissions information and policy
outlined in the periodic imformational postings in those newsgroups.
respecting usenet etiquite , these newsgroups are not gated to
mailing lists , but are archived on several nuucp and ftp hosts.

biz.sco.magazine was newgrouped dec 14 , 1992 , to provide a discussion
area for the readers , writers and publishers of sco magazine.

subject to the usenet news hierarchies carried by your upstream feed ,
you are now able to subscribe to the following

newsgroup mailing list subscription

biz.sco.opendesktop scoodt request@xenitec.on.ca
biz.sco.general scogen request@xenitec.on.ca
biz.sco.announce scoann request@xenitec.on.ca
biz.sco.sources none
biz.sco.binaries none
biz.sco.magazine scomag request@xenitec.on.ca

you are strongly encouraged to obtain these newsgroups via usenet
news mechanisms vrs mail. anyone having difficulty arranging a news
feed for these newsgroups is welcome to email the undersigned and
i 'll do my best to help. we also offer all required software in
source code form via anonymous ftp and uucp , as do many archive sites.
if , after having explored all options , you are still unable to receive
biz.sco. as news , you may subscribe to the mailing lists.

the 4 discussion newsgroups are bi directionally gated to companion
mailing lists , so anyone not having access to news but who does have a
uucp or internet mail feed can still participate fully using email.
mailing list subscribers should send their request to the appropriate
mailing list subscription address above , including in the message body

add subscriber address eg
add your logname@site.do.main or
add up ! stream ! yoursite ! your logname

inclusion of an alternative working bang path relative to a well know
major functional site might prove beneficial. deletions are handled
the same way , simply substitute delete for add , ensuring that
you use the exact same address you subscribed with. mailing list
subscribers receive how to post to the mlist article submission
information when their request is processed. if you do n't receive
an acknowledgement within a few days , check your routing and try a test
message via xenitec.on.ca back to your host. in such cases , it 's likely
that someone , somewhere , is bouncing mail replies to you (and would do
the same with mailing list traffic) , and you 'll want to resolve your
connectivity problem before trying to subscribe again. mailing list
subscriptions are free , subject to whatever arrangements you may have
with the site(s) feeding you.

should you receive no response or experience a sudden and prolonged
drop to zero volume on one of the mailing lists , this indicates that we
are no longer able to find a working route to your site. we loose a
handful of subscribers this way each month. if this happens to you ,
please email us your known working bang path relative to a major site.

what 's in the newsgroups (and mailing lists where applicable)

biz.sco.opendesktop technical questions and answers and informative
postings relating to past , present , and future
implementations of the sco opendesktop operating
environment and it 's various bundled components.

biz.sco.general questions , answers and comments on sco products
in general , and of course resulting discussions.

biz.sco.announce sco and sco developer product announcements of
interest to current and future users of sco products ,
and to sco developers , resellers and distributors.
(moderated , followups directed to biz.sco.general).

biz.sco.sources sysv or bsd source code for useful programs and
utilities , modified to compile and run with various
incarnations of sco xenix , unix , and or opendesktop.

biz.sco.binaries binary packages compiled from sco compatible source
code , often from source posted in biz.sco.sources
and often installable using the sco custom utility.

biz.sco.magazine interaction between the sco magazine readers ,
writers and publishers.

you should always endeavour to post your article to the most applicable
newsgroup. for example , posting your odt question to the general
newsgroup will preclude your question and answers to it from being
saved in the public odt archives. appropriate crossposting is allowed.

the undersigned is solely responsible for administration of the biz.sco
namespace. suggestions for additional biz.sco. newsgroups and or
mailing lists should be emailed to the address below.

subject xdm , xkernel , and olwm
lines 33
organization tufts university medford , ma

greetings ,
we have a network of 20 sun workstations , running sunos 4.1.1
and openwindows 3. 7 of these are sun 3 's that we have modified to
run seth robertson 's xkernel image , effectively turning them into
xterminals. we use xdm (x11r4) to manage the displays.

when we had 3 xkernel machines , things worked fine , but when
we installed 4 more last weekend , we appear to have found a weakness.
with 7 clients to 1 sparc 2 , the sparc 2 window manager is eventually
getting munged.

let me try to be precise the user sitting at the machine
that does all the actual processing for these xterminals is having
control of his keyboard and screen yanked away. (when this was the
department chair , it was kind of cute). we poked at xdm for a few
days and are satisfied that it is not at fault. our current theory is
that olwm (the sun version) was not meant for running multiple copies
on one machine (which is what happens the console user runs olwm ,
and every xterminal logged in has olwm running on the xterminal
server).

has anyone had any prior experience with this sort of behavior \?
can anyone shoot obvious holes in this theory \?
how about obvious gimmes \?
and , of course , any ideas on how to solve it \?

any ideas are greatly appreciated.

does anyone out there know of a way to have a unix machine automatically
set it 's display variable to that of the xterm you 're using when it 's

the best i 've been able to come up with has been a rather convoluted

andrew inman , consultant , itd consulting and support services
ainman@umich.edu university of michigan


from my own notes on this subject....

methods to automatically passwd authorization from one machine to another.
this also includes the problem of notifing the remote host of the current
display that is being used.

1 use rsh rexec on... (the method in the xauth manual)
set up the your .rhosts file in the home directory on the remote
machine so that a password in not required to remotly execute commands.

xauth extract display rsh other xauth merge

this method is also used by xrsh to pass authorization. my vampire
program also uses a variation , however i wrap it as part of the remote
command sequence (eg xauth add auth)

included in this method is the use of `xrlogin' and `xrsh' to do
this job for you. these programs usally (the newer ones that is) allow
you to pass a secified list of environment variables which includes
the `display' and or a copy of the authorization code required.

the `xon' program available (if enabled) on sun machines will also
pass environment variables , as well as the current directory. you will
however be required to store the authority in such a variable for
passing. unless you are also have shared home directories.

warning environment variables and command line arguments are visible
in `ps' listing with the appropiate flags. as such passing authorization
information in environment variables or as arguments is not recomended.
the recommended method as given in the manual (shown above) is safe from
the view of other users.

2 wrap it as part of the term environment variable.
this method uses the fact that most remote command executors do pass
the term environment variable to the remote host. it is then a matter of
an appropiate script in your remote .login file to extract the information
from the term environment variable and set up things appropiatly.
a version of the xrlogin script is available on the network which does
this. basically you change the term environment variable before the
actual call to rlogin is performed , to include your display and your
authorization.
on the remote machine you then extract this information and return the
term environment variable to normal before you use it for reseting or
stty'ing your terminal.

3 nfs.
write it to a file on a shared nfs partition you have access to.
note that if the home directories are nfs mounted , then authorization
is automatically passed , hoever you will still have to pass your
display environment variable via a file or other means. ie

login host echo display .x11host
remote host setenv display `cat .x11host`

4 finger for the info in a .plan file
this involves encrypting the information into your `.plan' or
`.project' and having the remote machine finger for the information.
this has the disadvantage of having the information to anyone fingering
the user. thus requiring a encryption method that is uniq to each
individual. ie the method of decyrption must not be shared or known
by others , nor should it be easy to determine.
a improvment is to use the `who fingered me' technique to only give
the information only to your own remote accounts and not just to anyone
who is asking.
this last method was developed last year by a second year here , untill
i explained to him the need for the encryption , at which point he gave
up this method. it is however a valid method. it is easer than (2) but
less secure.

is over 80000 xstones.....



i'm running linux and xfree86 on a 33mhz 486dx with 4mb of ram (8mb swap) and
it runs just fine. its a lot better than some of the crappy old xterminals
in the labs at school anyway.


you will not come even close to the performance of an xp10 series , plus you

excuse me , but with a 486 50 256k cache , s3 928 isa card , 8mb xs3 (x11r5) running 386bsd you can get 100k xstones at 1024x768 65mhz which i doubt
that your xp10 series gets. commerical verions x servers for s3 928 cards
can get 136k xstones. so the performance is there and additionally since
is running unix multiple users can use the system which i have done in
my home setup.

maintenance is minimal if you can read readme files for the x servers and
for 386bsd.

hi there

(i posted this to comp.windows.x.intrinsics but got no response , so i'm posting
here.)

i'm wanting to connect a digitiser made for pcs into my workstation (an hp 720).
it is my understanding the x windows can understand a variety of input devices
including digitiser tablets. however , this digitiser makes use of the serial
port , so there would seem to be a need to have a special device driver.

the hp manual pages say that the hp x server will accept x input from
devices listed in the usr lib x11 x devices file ( display number).
i should n't think i would be able to simply insert dev rs232c as an input
device in this file and expect a digitiser to work. but maybe i'm wrong. am i \?

what i would like to know is does anybody out there have a digitiser connected
to their workstation for use as a pointer for x (rather than just as input to a
specific x application) \? if so , what were the steps required for installation \?
did you need a special device driver \? did the manufacturer supply it \? are
there generic public domain device drivers around \? (i understand that
digitisers generally use only a couple of standard formats.)

any help would be greatly appreciated.

hi !

personally , i like nextstep very much. even more when i realise how much a
burden ordinary x or windows programming is. i also like objective c better
than i like c .

but , sometimes the restrictions are there. for instance it sometimes has to be
ms windows or x. now i'm looking for pointers to tools on those environments
that come close to nextstep , the appkit etc. also , environs that support rapid
prototyping (like with ib) without producing spaghetti code as soon as you want
to do real work.

maybe stepstone with some windows version of a kit of ui objects \? interviews
(what it is exactly , i do n't know. i kind of lost touch with that world when i
started with nextstep.)

most graphics systems i have seen have drawing routines that also specify
a color for drawing , like

drawpoint(x , y , color) or drawline(x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , color) or
fillrectangle(x1 , y1 , x2 , y2 , color)

with x , i have to do something like
xsetforeground(current color)
xdrawpoint(d , w , x , y)

why split this into two functions \? why did x designers decide to not associate
the color with the object being drawn , and instead associate it with the
display it is being drawn on \?

for flexibility. anyway , what you say is not really true. the color information
is associated with a graphicscontext , not with a display , and the gc is
a parameter to the drawing routines.

so , if you need to fast switch between green dotted lines and blue ones of
width 2 , you can make 2 gcs for those cases and then simply do

xdrawline(dpy , win , gc red , x1 , y1 , x2 , y2)
xdrawline(dpy , win , gc blue , x3 , y3 , x4 , y4)

for this effect.

this is eventually more complicated to do for the programmer , but also much
more efficient and flexible. you would not include all the other parameters
like line pattern , with , cap and joinstyle , drawmode and so on in every
drawing call , so why do it for color \? btw , stay away from xdrawpoint()
if you do n't really need it (to draw random points) , for image transfers
there are image routines.

we are making a transition from nextstep to x windows. i am trying to find the best gui tool for our needs. i have looked at several tools but they all seem basically the same (each salesman will beg to differ). i realize that there are differences but i do n't have an infinate amount of time to discover what they are. the tools i have looked at so far are uim x , x designer , tele use , tcl tk , interviews , and suit.
so far i 've drawn the following conclusions

1) the builder for interviews is not very mature , bad docs
2) tele use is very expensive and uses a proprietary toolkit
3) uim x x designer seem about the same , even though x designer does not have a interpreter (i 'll by centerline if i need one)
4) tcl tk is a little buggy
5) i know very little about the ics builder (just have the sales info)
6) due to a corporate agreement x designer is much cheeper than any other comercial product.
7) for the time i'm spending i could have bought all of them (well different money)
8) we will have to live with any shortcomings and make it work
9) this type of tool seems great , but noone seems to talk about them on the net. is there another news group for this \?
10) suit cost too much for comercial development.

i'm hoping someone out there has a strong opinion on at least one of these products.

x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl6


i am looking for a program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my linux
system.

it must be free.
it must run on standard (monochrome) x with a small screen size (800x600)
no motif openlook etc.
it must compile under linux with gcc g . most generic unix software
works ok.
it must produce postscript files that i can include into latex documents
with dvips. or just tell me another free program that converts one
of the supported formats to ps.
it must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).

i know of several such programs , idraw , xfig. tgif. i have
no experience with any of them. features i would like in the programs are.

ability to draw circles , arcs , straight lines , boxes and arrows.
support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.
support for texts in any size.
ability to move copy resize rotate any part of the drawing.
ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
(e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines , an arrow and a circle)
any aid (numeric coordinates , screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.
less essential , but in fact very handy preservation of connection.
if i move one part of the drawing , the lines that connect that part to the
rest of the drawing , stay connected.

ideally i want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics , flow charts , logic diagrams , data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it.

i just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs \? how demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space , memory and cpu usage \? are any of the programs
known to work on linux with monochrome x \?

subject painting with increasing resolution
lines 40

some people working a few cubes over have come up with this need , and
it seems that someone out there just might have done it already , and
can point me to some tools that would help. what they 'd like to do is
given a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either the
data is arriving over a slow link , or the display is across a slow
link) , they would like to first paint a low resolution version of the
picture , and then repaint it in higher resolution. thus , the picture
might first be generated in 1 4 resolution , with each 4x4 square of
pixels being filled in with a single color. next , each 4x4 square
would be replaced by 4 2x2 squares finally the 1x1 version would be
painted.

since one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side
of a slow link , the low res version obviously would n't be transmitted
as a bitmap that would n't help at all. instead , there would have to
be a process on the far end that receives the low res picture as a
small bitmap , and blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the
magnifier programs do). this brings up the question of whether the x
server can help. that is , when a window is opened , is there a way to
ask that a filter program be run to process the pixels \? or is the
only way to use something like rsh to start up a remote process
( permission denied ) , and have it open a local window \?

it seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts up
such a program remotely , and then accepts bitmaps , compressing each
one by some amount , and sending them to the remote program to expand.
but if there is something that x itself can do to help , it 's be nice
to hear about it. (i looked in several fms , but if it 's there , i
obviously do n't know the keywords ). if someone has a nifty tool
available that packages it all , we might want to get a copy.

oh , yes this is to run on some suns. part of the idea is to build
demos that can show such things as if this were run across , say , a
4800 bps link , this is how fast the pictures would appear. then the
customer would get a feel for the speed that they need to pay for.


if the auto industry were like the computer industry , a car would now
cost 5 , would get 5000 miles to the gallon , and at random times would
explode , killing all its passengers.

what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls \? i am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running
dv x is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response
time. anyone have any ideas \? \?

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network
itself. to give you a real world example , here at quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , novell
file servers , and each other. it 's not too much of a load on our
ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators , so you have 20 30 people on each
segment). if you had a badly loaded net , or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive , you could run into some slowdowns.

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself. say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. if you have
10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some slowdowns
because you 're now on (effectively) a 3.3 mhz 486. of course , dvx will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice , but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it.


well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the
significant drop in price year after year. the link i want to use
though (isdn 64k) is costly and the bandwidth limited. that 's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic
goes through it.

since i do n't think tom always gets time to read this group , i 'll take the
liberty of responding to some of this. if you really want tom to reply
you should send mail to support@qdeck.com.

a 64k line is certainly going to restrict you far more than the 10mbps
ethernet that we typically run. how restrictive it will be depends on
what you run and how you run it. i would think that a couple of instances
of some really nasty program like smoking clover would make the link
useless for anyone else. on the other hand , probably 50 xclocks quietly
updating every 10 seconds or so would n't impact it too much. in the real
world , you will be somewhere in between these two extremes.

going by the way i personally use x on a daily basis , i would n't want to have
to share that 64k link with more than 3 4 other people.

having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing) , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).

hmmm. has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all \? are you
running any standard ms windows programs like word \? what sort of
packets go blazing through \? what size link do you have (2mb or 10mb \? ).
what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points \?

our corporate wan is as unique as any other. the usage patterns are not very
good predictors of how yours will behave. the only one of our low bandwidth
links that normally get used in this way is a 56k link to ireland that they
often use to run a dos text based client end of a client server database
remotely from the dvx machine behind me. since the server end is (or was) always
at this end (california) it is faster to remotely run the client via desqview
x and have a short hop to the server than running the client locally and having
a long hop to the server. as i warned you , this tells us very little about
how you usage pattern will fill a 64k isdn link.

running word for windows remotely is going to itself be very usage dependent.
let 's break it into pieces and look at it. tracking the mouse pointer is easy
and efficient to translate from windows calls into x. popping up a menu is a
little more involved and will generate some traffic. restoring the screen
that was covered by that menu may be easy and may not be. does the server
that it 's displaying on have backing store \? if so and the server had enough
memory the display can be updated locally and will generate little network
traffic. if no backing store , then what was being covered up \? if it was a
solid colored rectangle of space we can tell your xserver to draw that quite
easily. if it was a full color backdrop of ren stimpy we may have to send
it back to the x server bit by bit. dvx will do its level best to only redraw
that small area , but in some unusual cases the entire screen may need to be
repainted. assuning a 1024x768 screen with 4 bits per pixel that 's 3145728 bits
that has to be sent. worst possible case you 're looking at about 50 seconds.
in reality it would never be this bad since the screen will always have parts
that will be tranlatable into higher level x calls.



it all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you 're going
to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)


what do you mean by network things \? i vision using ms windows and other
windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all i am getting are the displays. i am wondering how
good is the x and subsequently dv x protocol in transferring these
images with x calls and displaying them on a client 's machine.

x was designed from the ground up to be efficient across a network. it 's
pretty good for this. x programs are best , dos text programs are almost
as good (since we conert them to x easily). something like winx is a hybrid.
we intercept the calls windows makes to it 's graphics driver mouse driver
keyboard driver and convert them to x. the calls windows is making are in
no way designed to be efficient on a packet switched network. we go to a
lot of trouble to convert them to the highes level xlib calls we can , but
we are somewhat limited because we only know what windows and its applications
tell us.

above 127 to print out , but they are not where i 'd expect them for example ,
alt v does not produce a u umlaut. this leads me to believe that the fault

i am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than x drawing
routines to accomplish this. specifically , the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult , and certainly time consuming , if i have

how can i capture buttonpress buttonrelease events in multiple clients \?
i want to know if the user is still at the display before locking the screen.
i can get keypress keyrelease and pointer motion events , but if the user
is pressing the mouse button in the same location (the mouse does n't move)
i ca n't capture the events.

the o'reilly xlib programming manual (vol. 1) says on page 252
only one client can select button events on any one window at one time ,
due to the grab that automatically takes place.

any help would be appreciated.

eps is plain postscript. it is only wrapped by some comments and stripped
of any dubious commands for compatibility. you can simply do

!

save gsave
showpage def

include eps file here

grestore restore

showpage

end of file

and this way show it on it 's natural page position and size.

programs may use the boundingbox comment in the eps file to do
arbitrary scale , rotate and translate to include it in more complicated
ways than above.

nntp posting host spcsun18.bbn.com

i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif , but i'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part. does anyone know anything about
this problem........

i am using an xmtextfield , and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded
text string (ascii or kanji) either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring.
the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed , the text is getting
truncated , depending on the setting of the environment variables
lang (more specifically lc all). when they are set to japanese ,
the text gets truncated. when they are set to english , everything
works fine. i am taking the default for xmncolumns.
(please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual
application , just in my sample code to make things easier)

i am running motif 1.2 , x11r5 via hpux9.01. my test program is set up
to handle 16 bit kanji characters. i have remembered to do
xtsetlanguageproc() prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources
are set to japanese fonts.

do n't know if this matters , but my dialog box and textfield is initially
created with uil.


the problem does not happen with xmtext. unfortunately substituting
xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable
alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta ! )

i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
wants it. my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not
properly allocating memory for japanese , but since i do n't have the
source to look at it is just a guess.

please let me know if this sounds familiar , or if you have a suggestion ,
or if you want the sample program.

the only directory i know of that lists commercial and non commercial
widgets is the ics widget data book. ics sells the widgets for various
prices. there are also some public domain widgets in the delivery.

the ics widget databook is a subscription kind of thing , where
you pay some nominal fee , get a cd with the widgets and then you
can use the public domain widgets freely , and selectively activate
widgets which you want to purchase the right to use from them.
the nice thing about this is that you can purchase whole sets of widgets
such as those used in dataviews. i dont know there pricing schemes
but it is often better to buy than to redevelop the more complex
widgets , especially if you only one customer to distribute to.

this is the extent that i know about them except that i got their
databook catalog and it looked impressive (lots o' widgets there)

i dont work for ics or have any widgets being sold by them.
hope this helps you.

as i announced at the x technical conference in january , i would like
to
make imake tex , the imake support for using the tex typesetting system ,
publically available. currently imake tex is in beta test here at the
computer science department of dortmund university , and i am looking
for
some more beta testers , preferably with different tex and imake
installations.

judging from the responses so far , i have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that imake tex is not for installing tex , but for
using it. with imake tex , you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex , bibtex). simply
type make and your document 's dvi file will be up to date. all you have
to do is to write a simple imakefile and let imake generate a suitable
makefile for you. here is such an imakefile

include tex.tmpl
paperformata4()
simplelatextarget(document)

the generated makefile provides the following commands

make depend searching the tex source files for dependencies like
input somefile

make dvi generate an up to date dvi file

make viewdvi display it on your screen

make ps generate a postscript version of your document

make viewps display it

make clean remove unnecessary things

make veryclean remove even the dvi file

make makefiles generate makefiles in subdirectories


if ...

a) ...this seems attractive to you ,
b) ...you are willing to test imake tex and send me a short test report ,
c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary english documentation
(however , the german version is completed and included) ,

then you are invited as a beta tester. i am looking forward to your e mail.

for that error message xsun gives me upon startup. it says

but still complains about the font. i have symlinks from usr lib to the

try to run xsun under truss(1).

the best way to do this is by logging in over the network
and typing

this will give you and idea of where xsun things the fonts should be.

if you have defined a project root and done a make install , everything
should have gone right by default , even without symbolic links.

how to maximize the performance of x monthly posting

compiled by art mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

more ram , faster cpu 's , more disk space , faster ethernet... these
are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
performance of your workstation.

well , more hardware is n't always an option , and i wonder if more
hardware is always even a necessity.

this faq list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from x
windows on your workstation , without purchasing more hardware.

performance is a highly subjective issue. the individual user must
balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
decision. therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

this document is specifically concerned with x. there are of course
many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
however , they are outside the scope of this document.

people seriously interested in the whole area of system
performance , might want to look at the o'reilly nutshell handbook
system performance tuning by mike loukides. imho , it contains a
well written , comprehensive treatment of system performance. i'm
unaware of any other similar books. ed.

introduction administrivia


this document is posted each month , on or around the 15th , to the
usenet news groups comp.windows.x , news.answers , and comp.answers.
if you are reading a copy of this faq which is more than a few
months old (see the last modified date above) you should probably
locate the latest edition , since the information may be outdated.

if you do not know how to get those newsgroups and or your site does
not receive them and or this article has already expired , you can
retrieve this faq from an archive site.

there exist several usenet faq archive sites. to find out more about
them and how to access them , please see the introduction to the
news.answers newsgroup posting in news.answers.

the main faq archive is at rtfm.mit.edu 18.172.1.27 . this document
can be found there in pub usenet news.answers x faq speedups. if
you do not have access to anonymous ftp , you can retrieve it by
sending a mail message to mail server@rtfm.mit.edu with the
command send usenet news.answers x faq speedups in the message body.


what about the other x faq \?


david b. lewis (faq craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
well written comp.windows.x frequently asked questions document.
its focus is on general x information , while this faq concentrates
on performance.

the comp.windows.x faq does address the issue of speed , but only with
regards to the x server. the gist of that topic seems to be
use x11r5 , it is faster than r4 .
(please see the x faq for complete details).


window managers


there are a lot of window managers out there , with lots of different
features and abilities. the choice of which to use is by necessity a
balancing act between performance and useful features. at this
point , most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate
for a speedy window manager.

a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger ,
is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move .
also , if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner , you reduce the
amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
windows. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)

i 've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka
misc fixed medium r normal 13 100 100 100 c 70 iso8859 1 ). it is
the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun (1152x900 screen)
and still get two 80 column terminal windows side by side on the
display with no overlap. other font suggestions will be accepted.


the x server


which server \?

make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
if you have a monochrome monitor , use a monochrome x11 server.

on my monochrome sun , i have n't noticed much difference between
the xsun (colour) server and xsunmono , however it was pointed out to
me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
to less paging.
thanks to jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ,
michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se)

how your server was compiled can also make a difference. jeff law
(law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a sun system , x should be
compiled with gcc (version 2. ) or with the unbundled sun compiler.
you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not
using the bundled sunos compiler. i assume that similar results
would occur if you used one of the other high quality commercial
compilers on the market.

locking the server into ram \?

has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and
does not get paged \? eg via a call to plock(). does this help
performance at all \? i 've had one inquiry on this topic , and a few
pointers to the plock() function call , but no hard evidence from someone
who 's tried it. i am not in a position to give it a try.

starting your server

joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)
if you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever , sleep
for a second or two after launching each one. after i changed my
.xclients script to do this , logging in actually took less time...
we have a heavily loaded system without much core , though.

this sounds crazy , but i have confirmed that it works !

warner losh (imp@solbourne.com) provided me with a good explanation of
why this works , which i have summarized here

when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to
start accepting connections. a lot of initialization is done by
the server when it starts. this process touches a large number of
pages. any other process running at the same time would fight the
server for use of the cpu , and more importantly , memory. if you
put a sleep in there , you give the server a chance to get itself
sorted out before the clients start up.

similarly , there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x
client program starts toolkits registering widgets , resources
being fetched , programs initializing state and databases and so
forth. all this activity is typically memory intensive. once this
initialization is done ( the process has reached a steady state ) ,
the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
.xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
workstation 's limited resources

this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation , as there
are so many variables to be considered available ram , local swap
space , load average , number of users on your system , which clients
you are starting , etc.

currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like
(sleep 1 exec xclock )
(sleep 1 exec xbiff )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )

i 've experimented with
(sleep 1 exec xclock )
(sleep 2 exec xbiff )
(sleep 3 exec xterm )
(sleep 4 exec xterm )

i 've even tried
(sleep 2 exec start x clients script )
and then in start x clients script i had
(sleep 1 exec xclock )
(sleep 1 exec xbiff )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )

the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
completely finished processing my .xinitrc , and had settled down
into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients
were launched.

all of these yielded fairly comparable results , and so i just stuck with
my current setup , for its simplicity. you will probably have to
experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

fonts

loading fonts takes time and ram. if you minimize the number of fonts
your applications use , you 'll get speed increases in load up time.

one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small , one
large , one roman , whatever suits you) and configure all your clients or
at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts.
client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
into the server. this will also conserve server resources , since fewer
fonts will be loaded by the server.
farrell mckay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) ,
joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)

eg my main xterm font is 7x13 , so i also have twm set up to use 7x13
in all it 's menus and icons etc. twm 's default font is 8x13. since
i do n't normally use 8x13 , i 've eliminated one font from my server.

oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com)
keep fonts local to the workstation , rather than loading them over nfs.
if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable fonts , use a font server.

about the resources file


keep your .xresources .xdefaults file small. saves ram and saves
on server startup time. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)

one suggestion

in your .xdefaults (.xresources) file , try putting only the minimum
number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
applications. for example reversevideo true

then , separate your resources into individual client specific
resource files. for example home lib app defaults. in your
.login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath

setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults n

the comp.windows.x frequently asked questions faq contains
an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
ed.

so , when xterm launches , it loads its resources from
... app defaults xterm. xdvi finds them in ... app defaults xdvi ,
and so on and so forth. note that not all clients follow the same
xxxxx resource file naming pattern. you can check in your system
app defaults directory (often usr x11r5 lib x11 app defaults ) to
find the proper name , and then name your personal resource files
with the same name.

this is all documented in the xt specification (pg 125 666).
thanks to kevin samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) ,
michael urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) ,
and mike long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.

this method of organizing your personal resources has the following
benefits

easier to maintain more usable.

fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager
property. as a side benefit your server may start fractionally
quicker , since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

applications only process their own resources , never have to sort
through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

it also has drawbacks

the application that you are interested in has to load an
additional file every time it starts up. this does n't seem to
make that much of a performance difference , and you might
consider this a huge boon to usability. if you are modifying an
application 's resource database , you just need to re run the
application without having to xrdb again.

xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp. when
your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
then loaded by the individual client programs , they will not.
watch out for this ! !

i had c style comments in my .xdefaults file , which cpp stripped
out. when i switched to this method of distributed resource
files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
my clients were not finding their resources. xt did not
provide any error message when it encountered the c style
comments in the resource files , it simply , silently , aborted
processing the resource file.

the loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy , e.g. `` ifdef
color'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
method of resource management.

you may also run into some clients which break the rules. for
example , neither emacs (18.58.3) nor xvt (1.0) will find their
resources if they are anywhere other than in .xdefaults.

when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
with the machine where your resources are stored , your client
will not find its resources. loading all your resources into the
server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
their resources. casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

a possible compromise suggestion that i have (and am planning on trying)
is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg xterm) into my
.xdefaults file , and to use the separate resources files method for
clients that i seldom use.

define your display properly


client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server. in
that situation , rather than setting your display environment variable to
hostname 0.0 , where hostname is the name of your workstation , you
should set your display variable to unix 0.0 or 0.0 . by doing this
you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
thanks to patrick j horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)

see the display names section of the x(1) man page for further
explanation of how to properly set your display name.

i do n't think it 's stock mit , but (at least) data general and hp have
libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
the display is n't set specially.
rob sartin (88opensi ! sartin@uunet.uu.net)

jody goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an xlib patch to change
stock r5 to use local communication even if display is not properly set.
i do n't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
non mit patches and so have elected not to include it here. hopefully mit
will apply this minor ( 8 lines) patch themselves. in the meantime , if
you want to try it yourself , email jody. ed.


clients


if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think
carefully about the number of programs you are running. think also
about the kind of programs you are running. for example is there
a smaller clock program than xclock \?

unfortunately , i have n't really noticed that programs advertise how large
they are , so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
(eg xclock , xterm , xbiff) are welcome. ed.

i 've received some contradictory advice from people , on the subject
of x client programs. some advocate the use of programs that are
strictly xlib based , since xt , xaw and other toolkits are rather
large. others warn us that other applications which you are using
may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries. in
this case , using a non xt (for example) client program may actually
increase the amount of ram consumed.

the upshot of all this seems to be do n't mix toolkits. that is , try
and use just athena clients , or just xview clients (or just motif
clients , etc). if you use more than one , then you 're dragging in
more than one toolkit library.

know your environment , and think carefully about which client
programs would work best together in that environment.

a better clock for x


1) xcuckoo
suggested by duncan sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
available on export.lcs.mit.edu

xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of another program.
saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
suggested by der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)
available larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in x mclock.shar

non xt based. extensively configurable. it can be made to look
very much like mit oclock , or mostly like xclock purely by changing
resources.

of course , the ultimate clock one that consumes no resources , and
takes up no screen real estate is the one that hangs on your wall.

a better terminal emulator for x


from the readme file distributed with xterm


abandon all hope , ye who enter here

this is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
...


ugly maybe , but at my site it 's still the most used. i suspect that
xterm is one of the most used clients at many , if not most sites.
laziness \? is n't there a better terminal emulator available \? see below.

if you must use xterm , you can try reducing the number of savelines
to reduce memory usage. oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) ,
jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk)

1) xvt
suggested by richard hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk)
available export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib xvt 1.0.tar.z

...if you do n't need all the esoteric features of xterm , then get
hold of xvt ... it was written here just to save swap space as
xterm is rather a hog !

this was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm. you do n't have to
rename your resources , as xvt pretends to be xterm. in it 's current
version , you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm. i 've heard that
there are versions of xvt with this feature , but i 've not found any
yet.

update (march 1993) i recently had a few email conversations with
brian warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt. he
questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm. for
instance , xvt may initialize slightly faster , but compare scrolling
speed (try this quickie benchmark bin time dd if etc termcap
bs 40) and see which program can scroll faster. also , while xterm
may be slightly larger in ram requirements (we do n't have any hard
numbers here , does anyone else \? ) shared libraries and shared text
segments mean that xterm 's paging requirements are not that major.

as an experiment , he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm , but it
made little difference , since if you never use it , it never gets
brought into memory.

so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
xvt over xterm. in summary \? caveat emptor , your mileage may vary.
if you can provide some hard data , i 'd like to see it.
specifically how much ram each occupies , how much swap each needs ,
relative speed of each

2) mterm
suggested by der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)
available larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
x mterm.src mterm.ball o wax.

i also have my own terminal emulator. its major lack is
scrollback , but some people like it anyway.


tuning your client


suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

from scott barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding motif
text field widgets

i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets , i
was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes ,
particularly the initial one in the field. examining the what was
going on with xscope i found it. it seems that when the resource
xmnblinkrate is non zero and the focus is on a text field widget
(or even just a text widget) the i beam cursor will blink.
every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets , the
widget code is making a request to the server (copyarea). the user
can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0. it is not
noticeable on a 40mhz sparc , but it does make a little difference
on a slower system .

this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
of areas. consider your heavily used clients , are there any minor
embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server
requests \?


miscellaneous suggestions


pretty pictures

do n't use large bitmaps (gif 's , etc) as root window backgrounds.

the more complicated your root window bitmap , the slower the server
is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw , etc)

these take up ram , and cpu power. i work on a sun sparc and i'm
conscious of performance issues , i ca n't comprehend it when i see
people with a 4mb sun 3 60 running xphoon as their root window.

i 'll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by
having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

if you 're anything like me , you need all the screen real estate
that you can get for clients , and so rarely see the root window anyway.

thanks to qiang alex zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)
for reminding me of this one. ed.

a quicker mouse

using xset , you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
when you move your mouse. i use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file ,
which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
the wrist. see the xset man page for further ideas and information.

hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for
fine work. to cover my options , i have placed a number of different
mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.

e.g. (for twm)
menu mouse settings
mouse settings f.title
very fast ! xset m 7 10
normal (fast) ! xset m 3 10
system default (un accelerated) ! xset m default
glacial ! xset m 0 10


programming thoughts

joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)
to speed up applications that you 're developing , there are tons of
things you can do. some that stick out

for motif programs , do n't set xmfontlist resources for individual
buttons , labels , lists , et. al. use the defaultfontlist or
labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager
widget. again , stick to as few fonts as possible.

better yet , do n't use motif at all. it 's an absolute pig.

do n't create and destroy widgets on the fly. try to reuse them.
(this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits , too.)

use a line width of 0 in gcs. on some servers this makes a huge
difference.

compress and collapse multiple expose events. this can make the
difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
one.

francois staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be)
just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc
function would greatly increase performance of xt based
applications since they use malloc heavily. they suggested trying
out the gnuy malloc , but i did n't find the time yet. i did some
tests on small programs just doing malloc and free , and the
differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

any confirmation on this from anyone \? ed.

andre' beck (andre beck@irs.inf.tu dresden.de)

unnecessary noexpose events.

most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines , but
they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the
blits. this will cause a noexpose event every blit , that , in most
cases , only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
run through it 's event loop again and again.

thousands of xchangegc requests.

this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded x apps ,
where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed
again and again. xt uses a definitely better mechanism , by caching
and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters. this will
remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the
connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

say what ! \?

some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first

david b. lewis (by day dbl@osf.org , by night david craft@uunet.uu.net)
how about this swap displays with someone else. run all your programs
on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your
machine onto the other display. goal reduce context switches in the
same operation between client and server.

i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this , but i have received
the following confirmation...

michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se)
i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big
difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage
and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. this
helps a lot on my poor little ss1 with only 16 mb , it was
essential when i only had 8 mb.

casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)
the x11 server and the client are competing for the same cpu as
your server when you run it on the same machine. not really a
major problem , except that the x11 client and the server are in
absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

timothy h panton (thp@westhawk.uucp)
firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu 's are mostly idle , x 's
cpu usage is bursty. so the chances of you and your teammate
doing something cpu intensive at the same time is small. if they
are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your
action.

the second factor is that context switches are expensive , using 2
cpu 's halves them , you pay a price due to the overhead of going
over the network , but this is offset in most cases by the improved
buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) , allowing
even fewer context switches.

jesse w. asher

i was wondering this myself.

and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) windows nt.

with the bulk of the xhibition audience (and the unix community) developing
applications for in house or custom use , a new 32 bit operating system from a
player as large as microsoft needs to be evaluated. with ms windows on so many
desktops , and the price of computing power dropping , its successor needs to be
evaluated. as corporations begin to look at nt , so must their developers and
suppliers.

what you need. conference attendees will receive nt software development
kits to bang on , evaluate , and generally to see for yourself.

i hope this does n't sound like an nt commercial (it should sound like an
xhibition commercial ).

unfortunately it does. i do n't agree with the logic of nt at an x windows
conference. perhaps some good will come of it , but the two are so dissimilar
and the nt marketing stuff is so large in the xhibition adds that i was
coming to a similar conclusion as jesse...

thanks to bruce barnett , who recommended xvttool , and bernward averwald and

for a class of xterms.

in xvttool , simply create a key file that looks like
a a
b b
c c
...
and specify said key file on the command line. this will translate
any input into any other (in my case , lo case to up case). works great , and
you get a customizable button pad on the right or left side.

to use an xterm solution , add to your .xdefaults
capxterm vt100.translations override
key a string( a ) n
...

or
capxterm.vt100.translations override n
key a insert string(a) n
key b insert string(b) n

it is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need

right hand is doing at sun. i was informed by a sun employee that the pageview
program does require dsc compliant postscript. there was the possibility that
it was going to be changed so that if the file was n't dsc compliant that it
would stop at each showpage. i believe that this method would preclude being
able to go backwards and forwards through the file , i.e. , you could only go
forward to the next showpage. this is n't in ow3.0 pageview , but maybe it is

get ghostscript and ghostview. ghostview is a postscript previewer
that uses ghostscript.

from the ghostview readme



ghostview an x11 user interface for ghostscript.

ghostview is full function user interface for ghostscript 2.4.

brief list of features
ghostview parses any known version of adobe 's document structuring
conventions.
page size is automatically determined from the document structuring
comments. the user is able to override the values from the comments.
window size is set to the bounding box for encapsulated postscript figures.
default page size is letter and can be changed via xresources or
application defaults file to a4 (or any other valid size) for our
european friends.
scrollbars appear when necessary.
page orientation is automatically determined from the document structuring
comments. the user is able to override the values from the comments.
ability to view at 4 orientations portrait , landscape , upside down ,
and seascape (for those who rotate landscape the other direction).
ability to preview in any supported visual. (can preview in gray scale
or color on a color monitor.)
ability to mark pages for printing , or saving. (good for people that
printed a 100 page document and lost page 59 due to a printer jam.)
can popup zoom windows at printer resolution
(1 display dot 1 printer dot).

the ghostview distribution includes a ghostview widget that people
are encouraged to use in other programs.

ghostview 1.3 is available via anonymous ftp from

this file describes version 2.4.1 of ghostscript.



an overview of ghostscript


ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides

an interpreter for the ghostscript language , which very
closely resembles the postscript (tm) language and

a set of c procedures (the ghostscript library) that
implement the graphics capabilities that appear as primitive
operations in the ghostscript language.

the ghostscript language interpreter and library are written entirely
in c , with some assembly language accelerators for ms dos platforms.
currently , ghostscript is known to run on the following platform
families

ibm pc and compatibles with ega , vga , supervga , or compatible
graphics under ms dos 3.1 , 3.3 , or 5.0

a wide variety of unix systems using x windows version 11 ,
release 3 , 4 , and 5 , including sun 3 , sun 4 , sun 386i ,
sun sparcstation 1 generic 80386 machines running 386 ix
h p 9000 300 and 9000 800 decstation 2100 and 3100 vax

sun workstations (sun 3 , sparc , sun 386i) running sunview

vax , vms with x11r3 4 5 , gcc and dec c compiler (dec c compiler
version 3.1 or later is required).


(get ghostscript from the same ftp site you get ghostview.)

i have compiled xfig 2.1 patchlevel 7 with hp 's x11r5 from hp ux 9.01 ,
augmented by the athena and mu libraries from an x11r5 distribution
from iworks.ecn.uiowa.edu. it compiles nicely (although for one file
the preprocessor macro definition table size needed to be increased).
but when executed , nothing happens at all except for ever growing
memory requirements (eventually climaxing in a core dump). the binary
of the identical program , compiled on 8.07 with x11r4 , has no
problems. other programs like xtpanel compile , link , and run just
fine with the same libraries.

does this sound familiar , or am i going to have to figure this one out

i have a problem which many of you might have run into. we use lots of
ascii terminals and use them to the max. meaning lots of attributes , line
draw , etc. now what i need to do is come up with a working xterm which
will emulate our advanced ascii terminals as closely as possible.

this means needing all attributes to work , including bold and line drawing.
the only fonts which seem to meet these criteria are a pairs of fonts in
which one is bold and the other normal , while both have linedraw , fixed
spacing , and several sizes.

the only standard fonts which work are the fonts like 9x15 and 9x15b under
misc . they work great , except i need a font one size larger , 10x20. now
10x20 works well , but there is no bold counterpart !

to make matters worse , i need the fonts in some form i can use for tektronix
xterminals. it seems they like .pcf format , although i should be able to
convert a .bdf format.

anyone have any suggestions \?

this would be tedious , but if you have the time you could get the .bdf
file (i can email it to you if you do n't have it or do n't have easy access
to the x source) , and could make your own bold font from this. since each
glyph is just a bitmap , you could write a program to convert each
glyph to a bitmap readable file , use bitmap to make each glyph bold , and
convert the results back to .bdf format. then , use bdftopcf to create
the .pcf file. then , stick the .pcf in usr lib x11 fonts misc (or wherever)
and include it in fonts.dir and , voila , you 'll have what you need !

extract from the color readme file for anthony 's icon library.
for network discussion...

color coordination...

i tried to start a discussion in `comp.windows.x' at the start of the
year about some sort of `standard color table' that icons should follow
(say 16 to 32 colors including 5 colors for a small grey scale). but no
one responded at all.

the problem is that if the colors for icons are just used willy nilly
you will soon find that the workstations color table , devotes itself
solely the window manager , icons and other `adminstrative tasks' instead
of applications that actually require the colors for proper working.
``color needful applications'' such as picture and graphic displayers ,
animation , real time video , raytracers , etc... .

the following is a suggested color table for icons , and general use.
icons , window managers , and general applications , should follow this
table or something like it , unless the application is ``color needful''.

for each primary color (red , green , blue) three colors
eg values 0 , 128 and 255.
this results in 3 3 colors (27) representing most of the
standard colors for use in icons.

two extra shades of grey
eg vales (black) 0 , 64 , 128 , 196 and 255 (white , red , ...)

3 other colors probably of some primary color to provide shading
a and 3 d look to buttons and titlebars in the window manager.

this table represents 32 colors and represents a large range of
posibilities for the above ``administrative services'' of the
workstation.

if you installed x lib xt by redefining projectroot , you will find that

wondering if microsoft had bought xhibition \? the front says conference

x hibition was for x windows \? \?


jesse w. asher

yes , xhibition is for the x window system. the x window system conference
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to x. nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirty six technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for x application developers. add vendor
exhibits and a product presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today , and you have a complete show focused on x11.

speakers at xhibition 93 include

bob schiefler , lu abel , mark ackerman , paul asente , doug blewett ,
donna converse , jim fulton , oliver jones , keith packard , ralph swick ,
doug young , and many others.

xhibition is growing (fortunately for us ) and we have added some additional
conferences. surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest. these include object oriented technologies such as the object
management group 's orb and corba c as it applies to x client server
technologies such as dce threads databases object oriented and relational
and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) windows nt.

with the bulk of the xhibition audience (and the unix community) developing
applications for in house or custom use , a new 32 bit operating system from a
player as large as microsoft needs to be evaluated. with ms windows on so many
desktops , and the price of computing power dropping , its successor needs to be
evaluated. as corporations begin to look at nt , so must their developers and
suppliers.

the mission of the xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner. the nt conference
at xhibition is designed to do just that. we worked with microsoft to provide
the only conference this year specifically designed to show x and unix
developers the capabilities of windows and nt. if you are n't sure that nt has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment , this is
the place to find out. ask the folks from microsoft , get them to show you
what you need. conference attendees will receive nt software development
kits to bang on , evaluate , and generally to see for yourself.

i hope this does n't sound like an nt commercial (it should sound like an
xhibition commercial ). i just want to reiterate that the xhibition audience
is growing and xhibition is growing along with it. the industry is a
confusing place at the moment with unix , cose , nt , dce , corba , and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up. xhibition can help sort out the confusion.

subject 'makedepend' problem
organization information resources inc.
lines 46

hi , netters

we have a problem with 'makedepend' it does n't know how to correctly process
if clause in c preprocessor statements. it evaluates everything to
true no matter what the conditionals are.
for example , makedepend chokes on one of x11 include files (as distributed
by sun) namely xos.h

if ! defined(sunos41) defined( stdc )
include string.h
define index strchr
define rindex strrchr
else bsd ! stdc
include strings.h
endif ! sunos41 stdc

here 'makedepend' evaluates both if and corresponding else statements
to 'true' and tries to open the file strings.h which does n't exist
under solaris2.
we also have a lot of if statements in some of our legacy code.
we got and built 'makedepend' off the net it did n't fix the problem.

in all fairness it should be noted that 'makdepend' man page (sun 's
distribution) mentions this problem

bugs
if you do not have the source for cpp , the berkeley c
preprocessor , then makedepend will be compiled in such a way
that all if directives will evaluate to true regardless
of their actual value. this may cause the wrong include
directives to be evaluated. makedepend should simply have
its own parser written for if expressions.

has anybody come up with some solution fix to 'makdepend' other than
writeyourownparser... and willing to share it with us \?

since we often experience delays in our newsfeed please reply
directly to my e mail address i 'll post a summary.

if you have anything to add or change on the faq just let me know.
(especially if you had a problem that someone else was able to help you with)
send changes to steve@ecf.toronto.edu , please put 'faq' somewhere
in the subject line so that my mail filter will put it in the correct
mail folder.

please do not ask me questions that are not answered in the faq. i do not
have time to respond to these individually. instead , post your question
to the net , and send me the question and answer together when you get it.

frequently asked questions about x on intel based unix (with answers)


i) what options do i have for x software on my intel based unix system \?

1. free options
the best option is xfree86 , which is an enhanced version of x386 1.2.
any other version of x386 will have slower performance , and will
be more difficult to compile. information on how to obtain xfree86
is listed below.

x386 is the port of the x11 server to system v 386 that was
done by thomas roell (roell@sgcs.com).
it supports a wide variety of svga boards.
there are 2 major free versions x386 1.1 is based on x11r4 ,
x386 1.2 is included in mit 's x11r5 distribution (ie. you
do n't need to patch it into the mit source any more).
x386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from sgcs (see below).

ii) what is xfree86 and where do i get it \?

3. what is xfree86 \?

xfree86 is an enhanced version of x386 1.2 , which was distributed with
x11r5. this release consists of many bug fixes , speed improvements , and
other enhancements. here are the highlights of the enhancements

1) the speedup package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfree86 ,
selectable at run time via the xconfig file. some speedups require
an et4000 based svga , and others require a virtual screen width of
1024. the speedups suitable to the configuration are selected by
default. with a high quality et4000 board (vram) , this can yield
up to 40 improvement of the xstones benchmark over x386 1.2.
2) the fx386 packages from jim tsillas are included as the default
operating mode if speedup is not selected. this mode is now
equivalent in performance to x386 1.1b (x11r4) , and approximately
20 faster than x386 1.2.
3) support for localconn , compile time selectable for server , clients ,
or both. this support is for both svr3.2 and svr4. for svr4.0.4
with the 'advanced compatibility package' , local connections from
sco xsight odt clients are supported.
4) drivers for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipsets.
refer to the files readme.ati and readme.trident for details about
the ati and trident drivers.
5) support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (thomas eberhardt 's
code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
6) type1 font code from mit contrib tape has been included , and is
compile time selectable. there are contributed type1 fonts in the
contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
7) new configuration method which allows the server 's drivers and font
renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
distributions.
8) integrated support for 386bsd , mach , and linux.
9) a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga
cards is now included.

the following key features were added with the release of xfree86 1.2
(they were not in xfree86 1.1)

1) the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank switching of
available svga memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200
(see the x386(1) manual page for more information).
2) support for the hercules mono card has been added to the
monochrome server , and with it the ability to support a two
headed server one vga , and one hercules. so far this has only
been tested on svr4 (it is also reported to work under linux).
3) svr3 shared libraries , tested under isc svr3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
4) support for svr4.2 (there are some special considerations to
consider , due to new usl bugs see the readme.svr4 file for
more information.)
5) support for ps 2 mice , and logitech mouseman trackman (some
versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
6) a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
timing data , written by eric raymond (derived from previous
documentation and a lot of experimentation).
7) greatly improved support for international keyboards , including
implementation of the compose key functionality found on many
vendor servers (see the x386keybd(1) manual page for more
information).
8) the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has
been improved , and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
0.1 mhz. users may want to consider removing an existing clocks
line from their xconfig file and re probing using the new server.
9) many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig
configuration file. error messages are much more informative
and intuitive , and more validation is done. there are many new
options that can be enabled in the xconfig file (see the x386(1)
manual page for more information on the format of this file).

plus a number of other small things. refer to the changelog file
in the source distribution for full details.

also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond , and the
current x386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat.

4. what oss are supported \?

xfree86 supports
svr4.2 consensys v4.2
svr4.0 microport , dell , esix , isc , at t , mst , consensys , uhc
svr3 isc 2.2 3.0 , at t 2.2
linux , mach 386 , 386bsd 0.1

bsd 386 is not supported , but it should work. the most active
bsd 386 person is greg lehey grog@lemis.de .

note that esix 3.2d and sco are not supported yet ,
but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
if you are interested in tackling this , send mail to
xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. what video hardware is supported \?

at this time , xfree86 1.2 supports the following svga chipsets

tseng et4000
tseng et3000
paradise pvga1
western digital wd90c00 , wd90c10 , wd90c11 (these are supersets of
the pvga1 , and use its driver)
genoa gvga
trident tvga8900c , tvga9000
ati 18800 , 28800

all of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes ,
with the exception of the ati chipsets , which are only supported in
256 color mode.

the monochrome server also supports generic vga cards , using 64k of
video memory in a single bank , and the hercules card. on the
et3000 , only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
server , and the gvga has not been tested with more than 64k.

it appears that some of the svga card manufacturers are going to
non traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel clock frequencies. to
avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes xfree86
1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
clock. this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
discovered. refer to the readme.clkprog file for information on how
these programs work , if you need to write one. if you do develop such
a program , the xfree86 team would be interested in including it with
future xfree86 releases.

if you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using xfree86 ,
it is suggested that you purchase an et4000 based board such as the
orchid prodesigner iis. avoid recent diamond boards xfree86 will not
work with them , because diamond wo n't provide programming details.
in fact , the xfree86 project is actively not supporting new diamond
products , as long as such policies remain in effect. contributions
of code will not be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
if you would like to see this change , tell diamond about it.

some people have asked if xfree86 would work with local bus or eisa
video cards. theoretically , the means of communication between the
cpu and the video card is irrelevant to xfree86 compatibility. it
could be isa , eisa , or local bus. what should matter is the chipset
on the video card. unfortunately , the developers do n't have a lot
of access to eisa or vlb machines , so this is largely an untested
theory. however , we have yet to see any reports of things not
working on one of these buses and we have several reports of xfree86
working fine on them.

6. what about accelerated boards \?

at this time , there is no support in xfree86 for accelerated boards
like the s3 , ati ultra (8514 a) , tiga , etc. this support is available
in commercial products from sgcs and metrolink (for svr3 and svr4).

an s3 server is available for 386bsd and linux. contact
hasty@netcom.com for 386bsd or jon@robots.ox.ac.uk for linux.

a beta 8514 a server is available for linux. contact martin@cs.unc.edu
or jon@robots.ox.ac.uk . note these servers are not part of xfree86.

7. why does n't xfree86 support 16 color vga modes \?

the reason that this is not supported is the way vga implements the
16 color modes. in 256 color modes , each byte of frame buffer memory
contains 1 pixel. but the 16 color modes are implemented as bit
planes. each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
of each of 8 pixels , and there are four such planes. the mit frame
buffer code is not designed to deal with this. if vga handled
16 color modes by packing 2 4 bit pixels into each byte , the mit code
could be modified to support this (or it already may i'm not sure).
but for the vga way of doing things , a complete new frame buffer
implementation is required. some beta testers are looking into this ,
but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. what other hardware or software requirements are there \?

obviously , a supported svga board and os are required. to run
x efficiently , 12 16mb of memory should be considered a minimum.
the various binary releases take 10 40mb of disk space , depending
on the os (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
to build from sources , at least 80mb of free disk space will
be required , although 120mb should be considered a comfortable
lower bound.

9. where can i get source for xfree86 \?

source patches for the current version (1.2 , based on x11r5 pl22
from mit) , are available via anonymous ftp from
export.lcs.mit.edu (under contrib xfree86)
ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under xfree86)
ftp.win.tue.nl (under pub xfree86)
(for the rest of this faq , these 3 location will be called ftp)

refer to the readme file under the specified directory for information
on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. where can i get binaries for xfree86 \?

binaries are available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.physics.su.oz.au svr4 binaries
under xfree86 svr4
ftp.win.tue.nl svr4 binaries
under pub xfree86 svr4
ferkel.ucsb.edu svr4 binaries
under pub svr4 xfree86
stasi.bradley.edu svr4 binaries
under pub xfree86 svr4
blancmange.ma.utexas.edu svr3 (isc) binaries
under pub isc
ftp.prz.tu berlin.de svr3 (isc) binaries
under pub pc isc xfree86
tsx 11.mit.edu linux binaries
under pub linux packages x11
agate.berkeley.edu 386bsd binaries
under pub 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86
ftp.cs.uwm.edu mach binaries
under i386

ensure that you are getting xfree86 1.2 some of these sites may
archive older releases as well. each binary distribution will
contain a readme file that describes what files you need to take
from the archive , and which compile time option selections were
made when building the distribution.

iv) what general things should i know about running xfree86 \?

11. installation directories

the top level installation directory is specified by the projectroot
( usr x386 , by default) variable in config site.def. binaries , include
files , and libraries are installed in projectroot bin , include , lib .

this can be changed when rebuilding from sources , and can be modified
via symbolic links for those oss that support them. this directory is
nonstandard , and was chosen this way to allow xfree86 to be installed
alongside a commercial vendor supplied x implementation.

12. configuration files

the xfree86 server reads a configuration file ( xconfig ) on startup.
the search path , contents and syntax for this file are documented in
the server manpage , which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes

david e wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
clock settings for vga cards and monitor settings.
the database is installed in usr x386 lib x11 etc modedb.txt , and
is in the source tree under mit server ddx x386 etc. this database is
also available from him (for the latest copy) , and is kept on
export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib x386.modedb.z , which is updated
occasionally. obtain a copy of this database. it just might have the
settings you need. if you create new settings , please send them to
david for inclusion in the database.

if this does n't help you , the videomodes.doc (by eric raymond) file
with xfree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
it may be helpful to start with settings that almost work , and use
this description to get them right. when you do , send the information
to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

note the old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more , and
is completely unnecessary. if you need to determine dot
clock values for a new board , remove the 'clocks' line from
your xconfig file (if present) , and start the server. the
server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
you can use these values to put a 'clocks' line into your
xconfig file , which is not necessary , but will speed up
starting the server in the future.

14. rebuilding reconfiguring the server from the link kit

if you have installed the server binary link kit , it is possible to
reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server. this is
fully explained in the readme file that is available with the link kit.

v) what os specific things should i know about running xfree86 \?

first of all , the server must be installed suid root (mode 4755).

15. svr4
why wo n't my xterm run properly \?

if your kernel is not built with the consem module , you should define
consem no in you environment. otherwise xterm wo n't run.
csh users should use 'setenv consem no'

the esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
problems with xfree86. it recommended that this patch not be
installed. alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. svr3

make sure you look at ftp readme.isc , if that 's what you are running.

17. 386bsd

make sure you look at ftp readme.386bsd.

also , a separate 386bsd faq is maintained by richard murphey
rich@rice.edu . the latest version should be available in the
file xfree86 1.2 386bsd faq at the following ftp sites

agate.berkeley.edu pub 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86 1.2
wuarchive.wustl.edu mirrors4 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86 1.2
grasp1.univ lyon1.fr pub 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86 1.2

18. linux

you must be running linux 0.97pl4 or greater , and have the 4.1 gcc
jump libraries installed.

make sure the binaries x386 , x386mono , xload and xterm are setuid root.

if your kernel does n't have tcp support compiled in , you 'll have to
run the server as x pn . the default startup configuration assumes
that tcp is not available. if it is , change the two files
usr x386 bin startx and usr x386 lib x11 xdm xservers , removing the
pn argument to x386.

make sure dev console is either a link to dev tty0 or has the major
number 4 , minor number 0. also note that if dev console is not
owned by the user running x , then xconsole and xterm will not permit
console output redirection. xdm will properly change the owner , but
startx wo n't.

when running xdm from rc.local , you will need to provide it with
a tty , for example xdm dev console .

for more detailed information , please read the file readme present
with the distribution on tsx 11.mit.edu.

19. mach

make sure you look at ftp readme.mach.

vi) what things should i know for building xfree86 from source \?

this section has been removed from the faq , since it is
fully explained in ftp readme and the os specific readmes.
please look at those files for information on building xfree86.

vii) is there anything special about building clients with xfree86 \?

20. bsd compatibility library

a lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy() , etc.
the default configuration files are set up to link with libxbsd.a
which contains emulation for bcopy() , bzero() , bcmp() , ffs() , random() ,
seed(). a better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
x11 xfuncs.h in source files that call them. xfuncs.h provides macro
definitions for these in terms of the sysv 'mem' functions. if you are
linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
functions , then you should link with libxbsd.a

21. ansiccoptions

this is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
ansi ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to rewrite
the entire ccoptions line. for example , with stock mit , you 'd see
something like
ccoptions ansi o2 fwritable strings
and to get rid of the ansi ness , the developer would have to put
ccoptions o2 fwritable strings
in his imakefile. with this change , you would see a default of
ansiccoptions ansi
ccoptions o2 fwritable strings
and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is
ansiccoptions
to get rid of the ansi ness (many x clients will die a horrible death
with ansi). the effect is even more dramatic in practice , because
ccoptions is actually quite complex. the other issue is that one must
add 'ansiccoptions (ansiccoptions)' to a passcdebugflags definition.

subject x11r5 on solbourne
organization crin inria lorraine
lines 14

hi netters ,
having inherited a solbourne (s 4000 sun 4 compatible) , i was wondering
if somebody has ported x11r5 to this beast. since solbournce computer inc. folded
up i do n't know where i can get the kernel to move from r4. since they never
joined the mit consortium , the regular distribution does n't work. any pointers
will be highly appreciated.

subject cannot create 24 plane window
organization niels bohr institute and nordita , copenhagen

hello x'ers

i have a problem i am not able to create a window with 24 bit planes. the
following code illustrates the problem

include stdio.h
include x11 xlib.h
include x11 xutil.h

main()

display display
window win
xvisualinfo vinfo
colormap colormap
xsetwindowattributes attributes
xevent event

xnextevent(display , event)



i tried this with an sgi with 24 plane truecolor server , and with an hp
9000 700 24 plane directcolor server (with the obviously neccessary change) ,
both running x11r4. on the client side , i have tried with x11r4 xlib on
hp 9000 700 and decstation , and with x11r3 xlib on decstation. all the
combinations gave badmatch error on the createwindow request.

as far as i can tell from the manual , the only attribute which may give
a badmatch , is the colormap , if it belongs to a wrong visual. but the
visual was correctly matched , as i did not get the error message. what
am i doing wrong \? for information i can tell that xwud aborts with the
same error.

organization boecom project boeing computer services , seattle , wa
lines 13

i am planning to convert my motif 1.2 app from pixel to font units
which would all be set in the app 's resource file instead of hard coded
in the program.

however , the word here is from people who tried this already that for
some unknown reason xmform offsets placed in the resource file are still
interpreted in pixel units forcing people to code those offset font units into the program.

can somebody confirm this \?

subject callback parameter problem after x11r5 upgrade

we 've just recently upgraded our x11 to r5 and are now running into problems
with some of our applications that use motif 1.1. it appears that pointer to
the widget being passed to the callback function (i.e. , the w of
(w , client , call) ) is nil. the client and call pointers are okay in some
instances , but bogus in other instances.

we are running sunos 4.1.2 on a sun 4. after compiling x11r5 and all 23
patches (with the motifbc flag set) , we recompiled motif and then we
recompiled the application.

did we skip a step or leave something out \? is there a flag that we should
have used \? should we have left motif alone \?

any answers or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

rewrite 'makedepend' to use 'cc m' or 'gcc m' or 'gcc mm' (which is

hi ,

i am running x11r4 on an ibm rs 6000 (aix 3.2) and x11r5 on a sun4 (sunos 4.1).

since i run x on both colour and black white displays , i need different
values for the same resource , so i want to use ifdef color in my
application defaults files. however , cpp is only invoked by xrdb , and
not when the resources are loaded on demand.

is there a proper solution to this \?

so far , the only proper solution i 've come to think of , is to create 2
different files in my app defaults , say xterm and xterm color , and
set my xfilesearchpath to either home t n or home t n color.
but that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell
command without reading the .cshrc does not set xfilesearchpath).

furthermore , i thought of using include xterm in xterm color.
however , for resources in xterm that i want to override in xterm color ,
things are different on both machines. on a sun , the first found resource
is used (i.e. the one from xterm , the b w one) , while on an rs 6000 , the
last found value is used (i.e. the one from xterm color). what can i do
about it \?

i have one last question for the specification of xfilesearchpath , i
can use t , n , c and s. t stands for app defaults , n for the
resource class , but what do c and s stand for \?

as quoted from 1993may13.212321.2563@moepi.do.open.de by bernward@moepi.do.open.de (bernward averwald)

back in the days of x11.1 i did analyse the xterm code. the cursor
was implemented by drawing a rectangle around the character. i does n't
seem to be changed 'til now.
but if you have the sources you could add a blinking cursor via
xtappaddtimeout or similar .

the server overhead for this is mildly ridiculous , though (see also desqview x ,
which does this in its dos windows). do you really want xterm to wake up every
half second and whack the server into doing a bitblt \?

so what \? i'm running emu on a 25 mhz 68020 box. i cannot make out any
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not (if you think about it a bit , a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest pc). since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus , this
application is active anyway. to repeat it , a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance , it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software.

you are stuck in a distributed system feedback loop ! what if you are on an
xterminal or running xterm over the net to another machine \? that is when the
load problems occur. if you had a machine with 20 xterminals attached and
they all had blinking cursors in xterm 's , this could represent a considerable
ethernet bandwidth waste.

i'm not picking on you , just people keep forgetting that there is a lot of life
out there besides distributed or singleuser workstations !

i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose configure
events are handled.

i have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in. since i give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized , i made a translation table for the expose configure events.
the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event
calls my rescale method. the rescale method invokes a fake expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct)
to draw the data.

quest 1.
when the appl. is compiled linked w r4 (running in either r4 or r5 env.)
i get multiple ( 4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed. i assume i'm getting cascading events. is that right \?
any suggestions as to how to handle trap events in a better way \?

quest 2.
when the appl. is compiled linked w r5 i get no expose events
whatsoever. do events and or translation tables act differently in r5 \?

one way to mask the left button check the contents of the xevent that the
xaddeventhandler send to your event handling function (in your case , it is the
show mouse position function.

if the xevent arrive in this function as

xevent p event

then , the value of p event xbutton.button is the button that was pressed. so ,
you just do a switch on that value in order to distinguish between them. in case
it was not clear p event xevent.button is an int.

by the way , you mentioned the button1motionmask and if anyone can help me with
these motionmasks i would be grateful. i can not figure out how do distinguish
between motions by which button is pressed as the motion is occurring. in
essence i would like an seperate event handler for motion with each button.
unfortunately , the xevent sent by a motionmask does not seem to contain the
value of the pressed button.

nntp posting host pop
organization jet propulsion laboratory (nasa)
lines 102

i just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from
fisher@iscp.bellcore.com (greg fisher)

... the most serious problem i have identified has not
been incorporated. this problem occurs when the table widget 's
geometrymanager is invoked by a child. this will work correctly if
the table widgets parent complies with the xt protocols. however , if
they do not , as is the case for some motif widgets , and they ignore
xtcwqueryonly , then the sizing will be incorrect.
in order to see this problem , the following events must
happen
1. a child of the table widget must request a new size.
2. the table widget must query its parent for a new size having set
xtcwqueryonly.
3. the parent must ignore the xtcwqueryonly bit and resize the table
widget. as part of the resize , xmptableforgetproposedlayout is
called. this will set tw table.current cols and
tw table.current rows to zero.
4. the table will continue setting up the new size , working under the
assumption that it is working with a proposed and not actual
layout. at the end , it will call xmptablesaveproposedlayout. this
will save tw table.cols and tw table.rows and restore their
values from tw table.current cols and tw table.current rows.
however , these have already been set to zero.
5. since the table widget has already been resized , it will not need a
second resize.
6. next , another widget managed by some ancestor of the table is
resized. this results in the parent of the table requesting the
tables preferred size. since tw table.cols and tw table.rows are
zero , this will return 0x0 as the preferred size.
7. the parent is very likely to grant this request , resulting in a
loss of the whole table from the display.


he isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely
correct. here is the new implementation of xmptablenewproposedlayout
which will be released with the next update in 5 weeks

xmp table.c

void xmptablenewproposedlayout( tw )
xmptablewidget tw

xmptableconsidersamesize( tw )
xmptableproposedcolsandrows( tw )
xmptablequeryparentforresize( tw ) query only , no resize


since we only made a query , we should still need to continue.
however , motif is broken so that we actually may already have
been resized. in that case , the proposed layout is already
forgotten , so we should just quietly exit.

if ( tw table.resize status rsduetorequest )

xmptablemakecolsfitquerywidth( tw )
xmptablemakerowsfitqueryheight( tw )
xmptablegetproposedchildsize( tw )
xmptablesaveproposedlayout( tw )

else the resize has already been done. our proposed layout would
have been forgotten in the process.



the xptable the fix is identical , except of course for the names

xp table.c

void xptablenewproposedlayout( tw )
xptablewidget tw

xptableconsidersamesize( tw )
xptableproposedcolsandrows( tw )
xptablequeryparentforresize( tw ) query only , no resize

since we only made a query , we should still need to continue.
however , some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may
already have been resized. in that case , the proposed layout
is already forgotten , so we should just quietly exit.

if ( tw table.resize status rsduetorequest )

xptablemakecolsfitquerywidth( tw )
xptablemakerowsfitqueryheight( tw )
xptablegetproposedchildsize( tw )
xptablesaveproposedlayout( tw )

else the resize has already been done. our proposed layout would
have been forgotten in the process.

you need to start the x server with indirect its name.

if you start it with indirect localhost , it use the loopback adress as

remember that every machine has the adress 127.0.0.1 on the loopback network.

xm is a user interface framework for the c language built upon x11
and the x toolkit. it is designed to be a simple and intuitive programming
interface to access the functionality of commonly used widgets.
xm was initially created for the motif widget set , now support for the
athena widgets was added. applications created with xm run in both
environments without changes , although many nice features are only
available when using motif.
in some situations xm extends the underlying toolkit (i.e. providing
a combobox borrowed from ms windows) , but never tries to replace it
data of user interface objects is left to the widgets and only duplicated
in rare cases.

xm has nothing common with motif besides the general idea to
encapsulate motif widgets in c objects and the ' ' in it 's name. many
ideas for the xm architecture came from digitalk 's smalltalk version ,
which provides an easy to use framework for windows pm mac applications
(in the very first time of development i used the windows dialog editor and
a simple parser to create similar smalltalk and xm dialogs ).

top level objects in xm
'windows' , 'systemdialogs' and 'toolboxes' which use the automatic layout
feature of various composite widgets in motif and xaw
'userdialogs' which can be individually laid out with a user interface
builder (a first version of such a dialog editor is included in this
distribution)

controls (children of top level objects)
'statictext' , 'staticimage' , 'pushbutton' , 'checkbox' , 'radiobutton' ,
'edit' , 'listbox' , 'combobox' , 'groupbox' , 'panearea' , 'drawing' , 'toolbar'

the staticimage and all the button classes can display b w (x bitmap
format) or color (gif format) pictures as an alternative to a label text.

event handling is done by a simple but powerful mechanism which redirects
xt callbacks to member functions of xm objects.


commoninteract(ii) is built upon the xm drawing class and provides
components for building direct manipulative applications. is is a very
simplified implementation of some features from the commoninteract system
(research project of our institute in 1991) , an approach to define a
software achitecture for implementing direct manipulative applications
with multiple interaction media (i.e. sound , alternative input devices).
if you are interrested , look into the june 1993 issue of the joop (sigs
publications journal of object oriented programming) there should be
our paper about commoninteract (but be aware , that it is our 'state of
the art' from 1991).
commoninteract(ii) is still undocumented and is included because it was
used to implement the dialog editor. it currently supports only drawing
primitives (lines , rectangles , circles...) , but we plan to extend it to
support bitmaps and some controls also.
known problem the xm drawing class has no redrawing strategy (always
redraws the whole window , even after minimal changes like selecting an
object) , this looks very ugly on slow displays and should be fixed.


about this first release

xm is still incomplete and has a lot of bugs but we are using it here
for smaller applications which are running without problems. so i think
i can call it a 'beta release' which can be used to develop applications
for any non critical purposes.
commoninteract may be called a 'pre alpha release'. it 's development will
be continued this year because we plan to use it for another research
project here. besides incompleteness and the redrawing problem it seems
to be stable and can be used for experimental applications.

platforms this release was compiled and tested on
hp9000 720 running hp ux 8.07
sun sparc running sunos release 4.1.1
pc at386 running linux v0.99pl6

caution although the whole stuff was initially developed using an at t
standard c compiler this release is tested only with gnu g 2.3.3 or
above (the next release will be tested with both compilers).

i'm not all too sure about my viewing software. i hand converted this
thing in vi from a sun rasterfile... what a pain !

for folks who have n't the slightest , it went like this



how to make your own x face
in 0x000f easy steps !

1. scan my drivers' license into a .pcx file.
2. use wingif to 'trim' my face out of the license ,
'reduce' it by half , and
convert it to .bmp.
3. use paintbrush to touch up manually.
4. use wingif to 'reduce' it by half again.
5. use paintbrush to touch up again.
6. use wingif to 'reduce' it by half again
and convert it to .gif.

now over to the unix side...

7. use snapshot to convert the .gif to a sun rasterfile.
8. use iconedit to touch it up and
convert it to an x bitmap.
9. use vi (yes , a text editor) to manually convert
the rasterfile into the uncompressed x face format.
(lots of global ed commands , and by the time you 're
done you 'll mirror hex bytewise in your sleep ! ! )

now over to the linux side...

a. use compface to convert it to what you see here

i am looking for a program to draw various kinds of diagrams on my linux
system.

it must be free.
it must run on standard (monochrome) x with a small screen size (800x600)
no motif openlook etc.
it must compile under linux with gcc g . most generic unix software
works ok.
it must produce postscript files that i can include into latex documents
with dvips. or just tell me another free program that converts one
of the supported formats to ps.
it must produce drawings that are larger than the window size (scrollable).

i know of several such programs , idraw , xfig. tgif. i have
no experience with any of them. features i would like in the programs are.

ability to draw circles , arcs , straight lines , boxes and arrows.
support for both dashed and solid line styles for all of these objects.
support for texts in any size.
ability to move copy resize rotate any part of the drawing.
ability to turn any part of the drawing into a library component
(e.g. a transistor symbol composed of three lines , an arrow and a circle)
any aid (numeric coordinates , screen grid) to align parts of the drawing.
less essential , but in fact very handy preservation of connection.
if i move one part of the drawing , the lines that connect that part to the
rest of the drawing , stay connected.

ideally i want the tool so general and flexible that it is comfortable to
draw electronic schematics , flow charts , logic diagrams , data flow diagrams
and block diagrams with it.

i just want to know which of the programs offer which of the features on my
whishlist and are there any other programs \? how demanding are the programs
with respect to disk space , memory and cpu usage \? are any of the programs
known to work on linux with monochrome x \?

in the list you mentioned , tgif handles everything except rotation and
any size text. it only supports 90 degrees rotation. currently , it
supports 11 (x11r4 standard) font sizes. however , it allows arbitrary
scaling of the entire drawing. effectively , it allows any font sizes , but
you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.

tgif takes up 850k (compiled with o option) on a sparcstation. i was told
that it compiles under linux , but i have n't tried it yet. it works with
both color and monochrome x.

hey folks ,
i'm attempting to use imake to manage makefiles for a development effort and was curious
to find out if anybody else is experiencing problems with any target that
has subdirs generated by imake on solaris 2 platforms.

for example , 'make makefiles' chokes in the very first subdirectory.

i.e. target subdirmakefiles not found

you do n't give the precise error message , but i assume that
the making of the target fails , because make ca n't find the rules.

we 've seen this happen with sunos 5.x make as well and aat this
point i'm not sure why it happens. it seems to happen
with large makefiles. the entries near the end get lost.
small changes in the makefile will remedy this problem ,
as it does in your example.

in the mit r5 distribution r5.sunos5.patch this can happen with
the target ``makefiles'' in one of the doc directories.

at first i thought this was a bug with make on my sun , but i built and used gnumake with the
same results. attached you 'll find the first makefiles target rule from the generated makefile

this is really weird. are your really sure that you were using gnu make \?

i have found out , that there is a preconfigured german keymap for x

my first impression was very good , i was able to get z and y straight )
there 's still a little problem i ca n't solve however
i cannot get at the backslash , bar , brackets and curly brackets.
the alt gr key does n't seem to work.
i tried xev to find out whether it produces an event at all and it does.
looking up its keycode (113) in the xmodmap i found the entry mode switch
which does n't ring any bell. the entries for the keys i cannot use seem
to be correct. example keycode xx ssharp questn backslash
the first 2 entries i can even get at. the first one is the unmodified
key and the second is the key with shift , but what is the 3rd \? \?
my guess is that it should be the key with alt gr but it is n't.
if anybody has run into similar problems and knows how to solve them ,

xthe
x.b rx
xprogram connect to the specified
x.i host
xand executes the specified
x.i command
xin the background , returning immediately. to allow the execution
xof x programs , it copies a number of environmental variables to
xthe remote session. if you omit
x.ir command ,
xthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host. the
x.b rxterm
xvarient starts a remote xterm on a host , and also passes
x.i args
xto the remote xterm as arguments.
x.pp
xshell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local
xmachine , while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote
xmachine.
x.pp
xif the name of the file from which
x.b rx
xis executed is anything other than ``rx , ''
x.b rx
xtakes this name , stripped on a leading ``r'' as the command
xto run on the remote host , using any
x.i command
xparameters as arguments for the remote command.
x.pp
xif
x.b rx
xthinks you are using
x.b xauth
xbased x authorisation , and you are calling to a off site host , or
xto a different username , it will attempt to copy an authorization
xkey to the remote account. otherwise it will try to use
x.b xhost(1)
xto grant access to the remote host.
x.sh options
x.tp
x.bi l username
xuse
x.i username
xas the remote username instead of your local username. in the absence
xof this option , the remote username is the same as your local username.
x
x.sh environment
xif set , the values of path , display , xenvironment , xapplresdir ,
xxfilesearchpath , xuserfilesearchpath , openwinhome , ld library path ,
xand xauthority are exported to the remote program , unless the
xremote username is different , or the remote host is off site , in which
xcase only display is exported , with in all cases any variables named in the
xvariable rxenv.
x.pp
xthe display variable is tweaked as appropriate , to contain as qualified
xa hostname as is needed.
x.sh diagnostics
x.tp
x.ib command do n't recognise my name.
x.b rx
xcannot decode the name it has been called under. in this case
xit prints a warning message , and continues , as normal.
x.tp
x.b rx usage rx l username hostname args...
xthis means it could not decode the arguments given to it.
x.sh author
xduncan sinclair sinclair@dcs.glasgow.ac.uk , july 1992
x.br
xoriginally based on a program with the same name from the
x.b gwm
xdistribution. to distinguish this rx from other programs
xwith similar names , you should refer to this program as the
x.b glasgow
x.br rx .
x.sh see also
xx(1) , rsh(1) , xterm(1) , xauth(1) , xhost(1) , gwm(1)
x.sh bugs
x.b rx
xmakes a number of assumptions about the relationship between the
xlocal user , and the remote one , depending on whether the remote
xhost is onsite or not , and whether an alternative username was used
xor not.
x.pp
xin particular , if either the locally used shell , or the remotely
xused shell is the standard bourne shell ,
x.b sh(1)
xthen strange things are more likely to happen. especially when
xit 's only one of them.
x.pp
xsometimes quoting can get messed up.
x.pp
xit 's too easy to fool the smarts in
x.b rx
xto make it believe something that is not true , and fail because of it.
x.pp
xwhen
x.b rx
xuses
x.b xhost
xto grant access , the
x.b xhost
xcommand may fail silently.
x.pp
xif
x.b rx
xtries to send to large a command to the remote machine , it will
xlikely fail with a parse error from csh. if this happens , you
xwill probably have to reduce the size of the exported environment.

x
x copyright 1992 duncan sinclair sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk
x
x last modified early april 1993.
x
x distribution limited , as per the usual mit copyright.
x
x remote execution of x programs. based on a script in an old version of gwm.
x
x to install , put rx in your bin and make rxterm a link to it.
x some configuration will be necessary , see config comments...
x
x more and more this is less and less like the original....
x
x major hacked to work for our(my) set up , and also partly
x re written to work with sh , rather than ksh.
x
x maybe i 'll turn this into our first zsh script !
x
x looks like it turned into a perl script at some point big improvement.
x
x this code tries to be intelligent in the way it works. this means there
x are tons of implicit assumptions about the environment it is run in.
x these assumptions are all valid on the machines i use , and in my
x environment. at the same time , i try to make as few assumptions as possible
x about the remote machine. here 's a list of all the more tricky ones...
x ) that the remote machine has csh. (linux \? )
x ) that rshell bin (k) \? sh remote shell bin (k) \? sh. (make same.)
x ) if remote shell sh , that path is compatible. (use csh , etc..)
x ) i pass a cookie to the remote machine if need be , but does it
x know what to do with a cookie. (eat it \? )
x ) there must be others...
x
x why am i using csh to run the remote commands \? simply because it does n't
x interact badly with rsh , and hang waiting for a file descriptor to
x be closed. i 'd rather use zsh , or bash , or even perl , but they are not
x as universal as csh.
x
x
xrequire stat.pl
x
x what we called \?
x
x argv0 0
x argv0 s .
x
x config
x change these variables to be your domain name , and a pattern that
x will match all variations on your domain name. you must include
x those leading dots ! ! ! if your hostname includes your domain , see
x the code further down , marked xxx
x
x dom .dcs.gla.ac.uk
x dompat .dcs( .gla(sgow) \? ( .ac .uk) \? ) \?
x
x config
x change this to your value of bindir , or set the variable to if
x you think your users are smarter than that.
x
x xpaths usr x11 bin
x
x config
x make this the name of your remote shell command.
x
x rsh rsh
x
x end of config
x
x some variables we 'll no doubt use sometime...
x
x usage argv0 usage argv0 l username hostname args... n
x rshell (getpwuid( )) 8 bin sh
x home env home (getpwuid( )) 7
x xauth env xauthority home . .xauthority
x logf .rx.log
x@stuff ()
x debug 0
x
x before anything else , close stdin. this might stop rx hanging
x due to rsh weirdness.
x
xclose(stdin)
x
x do a l flag...
x
xif ( argv 0 eq l )
x shift
x user argv 0 die usage
x @luser ( l , user)

x
x
x pick a host , any host...
x
x mach argv 0 die usage
xshift
x
x things to think about for the remote machine.
x
x mach s dompat
x offsite mach .
x
x where am i \? seems we ca n't trust the dumb user to set hostname right !
x
x hostname env hostname `hostname` current host
x hostname `hostname` current host
x hostname s n
x
x if all your hostnames include your domain , comment out the next line.
x
xif ( offsite ) hostname hostname . dom xxx
x
x now we know where we are , and they are , are they different \?
x
x diff hostname ne mach
x
x what is the display going to be \?
x ! ! danger ! ! heavy regular expressions follow...
x this needs to be re written to be modular and can so be extended to
x support resetting host to unix , as required.
x
x display env display 0.0
x display s dompat
x display s (unix) \? ( d( . d) \? ) hostname 2 if ( diff)
x display s ( . )( d( . d) \? ) 1 dom 2 if ( offsite)
x env display display
x
x here comes the hard bit in sh. quote our args.
x also have to quote quotes. to cope with csh braindamage ,
x quotes are quoted thus ' ' ''
x so for an arg foo'bar , we get 'foo' ''bar' .
x
xforeach (@argv)

x we want to pass a cookie here.
x
x if ( e xauth)
x
x this is going to be unsecure , as the cookie will appear in a number
x of command line args. but at least it 'll work.

x )
x
x braindead bourne shell , needs to be given a path...
x we would rather not pass the current path , because it might not work
x on the destination machine. i 'd rather it was set by the user 's
x remote shell during the rsh.
x fortunately , all my x programs are in an arch independant place , and
x so it should n't cos a problem , locally.
x we check against rshell , because they might be running another shell ,
x differant from their login shell. i know , sounds weird , but it 's too
x common round here.
x i 've also included ksh in the brain damage , cos i ca n't see an easy way
x to pass throught env env without it being too late. (we only have
x one person who has ksh as a login shell anyway...)
x oh , yeah.. we are assuming that if it 's bourne shell here , then it 's
x bourne shell there. much more important than this is that it it isnt

i use those routines in a widget which only redraws exposed areas.
here 's a small piece of code that uses those routines

static void redisplay(pw , ev , region)
xtpmanagerwidget pw
xexposeevent ev
region region

pp exposure region is an xregion
xtpmanagerpart pp pw plotter
pp exposure region xcreateregion()
region is passed via an expose event
if(region null)

if (ev send event) synthetic event sent by widget it wants a full redraw

exporect.x pw core.x
exporect.y pw core.y
exporect.width pw core.width
exporect.height pw core.height

else

exporect.x ev x
exporect.y ev y
exporect.width ev width
exporect.height ev height


stuff deleted

region now contains the exposure region
xunionrectwithregion( exporect , pp exposure region , pp exposure region)

else
xunionregion ( region , pp exposure region , pp exposure region)
stuff deleted
we need to clip on expose region for redrawing the grid
xsetregion(xtdisplayofobject(pw) , pp plotarea gc , pp exposure region)
stuff deleted
check to see if child is exposed
if (xrectinregion (pw plotter.exposure region ,
child core.x ,
child core.y ,
child core.width ,
child core.height ))

so , i build up a region of exposures so that when i service my container
widget redraw of rectobj children , i only redraw what need to be redrawn.

it works for me , hope this helps you.

i 've run into a bit of a snag while trying to get mac x up and running and would appreciate
any responses from anyone who may have seen this problem.

on my local network , i have a number of macs , suns and sgi machines.

i have installed macx mactcp on all of the macintoshes and can run xclients on the sgi machines
all the live long day. the problem is when i try to run an xclient on any sun , i setup
the command in macx , then execute it. nothing happens , i do n't even get any command output.

now , i thought it might be a routing issue , but i can run remote xclients on the suns from my sgi
machines , as well as vice versa. i can also run remote xclients on sgi machines that
are not on my local net here , but the above problem holds true for non local suns as well.

i tried to send this as private mail , but mail to benj@ossa.hq.nasa.gov was
rejected , so here it is

here is an extract from the readme file that comes with macx

users of remote commands with sun machines may find that their remote commands
appear to do nothing and there is no output from the sun machine. this is due
to a feature of the sun rexecd network daemon which quietly disconnects from
requesting machines that are not known to the sun s network address ( etc hosts
or nis hosts) database. to successfully use remote commands with a sunos based
machine , there must be an entry in the network address database for the
macintosh which is running macx.

just create the window in the place you want it and set the program

then , assuming they have a non brain dead window manager , the user can
say whether they want to us program specified positions or not. for
tvtwm the usepposition command in the .tvtwmrc will do this.

now , i'm sure that by the time this message gets out of our local news

the shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its
positioning request. the window manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
me all information greatly received.

this problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents
windows , a misfeature of the x protocol , and a bug in the xt intrinsics.

the intrinsics bug is that it ignores the (x , y) position given in
reparentnotify events. olwm is structured in such a way that , when a window
is popped down , the last event the client receives is a reparentnotify event.
at this point , the intrinsics' notion of the shell 's location is out of date.

if a setvalues is done using the same (x , y) position , the intrinsics thinks it
needs to move the shell , so it issues a configurewindow request to move it
there. however , a (mis)feature of the x protocol is that a configurewindow
request that has no effect will generate no configurenotify event. the
intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive , and times out after
wmtimeout has expired. (actually , things are somewhat more complex because
the request is redirected to the window manager , but the net result is the
same.)

the solution is for the intrinsics to note the (x , y) positioning information
in reparentnotify events. this has been implemented and is available in x11r5
public fix 20. this is xbug 5513 for those of you who are interested in
gorier details.

subject colormap problem
organization f31
lines 24

i am saving an image on one machine and redisplaying the image on
another machine (both are hp 9000 model 750s). the image is created
using xcreateimage and xgetimage and displayed with xputimage. the
image is redisplayed correctly except that the colors are wrong because
the server on the other machine is using a different colormap.

i tried saving the colormap (pixel and rgb values) and on the redisplay ,
performed a table lookup against the new colormap. this did n't work
because some rgb combos do n't exist in the new colormap.

is there a way to force the server to load colors into set pixel values , or
is there a simpler way to solve this problem \? i tried using xinitcolormap
but could n't get that to work either.

any help would be appreciated.

it works fine , but the following will not work

the problem is that after i do the

this appears to work. i then do

sprintf(tmp str , r d , fun)

the problem is that the new info is drawn but the old info is

when it redraws the new info , the old info is still there.

hi all ,
this is the first time i 've posted to the net , so i hope this is

i'm looking for software packages that run on an ibm pc clone that
allows me to display openlook and motif windows on the pc.
the idea is to use the pc as a cheap x windows terminal for use by
process engineers at work.

if you already own all the clone equipment then there are lots of such
programs (see a current copy of unix world magazine).

but your performance will suck lemons running an xserver on a clone.
(from experience). you would be much better off with an xterminal if this
is a new install. the performance will be at least four times better.
in addition it would be much easier to install and use. on top of that
they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4mb ram , ethernet card ,
very high performance graphics card , good monitor , server software , tcp ip
for clone software , mouse , keyboard , etc , etc , etc.... you spend a whole
lot of ).

i can get 15 tektronix xp11 terminals for under 900 , and the performance
is over 80000 xstones.....

i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif , but i'm hoping
is really just a mistake on my part. does anyone know anything about
this problem........

i am using an xmtextfield , and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded
text string (ascii or kanji) either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring.
the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed , the text is getting
truncated , depending on the setting of the environment variables
lang (more specifically lc all). when they are set to japanese ,
the text gets truncated. when they are set to english , everything
works fine. i am taking the default for xmncolumns.
(please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual
application , just in my sample code to make things easier)

i am running motif 1.2 , x11r5 via hpux9.01. my test program is set up
to handle 16 bit kanji characters. i have remembered to do
xtsetlanguageproc() prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources
are set to japanese fonts.

do n't know if this matters , but my dialog box and textfield is initially
created with uil.


the problem does not happen with xmtext. unfortunately substituting
xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable
alternative (way too much code to be modified while in beta ! )

i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone
wants it. my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not
properly allocating memory for japanese , but since i do n't have the
source to look at it is just a guess.

the problem was that textfield was improperly walking the string it used
the character count instead of the byte count... a significan oops .
the problem has been fixed and the patch is included in the latest periodic
patch from hp support services.

this is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking



i am attempting to add a working savescreen function to a new

debugging i can see that my savescreen function is being called with on 0 ,
which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.

my problem is that this function is never being called again with on 1 , even
after i have moved the mouse and or typed some keys. my question is what am
i likely to be missing that would cause this problem \? i copied the basic
design of my function from the existing versions

static bool next savescreen(scr , on)
screenptr scr
bool on


this was copied from the omron server code is it the right way \?
if (on ! screen saver on)

if (on screen saver on) save user 's current setting
next save screen brightness nxscreenbrightness(my eventhandle)
nxsetscreenbrightness( my eventhandle , 0.0) blank the screen

else unblank the screen
nxsetscreenbrightness( my eventhandle , next save screen brightness)


return true


i can see in the server os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the
saver , but i cannot find where it wakes up the server and unblanks the
screen.

any tips help would be appreciated.

by others. did the author get permission to sell these works \? did
the author also get permission from all the people who contributed to
xv to sell their work as well \?

my guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author
maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product ,
and support for xv will begin to slide downhill.

if this is the case , then that 's a bummer. i really liked xv.

i understood that there are two methods to connect application code
to widgets

callbacks and actions

the problem i face now is that i have a quite long piece of
application code
that performs a lot of drawing into a window. i want to connect this
to a
widget. no problem so far. i could use a callback function or an
action to do this , processing any events afterwards.

but because the drawing takes some while , i want the application code
sequence
to be able to be interrupted by events. then i want to handle the
events
and resume with processing the application code at the point it was
interrupted.
it seems to me that this is n't possible , but how can i give the user
the
impression that his inputs are immediately processed \?

use a workproc. see xtappaddworkproc(3xt).

you should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this
is the hard part). then , in the callback that starts the drawing ,
you call xtappaddworkproc() to call your workproc the first time.
your workproc should be a function that returns a boolean...
true when you are finished , and false when you want to keep
processing. if you return false , the workproc is automatically
re installed.

note that this method is better that using a time out loop , since
events get processed in a more precedence oriented manner. if you
are using the same ada bindings i am , however , you are hosed , and
should look into xtappaddtimeout(3xt).

i have written a server program which makes socket connections to many nodes
and collects data from that nodes periodically. i need to display this data on
my x application. i tried
to invoke this server using xtaddapptimeout which works ok. but the
problem here is some time there is delay in collecting data. so i does n't
returns to eventloop during that time and my application remains busy and
it does n't respond to users input. i button press events are queued and
exected after server finished its task. now i am going to try appaddinput
call. so that it reads pipe only when there is something to read in pipe.

i am thinking of creating one pipe in which server will write and client
which is my x application will read. now i have some doubts which you may
be able to clarify.

1) when i fork a process. it will create to copy of my process. right ! !
now what does this two copies mean \? two shells. where should i fork
my application. what are the responsibilities of this processes. how
should i call this processes. \?

2) can i fork more than one processes. so that i can read from more
than one servers input.

thanks

to xannounce@expo.lcs.mit.edu

the andrew consortium
of the school of computer science at carnegie mellon
is pleased to announce

auis 5.1.1 for aix3.2
4 26 93

the andrew user interface system version 5.1 (our cdrom version) was
developed for aix version 3.1 on the ibm rs 6000 and many other
platforms. to accomodate aix version 3.2 , we have created a patch to
the sources. the patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous ftp from the
internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory
. aixpatch. for those without internet access , a 3.5 diskette can be
ordered for 10 by sending , or faxing , a purchase order to the address
below.

the base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a cdrom or ftp'ed from the
same host.

note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
auis to compile under aix3.2.



the andrew user interface system (auis) is a comprehensive environment
on top of x11 windows in which you can create , use , and mail multi media
applications and documents. a major advantage of auis is the
capability to recursively embed objects. thus , one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts , indentation , and other typography , but
also contains embedded raster images , spreadsheets , drawing editors ,
equations , simple animations , and so on. these embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects , including text.

auis has three components

the andrew user environment is an integrated and extensible set
of applications beginning with the ez text editor , a help
system , a system monitoring tool , an editor based shell
interface , and other editors corresponding to the various
available types of objects.

the andrew toolkit (atk) is a portable , object oriented
user interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
objects can be embedded in one another. with the toolkit ,
programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
easily as those that come with the system.

the andrew message system (ams) provides a multi media interface
to mail and bulletin boards. ams supports several mail
management strategies and implements many advanced features
including authentication , return receipts , automatic sorting of
mail , vote collection and tabulation , enclosures , audit trails
of related messages , and subscription management. it also
provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
low function personal computers in addition to high function
workstations.

the current public release of andrew , version 5.1 , includes support for
the new internet mime (multipurpose internet mail extensions) standards
for multipart , multimedia mail. a newer release , 5.2 , for members of
the andrew consortium has numerous additional features including new
editors for drawings , images , fonts , and user preferences.


remote andrew demo service

you can try out andrew from your own work station via the remote andrew
demo service. you need a host machine on the internet running the x11
window system. you 'll be able to compose multimedia documents , navigate
through the interactive andrew tour , and use the andrew message system
to browse through a few of cmu 's four thousand bulletin boards and
newsgroups.

to get started with the remote andrew demo service , simply run the
following command on your machine

finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

the service will give you further instructions.

the animation package i started just over 3 weeks ago. a number of the
solutions provided through discussions here have been incorporated in
the code , so have a look ! the full blurb has been posted to

this post is in two parts. to unpack the source code , extract the
articles into file1 and file2 (for example). use a text editor to
remove leading and trailing text at the cut here markers
(including the markers themselves). next type cat file1 file2
file , then uudecode file and zcat xrastool1.0.tar.z tar xvf .
read the readme file for instructions on how to proceed from there.
enjoy !

you have to do the same sorts of things that xt does with its main loop.
that is , you have to rig up a timer queue , and you have to put a

the functionality of the main loop dispatcher in xt is quite useful.

ever since i started to use xwindows (which is to say recently) i 've
accumulated a few questions about x applications. three examples follow

1) it was recently mentioned on comp.os.linux that there exists a post
script viewer. i am interested in this and any x editor that is an
improvement on xedit (which i find annoying).

try to get axe it 's a wonderful x based editor and much simpler to use than
emacs what is a overkill. of course , emacs is no editor but a religion.

2) at one point i was the proud owner of an amiga (and have since upgraded
to a '386 33). workbench (the point and click interface) used .info
files to store the data for icons associated with applications on a given
volume. i have noticed no such architecture anywhere under linux how
does xwindows associate icons with applications \? can one edit icons or
generate new ones for applications somehow \? (if it makes a difference
i'm running 'twm'.)

1) do n't call going from an amiga to a ibm 'upgrade'
2) the amiga workbench did the job of a desktop manager , and there is no
really amazing good x desktop manager in the public domain.
(i'm currently writing one... but it 's in very early stage)
3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.
4) x associates icons with nothing. a number of x window managers associate
icons with windows , in a way to ease window management.
but this has nothing to do with icons of a desktop manager application.
5) the tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.

3) i 've noticed some people have somehow discovered a way to display .gif
(or some kind of picture files) in the background , either replacing or
overlapping some the usual grey background employed by xwindows. i heard
this was done using some application , but i do n't recall what it was.

we are adding a motif wrapper to a family of data display programs.

these programs are each written as a 'main loop' with these steps
use semop to check a semaphore and if true access new data
otherwise block (new data comes quite often)
use msgop to check for messages and if true read them
otherwise continue (messages are user commands and not often)
update the display according to latest data and messages.

we typically have several of these running in windows ,
plus a data producer serving some device and setting the flag.
everyone blocking makes sure the device server gets to run.

xt and xm also have a 'main loop' model that we must fit into.
o'reilly vol iv ch 9 discusses adding a file watcher and also
how to add workprocs that are run during idle time.

we can 'open up' our existing main loop and call it as a workproc.
the problem is our blocking until new data is no longer appropriate.
neither is letting the program free run because others are hurt.

the unix select call lets you block until any of several i o are ready.
we want that for the x main loop except not file i o.
any suggestions or examples most welcome !

we run sgi personal iris and indigo systems.

hello ,

i have a problem with x11r5 on a sun386i an i hope that someone can help
me with it.
i 've built x from the mit sources after applying all patches i have got (i
think 23). building was easy. after installing everything i started x but
nothing happened but the screen and the keyboard freezed , the machine seemed
to hang. i loged in from another machine an found the sun386i running well.
'ps' told me that there 's a x server and a xterm running. and with some
experimenting with the mouse and repeatedly pressing d i blindly hit the
xterm , endet the session and got my prompt back.
i guess it 's a device problem but i did not find the correct device yet.
i 've got a sun386i with a b w framebuffer (ace 6 0688 94v 0 , rev 53)
sunos 4.0.2 and rom 4.4.
please help me. i'm able to run clients on the sun and send the output to
other machines but that 's not what i did it for.

thanks in advance ,
stefan

i'm trying to compile xftp which uses the xw widget set and i'm having
problems. we 're using motif and x11r5 and it seems that my version of the
xw stuff was only ported to r3. are there patches out to port this to r5
(or a newer port altogether) \? \?

or perhaps a newer port of xftp for use with r5 \? \?
thanks in advance.

are there any graphics texts with examples demos projects directly in
x \?

the last time i taught the course , i used a popular graphics text that
uses its own graphics package , with implementations available for
x mac pc. the problem was that after the course the students were good
at programming in the artificial package , but frustrated that they
could n't really use their skill for other work.

hi ,

i am using xdm on x11r5 with ow3 and xview3 on sun3s and sparcs running
sunos 4.1.1. prior to using xdm , i used to set path and other environment
variables (like manpath , helppath , arch , etc) in my .login file. with xdm ,
the .login file does n't get executed and therefore neither the olwm
root window nor my applications know about these variables.

i always use the following in my . t cshrc

...
f ( \? login 0 ) then
source home .login
endif
...

and in .login

...
setenv login 1
...

so i do n't need to set all environment variables in my .cshrc , but they get
set if i login via xdm or xon xrsh rx and so on.

hope this helps ,

bernward
