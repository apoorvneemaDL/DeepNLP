this summer ( july 20) my wife (michelle) and i will be in boston
attending my brother 's wedding. after the wedding we are planning
to motor up to bar harbor , maine to visit some relatives for a few
days. our summer would be made if we could find a bike (or bikes)
to borrow or rent to ride up to bar harbor and back.

here 's some important details i 've been riding for 11 years ,
(my own bikes for the past 7 years) , michelle has been riding for the
past 6 years (her own bikes) , i 've only been involved in one accident
which was caused by a cage driver running a stop sign , i currently own
a bmw r90 , michelle owns a yamaha virago 700 , we prefer cruising over
racing , we 've toured a fair amount , we 're both licensed and insured ,
and we 're nice people.

so , if anyone has a bike (or bikes ) , but the second one would have
to be a virago or something else with an equally low seat) that they
would be willing to loan us for 3 4 days in july , michelle and i would
be eternally grateful. in addition to our friendship , you would also
have the use of our bikes should you ever pass through minneapolis.
in exchange , we would be happy to take you and a guest out for dinner
and an evening of wild bike stories , or we might even be willing to
cough up some money for improvements to the bike(s) , like new tires or
something.

also , any information about bike rentals in the boston area would be
greatly appreciated.

thanks ,

just in case the original poster was looking for a serious answer ,
i 'll supply one.

yes , even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering. basically to turn left , you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first , causing a counteracting lean to

i guess i was semi serious. without using my hands , i lean and the bike
turns. when leaning , a torque is applied , at a 90deg angle to the front
wheel 's axle , just as in countersteering. however , this torque is also about
90deg from the axis of the steering head. instead of making the
bike lean , gyroscopic effect makes the bars turn , but i do n't remember
which way.

i was enjoying lunch this saturday at foodies in milford nh with an assortment
of other nedod folks when dean cookson ( yes he has not left the
country , yet) mentioned that the wiring diagram of the vfr750
shows that the light switch is a three position switch.

high beam
low beam
both beams


well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
2 position switch , but sure enough as deam expected , when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on.

this provides a very nice light coverage of the
road.

this is true for the st11 and the vfr750 and i would expect for any
other late model honda with the standard two position light switch.


it 's a make before break type of switch. if not required , it ought to be
for high low beams.

there might be a wee problem with this. if you use both filaments at the
same time , the bulb is tossing out a great deal more heat than normal.
possibly enough to shorten it 's life span. my honda crx cage a cage that
really wanted to be a bike had wimpy stock lights. so we used to run
around with both beams on. made a mucho big difference until both low
beam filaments died nearly simultaneously ! this was two weeks after
finding out how nice it was to use both beams. i replaced the lights with
quartz halogen lights and that ended the problem.

should clarify that it is the needles overlook , and not the recreation

have been marked as the anticline overlook. anticline overlook is
about 20 (dirt , if this matters to you) miles past the needles
overlook. the road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably

being related to former trainers , i have come to know that humans do have all the
advantages (well , at least one anyway). it is a little known fact that a dog will
involuntarily regurgitate and release an object that is too large to swallow. i
was told that if i were ever attacked by a dog i should ball my hand in a fist and
force it down the dog 's throat. the dog would naturally gag and release , and become
momentarily disoriented. this commonly happens to humans when we go to a doctor and
have our throats examined ( proof positive ). in the time during the dog 's
disorientation , the next move would be to wrap an arm about the dog throat in a
choke hold manner and constrict with all your might until the dog lapses into
unconsciousness ( from lack of oxygen and halting blood flow ). finally , run like
the wind to get away from the local area should the dog get up again and be really
pissed.

i know there 's already a bmw mailing list , but since it 's an r bike
only list (and limited to the r80 r100 bikes as well i believe)
i 've decided to give this a go and see how much interest there is.
please read all of this post if you plan on subscribing to the list !

there is only one restriction for the discussion on this list , that it
be about bmw 's. i do n't care which bmw , any and all are welcome. i will
probably post articles that appear in the local bmw club newsletter , and
would incourage other club members to do the same , especially tech
articles.

to subscribe to the list , send a message to the list address

bmw@rider.cactus.org

with the word subscribe (in caps) in the subject of the message. having
the word subscribe in the subject is the only way to subscribe. if you
put the keyword in the message body , your message will go out to everyone
on the list and you will be ridiculed beyond belief.

your from line must have a valid return address
the list sw will use the address in your from line

if you would like to use a return address other than what is contained
in your from line , do not send mail to the list ! send a note directly to
me (joe@rider.cactus.org) and i 'll take care of it manually.

the list sw will hack up the outgoing message from line so that your
original full name in () 's is preserved , but the return address is
replaced with the mailing list address (bmw@rider.cactus.org). this
allows you to simply reply to a message to keep it on the list (depending
on your mail interface natch. i use elm so that 's what i wrote it for ).
keep this in mind when you reply to a message and question the authors
parentage.

to remove your name from the list , send a message to the list address
with the word unsubscribe (in caps) in the subject of the message.
having the word unsubscribe in the subject is the only way to remove
your name from the list. if you put the keyword in the message body ,
your message will go out to everyone on the list and you will be ridiculed
beyond belief.

the list is run from my home system , a poor little 286 box running a
very old version of something that smells somewhat like unix. the mta
is n't the smartest around , but i 've managed to hack it up enough to make
a decent list mta. additions and removals are handled automatically by
scripts that intercept messages based on the subject (see below) and
may occassionally goof. the sw will send a response message back when you
subscribe. if you do not receive a response within a reasonable amount
of time (my link is via uucp and sometimes runs in spurts) , send me a
message (joe@rider.cactus.org) and i 'll look into it.

if the list turns out to be too popular and the mta groks over the number
of addresses , i 'll have to freeze the list recipients until i can come up
with a better mta.

good luck...

i'm terribly sorry.

and so you damned well should be... young whipper snapper ! it 's wet
kippers at ten paces if there 's any repeat of this sort of thing !

now , in keeping with the grand tradition of wreck.moto , let 's mutate !
take your partners by the hand...

on tuesday morning i spent a couple of hours (when i should have been
working) with a torch , brazing bits of scrap metal over the biggest
holes in yamadog 's exhaust pipes (s'mazin' what you can do with a
couple of aa cells and a three volt bulb ! ). i stuck some gun gum
into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the bike.

so , last night i'm on the way home when lo' an' bloody behold , the
sodding thing starts blowing again. i check it out and the gas is
escaping from around the clamp holding the number two pipe into the
port. as far as i can see (it being somewhat hole of calcutta at the
time ! ) , the nuts are still there (stop that bloody sniggering , you at
the back ! ) , but the pipe is a bit loose.

this morning i go out to the bike and pull out the socket set to
tighten up me' nuts (somebody give that spotty kid at the back a good
slap round the back of the head ! ) , and lo' an' bloody behold
a bloody gen , i find that the outer skin of the pipe has separated from
the inner sleeve right at the clamp mating bevel. so , i stuff in a bit
of baked beanz can and a bit more of mr holts' very best gun gum and
come to work (late again ! ) so that i can ask of the oracle... will a
brazed joint hold that close to the exhaust port \? anybody tried it \?

oh , and if anybody can tell me what the differences are between a 205
and a 207 brazing rod (made by gaz yup ! the camping folks.
surprised the marmalade outa' me , too ! in that place just off the isle
of wight) i 'd be eternally grateful (twenty sodding quid for two rods
and i do n't even know what i'm buying. bloody kanji ! ).

i am having trouble starting (keeping running) my 1992 cbr600f2. i have
had problems with it since last year , but it seemed to have subsided. now
it 's back again. problem persists regardless of choke usage pattern ,
gasoline type (brand octane) and pretty much anything else i can imagine
to change. the dealer is stumped (it 's still under warranty).

i start the bike. it runs great for a while (45 90 seconds) then the engine
starts to slow down. decreasing the idle setting will increase the engine
speed. increasing the choke increases the engine speed. regardless , the
engine will eventually slow down (and stop).

once stopped , it will not restart (even after flooded engine drill). if
i let it sit (45 90 minutes) it starts beautifully and runs great for ever.
so i go out , ride it hard for 100 miles and bring it back , ride it easy
for a few miles to let it cool down , and put it away.

next day , i go thru the same drill to get it going.

any ideas \? has anyone seen this before \?

another f2 rider had similiar problems , and this is the mail i sent him ,
hope this helps resolve you problem !

allen tobias writes
check the vent tube to the tank. sometimes the tube is clogged or constricted.
this prevents gas from flowing into the carbs because of the vacuum created by
the displacement of the gasoline. this is the small tube on the bottom of the
tank , the large tube is the overflow. you will have to remove the left side
tail section to get access to this area.

good luck !

but if it was clogged , would n't this interfere with engine operation all
the time \? when it runs , it runs well.

good point , did not catch this in the original post. the only other things
which come to mind , since this is a gravity feed fuel system , is this.
the fuel petcock valve is vacuum controlled from the 1 carburator. let
suppose there is a small hole or bad seal either in the hose itself or the
vacuum valve in the fuel petcock. when it is cold , the hole is open enough
to open the valve just enough to allow gas to the carbs with the choke on ,
since the choke creates more low pressure in the carbs when on to draw gas ,
and as the engine and surrounding area warm up , the hole seals up.

one way to check fuel flow through the valve would be to pull the side
panels off and remove the fuel hose to the carbs. connect a tube of the
correct size , preferably clear tubing to observe fuel flow , on the output
side of the fuel petcock. remove the control hose from 1 carburator. make
sure the tank is full. place the valve in the on position and apply vacuum
to the control hose , preferably with a vacuum device with a gauge , to check
for air leaks. with vacuum applied , fuel should flow freely. to see if there is
a vent problem , do this with the fuel filler cap open and closed , if it
flows a lot faster with the filler cap open , then there may be something in
the vent airway which changes position and depending on the position may clog
or partially clog the vent. i have heard of some f2 fuel tanks being replaced
to fix this problem. so the things which might be defective are , the control
hose from 1 carb , the petcock valve , and possibly the fuel tank vent.

now if all of the above shows no problem of fuel flow when cold , then there
is something in the carbs screwed up , but there are so many things to check ,
i would be typing all day to list them all !

here are a few , with everything back together , apply vacuum to the petcock valve
and open the drain holes on the carbs one by one to check fuel flow. open up the
airbox and check for foreign debris or clogged airways on the carbs , there are
quite a few on each carb.

i hope something is flushed out with all this trouble shooting. if american
honda does not resolve this , get mad as hell and report them to the bbb and
call the honda customer service hotline. it is a 800 number , but i do n't recall
it off the top of my head. i called just about tires for my f2 and a few days
later a customer satisfaction inquiry card arrived at home asking how i liked
the support i received , here would be your chance to tell them what you think !

buy the service manual on the f2 , it is an invaluable source of information
for working on your bike and i might add , trouble shooting !

hear screeching tires. i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it 's the
moroon flying up right behind me , in my panic i pop my clutch and stall the
bike. luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.
i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident \? suggestions \?

the experience you describe is why i do n't like to sit with my bike in
gear i figure there 's a chance that i 'll be startled in some way and
stall my bike. and i figure this is more likely than the chance that
i 'll be unable to escape some situation because of the extra time
needed to put the bike in gear.

so i concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split second
evasive manuvers. i split lanes so i'm not at the end of the line.
(unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country) if i ca n't
split (perhaps there is n't room) then i will stop near one side of the
lane so i have an easy escape , and leave my bike in gear until the next
car has stopped. i watch in my mirrors in the mean time to make sure
it will ! whether i really would have time to move should a car fail to
stop , i have n't had to find out yet. some cars have an annoying habbit
of racing up behind you before braking heavilly , so it can be hard to
tell if they are planning to brake or not !

so in summary , position yourself for an easy exit , and then watch your
mirrors until it 's all clear.

i 'd try it on the vfr , but goddamn competition accessories has n't mailed my
order yet. hell , it 's only been two weeks and i was ordering some pretty
bizzare stuff. like a clear rf 200 face sheild , and a can of chain wax...
bastards.

for what it 's worth , i got my can in three days from chaparral. that 's
ups ground from ca to ut , ymmv. the stuff seems to work , and it does n't
attract grundge like pj 1 blue does. i gave it the acid test , a full
day 's worth of breaking in the quadracer 's new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes. if there 's anything wet stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day , but the chain looked pretty clean.

as far as mail order goes , if chaparral has it in stock (and they can
tell you if it 's in stock , or about how long it will take to back order
it if it 's not) , i usually get it in three days. competition accessories
always seems to take a week or two to deliver. motorcycle accessory
warehouse also takes a week or two , and after trying to buy some boots
from them last week , i do n't think they actually stock anything. maw was
about 30 cheaper than chaparral on alpinestars tech 7 boots , but on
monday i was hoping to get them by the end of the week , so i asked maw a
completely unreasonable question do you have them in stock \? the
conversation went something like this

i need to know if you have some boots in stock.

do you want to pay with visa or mastercard \?

i want to know if you have them in stock.

well , the computer does n't show anything , i 'd have to call the
distributer to find out if we have them.

so do you have them or not \?

do n't you understand what i'm saying \? i have to call our
distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.

uh , right. so can you do it \?

yea , call me back in an hour , and ask for phil.

so an hour later phil is n't there , but mike says he 'll check , and call
him back in half an hour. half an hour later mike is n't there either ,
but he left a note that says they 'll have them by the end of the month
(3 weeks away). screw it , the 30 bucks is n't worth the hassle. i called
chaparral and asked if they had them in stock

ooh , alpinestars \? probably not , they are hard to keep in stock ,
but i 'll check. what size \?

size 10.

let 's see , yes ! size 10 , in blue white , gray white , black...

i 'll take the blacks !

this was about noon on monday , they arrived thursday morning. once
again , three days via ups ground. i like chaparral.

i'm not completely down on maw , they often have lower prices , but be
prepared to wait.

oh , and if anyone 's in the market for sand tires and other atv stuff ,
scorcher seems like a good outfit , friendly , fast , had the tires i
wanted in stock , and were cheaper than chaparral too.

i was privelged enough to experience my first volvo attack this weekend.

i was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long , riding
down rt. 40 in groton ma. at the side of the road , sitting off on the
shoulder was the killer volvo in question. no brake lights , no turn signal ,
nothing. we were doing about 40 mph and i was following the cage in front
of me about 2.5 3 sec. back. well , as said cage passes the volvo , the
brain dead idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she does n't need to wait
for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic
so that she can turn around... so i get on the brakes in a effort to not
t bone it , and the horn in an effort to wake the bdi up. as she finishes
the turn , she looks up at me with a completely blank , uncomprehending
stare.

where can i get rocket launchers for the vfr \?

bad news right after we placed our order , the company upped its
minimum order for manufacturing. we got in under the wire (with
an order of 115 or so pins) , but as a result of the low number of
pins , we were relegated to the we 'll get to it in between other
runs bin. as a result , it seems that it may be another 4 or 5 weeks

how about the name and number of the pin place. i would think that 115
or so people calling to bitch about why orders placed after ours are getting
done first might speed things along.

sigh. that 's music to my ears , after all the complaining lois did
about the seat on my bmw...

the best passengers are those which are unobtrusive. echo the movements
and lean of your rider. look over the shoulder thats most comfortable ,
but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.

i 've found that the phrase sack of potatoes works pretty well in
describing to a passenger how s he should act.

switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders , but be
sure and squeeze your thighs while you 're doing it so your rider knows you 're
still there. ) the guard rail is n't as safe as holding onto your rider.

on a long ride with my ex girlfriend nancy , i would notice her
drifting off every so often (we were droning down highway 101 to la).
i probably would n't have been aware of this if she had n't been in the
habit of squeezing my butt with her knees to hold on. good advice.

my experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means slow down .

seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , and you will make her
experience much more enjoyable. even a normal upshift causes your
passenger to bob , so i ease off the throttle before pulling in the
clutch to eliminate this. it 's more work , but your passenger will
appreciate it ! also , i 've found that using more rear brake than normal
helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops , which
makes it much easier for the passenger to hang on. if you 're going
sport riding , have the passenger reach around you and brace themselves
against the tank so you do n't have to bear both your weights with your
arms. (again your bike will dive less too)

for few millimetres to each direction. this does n't bother me when
riding , but i guess fixing it would n't hurt. last summer i took the
bike to a shop to have the valves adjusted , and the mechanic mentioned
that it should be an easy job. all i would have to do is to remove the
front sprocket cover and replace a bushing or a seal that i would find
there. well , upon a closer inspection i discovered that the gearchange
axle does n't even run through the sprocket cover. it seems that , in
addition to removing the cover , i would have at least to remove the
sprocket and then the cover that is behind the sprocket.

question would removing this small cover from the left side of the
engine enable me to lay my hands on that bushing seal (do n't know the
exact term in english , sorry) \?

question has anybody done this disassembly job for this or some
other purpose \? does the oil , for example , stay inside the engine \?

are they comfortable \? do they transmit a lot of

i do n't have the grips , but have looked into getting them. it 's my
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes (k1100rs , k1100lt , etc).
it 's also my understanding that the heater resides inside the bar
itself so if anything i would suspect it would reduce vibration by
providing more bar end mass.

i do n't see why they would n't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something.
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100 degree texas summers.

someone once sold heated motorcycle grips via mail order. the were
aftermarket replacement grips that had the heating elements mlded into the
grip itself. wires ran outside of the bars , from the grips to a switch and

i would prefer a picture with you in it. since most motorcycles do n't post ,
and are rather similar looking (i.e all r100s 's are more alike than they are
different) , it is the people that are ultimately more interesting.

yes , even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering. basically to turn left , you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first , causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left.

this sounds suspiciously like black magic to me. if by quick wiggle
to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right
before turning to the left , what is the input to the steering
mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old

maybe they are riding around an ever decreasing circle of lies which

me the official line here (though i do have my doubts about it) is that the
me front brake is applied first , followed by the rear brake , the idea being
me that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place.

if that 's the official line taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to , that also do n't teach countersteering , i have to
question the quality of the classes.

me too , though unfortunately the official line is the one that you
have to adhere to if you want to get a full licence. the examiner 's
guidelines are laid down by the government , and the basic rider education
courses have no choice but to follow them. it surprises me that none of the
rider groups here , either mag or the bmf make much noise about the fact that
the riding test requires you to ride three feet from the kerb all the time
in order to pass , that the front brake must be applied before the rear , that
you have to keep looking over your shoulder all the time (instead of just
when it is justified) there 's probably a few more too , which i ca n't
think of for the moment. if the riding test could be rejigged a bit
to include more of the real world survival skills and less of the
woefully simplistic crap that it contains now , then the accident figures
would (imho) reduce still further.

do n't think we should include countersteering knowledge in our test though...

i would post this one , which came to me yesterday. this is from board member
robert higdon to moa pres chich morse. this is not my words , o.k. guys \?

april 4 , 1993

re cecil king 's nominating statement

dear chick
we have a very serious problem with the election for president of the
moa this year. cecil king 's nominating statement (as it appeared in the
owners news) is 968 words , nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the by laws. in pertinent part , the rules state

each candidate 's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words. the nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.

obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task. had cecil 's
statement been cut as required , it would have concluded approximately with
the word undertiding sic in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his position statement. as a result , cecil has obtained what i view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president. this does
not just taint the election for that office it makes a mockery of the
process. i would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.
parenthetically , in your private correspondence with others , i would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an asshole you remind the
letter 's recipient that the re publication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences.
with kind regards , i remain ,
robert higdon

o.k. moa'ers , you read it , think for yourself , i trust you do know who
cecil king is , and that he was editor befor don douglass , and he is
a pres. candidate. i let you draw your own conclusions.

i 'd agree with henry. the grips are really nice to have in winter ,
and are n't noticably different from 'normal' grips in summer.

my only complaint is that the 'low' setting might as well be 'off'.
this has been complained about by every reviewer , official and
unofficial , that 's ever talked about these grips. the 'high' setting
is often too high for use with lightweight summer gloves when things
just get a bit nippy , but since 'low' does n't produce a noticable
effect , i end up turning the grips on and off to keep the temperature
about right. this generally is n't a problem when wearing thicker
winter gloves. when i asked the dealer if they could fix it , i
received a consoling pat on the back , and their sincere apologies for
the poor design (actually , i was told they worked just like they were
suppose to).

hello folks ,
i'm very happy with my new r80gs. my range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that 's 50 mpg ! ! surprisingly , the bike is a real cruiser. i was expecting
something rough. she 's a sweet backroad honey. and i can go pretty much
anyplace i 'd take my mountain bike. as far as shaft effect , it 's more a
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. maybe
i do n't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect , but in my opinion

not to start another shaft effect discussion , but the twist you
feel when revving sitting still is due to the larger fly wheels that
the bmw r bikes (maybe k 's too , dunno) use. if you whack the throttle
at stop lights , it 'll really rock the bike over (to the right).

snip snip
2) i run two lights , the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar. the illumination 's excellent that way , with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side) the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right , and it
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking , etc.) combined with the
headlamp on high you can see like day. but i 've heard that bmw alternators
do n't crank out too much. do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i'm
puttering around in the dirt at low rpm \?

please post if you come to any conclusion on this. i am thinking
of putting a light on each cylinder guard on my r100s , and was
wondering whether i was going to have to switch lights off every
time i was under 5 , 000 rpm )

well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
2 position switch , but sure enough as deam expected , when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on.

this provides a very nice light coverage of the
road.


hmmmm i noticed sometime ago that i could do the same on my virago , and
since i do n't read many schematics , i did n't really think aobut it too
much. yes it does provide excellent coverage , but i figured it would
probably draw a little too much current. i also figured that it was
overlapped just to prevent a blank spot of no headlight. are you saying
that these switches are designed for the hi lo combination \?

sheesh , even a trained attack dog is no match for a human ,

i agree with this 100 .

me , too... for chihuahua 's. the police and the military do n't train
dobermans and shephards and use them as weapons because they are so
easy for the average joe to defeat barehanded. you may have opposing
thumbs , but the dog has teeth so effective some of yours are named for
him. he has ir vision , better hearing and better smell than you do ,
and most likely faster reflexes.

you 're on a motorcycle , he 's on paws. roll on and blow him off. he
does n't even have net access.

oh bull pucky , ed. they use dogs because a) many people are
scared shitless of them and b) because of the nose and the
vision and hearing. without their cop partner in attendance ,
the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with
a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force.

oh horse puckey. without their cop partner in attendance , they are less likely
to be controllable without the use of force which would kill the dog.


those teeth are n't very much good with an arm shoved into the
back
of the animals throat and held there , and the neck is not

o.k. so you 've disabled the dog 's mouth , and given up use of your arm to do
so. how `bout them front and read paws , and the fact that to plug up that
mouth you 've given the dog the advantage of balance...

espcially strong. neither are the leg joints which can be
easily snapped , or the skull easily crushed , on even the largest
dogs.

have you ever tried to snap leg or crush the skull of a dog without use of
hardened instruments such as a baseball bat \? without the use of both arms and
full cooperation of the beastie involved , it 's not that easy. oh , but wait ,
you 've got your arm shoved in the dogs mouth. you lose....

your advice is correct , but a dog is still no match for a trained
human in a fight.

oh now you qualify you earlier statement by saying a trained human.

sheesh , even a trained attack dog is no match for a human ,
we have all the advantages.

most people here have not been trained to deal with a dog that wants to maul
you. get a clue.

sound like the pilot circuit was say lean clogged. i do n't think
water would cause a problem like this , but \?

apparently the oil pump is doing its job , and there was plenty
of oil. why did it seize \?

see above. were you by chance coasting when it stuck \? on a two stroke
you only have (substantial) lubrication when you are giving the bike gas.
if it was lean on the pilot , that 's why it stuck.

oh , btw the motor had been rebuilt just before i left adelaide , so had
done about 1600 miles when it blew. it was rebuilt because it had been
seized at some time before we got it , and it looked like that seizure
had happened at low mileage , because there were still hone marks in the
bore.

the rebuild we did consisted of a total tear down , new piston , rings ,
small end bearing , and new gearbox bearings. big end and rod judged
ok.

the highway patrol took a few of the opposition senators out and gave

for some bizarre reason , nc is the only state where the governer has no

it looks like it uses the same hardened steel as a kryptonite u lock ,
but unlike a u lock , it is hinged in 5 places and opens out to a large
rectangle (longer length than any u lock i have seen , plus it folds down

grr. hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.

went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after
work , only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the
ride was very zen.

got up this morning , needed to go home and get some disks stuff to work
on her computers with , rainy as all hell. soaked and cold by the time i got
home.

since i did n't have another set of thermals which were dry , i said to heck
with it and drove my cage back up.

lo and behold , those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm
yellow thing i have n't seen in quite awhile showed up when i was 10 minutes
into the trip.

and me in my cage. oh joy.


happily , my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the
bike when i first got it , put on an emgo replacement mirror... hated it the
entire time that thing was on my bike because i could n't see a damned thing
through it , plus it 's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors , so you
get a narrow angle wobbly blur)... and i got a replacement windshield for my
fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but
annoying)... so i spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing
them this afternoon.

'bout the only thing i still hate about the bike ('75 cb360t) is the damned
2 d cell flashlight headlight.

has anyone seen a good source for 25 watt halogen passing lights \? since
the charging system on the cb360t ca n't handle continuous use of a 50w
halogen headlight , i was thinking about putting a couple passing lights
on... that would give me 70w of lighting for the rare night riding i do ,
but would n't drain the battery during normal use (chiefly day trips and
commuting to work and back)...

i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja.
this will be the the first time i 've taken anyone for an extended ride
(read farther than around the block ). we 'll be riding some twisty ,
fairly bumpy roads (the mines road mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans).

this person is 100 lbs. and fairly small , so i do n't see weight as too much
of a problem , but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go \?

my fiancee' and i do quite a bit of sporty riding 2 up. i 'll tell you
what we 've found and the systems we 've worked out.

on starts , accelerate much slower than usual. it 's tough for the rider
to judge how scary fast acceleration is , because we 're holding onto something
and leaning forward. remember this.

on turns , have her lean forward and at the same angle as you (normally
this means she is n't leaning at all.) it 's very disconcerting to be leaned
over and have your passenger leaning so that they 're sitting straight up.
much balance is lost and this can be dangerous.

on slowing and stopping , do so much slower than usual. again , it 's tough
for the rider to judge how scary fast deceleration is , because we 're holding
onto something and leaning forward. however , you 'll figure it out fast
because braking too fast will shove the passenger forward into you , which
shoves you into the tank at an inopportune location.

generally , have the passenger keep her knees against you and the bike , not
out wide. this helps balance and gives her somegrip.

when you passenger is in fear , she will squeeze her knees against you.
normally this means slow down , and do it now ! .


turning so she leans with me , but what else \? are there traditional
signals for slow down ! ! or go faster ! ! or i hafta go pee ! ! etc. \? \? \?

we only have a couple signals. slow down is her either tapping me on
the back , or slapping my helmet with all her might. depends on the urgency
of the matter )

turn here is done by her pointing in the direction of an exit. this is
also the sign for cool ! look at that. i hafta pee is the same sign
as turn here . i'm hungry is the same sign. go faster is usually
done by her jumping up and down on her pegs in glee. i usually see slow
down more often than go faster .

i really want this to be a positive experience for us both , mainly so that
she 'll want to go with me again , so any help will be appreciated...

the best thing to do before the ride is to talk to a riding buddy , and
pillion on his or her bike. it 's incredibly frustrating , because you 're
in almost no control. now , multiply that feeling times ten , because
you as a rider know what your bike will do , and your passenger will likely
feel you 're about to scrape hard parts all the time , or lock up the brakes
at any moment , or go careening off the edge of a volcanic mountain , etc.
pillioning yourself is good training to take somebody on your pillion pad.

also , remember that it 's much more draining and tiring to ride 2 up
than by yourself , because you 're concentrating on much more , and
in the zen of the moment less. remember this.

oh bull pucky , ed. they use dogs because a) many people are
scared shitless of them and b) because of the nose and the
vision and hearing. without their cop partner in attendance ,
the dog is so much meat in the hands of any human with
a bad attitude and al ittle training in violent force.

one of the things that police dogs are used for is to
take the bullet instead of the human police officer.
as charles said , many people are scared of dogs and will
panic when one goes on attack. they will then turn their
weapon on the dog and this allows the police officer to
take control.

your advice is correct , but a dog is still no match for a trained
human in a fight.

a single person vs. a single dog in a face to face confrontation should
really be no contest. the dog is no match for a human willing to fight.
multiple dogs is a different story . . .

description of a pretty rowdy sounding party

and still we wonder why they stereotype us...

erc.

whacha mean 'we'...ifin they (whom ever 'they' are) want to stereotype me
as one that likes to drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their
beautiful bodies i like that stereotype.
if you were refering 'stereotype' to infer a negative you noticed we
did n't rape , pillage , or burn down the town. we also left mucho bucks as in
money with the town. me thinks the town likes us. least they said so.
lynn hall nos bros


they bein' themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population
bein the ones that regard bikers as a loud , irresponsible , irreverent ,
reprobate rabble.

does n't sound like they attended , though , does it \? in fact , if we riders
need friends , it sounds a lot like we might have a whole townfull from
lynn 's description , especially if the same crowd gets invited back
to party some more year after year.

sure you did n't rape and pillage it 's a relief to know that you were
such gentlemen but because you were not completely out of hand you
justify your lesser indescretions \? some pretty distorted thinking , i
should say.

you seem to be one of very few bent out of shape over these lesser
indiscretions . if the towns people are n't ruffled by the
indiscretions and the partyers are n't either , maybe the indiscretions
do n't amount to anything more threatening or damaging than harmless
good natured rowdiness among consenting adults. the only thing that
really bothered me about the description was the knee deep empty beer cans
in the street , but maybe the town had a plan to deal with that since they
helped set up the party in the first place. if i lived there and the
bikers' previous visits had established a record of mutual cooperation
and good intentions , i 'd certainly rather they stick around and party
than go riding off into the night impaired and maybe get hurt or killed.

oh i'm sorry , i just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in money)...
nevermind my criticism , i was out of line. i forgot that when one leaves
mucho bucks (as in money) their behavior is permissable , perhaps even
justified.

if it does n't hurt anyone , and all the parties to the party benefit
and consider the entire activity to be benign and harmless , then who
needs to permit or justify it \? you \? why do you need to do that \?

keep in mind that themfolks are the ones that could give a @ ! when
a biker gets killed , when their elected officials institute further
draconian legislation (helmet laws , gun controls , etc.) , the ones that do n't
respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all the
rest of the time...

ironically , these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that
do n't happen to fit the stereotype you describe. they 've developed a
friendly long term mutually beneficial relationship with a group of
motorcyclists , and are n't as burdened with mc ignorance as is the general
population because of it.

need i continue \?

if such a need exists , it surely must come from within.

so continue to wear your stigma as a badge , but the next time you are
whining about them and the effect of their values on yours , remember
that it was probably the behavior of self righteous wusses like myself
that kept them at bay for this long.

well , you got the self righteous wusses part right , anyway.

lotto@husc4.harvard.edu (jerry lotto) writes

the understanding and ability to swerve was essentially absent among
the accident involved riders in the hurt study.

the average rider does not identify that countersteering alone
provides the primary input to effect motorcycle lean by themselves ,
even after many years of practice.

i would agree entirely with these three paragraphs. but did the hurt
study make any distinction between an ability to swerve and a failure
to swerve \? in most of the accidents and near accidents that i 've seen , riders
will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare , simply because
the instinct to brake in the face of danger is so strong that it over rides
everything else. hard braking and swerving tend to be mutually exclusive
manouvres did hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable \?

apparently the instinct to brake in the face of danger is n't as strong
as the instinct to freeze up and do nothing in the face of danger. hurt
found that a surprising number of accident involved motorcyclists had n't
used their brakes at all prior to impact.

i think the only way you 'll ever use countersteering reliably and correctly in
a crisis is to make it the only conscious method of directional control you
ever use , and to practice it constantly , even when you have no need to do
any turning. if you follow me down a long straight , and i seem to be
wiggling back and forth randomly or suddenly without obvious need , it 's because
i'm practicing countersteering and avoiding imaginary obstacles directly in
my path. all of this practice may indeed be futile , but if i have even
milliseconds to react , the most familiar tactic available (and hopefully
the most automatic) will be countersteering. the same logic applies to braking
with the front brake , of course.

in response to jerry lotto 's post about not putting your helmet on your

one of the major causes of mirror breakage is impact with the pavement.
laws mandating that all mirrors be protected by helmets might be in order.
but seriously...

one place to put a helmet is on a , preferably clean , footpeg , hanging from
the chin guard , away from any hot pipes.

a few months ago , in one the the motorcycle mags , there was
an article that mentioned reflector tape that was supposed to
be available thru bmw. the idea was that the tape would look
black in sunlight , and reflect in other colors at night to
headlights. it sounded like a nice way to add nighttime
visibility without turning the bike into a carnival attraction.

i talked to the local bmw dealer about this. i was told that the
only thing he had heard about this kind of reflector , was it being
used in a coming line of bmw clothing (rainsuits). he was n't aware
of anything regarding self applied tape.

has anyone come across this from bmw or any other source \?

you may have been able to bounce the front up but not
actually do a wheelie . see the shaft effect unloads
the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front.
this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts

green cleaned the bug guts off my headlight. wonderful stuff. i recommend
that we officially delcare it a dod wonder spooge (tm) product.

i think you can get that at most head shops. i'm not kidding... although
it seems more appropriate for them to be selling simple green.

i am in hte market for a new bike (been without for a few years).
the two main bikes i'm looking at seriously are
the yamaha virago 535 and the honda shadow vlx 583.
i am leaning towards the yamaha for its shaft drive , the honda is chain.
insurance in fla. is more costly than i thought , so i am staying in this
power range. thanks in advance for any opinions and or experiences

a friend of mine (who 's probably reading this right now) just bought a new
yamaha virago 750. after spending 1 2 hours very late one chilly evening
watching him struggle with the bolts (had to remove the right peg , loosen
the brake pedal , c. c.) i 've pretty much decided never to get this
particular model unless he or someone else wants to change the oil filter
for me. compared to the 5 minute change he was used to for his honda , this
is just a design flaw oversight in my eyes.

because riding a passenger does n't really depend on the type of bike.
the things you want a passenger to do not do is the same. ergo , if he 's
asking advice , i reasoned he does n't have much practice , period. if
you say he does , fine. i still would n't take the uninitiated up a
road that 's all switch backs and reverse center uncrowned roadway , not

another good place for your helmet is your mirror ( ! ). i kid you not. if
you own a typical standard or other bike with fairly average mirrors
that screw into your handlebars , your helmet should fit over your mirror
and be fairly stable

be careful that you do not have any weight of the helmet resting on the
mirror. it will depress the foam liner in the helmet. that is not the
kind of foam that bounces back , like foam rubber. its purpose in life
is to absorb energy in an impact as it is compressed by your noggin.
if your mirror compresses it , there is that much less energy absorbing
capacity left to cushon your noggin in a crash.

i found the right handlebar to be a good spot , if on the sidestand.
hang with the chinbar facing up , balanced across the grip and brake
lever such that the weight of the helmet does n't compress any of the
chinbar foam. this is more challanging with an open face helmet.

last year i bought a krypto cable ii (3 8 x3 4' long , something like that)
that by all standards seemed like a decent piece. until i used it anyway...
before i ever used it for security purposes , i used it for entertainment
(minds out of the gutter , please) , which is to say that i sat fiddling w
it while watching tv (the night i got it). after three minutes of mindless
fiddling (of course it was mindless , remember i was watching tv) the entire
tumbler mechanism came out on the key ! not unlike that old georgie porgie
nursery rhyme. this left a very empty cylinder and a very non secure
(read swingin' in the breeze ) cable lock.
kinda makes me wonder about any flat key style lock. one yank w a

no mike. it is imposible due to the shaft effect. the centripital effects

good point john...a buddy of mine told me that same thing when i had my

you know what \? he was right !

uh , folks , the shaft does n't have diddleysquatpoop to do with it. i can get
the front wheel off the ground on my 5 , ferchrissake !

you may have been able to bounce the front up but not
actually do a wheelie . see the shaft effect unloads
the rear susspension and effectivly loads the front.
this is why a shaft bike should accelerate if it starts
scraping in a corner......


laz

sorry to be contradictory , but... i 've had my nighthawk at 45 degress
with the horizon and i was n't banked over in a turn...
the hard part is getting the front in off the ground. i rev to about
7 , 000 at drop the clutch. even harder is keeping it from coming up to far
i use the back brake as well as the throttle. once its up , it 'll wheelie just
like any other bike.

hi.

i'm not sure what the other guy (ca n't track down his post for his name)
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
they are. there 's a space between each link where the teeth of the
locking head notch in. thus , each link is a possible locking point.

also , (and this is not applicable to hard core thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxy acetylene torches) the cobralinks look a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks (imho) and i think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to bored joyriders nominally adept at
cracking unsecured bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally
functional.

finally , i notice that when i ride with my leathers , harness boots , and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (btw , i 've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock did n't pulverize any vertebrae) , cagers give
me a much wider berth , do n't hassle me , and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights.

i love my cobralinks almost as much as i love my pre 80 's honda dinosaur.

body) and i can feel the bike already shaking away).

year of riding. getting more than that really is overkill ,
as you 'll never even want to use it. the following bikes
can be bought (and repaired ! ) cheaply , are easy for a novice
to manage , and are plenty high performance
kawasaki ex 500
honda vf 500 interceptor
suzuki gs 550e

the 0 100mph time of the ex 500 at full throttle is way
sooner than you 're ready for it . ) with something
as small as a 250 , you 'd probably be wishing for more
power pretty quickly (unless it 's a tzr or rgv ).

now , i'm not saying that you 're 100 certain to kill
yourself immediately with a 600f2 or a gsxr 750. plenty
of people have started riding on those bikes and done
just fine. what i am saying is that it 's a waste of
money , and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you
drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping.
you 'll never get the throttle more than half open
anyway , so why spend the extra 2000 bucks \?

you could , but it would be considerably cheaper to spend 8 or so on

to replace the halogen lamp power supply after you fuse it trying to

well i was wrong. as i sat on the st , both feet down , all i could
think was big . then i put one foot up. heavy came to mind very
quickly. with cindy on the back was she on the back \? hard to
tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.

it is heavy , the 91 is mid 600 's dry , that is the one major drawback
of the st.

by 3000 rpm in second gear , all the weight seemed to dissappear. even

can you say tourque monster the test drive sold me on the bike ,
lot 's of bite anywhere above 2500 in any gear.

on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer , slippery new tires , and pads that

did you trythe abs tcs version \?

cindy has no difficulty with speed. 3rd gear , 4th gear , purring along
in top gear. this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk. lane
changes were a new experience. a big heft is required to move this
thing. responds well though. no wallowing or complaint. behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet , but the helmet buffeting was

after market fairing windshield for 100.00 raises the bubble 6 inches
above most heads , but hurts the looks of the bike.

non trivial. top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.
smooth , smooth , smooth. not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of ,
but it is pleasant.

this is the essence of the bike , move the throttle and itr accelerates
any gear anywhere anytime , i frequently find myself at the dod min
during a casual passing maneuver.

the jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes. its a down hill , reversing camber , twice reversing radius ,
decreasing radius turn. a real squeeze is needed on the front binder.
this is a function of the weight , you have to be aggresive with the brake
squeze , actually as tested by cycle world and an expert rider the st
stopped faster then the comparable models from bmw , and yamaha even with
the extra weight and gas .
the section of 133 we were on was tight , but too urban. the st works ok
in this section , but it shows its weight. we went by the clam shack

you must countersteer the st for every turn and movement short
of the classic pothole wiggle. just forget ever leaning into a
turn again. it must be countersteered into every turn and then
responds nicely.

about half way through the onramp , i yanked cindy 's wrist , our singal
for hold on tight . head check left , time to find redline. second
gear gives a good shove. third too. fourth sees dod speed with a
short shift into top. on the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light
traffic. did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new.
well , now it had 25 miles on it , so it was ok. tried some high effort
lane changes , some wide sweeping turns. time to wick it up \? i went
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat. and stayed
there. when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering ,
i looked down to find an indicated 135mph. not bad for 2 up touring.

faster then i 've ever gone , i 'd hate to buy this bike after your
short break in period


to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front. heavy. it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put
the thing on the center stand. i am sure that if i used the side
stand the st would have been on its side within a minute.

not true , the side stand is well designed for the weight and will hold
the bike nicely on dirt. i am able to easily get the bike up on
the center stand , just step down on the stand instead of pulling
up on the bike.

my demo opinion \? heavy. put it on a diet. smooth , comfortable ,
hardly notices the dod speed. i 'd buy on for about 3000 less than
list , just like it is. too much for the bike as it is.

keep looking the 91 left overs if available are going for 72 7700.
i love mine and i have n't found a better value then the st for 7500.
remember you get 3 years unlimited mileage warranty.

yep , it works like a charm. i had the same problem after about 7 8 years
of constant use , and i was thinking of seeing how much eclipse would
want to install a new zipper. but someone (i think it was chuck karish)
suggested i try that trick. it took a couple of tries to get the right
amount of squish , but it 's been fine for about 3 years since i squished
it. it should work for any of the nylon coil type zippers.

otoh
i tried this on my hg concord jacket thursday night. really , i just
made a tiny adjustment type of squeeze. really.

is (was \? ( ) your hg zipper the nylon coil type or the kind with
molded plastic teeth \? i 've only tried it on the coiled nylon type , and
it does n't take much squish to fix the problem. i found i was overdoing
it (no broken parts , but the zipper was too hard to pull) so after
spreading the zipper pull jaws again , i tried with vice grips. no , not
the usual grip of death technique , i adjusted the closed vice grips so
they were snug on the zipper jaws , then released them and tightened the
adjusting screw a bit. a couple of iterations and i had just the right
amount of zipper squish (tm).

result i now know that noplace in spokane will even consider trying
to repair a broken zipper closer thingy , which must be a 0.30 part
which needs a 20 tool to install.

i 've had two zipper pulls fail on my aerostich suit (actually on the
accessory ellipse) , and they sent me a few replacement pulls free of
charge. i do n't know what brand of zippers hg uses , but parts are
available for ykk 's plastic zippers. replacement was pretty simple , just
break and remove the plastic knob at the top of the zipper that keeps
the pull from coming off the top end. slide on the new zipper pull. then
crimp on (vice grips again ! ) a replacement zipper stop.

you might try fabric stores such and see if they sell replacement
parts.

oh , for what it 's worth , the coil type zippers on the eclipse tankbag
are also ykk.

when how do you decide that it is too windy to ride \?

when it 's too windy to stand.

when you 're on the road in high winds , stay alert. even more alert
than your alert 'cause you 're on a motorcycle and they 're out to kill
you kind of alert. be aware of the terrain , and how it may funnel
wind in sudden gusts (well , not gusts to somebody standing there , but
it 's gusty 'cause you ride through it). if you are riding in a steady
crosswind , be aware of a hill that will block the wind , and adjust your
lean angle. be aware of passing trucks to your windward side , your
lean angle will change dramatically both as you enter and as you leave
their turbulance cone. reducing your profile may help , ie , lean on the
gas tank and kiss the triple clamp. keep a nimble hand on the
steering , be ready to countersteer into and out of sudden wind bursts.
keep a larger than usual buffer zone , both ahead and behind , and to the
side , you can easily be blown half a lane over before you can react by
countersteering. keep a close eye on traffic in your mirror , if
someone is coming up wanting to pass , get out of their way early. stop
often for short brakes , extensive riding in high winds is both mentally
and physically fatiguing.

i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja.
this will be the the first time i 've taken anyone for an extended ride
(read farther than around the block ). we 'll be riding some twisty ,
fairly bumpy roads (the mines road mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans).



an extended ride as a passenger on a 750 ninja.

owww.

well , i hate to be a wet sock , but , well...

i was a passenger on many bikes for the longest time before i started
riding myelf , and i grew to hate long rides on sport bikes. the passenger
seats are not designed for long rides. the passenger positions are n't
even usually designed for short rides. i ended up torturing my knees and my
back by taking long rides as a passenger on sport bikes. one of the
reasons i originally liked my current guythingy so much was becase he had
a bmw. )

i 'd suggest a shorter extended ride at first a short turn in the mountains
or some such. then see how much pain she 's in , and proceed from there.

the best advice i 'd give a beginning passenger

do n't get on the bike until the rider says its ok , and work out some sort
signal for the rider to tell you when its ok to get off. after i get on
the bike i squeeze my riders hips to tell that i'm ready , and at the stop
he nods his head to show its ok for me to get off.

keep your feet on the pegs at all times. do n't wiggle (unless your rider
asks you to )

the best passengers are those which are unobtrusive. echo the movements
and lean of your rider. look over the shoulder thats most comfortable ,
but during turns look over the shoulder on the inside of the turn.

get used to your rider 's shifting style (riders use a reasonably
consistent shifting style). avoid helmet bonk. helmet bonk is
when your rider revs the bike up and then shifts and the sudden change
in foreward acceleration causes your helmet to bonk his hers. it
gets old real fast.

when pulling to a stop , put a hand or both hands on the tank to keep
your weight from pushing your rider up onto the tank. putting your hands
on the tank is also a good way to stretch your back if you 're in pain ,
but i'm told it gets harder to steer in turns if you leave them there.

switch your hands to the guardrail to stretch your shoulders , but be
sure and squeeze your thighs while you 're doing it so your rider knows you 're
still there. ) the guard rail is n't as safe as holding onto your rider.

do n't be afraid to ask for frequent stops if you 're in pain or
losing feeling in your feet. passenger seats are not generally designed
for comfort. work out some sort of pull over signal beforehand.

after failing my state of new hampshire noise gestapo test with my hd

problem at about 97 db.

two points

first , i do n't think the first dude did the noise test correctly.
holding the meter close to his body probably caused a high reading , and
doing it inside the garage with the door closed undoubtedly enhanced
the db level ! so if any other nh riders need to get this done , make
sure the inspection is done outdoors with the meter held well away from
the body.

second , these bub pipes are bloody terrific. at low revs or cruising
through town , they as quiet as the stock pipes , but have a sound thats
a more throaty , purring , rumble. when you open her up to 3000 rpm
they emit a wonderfully satisfying rumbling roar. best of both worlds !

1. all of us that argue about gyroscopes , etc. , throughly understand
the technique of countersteering.

including all the ones who think that they countersteer all the way
through a corner \? \?

well... all the way through a decreasing radius corner , anyway...

this is really the only thing we disagree on. maybe we should agree to
disagree \? \?

ok (but i'm right ! ) )

the official line here (though i do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first , followed by the rear brake , the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place.

if that 's the official line taught in those rider education classes
you were refering to , that also do n't teach countersteering , i have to
question the quality of the classes. the official line in msf
curricula is as i described. maximum braking is achieved by applying
both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even and
both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear to
prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the front , as more
traction is available to the front due to increased normal force due to
weight shift.

the official line you have been taught seems ineffective on the face
of it. applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage
of all the traction available to the rear at time 0 , and is halving the
available braking power by using only the front at time 0.

saying , brake until the tire just begins to slide is next to useless
advice to a newbie. he has to go out and slide the tire to find out
where that is ! it also gives him zero information from which to
develop a braking technique that changes as the braking and
corresponding weight shift develop.

if you do n't slide the tyre , you have no way of knowing whether you 've
achieved maximum braking or not. i'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can but if you want to find the
limits of the machine , you have to go beyond them.

not necessarily true. chirping the tire indicates impending lockup
(on most surfaces) , and serves as a good guide to newbies to indicate
maximum braking. i agree that totally locking the front occasionally
makes one a better rider , but it is a manuver best saved for an
experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like
code used to use.

in any case , for maximum braking , if (as i suggested) you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding , then you 'll be doing
exactly as you suggest ! !

true , but from the point of view of how to best teach riding skills
(which is how this discussion started) , keep both wheels just on the
point of sliding is nearly useless information. you need to teach a
technique , or at least a strategy , to achieve this.

how do you know what kind of gas to buy \? depending on the compression
ratio of your engine i heard. ok , but what kind of gas goes for what kind
of compression.

i'm asking this because i used to put 87 in my hawk gt and the other day ,
i changed because i wanted to see if there was a difference. and i do n't
know if i'm being subjective or what , but it seems like the bike runs
better !

run your bike on the lowest octane that it will run smoothly on.
higher octane fuel is not better than lower octane gas. pick up the last
american roadracing magazine. there 's a short article in there about
octane and the misconceptions many people make about the subject. look at
your owners manual. i believe it states 87 is just fine.

the first few times i pillioned someone whose safety was a great concern to
me (as opposed to brothers , etc.) , i almost got us both killed on several
occasions.

i was surprised to discover that it is much safer to just drive than to
distract yourself by trying to be unusually cautious and concerned. abruptly
adopting a novel set of thought patterns and riding strategies while piloting
a bike is just asking for trouble.

hear screeching tires. i dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it 's the

i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident \? suggestions \?

i 've only ever done it in an automatic. i was sitting in my olds , in
the winter , at a light , when i heard screeching behind me. i managed to
dart into the left turn lane before the sliding jetta wound up half
where i was and half in the parked car beside where i was. i 've never
had occasion to do it on a bike , but i imagine that it would be even
easier , because you could slip beside the car in front. giving a gander
at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch
out smoothly when you notice trouble , instead of waiting for the
screeching.

wheelies on lead wings are possible , but they ai n't easy , or so my

me. as for how high , how high do you want 'em \? modulation is n't
exactly the easiest thing in the world , or so says a guy 57 years old...

well , apparently once you get past about 6 inches , all the luggage shifts back in the panniers , the passenger slides back , and the dog ends up hanging onto the top rack ,
and they go all the way over until it 's flat on it 's ass , with the front wheel
straight up in the sky. impressive , but hard on the tail lights. )

yup. do it whenever i am in the cage (which is not often if its riding weather
... ie no snow). i find arm out and down and kinda finger wave works best for
sport bikes and arm out up works best for harleys. similar to how i wave when
i am on the bike.

generic bike riders actually seem to raise the hand entirely
off the handlebar and wave it around , so it 's easy to tell
when they 're waving.

and doders are easily recognized by their own special wave.
pay attention and i 'll tell you how to do it. hold your left hand out
in front of you , fingers straight but apart like a vase. you may also
use your right hand if you have a throttle lock or are stopped. bring
your fingertips and thumb together , touch , and open back to the starting
position. while you are doing this , move your hand slowly to the left.
do it gracefully and with a waving motion. you are now imitating a
squid propelling itself about underwater probably in search of food ,
drink , squids of the appropriate sexual orientation , or other squids to

i just got back from the 11th annual southern california harley dealers
association run to the colorado river city of lauglin , nevada.

why is it that some people ca n't enjoy themselves without being assholes \?

if you want to be treated with respect , you need to treat others , their
property , and their towns with respect.

several years ago , i was at the annual fly in of the experimental aircraft
association (eaa) near oshkosh , wisconsin. although approximately 100 , 000
people were in attendance , there was not a piece of litter anywhere. everyone
was considerate enough to place their trash where it belonged.

there 's no problem in having fun , raising hell , etc. but consideration
and respect for others is critical we need to work with each other , not
against.

nudity , fine...loud noise , fine...party all night , fine... but at the right
place and time. please , let 's not trample over other 's rights and then bitch
because they do n't treat us like gods.

michael menard

you know , i was n't even going to respond to this typical anti party
attitude message. trash was everywhere reason \? not enough dipsy
dumpsters for the massive crowd. oatman was n't prepared for the vast
number of people that showed up.
btw michael , oatman is the right place time. it 's called a run ! maybe
you did n't read my comment that they loved us and i'm talking about the
merchants and townspeople. the merchants that did n't want us their shops
were closed.
maybe i should have mentioned that when i left the trash was being
picked up (aluminum sells) by a crew assigned to the task.
i think the bottom line here is do they want us back \? \? \? ! ! ! they do !
this 'action' that went on at oatman is typical on a predominatly harley
run. it 's innocent fun.
so since i enjoy typical harley fun at runs in your eyes that makes me
an asshole. i 've already admitted i'm an asshole many times on the net.
all my friends are assholes too (lyrics to a new song \? ). so , you want a
dime to call someone that cares \?
it appears we have a difference of opinion. maybe you should look at the

my first encounter with a dog chasing after my bike was on my first poker run.
a big german shepard ran out into the pack of bikes i was riding with and tried
to bite the right leg of the guy riding in front of me. he kicked the dog a
couple of times (we were all only going about 10 15mph) and just made the dog
angrier and got away by applying wfo and outrunning the dog who then started
after yours truly. at the time , i had open drag pipes (obnoxiously loud as hell)
and as soon as the dog was about 2 feet away from the right side of my bike , i
pulled in the clutch and revved the motor up to about 5000rpm and the roar of
the pipes frightened the dog away (probably made the dog 's ears hurt like hell)
and he did n't come back for the rest of the bikers behind me either.

my second encounter was with an already deceased road kill dog. i was n't paying
very close attention to the pavement when the car in front of me straddled the
carcass. i looked down just in time to see what i was about to run over so i
just held onto the handlebars and freaked out. both wheels went squarely over
the dog 's belly with a thump thump just like running over a piece of a 4x4
lumber. the bike did n't lose any stability at all and i kept on going. after
i got to my destination , i found bits of fur , meat , and blood stuck to
the bottom of my motor and frame...... gross.

i do n't have the grips , but have looked into getting them. it 's my
understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european
style grips now coming standard on the 93 bikes (k1100rs , k1100lt , etc).
it 's also my understanding that the heater resides inside the bar
itself so if anything i would suspect it would reduce vibration by
providing more bar end mass.

i do n't see why they would n't work with the old style foam grips aside
from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something.
hard to belive considering they do fine in the 100 degree texas summers.

a few random thoughts on riding with a passenger

there 's no substitute for a bike with sufficient power , having taken
passengers very occasionally on the small (125 etc) bikes i used to
ride in the uk it was hard ! i'm now riding a gs1100 and that 's great ,
even moving from my freinds gsx600 i was riding recently. this may be due
in part to the fact that neither i , nor my regular passengers , are
particularly slimline !

i always tell passengers , stay in line with the bike on corners , that makes
their movements predictable.

my regular passengers both tend to hold either the rack or nothing at all ,
i do n't really like having a passenger hold onto me except for short periods.
again that may be biased by the fact that i 've had a couple of new passengers
(a friend recently for her first time on a bike) who hold on to me real tight ,
making any kind of maneuvering difficult.

i 've also discovered that on longer trips i prefer a passenger who moves and
shifts their weight a bit. i recently took a work collegue to a meeting (about
a 1 hour ride) and he sat totally still the whole way which left me also
sitting very still and getting a sore back.

we have a code system for turns , stop and for 'i need to shift position'.

quite right , your batteries should be perfectly alright and retain

and before anyone says i'm wrong , remember that new batteries almost

i need some advice on having someone ride pillion with me on my 750 ninja.
this will be the the first time i 've taken anyone for an extended ride
(read farther than around the block ). we 'll be riding some twisty ,
fairly bumpy roads (the mines road mt.hamilton loop for you sf bay areans).

unless she is really adventurous , do not take her on this route for her
first extended ride ! that 's kinda like taking someone on a no show 10 way
speed star competition as their first skydive.

this person is 100 lbs. and fairly small , so i do n't see weight as too much
of a problem , but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go \?
i want her to hold onto me ) rather than the grab rail out back , and
i 've heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we 're
turning so she leans with me , but what else \? are there traditional

1) if the ninja has adjustable suspension , adjust it to a stiffer
setting so you do n't bottom out in bumpy curves.

2) tell her the 3 cardinal rules are

a) never ever ever ever put her feet down. not when you stop at a stop
sign , not when she thinks you 're gonna crash , never. keep them on the
pegs until you tell her to get off the bike.

b) she is to hold onto your waist. she should hold on tightly enough
that she wo n't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle a bit. and
(added bonus for you here) , she should keep as close to your butt as
possible so quick stops do n't make her slide into you and knock your
balls up onto the gas tank. you decide how best to word this.

c) just stay perpendicular to the bike straight up in the seat. do n't
lean your body into curves , just go with the bike and stay perpendicular.
do n't look over your shoulder.

3) remember at all times that you have a passenger on the back. that
means do n't pop the clutch , and try to corner and stop smoother than
usual. be aware that if you jump on the brake , you 're going to have
the equivalent of a 100 lb. dead weight crashing into you from behind ,
so be prepared for that.

4) make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she does n't
have to go. no anti women stuff here i have a tiny bladder myself.

5) remind her to look around while you 're riding. point to things
of interest. it makes the ride more enjoyable to her (she wo n't get
so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet) , and it gives
her ample excuse to squeeze you to show she saw what you pointed at.

my wife and i tried the msf recommended look over the rider 's
shoulder in curves bit , and it just did n't work. the timing of
her weight shift was unpredictable (especially on the maxim because ,
unlike the ninja , the upright riding position really restricts the
pillion 's view of the road ahead). next time i had her just remain
perpendicular to the bike , and i could hardly tell there was someone
else on the bike in curves , and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs.

well the actual ergonomics of the switch make it appear to be a
2 position switch , but sure enough as deam expected , when
you balance the toggle switch in the center position both the high
and low beams go on.

this provides a very nice light coverage of the road.

this is true for the st11 and the vfr750 and i would expect for any
other late model honda with the standard two position light switch.

thanks to dean for reading the schematics , try it you 'll like it.

be a bit careful doing this i used to balance the switch on my gs550b
avec cibie' h4 insert so that both beams were on. i eventually fried the
main ignition switch , as it was n't designed to pass that sort of current.

what was so warm and got his mouth nose muzzle burned on the pipes.

a bicycling technique i 've
employed was to use my frame mounted tire pump to fend off dog
attacks.

one of my brothers had spent a lot of time practicing bizzare tricks on
his megabuck micromass bike. he said he once repelled a dog attack by
picking up the rear of the bike and smacking the dog in the side of the
head with the rear wheel. the dog had no idea what hit him , and he
fled quite rapidly. then again , he could jump garbage cans without a
ramp , so i do n't think i 'd care to try this one on a motorcycle.

the telephone worked much better than the tire pump.

good too , but the shoulders are connected to the arms , and the arms to

can make steering interesting.

bdc driver nearly rams back of innocent biker...

i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident \? suggestions \?

glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop. i 've only been riding for
about two years , but here are my rules for traffic light survival

i try to never stop just over a hill behind a car. if i have
to stop in such a location , i pull almost completely next to the
car in front of me. if i'm the only one (ie no car in front) , i
turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane , to increase my
visibility to any oncoming vehicle. make sure to keep your
taillight visible to traffic , though. (note my bike is bright
white turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)

on a flat road , i stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually
about two or three bike lengths). this will (hopefully) give
me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.

if you are the last in a line of vehicles , watch your mirrors
constantly ! if you see a vehicle approaching , and ca n't see
any evidence to indicate that he she is slowing down , get out
of the way now !

flicker your brake light. if i'm the last vehicle in line , i
will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from
behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors , of course ).
i vary the speed of the flicker , hoping to make the cager notice
that there 's something in the lane ahead of him.

now , with all that said , it 's the situation where you are first in line
that i feel most defenseless. if you 're first in line , your forward escape
route is seriously limited you can only move forward to the extent that
you do n't enter the intersection. i leave some room behind the stop line
(although around here , the @ ! light activators are always right up
next to the stop line ! ) , and watch the mirrors. i think i 've decided
that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.
any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind
you \?

yes , even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering. basically to turn left , you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first , causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left.

this sounds suspiciously like black magic to me. if by quick wiggle
to the right you mean that the handlebars turn toward the right
before turning to the left , what is the input to the steering
mechanism that makes this happen in the absence of the old
shove shove \?

well , as many a bored bike tourer can tell you , the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
say you want to turn left. you push your body off to the left.
to do this , you have to push against something , and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike). well ,
the apple guy (wozniak \? or was that churchill \? ) says that the
ground will push you right back. so , you pushed yourself off to
the left by pushing on the ground to the right , and the ground
pushed back toward the left. well , that push is on both wheels.
the rear wheel does n't care (unless you have serious bearing
problems) (except of course on the spagthorpe dragonfly , which
had the revolutionary countersteering contra shaft drive rear end) ,
but the front wheel has trail. if the ground pushes the front wheel
toward the left at the contact patch , the trail will cause the
wheel to turn to the right. hey , there we are. no hands counter
steering.

hello folks ,

i'm very happy with my new r80gs. my range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that 's 50 mpg ! ! surprisingly , the bike is a real cruiser. i was expecting
something rough. she 's a sweet backroad honey. and i can go pretty much
anyplace i 'd take my mountain bike. as far as shaft effect , it 's more a
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. maybe
i do n't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect , but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence. okay , here are
my questions

1) any recommendations for a home made fairing \? i 'd like to keep the
wind off my chest , and perhaps my helmet , for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph) , yet do n't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding. anybody have luck with two piece
detachible fairings \? i 'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) i run two lights , the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar. the illumination 's excellent that way , with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side) the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right , and it
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking , etc.) combined with the
headlamp on high you can see like day. but i 've heard that bmw alternators
do n't crank out too much. do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i'm
puttering around in the dirt at low rpm \?

3) this is embarassing i'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning. i invariably flood the carbs , then go in and read a section
of the paper , and then she starts right up. is this a zen thing \?

4) the hayne 's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... yeah , right. what do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol \? any
particular brands of gas that are best \? additives \?

thanks ,

some potentially cool story stuff here... do share the details.

how to get a verbal warning for 146 in a 55

it 's simple. first , it has to be the first really nice riding day
of spring. the bike is back together again , and so are you. grab
all your gear , put it on , and fill the tank with 94 octane premium
or better. head out.

in ames , there is a road that leads to the little town of
gilbert. gilbert has one stop light , if that tells you something.
having just gotten the bike back together , i thought i 'd take it
for a short ride and check things out. heading out of town , i
went into the twisties at a slow pace , just under the speed limit ,
and started leaning around. the pace quickened as everything felt
just right. finally , the road straightened and i was ready for a
bit of speed. grab third gear , open her up. at roughly 90mph
grab fourth gear. look at as much of the bike as you can , and fail
to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind. twist
the throttle like a fool , grab fifth gear at 130 or so , and see
just how well she 's been put back together.

at 146 (according to radar) i noticed the front fender was
flexing a bit. thus , i slowed , pulled off the road , removed my
helmet and gloves , unslung the took kit i was carrying in a fanny
pack , and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper
pulled in all hot and flustered.

have you any idea how fast you were going \?
not precisely , no. i was paying attention to the bike and road ,
not the instruments. i just got her back together last night , and
i'm just out here testing her out before i ride it in traffic.
my radar says you were at over 145mph. care to tell me why
i should n't give you a ticket \?
because i was testing the motorcycle away from population and
traffic , on a strait and flat road , while wearing all the protective
gear that safety demands \? (note i was n't quite that eloquent)
say , what kind of bike is that , anyway \?
i was eloquent on my cafe racer replica honda 750 , a rat bike
yeah , i have n't had my bike out of the garage in years.
compare riding stories
pack toolkit , having tightened that fender
so why were you out here \?
i figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through
me. if the bike fails somehow in a 35mph zone , i'm dead. if it holds
up out here , then i know it will work right in traffic. i do this
evvery year when i rebuild her.
not any more. you 'll find a better place than my highway
to do those speeds. if i ever catch you speeding on my highway
again i'm going to nail you for everything i possibly can. now get
out of my sight before i write you a ticket.
yes , officer.
and kid , keep your eyes open out there... drives off

and that , in a nut shell , is how to get a warning for 146 in a 55.
i do n't guarantee that it will work for you , but it worked for me.

blaine gardner @ evans sutherland
bgardner@dsd.es.com

aw , c'mon. the serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points ,
not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.
the non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.

i personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.
the first does trade ``quality , '' in the sense you mention , for heat.
this has a certain surprise value and if done correctly , which i
contend was done above , is reasonably entertaining. while it is true that
the flame i posted does not mention anyone 's habitual velocity , friends ,
dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with the appropriate
flair and it is short. the weakness of this type of flame is actually
that it can easily be taken too far , at which point it becomes trite and
boring. (witness the infante thread recently....)

the other type of flame , which you seem to be glorifying above , has
a few weaknesses as well. in the first place , it can get verbose and
tedious in the extreme , particularly if the reader does not already strongly
identify with one side or the other. in the second , discussing someone 's
personal qualities , habits , and so forth can quickly become libelous.
(or is that slanderous \? i can never remember the difference.) this leads
to a proliferation of lawyers , which is widely regarded as a bad thing.
finally , introducing polysyllabic words is problematic. i ca n't haul my
big dic. around on my bike , and it would be bad form to use a word which
actually turned out to have a meaning , especially one which ran counter
to my use and flamage in general.

in summary , blaine , your score for that flame is incorrect. while it may
be the wunder flame , the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
weaknesses , and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
applicable. you also probably could n't outrun a tennis ball with a
flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and i 'll bet you and your
motorcycle lean to the outside while turning. the same goes for anyone
who looks like you , too.

subject hawk gt new seat review
keywords corbin
lines 30

unable to stand the pain anymore , my wife bought the corbin gunfighter
and lady with passenger backrest for my hawk gt.

it came with no instructions , but it came 2 weeks earlier than they
said it would. installation would have been very easy , but the seat
fastening hardware was apparently always on the wrong sides with
the stock seat ! it never was easy to put on. once i figured that
out , the new seat went on the first try. the passenger backrest , though ,
does not fit as i thought it might. the supplied screw to set the
backrest angle does not fit , and i have not yet found a suitable ,
hard , ( sae grade 8 , or perhaps 5 ) 1 4 20 bolt that fits. there is a
a soft bolt in there now just do n't lean back.

the driver 's section of the seat is a bit wider. seems comfortable
enough , but then again i put about 5000 miles on the stock seat
without a thought. the passenger 's section has about 8 times the
volume of foam that the stock seat has , and from my short test it
seems much more comfortable. the backrest helps a bit , but i 've not
has enough time to really test it. the backrest also comes with a
small pocket. its now more difficult to swing my leg up over the
10 taller seat.

if i go on the three notch ride soon ( dixville , pinkham smugglers) ,
i 'll give a more complete report , but in general it seems like an
improvement.

yep ! i did one yesterday on my shaftie vision... i should mention

the result of a necessarily agressive acceleration manouver through an
intersection (damn san antonio cagers tend to be really bad drivers).

however , i have done one by myself , it just takes a lot of

hello folks ,

i'm very happy with my new r80gs. my range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons...
that 's 50 mpg ! ! surprisingly , the bike is a real cruiser. i was expecting
something rough. she 's a sweet backroad honey. and i can go pretty much
anyplace i 'd take my mountain bike. as far as shaft effect , it 's more a
torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion. rev it sitting still
(when the driveshaft is not moving) and the bike twists a bit. maybe

if the clutch is in , then a large chunk of counter rotating mass is not
rotating. hence , at a light , reving makes it twist. shaft effect is the
rear end rising under power or (the real problem) getting lower to the road
when the throttle is snapped shut (say when you are cornering and the heads
are real close to the road). new gs bikes with the paralever shaft have
almost no shaft effect.

i do n't ride her fast enough to get a shaft effect , but in my opinion
a little buffeting by wind is of far greater consequence. okay , here are
my questions

1) any recommendations for a home made fairing \? i 'd like to keep the
wind off my chest , and perhaps my helmet , for comfort at highway speeds
(70 mph) , yet do n't want to (a) screw up the stability or (b) block my
vision too much for trail riding. anybody have luck with two piece
detachible fairings \? i 'd like to make it myself out of plexiglas.

2) i run two lights , the standard headlamp plus a sidelamp mounted on the
crash bar. the illumination 's excellent that way , with a full beam coming
out from the level of the motor (left side) the lamp beam is linear so
that you get a bright streak of illumination from left to right , and it
really picks up the periphery (deer lurking , etc.) combined with the
headlamp on high you can see like day. but i 've heard that bmw alternators
do n't crank out too much. do i need to shut down the sidelamp when i'm
puttering around in the dirt at low rpm \?

it 's a question of how long you spend at low rpm and how much you need the
extra light. at low rpm , 3k and under , they do n't charge all that much if
at all. the alternators put out sufficient wattage , it just that you need
to be at 4k rpm to get it.

3) this is embarassing i'm having trouble starting the bike first thing
in the morning. i invariably flood the carbs , then go in and read a section
of the paper , and then she starts right up. is this a zen thing \?

full choke. open the gas taps. hit the starter and ever so slightly blip the
throttle. it should fire. cranking should be done with minimal throttle.
my r100 likes the throttles to be raised just a bit off idle.

it 's an experience thing. like zen , it 's hard to describe. it can be hard
to learn if you are n't paying atttention to the differences between success
and failure. especially if you get really pissed off and flatten the
battery while trying to get it to run.

if my bike has been sitting for a few weeks , i give it a short while to
start. if it does n't , i turn it off and wait a few minutes for things to
vaporize in the fuel system and then it lights right off. i 've got dual
plugs which make it easier to start.

4) the hayne 's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline
with alcohol additives... yeah , right. what do you folks due to keep
the engine and carbs from being eaten by ethanol and methanol \? any
particular brands of gas that are best \? additives \?

the big fix is the bing carb upgrade kit. it 's good for a few mpg and the
parts are alcohol proof. the parts it replaces are n't alcohol proof. as
long as the bike is n't going to sit for long periods of time , gasohol is
nice since it helps keep ping away. if your bike does n't ping on cheap gas
you ought to raise the compression ! (half a smiley , the bmw twins of the
80s and beyond have lowered compression to keep the epa happy. dual plugs
and higher compression give back a big chunk of the lost perfomance).

done dyna s modules for several friends and i 'll get one also unless
a bunch of folks say the crane is better.

one guy just installed the mc power arc ignition but has not yet
reported the results. it was not a simple bolt in replacement as new
mounting holes had to be drilled.

i recognize it 's more fun to discuss why chris needed to change brands of
penis enhancer but how 'bout some comments on single fire ignitions for
a while...

i just installed a mc power arc ii , and it seems to run great. i also
used mc coils , and neither the ignition module or the coils required
any new mounting holes to be drilled on my 92 fxstc. a little soldering
and all was fine. static timing was real easy to set too.

on the other side of the coin , my local wrench , whose opinion i
invariably seek but do n't always adopt , thinks mc power arc is a piece
of shit and says all them jap chips are gonna fail you one day .
needless to say , he does n't like any electronic ignition modules , and
recommends the dyna s system. i think that 's the one with the
hall effect timing sensor(s) , correct \?

car accessory shops here sell stuff called t cut , which is a very fine
cutting paste for paint , and this will remove the dull finish and
minor acratches. it will also remove all the traffic film and stuff that
you probably do n't realise is there , and give your paintwork its original
lustre and shine. it can sometimes react badly with metallic paint , though ,
so try it out carefully before going to town with the stuff. afterwards
apply wax polish , and all will be well again.

btw do n't confuse t cut with the cutting paste used for grinding in
valves...the principle 's the same but the coarseness is vastly different...

i hate pre'80s motorcycles.

at first i thought it was a phase. i though i would
get used to them. it did n't happen. i tried gazing
at cb750s and 900 customs ,

thats pretty hard since cb900 customs were n't introduced
until 1980. if you find a pre 80 one , hold onto it. it
will be worth big bucks some day.

what am i to do \? everytime i read a .sig containing

mine has comstar wheels. methinks you need to do

well , if i were to do that , i would never be going over 35 mph even in
6th gear ! ! ! so my question is , will it hurt my new cycle to take it up
in the 6 7000 rpm range so that i can at least go the speed limit \? \? \? \?

but you already can go at the speed limit at 4000 rpm. all you need
to do is to find a road with a 35 mph speed limit.

this is n't quite as silly as it sounds. if you take a nice day trip
over back roads ( not highways full of people trying seriously to get
from here to there) then you might be able to hold 35 mph comfortably.
you could easily do 500 miles over three different weekends. you
might even get to enjoy some of the scenery. yes , i know this is
probably not why you bought a 250 called ninja.

i have a 1974 honda cb360t which for most of my purposes runs well.
however i expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load.
that is , on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th i'm lucky if i can
hold speed. if i try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm , power drops
drastically. put simply , under load , the engine wo n't rev past 5000
rpm. the top third half of the throttle range is dead. standing still
the engine runs fine up to red line (9 10k).

other phenomenology at about the point that power loss kicks in , the
engine becomes a little wavery. that is , at a steady throttle the
engine speed goes up and down slightly. the bike has about 13000 miles
on it and is in good tune , at least until it starts to balk.

i would appreciate any suggestions as to what 's ailing the poor beast.
my thoughts run toward clogged jets and or improper spark advance. i'm
hoping it 's not something more drastic since the bike 's not really worth
the hassle of any major engine work.

go to the highway patrol and explain the situation , give them a

specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish to prosecute
(ie , search the vehicle code and have the section number handy). fill
out the ticket and sign it. it will go through the same system any

appear in court to prosecute. your word will not carry the same weight
as a cop 's.

and , indeed , the advice i got from a police officer when i had my
close call was that , without additional impartial witnesses , it
would be my word vs. the other driver 's , and that it was up to me
to decide whether the time and inconvenience to me was worth the
time and inconvenience to the other driver , and also whether any
positive effect would result (beyond making me feel better).

yesterday , a friend had asked me to accompany him to a local motorcycle
dealer. it has been a while since he last rode ( 10 years) , and i myself
have never bought a new bike from a dealer. what follows is an experience
of that visit and of an observation of squildly behavior by other
customers and or sales personel

background

i ride with a group of friends , who mainly are into cruiser type bikes. my
friend was hell bent on getting an intruder and had seen a few used ones. he
wanted to see what the new ones were going for , so we happened upon a dealer
that sold both suzuki and yamaha.

the place was fairly busy , so we browsed a bit. we happened upon a few
intruders , most of which had sold signs on. my friend had been bitten.

well the salesdroid appeared and as my friend started chewing the fat , i
moseid on outside. the next thing i know , i see 3 or 4 sport bikes pull in.
i could stereo type the type of riders (backward ball hat , oakley , iq 40) ,
but i wo n't. well they went inside , i did n't think much of it. i figured
to each his own. i went back in to see if the salesdroid had his fangs
firmly implanted into my friends back , when i noticed the hormone gang
talking to other salesdroids managers. lot 's of laughter , jokes etc. no big
deal.

here is the part that concerned me. the hg and those shop personel that were
not busy with customers went back out , where said hg members fired up their
rides and did the obligatory reving up of those 600 beasts. at this point ,
one decided to see how much rubber a katana 600 could deposit in the drive.

squids , i thought to myself. but i was appalled that the salesdroids manager
not only condoned this behavior , but encourged it , to the point were they
were betting how long he could keep it up and egged him on to pull a wheely
as he rode off onto a busy street around rush hour. the girl that was riding pillion on another bike , seemed rather hormonal about this display , and urged her
pilot to quickly catch up. the others followed , making sure there kerkers
could be heard as well as felt.

i felt embarassed at this point to be a motorcyclist. i felt the eyes of those
in cages , witnessing this display , then glancing over to the dealers lot and
damning all those on two wheels. needless to say , my friend felt a little
uncomfortable and we left.

i will now turn off my frustration and go ride... peacefully , to clear my
anger. i only hope that the cop who is following me home , has an open
mind and does n't associate me with them.

btw , i ca n't afford a new bike.....

i 've never ridden pillion very much but recently had an excellent
experience passengering with dave edmondson at pilot while in london.

i found that it upset the bike much less if i rode with the pilot , that
is , if i looked over his shoulder and anticipated when i should hold on
hard for braking or acceleration. i tried to always look over the
inside shoulder on corners and move as little as possible , leaving
dave to manage me and the bike as he normally would the bike and
luggage.

hard acceleration can be quite unnerving as the feeling of being spit
off the back is hard to fight. similarly , i held on to the grab handles
tightly when dave needed to brake so as not to mash him to a pulp (i'm
a lot bigger than he is...). reaching around him and pushing off the
tank seemed like it would be very awkward and make it even harder for
him to manage.

on the rare occasions when i carry a passenger myself , i absolutely
refuse to carry anyone who is not properly accoutered for riding. that 's
helmet , jacket , gloves , stout pants and shoes boots as a minimum. it 's
not my responsibility to provide this gear , but it 's my responsibility
to require it if they want to ride.

and i agree with an earlier poster if you 've not had much experience
carrying a particular passenger and especially if you 've not carried
many passengers before , take a few gentler rides of some duration before
you head off to a difficult road like mines mt. hamilton. that 's a
nasty place to find yourself in trouble.

thoroughly , took it on a short ride to dry it off and heat it up

i just bought a brand new kawasaki ninja 250. i am a first time buyer

the tachometer has a sticker right on it that says for the first 500
miles do not go over 4 , 000 rpm 's , and for the next 500 miles , do n't go
over 6 , 000. (referred to as the break in period if you did n't know.)


well , if i were to do that , i would never be going over 35 mph even in
6th gear ! ! ! so my question is , will it hurt my new cycle to take it up
in the 6 7000 rpm range so that i can at least go the speed limit \? \? \? \?

any lock including the kyptonite utypes are easy to break into if the person has
the proper supplies and or motivation. 3 minutes and your bike is gone !
i would be glad to explain but i dont want to contribute to any unlawful
activities.

does this make anyone 's skeptic alarm (tm) go off \? no offense , bill , i
do n't mean to say that you 're not being straight , but i wonder how you
know about this \? have you actually every used your secret method to break
all the different kinds of bike locks \? or are you taking someone 's word
for it \?

the fact is , it is unlikely that someone reading anything here is going to
go into a successful bike stealing business because they read anything in
rec.motorcycles. so please tell us what you are talking about. we ca n't
even protect against an assault , or discuss methods , if you do n't come out
with it.

see , i have heard the ones about the pipes , and the liquid nitrogen , and the
cordless dremel tools , and a bunch of other ones. the most plausable method
(i am not a bike thief , so i really do n't know for certain) is just to put
a rod through each wheel , and use four guys to just lift the bike into a
truck. this works because most people do n't lock their bikes to anything.
since that method is so childishly easy , i figure a nice , visible chain or
cable locking the bike to something is likely to make a lazy thief go on
to the next bike.

(hey , finally an advantage to the weight and high cg of the concours ! )

especially since i have a bike that i would hate to see ripped off
by such a trival tactic. warning no lock alone is a safe deterent against theft ,
the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock picker to walk away with your
property ! i personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned.

what tactic are you referring to \? if we do n't know what you are talking about ,
we ca n't very well guard against it , can we \?

for my money (literally) i rely on a combination of a motion detector alarm
with pager when i'm out of earshot of the bike in a questionable area , c c
insurance , and i try to park in obvious , visible areas with lots of people
about. (see , if someone just plays with the bike without intention of
stealing it , at least some eyes are on it , and if they get too rambunctious ,
they 'll set off the alarm.)

that 's for a nice bike. for a ratbike , the trick is to always keep its
actual value well below blue book , so that it looks so crappy nobody would
want to steal it , and even if they were stupid enough to , you would make
a profit on the deal. )

seriously , if i (for instance) need to go on a business trip for a week ,
and (sadly) have to leave the bikes sitting , they both get a shitty looking ,
but useable cover , locked on , and both bikes locked to each other and a
curb bumper in the parking lot under the light. i usually rig the cable
locks i use (aircraft cable) so that if anyone pulls on either bike or
the cable joining them , the concours alarm goes off. and i have a friend
come buy every day to have a look and make sure they 're still there. the
only thing i have ever had stolen was a 60 cover , and that was over
winter storage , with the battery out of the bike (and thus no alarm).

oh , put your own eyelets into the cover for the locks to pass through , and
place them so that they have to absolutely destroy the cover to get it off.

that 's the best that i can think of. most of the locks i see people put
on bikes look , well , not too mechanically sound. i like abus , since i have
personally removed master locks from lockers with my boot.

this tactic depends for its effectiveness on the dog 's conformance to
a psychological norm that may not actually apply to a particular dog.
i 've tried it with some success before , but it wo n't work on a charlie manson
dog or one that 's really , really stupid. a large irish setter taught me
this in my yard (apparently his territory) one day. i'm sure he was playing
a game with me. the game was probably kill the very angry neighbor before
he can dispense the terrible punishment.

what , a dog weighs 150lb maybe , at max \? you ca n't handle it \?

we were having a problem with instability in the universal gravitational
constant that day the closer i got to those exposed fangs (still dripping ,
no doubt , with the viscera of the last foolhardy experimenter cum canine
psychology) the bigger and heavier the dog appeared to become. also ,
recall that the distribution of the 150lb is one five pound jaw teeth
operated by two 70lb muscles driven by a .005 ounce brain possessing an
instinctual heuristic composed of equal parts of bloodlust and ravening hunger.
the other 5 lb is , of course , dog poop , but that varies all over the place
as the dog deposits it regularly on the painstakingly manicured and tended
lawns of the dog 's owner 's neighbors (whilst continuously replenishing its
inexhaustible supply , no doubt by consuming the likes of folks like me).

you have , i presume , thumbs \? grapple with it and tear it 's head
off !

my very thought at the time , but as i looked down at these once formidable
instruments of mayhem , i realized they had become weak and atrophied by too
many sedentary hours tapping away at my ergonomically correct crt keyboard.
there was only one option left i reached down to the toolbox near my
car and grasped my craftsman 150 ft lb torque wrench , surely the bludgeon
of dire necessity if ever there was one. to my amazement and
confusion , the setter started shaking and rolling on the grass , then leapt
to its feet and vanished down the street , still quivering and occasionally
looking back at me.

seven at one blow ! i exclaimed , flexing my new found biceps and brandishing
my terrible weapon of invincibility as i stalked the now secure environs
of my domicile. it was only later that i found out what the dog apparently
knew all along the wrench was defective , would no longer measure torque
accurately , and sears would n't fix it or replace it. what i had interpreted
as fear and subservience were in fact unmitigated hilarity and contempt.

sheesh , even a trained attack dog is no match for a human ,
we have all the advantages.

exactly nobody can look quite as silly as we can.

since at least one other person was interested in this

my fzr 's black exhaust pipes are rusty and i researched getting them repaired.
yesterday i bought a can of vht 1500 degree black header paint and spent an
hour sanding two of the header pipes by hand. sprayed on paint. thought
about how clean i was able to get the metal with sanding and determined that
i would n't be at all suprised if the paint wore chipped off in a month.

soooo call a couple of places up in minneapolis and discover that powder
coating , while extremely durable , will not handle over 600 degree
temperatures. the place i talked to said they were experimenting with
some new powder that is supposed to handle 1100 degrees but that it would n't
be available for months at least. they directed me to another shop that
specializes in header coating.

the other shop said they have 2 coatings available. one is aluminized that
can do 1200 degrees and is comparable to powder coating for durability.
the other is silicon (i think) based and can do 1800 degrees ( ! ) but is
thinner and not as durable. both coatings have a textured finish (not
super smooth) and should be cleaned with hot water and a brush.

price for 4 1 foot header pipes and a 2 foot 4 2 1 collector was 100. i'm
planning to take the parts up friday and get them back (ups) next week maybe
wednesday.

sounds to me like this kind of coating stuff should be way better than paint
considering how much abuse the pipes get from road crap rocks.

my best advice would be to contact a local dealer (see the yellow
pages under motorcycle dealers ) and ask for the address of the local
section bmw owners club. the local bmw dealer will give you details
of the bmw insurance terms and the club will help you with all
details. getting a bike from the dealer is the best bet , if you can
afford it. the warranty is fairly handy as bm bits are made from
solid gold , apart from the parts made from ruby and platinum. apparently.

yes , even when steering no hands you do something quite similar
to countersteering. basically to turn left , you to a quick wiggle
of the bike to the right first , causing a counteracting lean to
occur to the left. it is a lot more difficult to do on a motorcycle

it would be a shame to split boxer riders between different lists
unless , of course , the existing list failed to meet the readers'
needs.
you presumed you needed to split out a gs list.
by implication of your split , a plain ol' bmw
list would n't meet the gs riders' needs.

good point. the list actually started out as an extension of my gs
v. fj shootout list , which is why it got that name. since inception ,
however , other boxer interested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been geared to gs pd st specific topics.

for the sake of not forcing the split issue ,
how about changing the charter and renaming
your list from bmw gs to just bmw \? would that
make everybody happy \?

when i raised the to expand or not to expand that is the question
question on the list itself , there were mixed feelings. the list has
always been open to anyone with a non bouncing from line and there
has been general agreement that only boxer related stuff is
appropriate. almost all of the subscribers own r80 r100 gs st pd
bikes , although some r , rt and rs owners are also on it.

at this point , my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible. the list is fairly technical , with how do i do this \? ,
what kind of that should i get \? kinds of questions. there has yet
to be any non bmw bashing , k bike bashing , or any bmw mfg 'd after
1962 is a piece of shit bashing. such posts are , by consent of the
governed , proscribed.

if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the
net.boxer.owners , then i am not going to stand in the way of progress.

so , hesh , let me turn the question around have you (or has anyone
else) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded \?

i bought a yamaha xs850 with 8k miles. over the last 2 years , i 've put 30k

5k. well every 7.5k or so , i 've checked the pad clearences , and they never
change ! if anything , the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which
makes no sense to me with the pad system the pads should wear until the
clearances are too great right \? i know that threaded adjusters can tighten
up , but i did n't think these kind could.

bottom lines is that i have n't touched my valves for 30k on this bike and
they are still nice and quiet and if anything , the clearances are tighter...
what 's the deal \? any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve
adjustment intervals \?

yeah , i had an xs750 that was the same. the valve seats tend to wear
very slowly , and anything that might get taken off the pad (which should n't
really wear) will tend to compensate so it 's a sort of self compensating
system.

reminds me of a great editorial by bruce reeve a couple months ago
in cycle canada.

he was so pissed off with cops pulling over speeders in dangerous
spots (and often blind corners) that one day he decided to get
revenge.

cruising on a factory loaner zzr1100 test bike , he noticed a cop
had pulled over a motorist on an on or off ramp with almost no
shoulder. being a bright lad , he hit his bike 's kill switch
just before passing the cop , who happened to be bending towards
the offending motorist there by exposing his glutes to the
passing world.

with his ignition system now dead , he pumped his throtle two
or three times to fill his exhaust canister 's with volatile raw fuel.

all it took was a stab at the kill switch to re light the ignition
and send a 10' flame in sargeant swell 's direction.

i wonder if any cycle cops read cycle canada \?

although i agree with the spirit of the action , i do hope that
the rider ponied up the 800 or so it takes to replace the exhaust system
he just destroyed. the owner 's manual explicitly warns against such
behavior for exactly that reason you can destroy your muflers that way.

if you had been looking in your mirror , you would have seen the guy coming
before you heard the screeching tires.

when you 're stopped at a light

1) stop so that you 're got space in front of you , and a quick easy escape
route (between lanes , into a crosswalk , up a driveway , somewhere) if someone
decides they want to plow into you.

2) keep the bike in first with the clutch in until at least a couple of cars
are stopped behind you , so you do n't have to waste a second you do n't have
trying to get it in gear if you need to move.

3) watch your mirrors. in that situation , most of the hazards you are
trying to avoid are coming from behind you. sipde ( msf geek speak)
is n't just for when you 're moving. and you 're less likely to panic and stall
the bike if you 've got time to prepare before the guy 's tires lock up behind
you. (you still get the bejeezus scared out of you , but it 's more a feeling
of quickly rising dread than a sudden jolt.)

greetings rec.motorcyclists.

coming up labour day weekend this year , worldcon (world science fiction
convention) will be held in san francisco (california). i am planning
to attend and have been speculating on doing my trip there by motorcycle
instead of by plane (as was my initial thought.)

i live (and would be departing from) ottawa , ontario (canada).

i had planned to take two weeks for this trip , giving me 5 days travel
time on either side of the weekend.

this looks like a distance of about 2800 miles (4500 km).

if your distance calc is correct for an on the road distance (and not
as the crow flies) , this is 900km a day for 5 days. if you spend the
entire time on interstates , which would be a total waste of time , that 's
at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating peeing
sight seeing etc.

i was contemplating a similar trip , but from ottawa to la , or
maybe ottawa to austin tx.

i figured if i wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it , i 'd
have to get my ass off the major interstates and spend lots of
time enjoying the country around me i.e. stopping with a camera ,
meeting towns people , going to a few bars. no sense spending 2 weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump.

i estimated i 'd need at least 4 5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.

i am looking for input , opinions , comments , or snarky remarks on
1. my sanity.

in question 8 )

2. suggested routes. (note , getting there is important , and my
schedule does n't leave a lot of room for side trips , or circuitous
routes)

try and stay off the interstates ! ! !

5. anybody who wants to join me on this trip. (for even part of the
distance.)

depending on your route and my plans , i may be heading that way as far
as at least detroit.

7. anything that comes to mind , and that you think might be relevant.

the reactions of little boys seems to be the most enthusiastic to
a wave (and also good to see). i always wave when i see a kid that
has at least noticed my bike. i figure it helps the future of the
sport.

i have to admit that i usually try to do so without the parental
figure noticing i`m afraid that the kid will get yelled at for
associatign with anti societal types like us.


a few weeks ago i was in the dmv with ken. i was standing in a mile long
line waiting for some really bored looking person to fleece a bunch of
people from some dough. ken was sitting on a chair next to our helmets
wondering why everybody there looked to be about the social calibur of
people you would find at a laundromat when some young woman walked in who
required our conferring attentions. he came over and stood in line with me
while we watched her fill out some forms and then we noticed a little kid
about 4 years old reach over the bench and touch our helmets , one at a time.
i did n't particularly mind , and neither did ken (that the kid was touching
our helmets that is). but the helmets were n't on the most stable of
platforms , so ken scooted over there to resettle them and as soon as he
touched the helmets , mother of said child started shrieking at her kid you
stay away from those you shit ! and whopped the tyke brutally about the head
and shoulders.

i suppose it was our scary sex drugs and unix t shirts that sent such
bouts of terror through her body.

hey , what the hell do you mean by that \? you suck. i have a god given
right to express opinions , carry a gun and to not wear a helmet , goddamn
it. everything you stand for is stupid.

i 'd give it an 0.5 on a scale of 10. analysis and hints deleted

aw , c'mon. the serious overreaction ought to be worth a couple of points ,
not to mention the bit condemning everthing the flamee might ever say.
the non sequitur about guns and helmets is just the proper flourish.

nope. flames should be interesting . around here , guns helmets
are the wallpaper.

i personally am of the opinion that there are two types of good flames.
the first does trade ``quality , '' in the sense you mention , for heat.
this has a certain surprise value and if done correctly , which i
contend was done above , is reasonably entertaining.

not everyone in rec.motoland is so easily amused. blaine , as an elder ,
has seen the superflamers at their peaks (or depths , if you prefer).
with that sort of incendiary backdrop , awarding your faltering bic a
0.5 was the purest act of charity.

while
it is true that
the flame i posted does not mention anyone 's habitual velocity , friends ,
dinner , or entertainment , it says what it needs to with the appropriate
flair and it is short. the weakness of this type of flame is actually
that it can easily be taken too far , at which point it becomes trite and
boring.

unless , of course , your audience has only seen several thousand similarly
uninspiring attempts in this arena. in that case , the trite boring
threshold tends to drift away from where you first set it , as yours will ,
eventually (or not).

the other type of flame , which you seem to be glorifying above ,
... blah , blah , blah ...
in summary , blaine , your score for that flame is incorrect. while it may
be the wunder flame , the weaknesses you point out are not necessarily
weaknesses , and your suggested corrections are not always useful nor
applicable.

until you can yank the flame out of blaine 's internet port before he
can io close() it , you are in no position to lecture him , grasshopper.

you also probably could n't outrun a tennis ball with a
flatulent dog stapled to your posterior , and i 'll bet you and your
motorcycle lean to the outside while turning. the same goes for anyone
who looks like you , too.

oh please (yawn) , you 're slipping further down the scale with each
successive attempt. it 's so embarrassing to watch. say , you 're not

another good place for your helmet is your mirror ( ! ). i kid you not. if

seriously , though , putting a helmet on a mirror is inadvisable because
you are then resting the weight of the helmet on the fragile foam
liner that is expected to cushion your noggin. and once crushed , that
foam never pops back.

a variation of mirror hanging thing is what i do with the bike on the
sidestand (hey , the centerstand is for maintenance) i turn the wheel to
the stop (left) and can hang the helmet by the chin bar on the right
grip. there is no crushable foam in the chin bar , and it is pretty
secure on there (as long as the forks are locked). if i have to leave
the helmet with the parked bike (and the bags are n't on full) , that is
about the most stable place.

an even better strategy is to leave less of a buffer between you and

1st gear with the clutch handle squeezed in (how 's that for

when the next bdi cager comes screaching in , simply ride up along side
of the car in front of you. you do n't need to panic and do it , or you
will pop the clutch and stall the engine. do is smoothly , just

quick question

what are the advantages of slip on 's versus your stock exhaust versus
aftermarket exhaust systems \? i do n't see many people using slip on 's
but they are heavily advertised and half as expensive.

thanks !
dave


cost is lower than oem replacements and they weigh less. also , in most
instances you do not have to rejet the carburetors to get a little more
performance. i replaced my oem canister with an ontario systems slip on.
the mid range performance is better but i also notice a slight stumble at
2 3k rpm. after talking to kaz yoshima , the developer and manufacturer of
the slip on , he thinks i might need larger pilot , idle , jets. was not suppose
to but maybe where i live makes a difference. altitude , barometric pressure...
anyway , besides that minor glitch , i like the slip on performance and the sound ,
which is louder than stock , but not loud enough to annoy folks. the ontario
slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to reduce the sound at full
throttle.

just remember , every bike is a tuned system. when you change the intake or
exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the manufacturer , you may
have to change other areas to compensate. like a complete change of the exhaust
system , header and muffler , changes the exhaust characteristic to the point
which re jetting is required to compensate for the new engine breathing pumping
profile.

talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend to use and ask them if
they have used it on your particular bike. check with people who have the
system also to see what they think about there slip on.

also , as a last data point , in sport rider 's first issue , did a review on a
group of header and exhaust systems for the cbr600f2. they also included , as a
side bar , the ontario slip on , the dyno showed an increase from stock of 5bhp at
the rear wheel , 85 verses 91.

buyer beware , of outrageous claimed increases in horse power ! it may have been
true in the past , but not today !

bike. luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.

i understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident \? suggestions \?


anybody who drove into somebody like that in this country would hopefully
lose their licence. however , the avoidance is simple. do n't stop behind the
cage. stop beside it , or better still , in front of it , so that it acts as a
buffer.

it sure would be nice if someone would start making replacements
for oem exhausts that were would be cheaper but not louder...

i read about a supertrapp system called e.a.r that was supposed to be
quiet enough to pass some european standards. apparently it 's not
on the market yet...

yoshimura makes a few systems that are supposed to be kind of quiet.
they are also really light. i'm planning on getting one of these
systems soon , and will post the results.

i was posting to alt.locksmithing about the best methods for securing
a motorcycle. i got several responses referring to the cobra lock
(described below). has anyone come across a store carrying this lock
in the chicago area \?

any other feedback from someone who has used this \?

what about the new yamaha cyclelok \?

it is far from new. it 's been around almost as long as dirt.

from the photo in motorcyclist , it looks the same hardened steel as a
kryptonite u lock , except it folds in five places.
it seems to extend out far enough to lock the rear tire to the tube of
a parking sign or similar.

anyone had any experience with them , how easy is it to attack the lock
at the jointed sections \?

i had one for one of my old bikes. worked fine. i'm sure , being
rigid and nonflexible , that the cyclelok would yield instantly to the freeze
and break routine.

but then , for 40 , what do ya want \?

later ,

turn dynamics sit so that you feel like you 're sitting upright...
good advice.

please , no sudden moves...
my ol'lady taps me on the shoulder to let me know she is
uncomfortable. i , in turn , am prepared for her to move about on the
back of the bike.

trust is essential. ...
we had 1 bad crash (nail in rear tire on left hand sweeper at crest
of hill on pavement pea gravel road) and her actions helped lessen
the severity of it. as we were crashing , she stayed upright in the
saddle with her feet on the pegs and her hands about my waist. i was
able to get the bike slowed down 10 15mph before we were high sided.
she got off with a fair case of road rash and i had to have the doc
remove a lot of rocks from my knee. had she panicked we would have
probably crashed at greater speed causing greater injury.
btw , as soon at the tire went flat , we went into violent tank
slappers. this is what she rode out in a normal riding posture !
