if both paries do this , then the transaction will obviously
be cod. this allows both parties to exercise the amount of
trust they see fit.


cod is fine until the buyer opens the box to find they paid 150.00
for a brick. or if it the seller allows for a personal check to be used
on a cod it 's fine till a stop payment is made. there are few methods
to protect both buyer and seller in any sort of transaction. even with
merchants and customers there are problems...stolen credit cards ,
chargebacks , no return policies and getting the wrong item , etc.

about the only protection available to to do business with someone you
trust....someone who has been around for a while.

time once again to clean out the ol' closet. some stuff is up for offers , some
is n't. please read carefully.


in the make offer department

wordperfect 5.0 , upgrade copy. includes all disks and all upgrade
manuals. best offer.

balance of power , 1992 edition , for the amiga. with manual and reg.
card. best offer.


in the for sale department

technics model 715 auto reverse open reel stereo tape deck. because
it 's auto reverse , this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
deck does , so it 's not very good for splice type editing. however ,
i have used it effectively in tape studio applications for mastering ,
and it works great. 3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds , supports up to 7 reels.
dual lighted vu meters with record indicators. full auto reverse
capable (and the mechanism works , too ! ). adjustable sound on sound ,
and socket for remote control (i do n't know where you 'd find one , but
they used to make 'em) , plus a 110vac unswitched outlet. this unit
is in excellent condition and i have had it rebuilt once since i got
it works perfectly.

price 225.00 or best offer , or possible trade (see below).


panasonic kx p1624 printer. 24 pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both
text and graphics modes. warranty cards , manuals , all the usual stuff
you expect when buying like new merchandise. i'm selling it because i
now have a better printer. this is the wide carriage version of the
kx p1124 , by the way. test prints are available upon request.

price 250.00 o.b.o. or trade.


excalibur custom pool cue. 19 oz. , 13 mm , brass joint , irish linen
wrap , could use a new tip but will hold up for a while. i 've got too
many cues as it is , and do n't need this one. hits nicely , is very
straight and in excellent condition.

price 125.00 o.b.o. or trade. imperial hard case (1 butt 1 shaft)
available for an additional 40.00.


trades i need the following things , and i have no cash of my own right now ,
so if you want to trade , it needs to be straight across. the list

amiga rom upgrade to at least 2.04 , preferably 2.1 , with appropriate
dos and workbench.

1 meg agnus chip for the amiga.

amiga hard drive and controller (preferably scsi).

ibm compatible hard drive (and controller if not mfm). this one 's
touchy , as i have a full height and do n't have room for more unless
i swap out needs to be above 100m , and i will consider trading a
good st 4096 in the deal.

intel 9600ex or 14.4ex or similar external high speed modem.


this is not a complete list , but it 's close. if you 've got something way off
the track of this list , it 's probably not going to interest me at this point.

my company maintains a 20 , 000 mailing list which is regularly rented for

one time use by the major software companies. the method you are using to
seed your junk mail , is n't really effective. bulk mailers regulary
either send their databases to be cleaned by the ncoa , which if you 've
moved recently , will revert back to the original xxx cool , and in large
mailings , there will likely be a dupe of you , and they 'll pick the first , and use the
others for future mailings.

it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.

in addition to improper etiquette , this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.

am i correct in assuming this is improper , and if so , what can be
done to penalize such an improper use \?

this package was bought throught a award give away company. i attempted
to cancel my order before i received the package , but i was too late and
the company refused to take the package back for refund. i know the truth
which i would never get my 697 back , but i wish to get my money back as
close as possible. here is the describtion of the package...

nishika 3d camera it takes very good picture , never been opended
or used. it came with wide angle flesh , carring
case , film , and a instruction video. it has four
lens and created a 3d effect on a regular 35mm
film.

jewelry it came with the package as additional gift.

bahama vacation voucher the voucher is good for two rt airfare to freeport.
the users get a special hotel rate of 27 per person
per night. meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is
not included.

las vegas , reno , orlando the voucher provides one rt airfare , and
hotel accomodation for 3 days 2 nights.
meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is not
included. the voucher is good for all 3
locations , but you ca n't travel to all 3
places at once.

cancun , mexico the voucher provides one rt airfare , and hotel
accomodation for 3 days 2 nights. meals and
ground transfer , hotel tax is not included as
usual.

i paid 697 for the whole package. so try not to be cold blooded when you
make your offer. details would be provided by request. i do wish to sell
the whole package at once. so if you are just looking for the vacation
vouchers , i do n't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric
if you are interested in the camera , you could treat the vacation vouchers
as gift.

if you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected
to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out of five awards.
trust me , you would get the exactly the same package as i did. there is
only one award which will be given away. so do n't bother even to call them
back , if you are really interested , you could get it from me for a cheaper
price. and you could receive the package within a week ( i waited three
months to get my first and final packages). also , they would ask for your
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit
card company. so why spend more than you should when you could get them
from me for a cheaper price.

if you are interested , please reply to me as soon as posible. i really
wish to get this over with. make me an offer , if i am confortable with
your offer , i would send the package by u.p.s. the next day morning.
more details could be given if you wish.

carl ,
what brand of drives are these \? do you have documentation \?
i 'll go 40.00 shipping if you have documentation...

do not pay 40 for floppy drives.. they are about 40 new.
also , you do not need documentation for floppies. installation
for these things are idiot proof.
just some advice..

after hearing about the mcgovern house story on paul harvey i never had any
idea how much it was worth. the autograph is on a senate pass card
and is signed 'john kennedy.' i do n't remember if it was signed
'senator john kennedy' or whether or not it was dated , because i have n't
looked at it in quite a while. currently it is in a safety deposit box.
i would rather sell to a private collector rather then go through an auction
house such as christy 's since that would tend to take away from the profit.
if you (or any collector you may know) has an interest in this please send

in a previous article , tomc@arezzo.oas.olivetti.com (tom carlino) says

recently i bought a musical instrument through the internet and had
it shipped to me via ups ground. the shipping was done through a
mail box service , mailboxes , etc. being somewhat surprised at the
price , i compared prices of shipping this way to shipping directly
through ups and this is a summary. i am not making any endorsements
or condemnations but merely presenting the facts from which you may
draw your own conclusions.


i 've encountered the same thing with mailboxes , etc. and i suggest
anyone to use the original ups service if at all possible. shipping
to virginia from cleveland was around 20 for 12 pounds , and c.o.d.
was 8.00 , as opposed to 4.50 for ups.

i 'll third the opinion about this outfit franchise. now , when i
buy over the net and pick up the shipping costs , i 'll specify that i
only pick up the normal ups charges (as if delivered directly to
ups) , as i 've been burned by 10 shipping charges for a 2.49 pkg.
i will never use a mailing service unless i do n't have the
right box and the buyer needs whatever immediately. i 'll also
tell the person , if they agreed to pick up shipping , what is going on.

other things to watch out for consider

the rates are 5 to 30 higher than ups direct.

for a non ups (truck) package , they quoted a rate
of 85. fed ex economy air was only 85 for the
same weight ! rps (a trucking package company , in many
cities) only wanted 18. guess who got it. the mailbox
operator told me i was not telling the truth about
competitors' rates , said rps was unreliable (i 've used them
before with no problems) , etc. right.

a cod check goes to the mailing service. our local
mailbox then takes its sweet time mailing me the
remade check. all this for an additional 3.00 over the
ups cod charge. what a deal.... )

for packages over 100 , they charge you about double over
what ups charges them for insurance. i 've never had
a claim , but other netters (is ralph seguin out there \? )
have told horror stories about them...

all package traces have to be done through mailbox by
mailbox.

our local mailbox operator told me i was lying when i
asked him why their rates were stratospheric compared
to direct ups. does he ever check \? probably not...

their ups ground rates come close to fed ex 's economy
air rate , and fed ex will pick up !

ups will pick up for a 5 charge in most areas !

organization iowa state university , ames , ia
lines 36

in article c5t7qg.9ij@rice.edu xray@is.rice.edu (kenneth dwayne ray) writes
i had the front panel of my car stereo stolen this weekend.

i need to buy the front panel of a sony xr u770 car stereo.

i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable front panels
were to make the radio useless , and thus discourage theft (that is if the
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)

if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio
originally costs , or even sold at all ,
then the above discouragement would n't be so great.

i personally would be unhappy , if i bought a radio like that , thinking that
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio 's value , and the covers were
sold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.


the front covers should be available from sony. check with a local car
stereo shop. you will probably (definitely) have to provide the units
serial number and hopefully you had registered the warranty card. i
do n't know the cost , but replacements have to be available to people
who damage the face cover , so it stands to reason that it can be replaced.

as to deterring theft

when i worked for a stereo shop , we referred the customer to a sony 800
number. we would not sell the face , nor did we have them available. most
people who came in asking for the face cover (or a pullout sleave for that
matter) would look very disheartened to find that they acquired a deck
they could n't use. if theft occurs with these decks , notify sony. serial
numbers do catch theives.

just a thought ,

bare means what it says. you get a case , a power supply , and a motherboard
(with ram and a coprocessor). everything else is yours to add as you like.

the case power supply

standard desktop case. 230watt power supply with the usual connectors.
room for five floppy hard drives (three visible , two internal).

the motherboard

us made micronics 8 slot motherboard with intel 386dx 25mhz cpu
64kb sram cache
4mb 80us ram using 4x1mb simms (worth 150 alone)
cyrix 83d87 math coprocessor (worth 90 alone)
norton si 6.0 rating of 26.1
latest version phoenix bios


please do not post email saying but i can get a taiwanese superclone
386 90 for only 9.95 including a free toaster ! . i am certain you can
find a cheaper brand x board without even breaking a sweat. new micronics
cpus command a several hundred dollar premium because they are us made ,
use high quality components , and are known to be both very reliable and
compatible. they have been oemed in systems sold by both gateway and
zeos at various points in the past. (check out the ads in the back pages
of byte or pc magazine if you want to see this price differential for
yourself.)

price 495 complete , 100 less if you do n't want need the case and
power supply. the board is fully guaranteed. email for further details
or for any questions.

thanks !

my little nash has sat for about a year (had been running) , but now i must move
a long distance and there are too many things to carry with me. here are the
details of the car

1958 hardtop exterior condition
rocker panels rusted out at weld points , no rust at typical spots like
door hinge mounting points , back battery box , etc. missing front bumper ,
front pan dented up , one weld popped in front. this is for the most part
a solid , restorable automobile.

interior condition
missing original steering wheel , has one of the smaller aftermarket
wheels , seats need reupholstered , general fair condition.

mechanical condition
had been running , but now does not want to start...needs new rings (which
i have) also have extra parts such as complete long block , extra steering
shaft , etc.

for a car that has not been touched since 1958 , it is in solid shape. it will
obviously need some work , but will make a good project.

price well , this is a tough one , i would like to get around 800.00 , but will
consider any serious offers by individuals willing to come and get it. if you
have things to trade such as tools , toys , cameras , comics , cards , etc. ,
anything easily movable to florida , i may consider that as well.

i participated a promotion by a company called visual images.
they sent me a award certificate three months ago and asked
me to buy their promotion package in order to receive the major
award. they mislabled my address and i did not receive my package
until one month ago. i was mad and angry about how it took them
so long to get my package. so i wrote them a letter and requested
for a refund. they never return my letter. i was lucky enough to
find out their telephone number through operator and received the
package. i immediately returned the package and wrote them another
letter to ask for refund. the package was returned because they
address they put on the package was incorrect. i attempted to
call them and learnd that they have changed their telephone number.
it took me at least 10 phone calls to find out their new number ,
but they refused to take any responsibility. i spoke to their
manager and she said she would call me back , but she has not call
yet. but i was able to get their address from their front desk.
should i just go ahead and send the package \? or should i waite until
they call me back \?

i know there are several people on the net has experience with the
same company. i would like to know how they got their money back.
if you have similar experience , please advise me.

subject optonica tuner and integrated amp forsale
organization purdue university computing center
distribution na
lines 29

i have an old optonica tuner and integrated amp that i no longer
use. the integrated amp section does not work right now but should
not cost much to fix. i believe that it is just a chip. i have
used it as a preamp and it works great !

this is a very nice looking and well built set. they both are low
profile but the amp is rather heavy.

the tuner is in fine working condition and is a match to the amp.

the amp is rated at 75w ch.

these peices went for about 850 new.

i would like to get 150. obo for the pair.

if anybody has knowledge anough to fix the amp , i have had an estimate
done that it should cost less than 50 in parts.

please email me if you are interested. i will be moving back home for
the summer and will sell it back there if i do not do so here.

it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.
in addition to improper etiquette , this product is a mailing list

according to reports , if you do n't have dos yet , and do n't have any

for people who have dos5 , and some sort of utility , dos6 does n't offer

oh , dear. let me be the first on my block.

you have just violated one of the major shibboleths of the usenet groups

nit is he unable to type the first 'h' in this word \? )

you 're not supposed to use a newsgroup to plug your own commercial
enterprise (of any kind people frequently get flamed for announcing
they 've got a new book out.)

i do n't know whether this is an official usenet rule or just a long
standing custom , and it does n't make much difference from a practical
point of view.


as a matter of fact d.j. , it does make a difference.
almost a half million new users joined the internet last year ,
many of them are commercial businesses. the ban on commercial
use of internet is no more.

one should have the breeding not to post commercial material
on an account provided by ones employer or school , unless the
provider of such account gives permission. (ha ! )

reminding us that advertising is not done on internet

as a matter of fact d.j. , it does make a difference.
almost a half million new users joined the internet last year ,
many of them are commercial businesses. the ban on commercial
use of internet is no more.

jack , there is a difference between using the network for commercial
purposes and advertising in newsgroups. business communication is
okay. advertising to hundreds of thousands of users around the planet
who have no desire to receive advertising is not okay.

those of us who pay for internet access are constrained only
by our innate good taste and no have no administrator to
guide( \? ) us.

i suspect that a site which generated a large volume of material not
in anybody 's good taste would find itself getting a lot of attention
it did n't want. you may belong to the public library , but that
does n't mean you can deface the books , disorder the stacks , or disturb
the other patrons.

you 're constrained by the same rules that the rest of the users (many
academic and military , who get irritable about a network for which
they pay with tax and grant money carrying private business
advertising) follow. there are secret masters here , just like
everywhere else. they 're not as obvious as the ones on prodigy , but
they 're here.

no doubt at some point the internet , like everything else , will become
grotty enough to carry advertising. at that time i hope it is
confined to its own newsgroups and not on discussion groups like
misc.writing.

nntp posting host atlantis.csos.orst.edu

this is the final public update to my dragon magazine auction. if there
are no new bids then the current bids stand (like that 's gonna happen. ) ).
after this , any updates will be by e mail only . the entire auction
will end as soon as the bids stop coming in. so if you want to get in
on this , be sure to bid now. all bids must be made in at least
25 cent increments. buyer will pay shipping. (unless you have any
particular fancy , it will be us mail 4th class special , with lots of
padding).
all dragons are bagged. the condition of them vary quite a bit ,
so i 've come up with my own condition system. some dragons may be missing
items like the inserts. if you have any questions , feel free to ask.

condition ratings usually this is just an evaluation of the cover , as
most of the material inside is in great shape.
excellent ie as you find them in the store
very good still in great condition , but can tell it 's been boughten
good on down the line
very fair fair indicates lots of use (but still decent )
poor indicates the material inside may be damaged (usually by
scissors).
a by the condition indicates that something from the magazine is
missing (usually the insert)
i 'll post another public update sometime this weekend (which will be the
final public posting , after which the auction will be by e mail until
the bidding stops)

again if you have any questions , ask away.

these games require a sony 1450 laserdisc player. the
nice thing about this player is that you can also watch
normal laserdisc movies on it as well. i have one which i
will sell for 600 by itself , 550 with a purchase of one
complete system or 500 if you buy both systems.

i currently run this into my entertainment center. i have
it housed in a pc computer case with with its own fan , and
power supply. i run the audio into my stereo system , and the
laserdisc runs directly into the t.v.. i have made a mount for
the joysticks and the buttons. first person who buys both
games will get it all , otherwise you have to do it yourself.

if you would prefer to have it all housed in a normal
arcade cabinet this can be done as well. the graphics will
go nicely along the sides and front of the cabinet.

everything works perfectly. the laserdisc player has an
rs 232 port which you can use to develop your own multimedia
type applications. the laserdiscs have been stored in a safe
place and have no scratches on them.

if you are interested please email me.

okidata 180 printer including cables for both ibm compatibles (centronics
parallel) and commodore (rs 232 round). also includes power cable , manual ,
and a handful of computer paper to get you started. this is a 9 pin printer.
i recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon. a print sample
can be provided upon request. this is a very dependable printer it never
jams or does weird things. i have used it with a commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx. i use mainly wordperfect 5.1 (see next
post) for which i got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the
okidata 180 in epson fx mode.

when i got the printer , it was selling for around 200 220 new (i got mine
from tenex brand new for a christmas present). i would like to get about
100 or so for it. if you are interested at all in it , please give me a ring

for sale ...

hewlett packard deskjet 500 inkjet printer.

o perfect condition both internally and externally
o comes with two full ink cartridges
o less than six months old
o comes with all original packaging , manuals , cables
and software

this is truly an excellent printer and is the low cost
alternative to a laser printer. it prints with the
quality of a laser printer , but for a fraction of both
the inital cost and he long term cost (that is ,
replacement of ink cartridges as opposed to replacement
of toner). the printer prints at a maximum of 300 300
(d)ots (p)er (i)nch (d.p.i.) on many different types
and sizes of paper , including envelopes and
transperencies. printer prints in both landscape and
portrait modes. printer can accept up to two
cartridges giving it things like more memory or
additional fonts. printer works excellently with
windows and dos and brings truetype to its full
potential.

i originally purchased the printer for 375.00. make me
an offer , but i would prefer to stay in the 300.00
range. i will pay the shipping to anywhere in the
continental u.s.a.

if you are interested , please either leave me email or
call kirk peterson at (303) 494 7951 anytime.

thanks !



p.s. the printer will work with any computer that
can accept a standard parallel or serial
connection. (that is , ibm , amiga , etc.)

it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to
use the net to directly advertise their products.

the net is not supposed to be a dumping ground for free ads , but
reserving it for tripe does n't seem to be a significant improvement.

in addition to improper etiquette , this product is a mailing list
used for generating junk mail.

so \? either they target it well enough to pay for it , in other words ,
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff (in which case it
is junk only for the rest and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case) or they go bankrupt. seems fair to me.

am i correct in assuming this is improper , and if so , what can be
done to penalize such an improper use \?

you could hold your breath. you could kill offending messages as

excellent product at a decent price with support.

4 hours on the modem and 2 hours shuffling floppies. and
those who do n't need sls support and opt to go it alone.

for example , i subscribe to 2 magazines , abc news and xyz products .
i give my name as joseph x. cool for the first , and joe q. cool for
the 2nd. when i get junk mail addressed to joseph x. cool , i know
where they bought my name.

this does n't help not getting junk mail , but you at least know who 's
selling your name. and if you ask companies to not sell your name to
mailing lists tele marketeers , they are not supposed to (as in , it 's
illegal.)

and in case you have n't guessed , i do n't really use joe cool.



my company maintains a 20 , 000 mailing list which is regularly rented for
one time use by the major software companies. the method you are using to
seed your junk mail , is n't really effective. bulk mailers regulary
either send their databases to be cleaned by the ncoa , which if you 've
moved recently , will revert back to the original xxx cool , and in large
mailings , there will likely be a dupe of you , and they 'll pick the first , and use the
others for future mailings.

btw , our list is currently one of the hottest lists for actual buyers of
a ms windows utility product in the 100 range , and is available through
direct media in ct. , at 0.10 per name. please let your direct mail

quantity make type

i will accept the best offer i receive for the disks and i'm willing to sell

offers on these disks i would considering throwing them in with the new
disks i'm selling above).

i also have a head cleaning kit for 8 disk drives for which i will take

all sales are final.

the other party will end up paying for his her mistake with
interest from the time of the filing to the pay date of the

i think the problem with small claims court is that you have to go to
the location of the person you 're taking action against. it seems to
me the time and money involved in travelling out there (unless this
person is close to you) would n't be worth it for a small claim.
it really depends on how much money you 're out.

hello neo geo owners (and non owners who could n't resist the title )) ,

i was wondering if any of you out there want to trade or sell games. i
mean , buying them from the stores can get kinda expensive. 184.99 is
a little too much to be spending on each game. but ahh , the quality...
now i can get them for about 100 , but that 's still a lot.

right now , i have

hi to all.

since all of you could also be a seller as well as a buyer , i 'd like to bring
this issue for discussion what would be the best solution in case a deal
became a lemon \?

as i understand most people selling things over the net do not grant a warranty , i am in such a situation that the seller did not state whether a warranty would be granted or not and the item i received is out of order. the seller insisted
that it was 'in good condition' when he sent it and so would just return half ofthe amount that i paid if i send the item back to him and after he is sured it
is bad. is this reasonable \?

basically i would like to believe the seller tells the truth. also , i am positively to say that i 've not done anything wrong which might cause the failure of
the thing. my assumption here is everyone is honest so rule out the possibility that either one of the two parties or both are liars.

i would like to hear your opinion either in here or directly respond to my
e mail address.

i know there is such a risk that you could lose money. but , how can we make it
enjoyable to most people and not wasting the bandwidth \?

subject tcd d3 dat walkman for sale
summary i am backing out because someone is selling me another
keywords digital audio tape sony tcd d3 dat walkman
organization purdue university engineering computer network
lines 64

i recently backed out of purchasing an almost unused sony tcd d3 dat
walkman , having found someone else who has a unit i personally prefer (and am
paying more for). however , it 's still a heck of a machine for the price it
is quite rugged , and many people out there swear by it. (it 's probably the
most popular walkman style dat machine out there.)

anyway , the guy selling it is bryan davis (bdavis@netcom.com) , and
here 's what he told me


here is what is included
tcd d3 datman.
(2) rca to stereo 1 8 plug cables. one for analog input , one for
analog output.
optical digital i o cable (one lead for input , one for output).
a copy of my sales receipt with a note about your purchase. the
unit is still under factory warrantee.
ac adaptor battery charger.
rechargable battery.

i paid 750 tax for it so i hope you do n't mind if i keep the 60 minute
tape it came with (i have some samples on it ! ).

by the way , he spent at least 100 too much for it , unless he 's including an
extended warranty , which is advised for dat machines , since it costs about
300 to replace the head when it wears out , and it probably will within 5
years if you use it a lot.. davisonj


i'm not going to quote my sale price for him that would not be nice.
send him mail and ask him what he wants.

again , i 've used the tcd d3 , and i have to say that i can certainly
understand why it is as popular as it is. i 've been using one for a little
while , and although i had some problems with it recently , i should also point
out that the particular one i was using had been on the road for two years and
had truly been used during that time. (this is the same exact dat machine
that was lugged around the u.s. and canada to record the jazz butcher
conspiracy for their recent live album.)

bryan davis says

i know at least half a dozen professional musicians and record labels
in s.f who use that model (and have been for a while) with no reported
problem. my problem is that everyone i know already has one.


'nuff said.

the reason i'm not getting it is that i found someone else selling me a
unit that features phono plug spdif i o instead of optical (i do n't have any
optical ports on my equipment , but you , the reader , might) , and it also has
some other bells whistles that the tcd d3 does n't. (i am also paying more
for the alternative.) note that phono plug to optical spdif adapters are
available if you absolutely must have one.

of course , it has scms. all consumer decks do. (so do sony minidiscs ,
by the way.)

anyway , if you 're interested , get in touch with bdavis@netcom.com.

subject 486sx motherboard case mouse
organization duke university durham , n.c.
lines 54
nntp posting host raphael.acpub.duke.edu

hello , i have a motherboard and a case for sale as a package.
both of them came from a compuadd computer i bought last august and am
presently upgrading.
here are the specs

motherboard

cyrix 486sl 25 mhz microprocessor
chips and technology chipset (scatsx v2.3.6 slslc)
8 simm banks for a maximum of 32 megs of ram
built in floppy and hard drive controllers
built in ports 1 parallel , 2 serial (9 and 25 pin)
built in paradise svga controller with 1 meg of ram (windows drivers inc.)
can do up to 1024x768 @ 256 colors
based on the western digital wd90c31 chip
math co processor slot
3 16 bit expansion slots and 2 8 bit expansion slots

case

low profile desktop
very nice grey color
150 watt power supply
room for 2 floppies plus hd

mouse

3 button
microsoft compatible
grey color matches case

all original manuals and documentation , video drivers , etc. are included.

you are probably wondering why i must sell the case with the motherboard.
it is simply because the case is custom made for this particular board and
you would be hard pressed to fit another mb in it. however , the case and
this motherboard were made to go together and fit perfectly.

as you can see , since this board includes drive controllers and a video
controller , you can save some money by buying this unit and not a mb
where you would need to get io cards , video card , and drive controllers
its just a lot more convenient on the whole

i would like to ask about 500 for this whole package. i think this is a fair
price given the facts that it includes a video card and drive controllers io
ports. all you need to do is add drives , a monitor , ram , and a keyboard.
also keep in mind that it is n't a generic board , but from compuadd.
i also will entertain all serious offers.

please email at jmu@acpub.duke.edu

thanks

subject re car stereo stolen \?
organization rice university
lines 31

i had the front panel of my car stereo stolen this weekend.

i need to buy the front panel of a sony xr u770 car stereo.

if by any chance anyone has had the body of a sony xr u770
stolen and has an otherwise useless front panel i would
love to buy it from you.

if you know anyone who had a removeable front panel car stereo
stolen from them , could you please forward this message to them \?

thanks !

kris

i was my understanding that the purpose of those removeable front panels
were to make the radio useless , and thus discourage theft (that is if the
cover were removed by the owner and taken along whenever the car was left.)

if those covers were sold for anything remarkably less than the radio
originally costs , or even sold at all ,
then the above discouragement would n't be so great.

i personally would be unhappy , if i bought a radio like that , thinking that
removing the cover greatly depreciated the radio 's value , and the covers were
sold by the company (or other legitimate source) cheaply.

came as gift. i really want to sell them , so make me an offer for
the whole package. if you are participating in a award , 697 is how
much you would end up paying. and i strongly believe that you would
get the same award as i do. if you are interested in those items ,
you could get them from me for a cheaper price.

let me know , and make me an offer. no flames please , i have got enough.

i have used jvc 's top of the line portable cd player for three months now.
i have mostly used it in my car on long trips , so it has less than 20 hours of use on it. the unit is one of the best that i have seen and listened to , but
i am going to part with it to install a disc changer in my car.

features include

rechargeable nicad batteries
wireless remote control

carrying belt and case
digital 6 band graphic eq with spectrum analyzer
25 presets , 5 user programmable

programmable from remote
intro , random , repeat playback

i will include a discwasher (tm) power converter to convert an automobile 's
12v dc to the 5.5v dc that the unit requires. i had to buy this one because
it was the only one that fits , (jvc makes a unique connection that cannot be
found at radio shack etc).

i paid 235 for the disc player and another 30 for the power converter.
i will sell the disc player alone for 180 , or both items for 190.

just to inform the readers of newsrc sony has just introduced a new datman ,
the tcd d7 which is smaller and less expensive than the d3. also , the d7
has a coaxial jack which the d3 lacks. oh , the d3 has always been
available through mail order houses for less than 700 dollars new... with

it 's built with real metal parts , not cheap modern plastic , and it 's painted

the only option you should jumper is the drive select , shown as 4c32c1
above. there is also a drive power up option jumper (elsewhere on the
drive 's board) but the odds of that having been unset are slim.

since the 3b1 normally has only one hd , you would jumper betwwwn c1 to
select the first (possible) drive address if the 2190 is your second drive
on the 3b1 , then jumper between 2c .

similarly , there are people who wanted the advertised catalog who

dj there is starting to be a glut of new aircraft on the market
dj (airlines are taking delivery , then mothballing their new
dj planes).

dj unless the fuel efficiency is better than the airbus 320 or
dj boeing 767 , this plane is not economically feasible for the
dj major players (airlines). unless the price is real cheap , and
dj you have an owner that does n't care about fuel economy (saudi

ummm...

i 'd be surprised if you could n't find a gov't aid program to

beware , from what i understand neither the amd or cyrix 486s are clones of
the intel 486. they are using the name 486 because they run as fast as a
intel 486. they do not have exactly the same instuction set nor do they fit
into the same socket. most are very fast 386s without coprocessors.

amd recent won the appeal against intel to use their microcode , so they

fellow netters ,

i just wanted to let you know that there are a few honest and good people out
there (even outside of iowa). i'm sorry if anyone thinks that i am wasting
space , but i thought you might want some relief from the so and so is a thief
posts. not that i think we should n't hear about the bad deals , but it would be
nice to hear some good news once in a while.

after seeing his post on one of the for sale groups , i mailed mr. mark miller a
request for his copy of wordperfect 5.1 for dos. he suggested a price of 50
in his ad , but when i phoned him , he quoted 40 plus shipping. that sounded
more than fair to me , so i told him that i would send him a check the next day.
imagine my surprise when i logged into my account the following day and found a
message from him saying that it had already been sold (after i had just mailed
the money order). after another e mail message to him , he apologized and
assured me that it was a mistake i was the one who he was holding it for. he
sent the package as soon as he got the money , along with a letter stating a
transfer of license. this was n't good enough for wordperfect , so i asked him
to fill out one of their forms. no problem we thought. it took three times
to get it to the right address (my fault). anyway , he mailed me the form for
my signature and included a workbook that i had no idea was included in the
deal. again , he apologized for not sending it before. i now have the world 's
best word processor and a renewed hope in the world that there are a few good
ones left. i recoend that if you ever see that mark is selling anything thatat
you may want , give him a call. if i had the choice , i would purchase all of my
software from him.

bravo , mr. miller !

time to clear out some miscellaneous lenses , cameras and photo stuff
that 's not being used. some are gems , some are mundane.


minolta af 50 1.7 lens for maxxum cameras. new lens , but i guess it 'd
be best to call it a demo since i did not get the literature , box or
warranty cards. 30.

vivitar 2x converter for nikon f or ai lenses. pretty cute flip back
tang so it will work with all manual focus nikon lenses and bodies.
it will even couple (and double) a non ai lens to an ai body. 15.

pentax 50 1.4 screwmount lens. well actually it 's a super takumar which
is what they all were back then. very mint condition. 25. nice hard
case for this lens 5 more..

alpex 135 2.8 lens. beautifully made , all metal construction with fine
optics. minolta mount. 25. another hard case that fits this with
strap can be added..call it 7 more.

vivitar 283 flash. the one that made vivitar famous (until the 285
eclipsed it). tilt head , removable sensor , variable auto exposure.
30.

universal roamer 63 folding old bellows camera with leather case.
uses 120 or 620 film , 100mm f6.3 lens. kinda cool articulated shutter
release. decent shape. 20.

weston 540 lightmeter. nothin super fancy , but it works well , and is a
good cross check to built in meters. 7 with case and strap.

and finally..the gems

pentax auto 110 camera with 24mm f2.8 lens. this is the little
(and i do mean tiny) slr that pentax made. has interchangeable lenses ,
but try and find the 20 40 zoom , true through the lens viewing with
split image focus , and completely auto exposure. 70.

olympus 35rc rangefinder camera. a really cute little camera with 42mm
lens (f2.8) with built in manual or auto exposure , self timer etc. i
think this was the predecessor to the xa and it 's nearly all metal.
i wo n't mind holding onto this one if it does n't sell. 60.

olympus om 1 with flash shoe , leatherette case , 50 1.4 zuiko lens , and
tokina sd (super dispersion) 70 210 lens. these are all in very nice to
mint condition , except for one little ding on the om body near the film
advance lever. lenses are perfect , and the tokina is a very compact ,
and sharp lens. 225 for the set.


that 'll do to clean out some of the stuff. feel free to offer on this
stuff , although the cheaper stuff is priced to cover my hassle in
shipping it..

for more details call or email.

hi , everyone


i need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

several weeks ago i posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external hd for mac. the scumster r.e.p. called my friend and
they agreed on a price. my friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
english) paid by check , requesting r.e.p. to call him back when the check
arrives and the hd is send. well , the check was cashed 3 24 and that is
that. phone that r.e.p. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left e mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. i know , that r.e.p. is a student at
university of delaware i have his e mail address , his us postal address
and his ( \? ) phone . the question is what is the best way to proceed \?

thanks in advance for any advice.

sincerely ,
victor levenson (vvl2h@virginia.edu)

p.s. the reason i did not put r.e.p. 's full name is that i still hope...


p.p.s. if i get enough responses i will post a summary , maybe even on a
regular basis.

well , i'm not sure i 'd go quite that far , but i agree that motorola
gear is of better quality. the question is how much that quality
is worth to a ham in amateur service , not commercial service

this radio can hear a repeater thats 40 miles away without
an antenna.

ok , great. but how often does that come up \? how good is
good enough , and how much is someone willing to pay for it \?
a good ham quality ht is maybe 500 , while a commercial
quality one is maybe 2000. is the increased reliability and
performance worth 4 times the price in amateur service \?
only the individual involved can answer that question , and each
ham has to decide for him herself. if motorola quality is worth
4 times the price to you , then more power to ya'. but i'm amazed
that folks make that choice. for , me , given that i 've got 2000 to
spend , i'l pick the yaesu ht and a nice new hf rig every time over
a motorola ht alone , no matter how good it is. to me , ham quality
gear is good enough . to each his own...

very fast (up to 192 cps) printing in printer controlled (as
opposed to windows driver controlled) printing
bidirectional printing for faster processing speed

remaining stack of tractor fed paper (about .4 )
free copy of windows printer driver (unless this is illegal , or if

free unregistered dos shareware program ( 2 registration , i think)
that apparently offers some word processing capabilities

the last two will be on a disk (either size). i am asking for around
165 , but i am open to any (reasonable) offers. i am a college
student , so i cannot afford to buy a new printer without getting a
considerable portion of the money from this printer. this price
includes all above items , and shipping (probably ups) is included as
well. i have the original box , but only one of the original styrofoam
end pieces. i will use a towel on the other end (you get a free towel
too ! ! ). worked fine getting it here. the whole shebang might not fit
in the original box i will figure this out after the offers come in.

hi ,

i have a humminbird hdr200 depth sounder for sale. it
has been used for 1 season on my sailboat.

all parts are included as well as the installation
instructions. it is even packed in the original box it came in. there
is no damage to the unit or the transducer. in fact , the transducer
was mounted inside the hull in a piece of pipe glued to the hull.
so it led a sheltered life. the transducer can be mounted either inside
the hull as i did , or on the transom. it cannot be placed in a hole
drilled into your hull.

it is fully waterproof and fits into a 2 hole in a bulkhead
(that 's where i had it installed) or into a standard dashboard on a
powerboat. it reads depth to 199' and has a backlit lcd display. it has
an adjustable shallow water alarm built in.

i am changing out my instruments to another manufacturer that
outputs the nmea 0183 information. this little depth sounder works fine
and is very stable.


it is usually priced as low as 130 in some catalogs , i paid 150 .


the first 80 takes it , or best offer.

i have the following items for sale.

rabbit pip tuner
soloflex like gym
scanner (800 mhz)
cb antenna
blazer jimmy running boards


rabbit pip (picture in picture) box.

this device when used with a vcr tuner will allow you to
have a second channel popped up on any corner of the screen.
the you can press swap on the remote and the small picture
will be swapped with the main picture.

the only limitation to this box is that it is has 36 channel
tuner. this means that the box itself cannot tune higher
than cable channel 36. however , if your vcr tuner is capable
of tuning higher than this , then you simply tune the vcr to the
channel desired and then swap pictures (assuming the alternate
picture is channel 36 or lower) and it will work fine.

original cost 149
will sell for 75



running boards for jimmy or blazer

brand new black running boards for the s10 15 models. i purchased them

to fit those kodak slide projectors

i am willing to give away singer caramate ii or singer caramete sp (

each projector (viewer) will equal trade for 1 or 2 kodak projector lenses
depend on the focal length. i will pay for the shipping for singer

since i do n't need those singer projectors , if you have some 35mm slr system
you do n't need , i am willing to do the trade as well.

pc game for sale

waxworks by horrorsoft accolade (5.25 ) 30

by the same folks who brought you elvira i ii. i played
elvira i ii , and think that horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with waxworks. the look and feel is
roughly the same as in the elvira games , though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive. the first two games ,
especially elvira ii jaws of cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hit point restoring was very difficult. this
is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park , but it is
quite fair , in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective , or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy. in one of the four wax works to be explored , there is
no fighting at all (well almost none) , though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles.

the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really
broken up into four seperate rpgs , one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter. in starting each one , your character is transported
with no objects to use , and experience level 1. one exhibits traps
you inside a multi level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must
escape by fighting , mapping and puzzle solving. another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods , while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies. this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans , kill the head plant alien , and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up. this is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit. another exhibit puts you into
jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper
victim , and of course the police think you are responsible. you must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and
meet him face to face but first get a disquise. the last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to
stop the almost indestructible zombies.

over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a
creepy tone for the game , as was the case for the elvira games , though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.
i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans.

all games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.
