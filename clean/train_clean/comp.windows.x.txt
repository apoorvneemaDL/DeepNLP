hey guys !
i work on many stations and would like this name and current logname
to be in a title of xterm when it 's open and a machine name only
when it 's closed. in other words , i want host and logname to appear
as a title of opened xterm and host when xterm is closed.
how can i do it \?
almost all window managers (twm , mwm , olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. for your purpose put following into your
.login (if you 're using csh or tcsh) , for sh you have to modify it.

if ( term xterm ) then
echo 2 logname @ host g 1 host g
endif
1) this is not a feature of the window manager but of xterm.
2) this sequences are not ansi compatible , are they \?
does anyone know if there are compatible sequences for this and what they
are \? i would think they are dcs (device control sequence) introduced ,
but may be a csi sequence exists , too \?
this must work on a dxterm (vt and ansi compatible) , it may not work
on xterms.
it works on xterms. at least i have no problem with it. back to the original
question

i usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop
menu. here is a sample command

xterm sl 999 n ls12i title ls12i e rlogin ls12i

the n and title options give the text for window and icon. as i use the
tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh) , i can do the following

i have an

alias precmd echo n ' 2 host cwd g'

in my .tcshrc. this is a special alias for tvtwm. it is executed each time
before printing the prompt. so , i have the current host name and the current
directory path in the title bar of my xterms.

have you gotten an answer yet \? using your variables , this is what i would do
xterm t host logname n host

subject xquerybestcursor semi broken \?
organization national center for atmospheric research
lines 18

some one asked me recently why they when they used xquerybestcursor to see
if they could create of a given size it seemed to imply they could , but the
server did not create cursors of that size. investigation showed that some x
servers will happily return any size up to the size of the root window , while
others return some fixed limit of more reasonable size. the interesting thing
to me is that the same server binary acts differently on different hardware
a sun4 with a cg2 will claim cursors up to root window size are ok , while a
sun4 with a cg6 will stop at 32x32. so far i 've also seen this behavior on
ncd and phase x x terminals and have been told it also occurs on hps.
actually , the ncd is even more liberal sizes much larger then the root
winodw are gladly returned as ok. is xquerybestcursor semi broken or is this
behavior correct \? i 'd really like to see a 2000x2000 cursor !

hi ,

i'm trying to write a motif program on an interactive unix machine , and i'm
observing very strange behavior when my program attempts to expose a
drawingarea. namely , some xlib operations work , and some do not. in
particular , the expose consist of two xfillrectangle calls followed by some
xdrawpoint calls , and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing
whenever a pulldown or popup up menu is (clicked on and) moved in the
rightward direction over the drawing area , but after the move , is still on
some part of the drawing area. this also happens less consistently when the
pulldown popup is moved in the leftward direction.

assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd , is this a server
bug \?

thanks ,

no , it is n't. it is the x window system , or x11 , or x or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the x consortium....

there is no such thing as x windows or x window , despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags.

i used to think this way , and not just about x. for example , incorrect
english constructs such as its raining or it 's window id annoy me.
however , there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way
things really are in the world.

well , yes and no. i do n't particularly want this discussion to spark
a lengthy debate , but i do think it 's worth pointing out that popular
usage is not always sufficient excuse.

in this case , for example , i think an appropriate parallel may be found
in the pronunciation of proper names if people commonly misspelled or
mispronounced your name , would you feel compelled to change it \? probably
not.

the same is true of x. the x window system , x , x11 , and related
monickers are proper names in the same sense that any product name is a
proper name. in fact , some of them are trademarked names. the fact
that many people get them wrong is largely beside the point.

as for the trade publications that promulgate things like x window or
x.windows or any of the other nonsensical variants one often sees ,
consider the fact that these publications are supposedly written by
journalists . would you trust the facts of a journalist who could n't
be bothered to get the name of his her source right \? would you trust
a product review by someone who got the name of the product wrong \?

popular usage is as it may be , but i for one am all for holding people
who claim to be journalists to a higher standard of correctness.

indeed , the fact that x won out over news
was really down to popular opinion (i know , we all think it 's( ! ) technically
superior as well ! ).

x11 technically superior to news \? well , in some alternate universe

one widget is a multi column list (which lots of people have

the o'reilly example fails for almost every set of inputs because

the xtici editor fails in xcmsstorecolors , apparently because the

you ca n't actually edit any colors.

finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview.
i put together a quick test , and i 've found that xputimage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average \? ) than the
sunview command pw rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that
(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down or
(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both ! my question is , what
is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window \? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server \? or am i stuck with
xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...) \?

then to draw i do

xdrawline( mydisplay , xtwindow( drawingarea1) , gc , x1 , y1 , x2 , y2)
xflush( mydisplay)

and when i'm all done , to return things to normal i do

xsetfunction( mydisplay , gc , gxcopy)


what i 'd like to happen is for the lines i draw to be the inverse of
whatever i'm drawing over. instead what happens is i get white lines. if
the lines are over a white background nothing shows up. if the lines are
over a black area nothing shows up ! it 's very strange. but the gxxor
function seems right since if i do a rubber banding box , it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

any suggestions what i'm doing wrong \?


i believe for this to work on a color display you must set the foreground of
the gc to be (foreground background).

some time back i asked for software recommendations to allow me to
run x from my pc at home to my sparc at the office.

many thanks for all replies , the majority of people recommended
pcxremote from ncd. i received it yesterday and installed it on
my sparc and pc with only one hitch.
the unix install consists of copying 2 files into some local bin directory.
on the pc side , i ordered the windows version which came with a slick windows
installation.


the only problem i had was that my .xinitrc in my home directory
had the line
display `hostname` 0.0 export display

s.t the clients i kicked off connected to my xserver on the sparc console.
by removing this line from the .xinitrc everything worked as planned
and the clients connected to the server at

`hostname` 1.0

some comments on performance , i was connected to a sparc 2 thru
a netblazer terminal server over a 9600 baud line.
my pc is a 486 dx2 ati ultra , 16 mb

bitmap stuff sucked.
basic editing and compilation stuff definitely usable.
xmail was very usable.

at times the first time u typed in an xclient window there was
a very noticable delay , i put this down to brain damaged windows
should not be called a scheduler , besides that this will become
my remote work environment for a while.

has anybody tried the non windows version of the product , the sales
person said they performed about the same , given the over head of
windows i question this \?

many thanks for help to all who responded

hey guys !
i work on many stations and would like this name and current logname
to be in a title of xterm when it 's open and a machine name only
when it 's closed. in other words , i want host and logname to appear
as a title of opened xterm and host when xterm is closed.
how can i do it \?

almost all window managers (twm , mwm , olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. for your purpose put following into your
.login (if you 're using csh or tcsh) , for sh you have to modify it.

if ( term xterm ) then
echo 2 logname @ host g 1 host g
endif


1) this is not a feature of the window manager but of xterm.
2) this sequences are not ansi compatible , are they \?
does anyone know if there are compatible sequences for this and what they
are \? i would think they are dcs (device control sequence) introduced ,
but may be a csi sequence exists , too \?
this must work on a dxterm (vt and ansi compatible) , it may not work
on xterms.

ports of motif to both 386bsd and linux are available for a fee of about

pertaining to motif has been high.


i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial
and non commercial software (ie. you will only get free software using
athena or openlook widget sets , and only get commercial software using
the motif widget sets).


i ca n't see why. if just about every workstation will come with motif
by default and you can buy it for under 100 for the free unix
platforms , i ca n't see this causing major problems.

let me add another of my concerns yes , i can buy a port of motif for cheap ,
but i cannot get the source for cheap , hence i am limited to using whatever x
libraries the motif port was compiled against (at least with older versions of
motif. i have been told that motif 1.2 can be used with any x , but i have not
seen it myself).

currently , i have x11r5 running on eight different unix platforms , of which
only three came with motif. on those three , i am unable to use the x11r5
libraries to build motif clients , because i get link errors between the
vendor supplied port of motif and my x11r5. i anticipate having this same
problem when x11r6 becomes available.

the result is that i cannot build motif clients that rely on x11r5 , since i do
not have motif compiled under x11r5. true , i could buy another port of motif ,
but that sort of ruins the whole idea of free , does n't it \?

there 's really no way to force a window manager to do much of anything

there is no event mask for a particular mouse button press. however in your
event handler you can use the event structure passed in and query it to find
which button was pressed i.e.

void
someeventhandler(widget w , xtpointer data , xevent event)

catch the button 1 (usually left button)
if ( event xbutton.button button1 )
do some action

do nothing and exit from function

i am having a problem with the high order bit of a character being
clipped when entered in an xterm window under motif. i have reprogrammed
the f1 key to transmit a ff be character sequence by using the
following line in .xdefaults

ctrl shift alt key f1 string(0xff) string(0xbe) n

i merge in this line with xrdb merge and then create the new xterm
which has the remapped f1 key. the problem that arises is that the
application which is recieving input at the time only sees a 7f 3e
sequence , which is ff be with the high order bit of each
character being filtered or ignored.

when i run xev and press the f1 key , i get the correct value showing
up in the following two key events

keypress event , serial 14 , synthetic no , window 0x2800001 ,
root 0x28 , subw 0x0 , time 2067815294 , (67 , 80) , root (74 , 104) ,

notice that the keysym being transmitted is correct 0xffbe.
but when i use the f1 key while in vi or in a program i wrote to
spit back the hex values of keyboard input , i only get 7f 3e .

does anyone know why the high order bit is being filtered and what
i can do to make sure that the entire 8bits make it through to
the final application \? any help is greatly appreciated.

dropsite in the main control area , while the source in contrib xview
knows nothing about drag and drop.

the textedit.c included in the xview sources says it 's version 15.50 ,

store and reply of mouse and keyboard events


to produce regression tests or automatic demo 's
we would like to store all mouse and keyboard events
produced by a user. it should be possible to filter
the mouse and keyboard events from the server 's queue
an to store them in a file.
this sequence of events , stored in a file , should be given
to the server 's queue as if a user is working.


1. exists a tool that is capable to save and reply all
mouse and keyboard events (where) \?

2. where one can catch these events to store them \?
in our case the server 's queue is on a x terminal (hp).
where can we catch all events coming from a given
server.
if this is not possible , can we catch all events given
to a certain client and how \?

3. where one can send a stored sequence of events to simulate a user \?
is there a central dispatcher on the clients machine who manages
all incoming events from a given server and how can we reach it \?


thanks in advance

subject gcc and building the hp widget set on linux
reply to wpwood@austin.ibm.com (bill woodward)
organization the institute of knowledge on jinx
lines 30


i am currently attempting to get a copy of the hp widget set compiled
under linux (sls release with kernel 99.6) and am running into some
problems. actually , it seems that this is more of a gcc question ,
because i got it to compile without trouble using cc on an rs 6000.
basically , there are a number of functions with prototypes
set up in , let 's say , compositep.h , for instance , the composite
widget 's insert child procedure is set up with the type

typedef void ( xtwidgetproc) (widget)

but in several places in the hp source code , they reference the
insert child procedure and pass it multiple arguments instead of just
one , as the prototype suggests. for example

( superclass composite class.insert child)(w , args , p num args)

now , gcc chokes on this , giving an error message that too many arguments
are passed to the function. so , does anyone have any suggestions as to
how to turn off this checking in gcc , or how i can go about changing the
code to accomodate this call without changing usr include x11 compositep.h ,
or has anyone successfully built the hp widget set and have any suggestions.
many thanks in advance for any help.

it is actually worse than you think. i have the same problem , and have

note that the emacs on my hp has no problem , and i am using exactly
the same xmodmap and emacs configuration.

i 've seen a lot of different terms , which seem to mean the same thing.
who can give an exact definition what these terms mean

) multi screen
) multi headed
) multi display
) x server zaphod mode

is there a limit how many screens displays a single server can handle
(in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) \?

how is the capability called , if i want to move the cursor from one
screen display to another.

as to how many clients may be display on a server , i believe the limit
would be how much memory is available to your server or allocated by the
server.


this all sounds suspiciously like my company might have something to
do with this.

background first megatek has a series of framebuffers designed as
x accelerators. for the most part these are designed for sun sbus
and sun (and other vendor 's) vme systems.

that said , megatek products support multi screen and or multi display
on a sigle workstation. most of our cards have a keyboard mouse port
which can be used to provide additional displays. for example , say
you hade a sparcstation with an sbus expansion chassis. you could
put in six frambuffers , allowing a total of six screens in the system.
you could then attach from 1 to 6 keyboard mice , allowing you to
mix and match any combination of screens and displays. you could
have 1 6 screen display , 3 2 screen displays , 6 1 screen displays ,
or 1 2 screen display and 1 4 screen display. basically any
combination.

because of this , we at megatek try to be very careful about the use
of the words multi screen and multi display. they are quite different
in meaning , and (at least in x) have exact definitions.

the reason i ramble like this is the mention of an upper limit if 12
screens in a display. as it so happens , there 's a define in the server
that determines the most screens supported (server include misc.h ,
maxscreens). as released my mit , this is 3. as released by megatek ,
this is 12.

as such , the most screens supported by a single megatek display (i.e.
x server) is 12. if someone construed this to be a limitation of x
i'm sorry , but clearly (as pointed out so well by mr. neto) this is
not the case.

we just did it here because nobody has ever asked us for more. of
course , i could say buy all you want , we 'll support more.

in some it cannot keep even the maximum value set by

panel slider item and panel text item attributes

panel notify level panel attr(attr enum , 152) ,

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.

subject 121) are callbacks guaranteed to be called in the order registered \?

although some books demonstrate that the current implementation of xt
happens to call callback procedures in the order in which they are registered ,
the specification does not guarantee such a sequence , and supplemental
authoritative documents (i.e. the asente swick volume) do say that the order is
undefined. because the callback list can be manipulated by both the widget and
the application , xt cannot guarantee the order of execution.
in general , the callback procedures should be thought of as operating
independently of one another and should not depend on side effects of other
callbacks operating if a seqence is needed , then the single callback to be
registered can explicitly call other functions necessary.

subject 122) why does n't xtdestroywidget() actually destroy the widget \?

xtdestroywidget() operates in two passes , in order to avoid leaving
dangling data structures the function call marks the widget , which is not
actually destroyed until your program returns to its event loop.


subject 123) how do i query the user synchronously using xt \?

it is possible to have code which looks like this trivial callback ,
which has a clear flow of control. the calls to askuser() block until answer
is set to one of the valid values. if it is not a yes answer , the code drops
out of the callback and back to an event processing loop

void quit(widget w , xtpointer client , xtpointer call)

int answer
answer askuser(w , really quit \? )
if (ret yes answer)

answer askuser(w , are you really positive \? )
if (ret yes answer)
exit(0)



a more realistic example might ask whether to create a file or whether
to overwrite it.
this is accomplished by entering a second event processing loop and
waiting until the user answers the question the answer is returned to the
calling function. that function askuser() looks something like this , where the
motif can be replaced with widget set specific code to create some sort of
dialog box displaying the question string and buttons for ok , cancel and
help or equivalents

int askuser(w , string)
widget w
char string

int answer ret none some not used marker
widget dialog could cache carry , but ...
arg args 3
int n 0
xtappcontext context

n 0
xtsetarg(args n , xmnmessagestring , xmstringcreateltor(string ,
xmstring default charset)) n
xtsetarg(args n , xmndialogstyle , xmdialog application modal) n
dialog xmcreatequestiondialog(xtparent(w) , string , args , n)
xtaddcallback(dialog , xmnokcallback , response , answer)
xtaddcallback(dialog , xmncancelcallback , response , answer)
xtaddcallback(dialog , xmnhelpcallback , response , answer)
xtmanagechild(dialog)

context xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (w)
while (answer ret none xtapppending(context))
xtappprocessevent (context , xtimall)

xtdestroywidget(dialog) blow away the dialog box and shell
return answer


the dialog supports three buttons , which are set to call the same
function when tickled by the user. the variable answer is set when the user
finally selects one of those choices

void response(w , client , call)
widget w
xtpointer client
xtpointer call

int answer (int ) client
xmanycallbackstruct reason (xmanycallbackstruct ) call
switch (reason reason)
case xmcr ok
answer ret yes some define value
break
case xmcr cancel
answer ret no
break
case xmcr help
answer ret help
break
default
return



and the code unwraps back to the point at which an answer was needed and
continues from there.

subject 124) how do i determine the name of an existing widget \?
i have a widget id and need to know what the name of that widget is.

users of r4 and later are best off using the xtname() function , which
will work on both widgets and non widget objects.

if you are still using r3 , you can use this simple bit of code to do
what you want. note that it depends on the widget 's internal data structures
and is not necessarily portable to future versions of xt , including r4.

include x11 corep.h
include x11 xresource.h
string xtname (widget)
widget widget will work with non widget objects

return xrmnametostring(widget core.xrm name)

subject 125) why do i get a baddrawable error drawing to xtwindow(widget) \?
i'm doing this in order to get a window into which i can do xlib graphics
within my xt based program

canvas xtcreatemanagedwidget ( ... , widgetclass , ...) drawing area
...
window xtwindow(canvas) get the window associated with the widget
...
xdrawline (... , window , ...) produces error

the window associated with the widget is created as a part of the
realization of the widget. using a window id of null ( no window ) could
create the error that you describe. it is necessary to call xtrealizewidget()
before attempting to use the window associated with a widget.
note that the window will be created after the xtrealizewidget() call ,
but that the server may not have actually mapped it yet , so you should also
wait for an expose event on the window before drawing into it.


subject 126) why do i get a badmatch error when calling xgetimage \?

the badmatch error can occur if the specified rectangle goes off the edge of
the screen. if you do n't want to catch the error and deal with it , you can take
the following steps to avoid the error

1) make a pixmap the same size as the rectangle you want to capture.
2) clear the pixmap to background using xfillrectangle.
3) use xcopyarea to copy the window to the pixmap.
4) if you get a noexpose event , the copy was clean. use xgetimage to grab the
image from the pixmap.
5) if you get one or more graphicsexpose events , the copy was n't clean , and
the x y width height members of the graphicsexpose event structures tell you
the parts of the pixmap which are n't good.
6) get rid of the pixmap it probably takes a lot of memory.

subject 127) how can my application tell if it is being run under x \?

a number of programs offer x modes but otherwise run in a straight
character only mode. the easiest way for an application to determine that it is
running on an x display is to attempt to open a connection to the x server

display xopendisplay(display name)
if (display)
do x stuff
else
do curses or something else
where display name is either the string specified on the command line following
display , by convention , or otherwise is (char )null in which case
xopendisplay uses the value of display , if set .

this is superior to simply checking for the existence a display command line
argument or checking for display set in the environment , neither of which is
adequate. 5 91


subject 128) how do i make a busy cursor while my application is computing \?
is it necessary to call xdefinecursor() for every window in my application \?

the easiest thing to do is to create a single inputonly window that is
as large as the largest possible screen make it a child of your toplevel
window and it will be clipped to that window , so it wo n't affect any other
application. (it needs to be as big as the largest possible screen in case the
user enlarges the window while it is busy or moves elsewhere within a virtual
desktop.) substitute toplevel with your top most widget here (similar code
should work for xlib only applications just use your top window)

unsigned long valuemask
xsetwindowattributes attributes

ignore device events while the busy cursor is displayed.
valuemask cwdontpropagate cwcursor
attributes.do not propagate mask (keypressmask keyreleasemask
buttonpressmask buttonreleasemask pointermotionmask)
attributes.cursor xcreatefontcursor(xtdisplay(toplevel) , xc watch)

the window will be as big as the display screen , and clipped by
its own parent window , so we never have to worry about resizing
xcreatewindow(xtdisplay(toplevel) , xtwindow(toplevel) , 0 , 0 ,
65535 , 65535 , (unsigned int) 0 , 0 , inputonly ,
copyfromparent , valuemask , attributes)

where the maximum size above could be replaced by the real size of the screen ,
particularly to avoid servers which have problems with windows larger than
32767.

when you want to use this busy cursor , map and raise this window to go back to
normal , unmap it. this will automatically keep you from getting extra mouse
events depending on precisely how the window manager works , it may or may not
have a similar effect on keystrokes as well.

in addition , note also that most of the xaw widgets support an xtncursor
resource which can be temporarily reset , should you merely wish to change the
cursor without blocking pointer events.

subject 129) how do i fork without hanging my parent x program \?

an x based application which spawns off other unix processes which
continue to run after it is closed typically does not vanish until all of its
children are terminated the children inherit from the parent the open x
connection to the display.
what you need to do is fork then , immediately , in the child process ,
close (connectionnumber(xtdisplay(widget)))
to close the file descriptor in the display information. after this do your
exec. you will then be able to exit the parent.
alternatively , before exec'ing make this call , which causes the file
descriptor to be closed on exec.
(void) fcntl(connectionnumber(xdisplay) , f setfd , 1)

subject 130) can i make xt or xlib calls from a signal handler \?

no. xlib and xt have no mutual exclusion for protecting critical
sections. if your signal handler makes such a call at the wrong time (which
might be while the function you are calling is already executing) , it can leave
the library in an inconsistent state. note that the ansi c standard points
out that behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself , so this is not a problem specific to
xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other functions which may be
called safely but it may not be assumed that these functions are called by
xlib or xt functions.
you can work around the problem by setting a flag in the interrupt
handler and later checking it with a work procedure or a timer event which
has previously been added.

note the article in the x journal 1 4 and the example in o'reilly
volume 6 are in error.

thanks to pete ware (ware@cis.ohio state.edu) and donna converse
(converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu) , 5 92


subject 131) what are these xlib sequence lost errors \?

you may see these errors if you issue xlib requests from an xlib error
handler , or , more likely , if you make calls which generate x requests to xt or
xlib from a signal handler , which you should n't be doing in any case.


subject 132) how can my xt program handle socket , pipe , or file input \?

it 's very common to need to write an xt program that can accept input
both from a user via the x connection and from some other file descriptor , but
which operates efficiently and without blocking on either the x connection or
the other file descriptor.
a solution is use xtappaddinput(). after you open your file descriptor ,
use xtappaddinput() to register an input handler. the input handler will be
called every time there is something on the file descriptor requiring your
program 's attention. write the input handler like you would any other xt
callback , so it does its work quickly and returns. it is important to use only
non blocking i o system calls in your input handlers.
most input handlers read the file descriptor , although you can have an
input handler write or handle exception conditions if you wish.
be careful when you register an input handler to read from a disk file.
you will find that the function is called even when there is n't input pending.
xtappaddinput() is actually working as it is supposed to. the input handler is
called whenever the file descriptor is ready to be read , not only when there is
new data to be read. a disk file (unlike a pipe or socket) is almost always
ready to be read , however , if only because you can spin back to the beginning
and read data you 've read before. the result is that your function will almost
always be called every time around xtappmainloop(). there is a way to get the
type of interaction you are expecting add this line to the beginning of your
function to test whether there is new data
if (ioctl(fd , fionread , n) 1 n 0) return
but , because this is called frequently , your application is effectively in a
busy wait you may be better off not using xtappaddinput() and instead setting
a timer and in the timer procedure checking the file for input.

subject 133) how do i simulate a button press release event for a widget \?

you can do this using xsendevent() it 's likely that you 're not setting
the window field in the event , which xt needs in order to match to the widget
which should receive the event.
if you 're sending events to your own application , then you can use
xtdispatchevent() instead. this is more efficient than xsendevent() in that you
avoid a round trip to the server.
depending on how well the widget was written , you may be able to call
its action procedures in order to get the effects you want.

subject 134) why does n't anything appear when i run this simple program \?

...
the window xcreatesimplewindow(the display ,
root window , size hints.x , size hints.y ,
size hints.width , size hints.height , border width ,
blackpixel(the display , the screen) ,
whitepixel(the display , the screen))
...
xselectinput(the display , the window , exposuremask buttonpressmask
buttonreleasemask)
xmapwindow(the display , the window)
...
xdrawline(the display , the window , the gc , 5 , 5 , 100 , 100)
...

you are right to map the window before drawing into it. however , the
window is not ready to be drawn into until it actually appears on the screen
until your application receives an expose event. drawing done before that will
generally not appear. you 'll see code like this in many programs this code
would appear after window was created and mapped
while ( ! done)

xnextevent(the display , the event)
switch (the event.type)
case expose on expose events , redraw
xdrawline(the display , the window , the gc , 5 , 5 , 100 , 100)
break
...



note that there is a second problem some xlib implementations do n't
set up the default graphics context to have correct foreground background
colors , so this program could previously include this code
...
the gc values.foreground blackpixel(the display , the screen) e.g.
the gc values.background whitepixel(the display , the screen) e.g.
the gc xcreategc(the display , the window ,
gcforeground gcbackground , the gc values)
...

note the code uses blackpixel and whitepixel to avoid assuming that 1 is
black and 0 is white or vice versa. the relationship between pixels 0 and 1
and the colors black and white is implementation dependent. they may be
reversed , or they may not even correspond to black and white at all.

also note that actually using blackpixel and whitepixel is usually the wrong
thing to do in a finished program , as it ignores the user 's preference for
foreground and background.

and also note that you can run into the same situation in an xt based program
if you draw into the xtwindow(w) right after it has been realized it may
not yet have appeared.


subject 135) what is the difference between a screen and a screen \?

the 'screen' is an xlib structure which includes the information about
one of the monitors or virtual monitors which a single x display supports. a
server can support several independent screens. they are numbered unix 0.0 ,
unix 0.1 , unix 0.2 , etc the 'screen' or 'screen number' is the second digit
the 0 , 1 , 2 which can be thought of as an index into the array of available
screens on this particular display connection.
the macros which you can use to obtain information about the particular
screen on which your application is running typically have two forms one
which takes a screen and one with takes both the display and the screen number.
in xt based programs , you typically use xtscreen(widget) to determine
the screen on which your application is running , if it uses a single screen.
(part of the confusion may arise from the fact that some of the macros
which return characteristics of the screen have display in the names
xdisplaywidth , xdisplayheight , etc.)

subject 138) can xgetwindowattributes get a window 's background pixel pixmap \?

no. once set , the background pixel or pixmap of a window cannot be
re read by clients. the reason for this is that a client can create a pixmap ,
set it to be the background pixmap of a window , and then free the pixmap. the
window keeps this background , but the pixmap itself is destroyed. if you 're
sure a window has a background pixel (not a pixmap) , you can use xcleararea()
to clear a region to the background color and then use xgetimage() to read
back that pixel. however , this action alters the contents of the window , and
it suffers from race conditions with exposures. courtesy dave lemke of ncd
and stuart marks of sun

note that the same applies to the border pixel pixmap. this is a
(mis)feature of the protocol which allows the server is free to manipulate the
pixel pixmap however it wants. by not requiring the server to keep the
original pixel or pixmap , some (potentially a lot of) space can be saved.

subject 139) how do i create a transparent window \?

a completely transparent window is easy to get use an inputonly
window. in order to create a window which is mostly transparent , you have
several choices
the shape extension first released with x11r4 offers an easy way to
make non rectangular windows , so you can set the shape of the window to fit the
areas where the window should be nontransparent however , not all servers
support the extension.
a machine specific method of implementing transparent windows for
particular servers is to use an overlay plane supported by the hardware. note
that there is no x notion of a transparent color index .
a generally portable solution is to use a large number of tiny
windows , but this makes operating on the application as a unit difficult.
a final answer is to consider whether you really need a transparent
window or if you would be satisfied with being able to overlay your application
window with information if so , you can draw into separate bitplanes in colors
that will appear properly.

subject 140) why does n't gxxor produce mathematically correct color values \?

when using gxxor you may expect that drawing with a value of black on a
background of black , for example , should produce white. however , the drawing
operation does not work on rgb values but on colormap indices. the color that
the resulting colormap index actually points to is undefined and visually
random unless you have actually filled it in yourself. on many x servers black
and white often 0 1 or 1 0 programs taking advantage of this mathematical
coincidence will break.
if you want to be combining colors with gxxor , then you should be
allocating a number of your own color cells and filling them with your chosen
pre computed values.
if you want to use gxxor simply to switch between two colors , then you
can take the shortcut of setting the background color in the gc (graphics
context) to 0 and the foreground color to a value such that when it draws over
red , say , the result is blue , and when it draws over blue the result is red.
this foreground value is itself the xor of the colormap indices of red and
blue.

subject 141) why does every color i allocate show up as black \?

make sure you 're using 16 bits and not 8. the red , green , and blue
fields of an xcolor structure are scaled so that 0 is nothing and 65535 is
full blast. if you forget to scale (using , for example , 0 255 for each color)
the xalloccolor function will perform correctly but the resulting color is
usually black.

subject 142) why ca n't my program get a standard colormap \?
i have an image processing program which uses xgetrgbcolormap() to get the

xgetrgbcolormap() when used with the property xa rgb default map does
not create a standard colormap it just returns one if one already exists.
use xstdcmap or do what it does in order to create the standard colormap first.

subject 143) why does the pixmap i copy to the screen show up as garbage \?

the initial contents of pixmaps are undefined. this means that most
servers will allocate the memory and leave around whatever happens to be there
which is usually garbage. you probably want to clear the pixmap first using
xfillrectangle() with a function of gxcopy and a foreground pixel of whatever
color you want as your background (or 0l if you are using the pixmap as a
mask). courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun


subject 144) how do i check whether a window id is valid \?
my program has the id of a window on a remote display. i want to check whether
the window exists before doing anything with it.

because x is asynchronous , there is n't a guarantee that the window
would still exist between the time that you got the id and the time you sent an
event to the window or otherwise manipulated it. what you should do is send the
event without checking , but install an error handler to catch any badwindow
errors , which would indicate that the window no longer exists. this scheme will
work except on the rare occasion that the original window has been destroyed
and its id reallocated to another window.

courtesy ken lee (klee@synoptics.com) , 4 90


subject 145) can i have two applications draw to the same window \?

yes. the x server assigns ids to windows and other resources (actually ,
the server assigns some bits , the client others) , and any application that
knows the id can manipulate the resource almost any x server resource , except
for gcs and private color cells , can be shared .
the problem you face is how to disseminate the window id to multiple
applications. a simple way to handle this (and which solves the problem of the
applications' running on different machines) is in the first application to
create a specially named property on the root window and put the window id into
it. the second application then retrieves the property , whose name it also
knows , and then can draw whatever it wants into the window.
note this scheme works iff there is only one instance of the first
application running , and the scheme is subject to the limitations mentioned
in the question about using window ids on remote displays.
note also that you will still need to coordinate any higher level
cooperation among your applications.
note also that two processes can share a window but should not try to
use the same server connection. if one process is a child of the other , it
should close down the connection to the server and open its own connection.

subject 146) why ca n't my program work with tvtwm or swm \?

a number of applications , including xwd , xwininfo , and xsetroot , do not
handle the virtual root window which tvtwm and swm use they typically return
the wrong child of root. a general solution is to add this code or to use it in
your own application where you would normally use rootwindow(dpy , screen)

function name getvroot
description gets the root window , even if it 's a virtual root
arguments the display and the screen
returns the root window for the client

include x11 xatom.h
window getvroot(dpy , scr)
display dpy
int scr

window rootreturn , parentreturn , children
unsigned int numchildren
window root rootwindow(dpy , scr)
atom swm vroot none
int i

swm vroot xinternatom(dpy , swm vroot , false)
xquerytree(dpy , root , rootreturn , parentreturn , children , numchildren)
for (i 0 i numchildren i )
atom actual type
int actual format

window newroot null

if (xgetwindowproperty(dpy , children i , swm vroot , 0 , 1 ,
false , xa window , actual type , actual format , nitems ,
bytesafter , (unsigned char ) newroot) success newroot)
root newroot
break



return root

subject 147) how do i keep a window from being resized by the user \?

resizing the window is done through the window manager window managers
can pay attention to the size hints your application places on the window , but
there is no guarantee that the window manager will listen. you can try setting
the minimum and maximum size hints to your target size and hope for the best.

subject 148) how do i keep a window in the foreground at all times \?

it 's rather antisocial for an application to constantly raise itself
e.g. by tracking visibilitynotify events so that it is n't overlapped
imagine the conflict between two such programs running.
the only sure way to have your window appear on the top of the stack
is to make the window override redirect this means that you are temporarily
assuming window management duties while the window is up , so you want to do
this infrequently and then only for short periods of time (e.g. for popup
menus or other short parameter setting windows).

subject 149) how do i make text and bitmaps blink in x \?

there is no easy way. unless you 're willing to depend on some sort of
extension (as yet non existent) , you have to arrange for the blinking yourself ,
either by redrawing the contents periodically or , if possible , by playing games
with the colormap and changing the color of the contents.

subject 150) how do i get a double click in xlib \?

users of xt have the support of the translation manager to help
get notification of double clicking.
there is no good way to get only a double click in xlib , because the
protocol does not provide enough support to do double clicks. you have to do
client side timeouts , unless the single click action is such that you can defer
actually taking it until you next see an event from the server. thus , you
have to do timeouts , which means system dependent code. on most unixish
implementations , you can use xconnectionnumber to get the file descriptor of
the x connection and then use select() or something similar on that.
note that many user interface references suggest that a double click
be used to extend the action indicated by a single click if this is the case
in your interface then you can execute the first action and as a compromise
check the timestamp on the second event to determine whether it , too , should
be the single click action or the double click action.

subject 151) ! how do i render rotated text \?

xlib intentionally does not provide such sophisticated graphics
capabilities , leaving them up to server extensions or clients side graphics
libraries.
your only choice , if you want to stay within the core x protocol , is to
render the text into a pixmap , read it back via xgetimage() , rotate it by
hand with whatever matrices you want , and put it back to the server via
xputimage() more specifically
1) create a bitmap b and write your text to it.
2) create an xybitmap image i from b (via xgetimage).
3) create an xybitmap image i2 big enough to handle the transformation.
4) for each x , y in i2 , i2(x , y) i(a , b) where
a x cos(theta) y sin(theta)
b x sin(theta) y cos(theta)
5) render i2
note that you should be careful how you implement this not to lose
bits an algorithm based on shear transformations may in fact be better.
the high level server extensions and graphics packages available for x
also permit rendering of rotated text display postscript , pex , phigs , and gks ,
although most are not capable of arbitrary rotation and probably do not use the
same fonts that would be found on a printer.
in addition , if you have enough access to the server to install a font
on it , you can create a font which consists of letters rotated at some
predefined angle. your application can then itself figure out placement of each
glyph.

the method above and by using an outline (hershey) font.

subject 152) what is the x registry \? (how do i reserve names \? )

there are places in the x toolkit , in applications , and in the x
protocol that define and use string names. the context is such that conflicts
are possible if different components use the same name for different things.
the mit x consortium maintains a registry of names in these domains
orgainization names , selection names , selection targets , resource types ,
application classes , and class extension record types and several others.
the list as of 7 91 is in the directory mit doc registry on the r5
tape it is also available by sending send docs registry to the xstuff mail
server.
to register names (first come , first served) or to ask questions send
to xregistry@expo.lcs.mit.edu be sure to include a postal address for
confirmation.

from the readme file of version 4.99c

this is the plplot distribution. plplot is a scientific plotting package for
many systems , small (micro) and large (super) alike. despite its small size
and quickness , it has enough power to satisfy most users , including standard
x y plots , semilog plots , log log plots , contour plots , 3d plots , mesh plots ,
bar charts and pie charts. multiple graphs (of the same or different sizes)
may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each graph. different
line styles , widths and colors are supported. a virtually infinite number of
distinct area fill patterns may be used. there are almost 1000 characters in
the extended character set. this includes four different fonts , the greek
alphabet and a host of mathematical , musical , and other symbols. the fonts
can be scaled to any size for various effects. many different output device
drivers are available (system dependent) , including a portable metafile
format and renderer.

the plplot package is freely distributable , but not in the public domain.
the plplot source code , except header files and those files explicitly
granting permission , may not be used in a commercial software package without
consent of the authors. you are allowed and encouraged to include the plplot
object library and header files in a commercial package provided that (1) it
is explicitly and prominently stated that the plplot library is freely
available , and (2) the full copyrights on the plplot package be displayed
somewhere in the documentation for the package.

we welcome suggestions on how to improve this code , especially in the form of
user contributed enhancements or bug fixes. if plplot is used in any
published papers , please include an acknowledgment or citation of our work ,
which will help us to continue improving plplot. also , please remember that
as plplot is not a commercial product , we cannot be expected to offer the
kind of support that a commercial product may. there is great interest
in extending plplot and fixing bugs , but the principal authors can only
afford to work on it part time. improvements will necessarily focus on
those which help us get our work done.

plplot is written in c , enabling it to run on many platforms practically
without modification. fortran programs may use it transparently stub
routines are provided to handle the c fortran interface without any
modification of the user program. c programs are required to include the
header file plplot.h see the documentation for more details.

the main documentation for plplot is in the doc directory in the form of
several tex files please consult this for additional information ('latex
plotdoc'). unfortunately documentation tends to lag actual improvements to
the code , so do n't be surprised if some known features are not explained
there. consult 'changes.log' to see a list of recent changes.

at present , plplot is known to work on the following systems

unix sunos
a ix
hp ux
unicos
dg ux
ultrix
sysv
linux

amiga exec
ms dos
os 2
next

for more information on how to get or use plplot on your system , see

subject expose configure event handling (r4 vs r5)
organization umiacs , university of maryland , college park , md 20742
lines 29

i have two questions (well probably more...) about how expose configure
events are handled.

i have an appl. which uses 1 window to draw in. since i give the user the
capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be
resized , i made a translation table for the expose configure events.
the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event
calls my rescale method. the rescale method invokes a fake expose
event (actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct)
to draw the data.

quest 1.
when the appl. is compiled linked w r4 (running in either r4 or r5 env.)
i get multiple ( 4) redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size
is changed. i assume i'm getting cascading events. is that right \?
any suggestions as to how to handle trap events in a better way \?

quest 2.
when the appl. is compiled linked w r5 i get no expose events
whatsoever. do events and or translation tables act differently in r5 \?

thanks in advance

almost all window managers (twm , mwm , olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. for your purpose put following into your

if ( term xterm ) then
echo 2 logname @ host g 1 host g
endif

note , stands for esc , in vi you can enter it by pressing
ctrl v and the esc . same for g , it means ctrl g. in vi
press ctrl v and then ctrl g.
the first sequence puts the string into the title bar the second
in the icon.

btw , you can also put the current working directory in the
title bar if you make an alias for cd

alias cd 'cd ! echo 2 logname @ host cwd g '

when exposuremask is set for the child windows , those windows are correctly

i am trying to figure out the current c toolkit directions .
more simply , i 'd like to know which c toolkit to bet on
for use in a new long term project.

i have the same problem. i have looked at motif , wwl , interviews , gina ,
and a few variations on the above. i 've also done a cursory examination
of rogue wave 's view.h . i like view.h 's abstractions best of all of the
toolkits i mentioned , but the resulting code looks little like motif , and i
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code. gina allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance ,
but the resulting code is almost too motif like , and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent c code. interviews looks
promising , but i have n't found a free version with motif support , and i'm
not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted ,
and what (if any) specific motif support will be available over time. the
other libraries produce code which is less motif like , but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task.

at this point , my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in
c , and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task. later , if osf or some credible standards setting body
comes up with a c interface to motif , i will change to that. it does me
no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions. it 's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now. views.h is the only
library i 'd consider right now , but in our environment , we 'd end up spending
nearly 5000 to use it , and i ca n't justify it when it 's likely to cause
short term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction , and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the j curve.

x window installation on a sun4 470 with cg6 alone and with cg2 as
screen 0.0 and cg6 as screen 0.1.

questions
1) are there any hardware configuration changes on the cg2 and or
cg6 devices that need to be made other than pulling out and inserting the
cg2 frame buffer in the vme bus \?

2) the cg6 is called a 'graphics accelerator' as apposed to a 'frame buffer'.
what is the significance of this to the x server and how do we install
the sunos driver x to be compatable.


i would appreciate any information on this.
i am posting this on the behalf of dr. john charlton (who does not have net

dear sun and windows people ,

i am running sun workstations with sunos 4.1.1 and
vanilla x11 r5. i have a bunch of xterminals as well.

today i had my xdm fail. at about 9 30
it was impossible to login to a host from an xterminal.
the message was the xdm too many retransmissions .
in my xdm errors file i had the following entries


error (pid 7423) server for display 0 terminated unexpectedly
256
error (pid 7927) warning keyboard on display 0 could not be
secured
error (pid 7423) server for display 0 terminated unexpectedly

i also had

256
error (pid 7462) warning keyboard on display 0 could not be
secured
error (pid 7423) server for display 0 terminated unexpectedly
256

also , at the console , the login box would come up for
about 2 seconds and then
it would go away. it would do this continuously.

i could login from another workstation to the hosts in question ,
however , i could not login on the console.

i tried killing xdm and restarting it but that did n't help.
i finally rebooted all the hosts. (which hurts when done in the
middle of the day).

any help would be appreciated.

thanks ,

it is much slower.

anyone can give me some ideas on how to program popups so that each time

thankyou shirley

thanks to those who responded.

we were able to prevent this behaviour by two methods

1) running twm rather than olwm
2) keeping olwm , but putting wmtimeout 10 in the resources

it has been suggested that the difficuty was something to do with the
window manager positioning the popup window. any guru who can analyse
what is going on from this information , please post and let us know.

thanks shirley

i ran in to this problem i while ago , and from what i remember you should use
xttranslatecoordinates etc. after realizing the main widget to calculate
the location of the popup , then use something like xtvasetvalues on the
popup widgets before ever using them. calling setvalues repeatedly (e.g.
every time something pops up) seems to be what slows you down. i never
delved deep enough to figure out exactly why though...

try this after xcreatewindow

these hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window
are specified by the users and that the window manager should accept these
values. if you use xsizehints flags pposition psize , this tells the window
manager that the values are prefered values of the program , not the user.
i do n't know a window manager that does n't place the window like you prefer
if you specify the position and size like above.

sorry , but olwm and tvtwm do n't do it. they place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

currently , my solution is

xcreatewindow(...)
xsetwmproperties(..)
xmapwindow(...)
xflush(...)
xmovewindow(...)


it works with olwm , but is less than elegant. all this leaves me wondering
if i'm overlooking something obvious.

there are several products you might investigate. if you 've got

choice. it is n't compatible with hypercard , but has a similar
architecture (and way more functionality). i do n't have contact

be too hard to find.

if you 're running news on sparc , check out hyperlook
(hyperlook@turing.com). it uses postscript as a scripting language
which is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting ,
but not so good for non programmers. it was 995 , last i heard.

you might also look at our product metacard. we 're alpha testing
direct importing of hypercard stacks (we 've even made the test release
available for anonymous ftp) , so we 're obviously the closest in
functionality. metacard runs on most unix workstations and costs
495. email to info@metacard.com for more details.

my question is this is there a means of determining what the state

alright. ignore this. i have delved a bit deeper (xkeyevent) and
found what i was looking for.

ev state has a bunch of masks to check against (lockmask is the one
for capslock). unfortunately , it appears that the numlock mask varies
from server to server. how does one tell what mask is numlock and
which are for meta (mod1mask , mod2mask , mod3mask , mod4mask , mod5mask).
eg , sgi 's vendor server has mod2mask being numlock , whereas solaris
1.0.1 openwindows 3.0 has mod3mask for numlock. is there an
unambiguous means of determining numlock 's mask at runtime for any
given server \? sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance.

you 'll have to check the keysym(s) on each of the keys for each
modifier. the one with numlock in its mapping is the modifier
you want. a bit ugly perhaps but i think its currently the only
way to do this (and it does have some precedent as keysyms are
used to differentiate capslock from shiftlock for the lock
modifier).

i do n't know of an accepted strategy for handling ambiguous
assignments either. (ie. what if numlock is mapped for more then
one modifier). i suppose first found is as good as any.

x does n't handle locking modifiers that well.

hope that helps ,

to keyboard traversal even though the pointer is not in the dialog
window and even though the window manager keyboard focus policy is
pointer.

how is this done \?

i would like to emulate this behavior in my application. it seems a
reasonable behavior since when a dialog is popped up from a keyboard
action , the dialog is not guaranteed to be under the pointer and the
user should not have to reach for the mouse just to move the focus.

alternatively , i'm open to any suggestions as to what is the right
way to insure that popups get the focus when they appear , particularly
when they are invoked from the keyboard and one 's keyboard focus
policy is pointer.

can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me

you ca n't make gl calls in an xmdrawingarea widget for sure.

there is a widget already defined for gl. it is the glxmdraw (motif) or
glxdraw (athena) widget. it is similar to a xmdrawingarea , except that it
allows you to use gl calls to render into the window. look at glxlink ,
glxunlink , glxgetconfig , and glxwinset in the man pages.


the glxmdraw widget works pretty well. opengl will be an improvement.

i can vouch for that. the gl widget works pretty well. i have been using it
for sometime now. i'm not sure though whether you can use xlib calls to draw
into the gl widget. i have n't tried it yet nor have i read the accompanying
documentation completely. try posting to comp.sys.sgi for more information.
better still , you will find most of the answers in the sgi manuals .. there
is a little transition guide which explains the mixed model programming
paradigm(mixing x and gl).

does pex (graphigs \? ) have the same functionality of gl \?

i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful , but
that 's just an opinion. mileage may vary.

well , pex is designed as an extension to x and will be more seamless but
then , it is buggy to start with .. opinions again.

hardware is truecolor in yuv space in x terms it has a 24 bit
static color visual. i would really like to have the server just
present this static visual , but i'm not sure if this will be
acceptable to most x clients. the three problems i see are

1) the colormap , though huge , is static.
2) all pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
3) because the hardware actually lives in yuv space , the
translation rgb yuv will introduce some rounding error.

we tried to ship an x server once that only supported a 24bit
truecolor visual. the main problems we encountered were

1) clients written with logic like the following

if (defaultdepth() ! 1)
assume default depth is 8bit

these clients need an 8bit deep visual in the root window
to run correctly.

2) other clients did n't even bother to do that much , and just
outright assumed they had a dynamic visual class , with a
dynamic colormap. xstorecolors does n't work on cmaps
associated with static or truecolor visual classes , but
many clients do n't bother to check , they just start
throwing xstorecolor calls at you.

though both are clearly client error , this is the case with so many
clients that it 's easier for you to expose 8bit pseudocolor as a
default root window visual , than it ever would be for all these client
writers to change their clients to do the right thing.

ncsa mosaic provides a consistent and easy to use hypermedia based
interface into a wide variety of networked information sources ,
including gopher , wais , world wide web , nntp usenet news , techinfo ,
ftp , local filesystems , archie , finger , hyper g , hytelnet , texinfo ,
telnet , tn3270 , and more.

this release of ncsa mosaic is known to compile on the following
platforms

sgi (irix 4.0.2)
ibm (aix 3.2)
sun 4 (sunos 4.1.3 with stock x11r4 and motif 1.1 , and gcc).
dec ultrix.
dec alpha axp (osf 1).

documentation is available online.

changes since 0.13 include

o added new resource , gethostbynameisevil , for sun 's that
coredump when gethostbyname() is called to try to find out what
their own names are. (command line flag is ghbnie.)
o explicitly pop down all dialog boxes when document view
window is closed , for window managers too dull to do so
themselves.
o better visited anchor color for non sgi 's.
o added .hqx and .uu to list of file extensions handled like .tar files.
o added 'clear' button to open box , to allow more convenient
cut n paste entries of url 's.
o new resource 'autoplacewindows' if set to false , new document
view windows will not be automatically positioned by the
program itself (but it 's still up to your window manager just how
they 're placed).
o command line flags i and iconic now have desired effect (new
resource initialwindowiconic can also be used).
o gif reading code is a little more bulletproof.
o obscure infinite loop triggered by extra space in img tag fixed.
o eliminated nonintuitive error message when image ca n't be read
(inlined ncsa bitmap is indication enough that something 's not
right for authors , and readers ca n't do anything about bad images
in any case).
o obscure parsing bug (for constructs like address a
href ... text a address ) fixed.
o fixed mysterious stupid coredump that only hits suns.
o fixed stupid coredump on url 's like ' cbl.leeds.ac.uk '.
o fixed buglet in handling rlogin url 's.
o new support for solaris sysvr4 (courtesy
dana@thumper.bellcore.com).
o better support for hp ux 8.x and 9.x (courtesy
johns@hpwarf.wal.hp.com).
o better support for next (courtesy scott@shrug.dur.ac.uk).
o some miscellaneous portability fixes (courtesy
bingle@cs.purdue.edu).
o miscellaneous bug fixes and cleanups.

organization association of nextstep developers international
lines 28

i am trying to build and use imake (x11r4) on an ibm rs 6000 running aix v3.2.
i am having the following 2 problems.

(1) many of my imakefile 's have contructs like
this is a makefile
at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c
preprocessor and into the makefile. most of the c preprocessors that
i have used will not treat such a as appearing at the start of the
line. thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
start of a directive.

however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
as the start of a directive. the cpp fails when it determines
that this is not a known directive. i have temporarily hacked my
imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
fix.

(2) several imakefiles use as a parameter to a macro when a particular
use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter. the aix cpp
gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok.

if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions , i would appreciate
information about on your solutions. (perhaps , this is solved in a later
version of imake that i have not reviewed.) also , do you know of other cpp 's
that behave similarly \?

since i do not have easy access to news , a response to
'white billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why graphics
do n't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle \?

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
xlib graphics. a button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()
(or equiv) directly instead , it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
window is mapped.

the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped. do you know the best way to tickle a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item \?

subject overriding window manager focus processing

keywords window manager focus motif

i am working on an x window based application that needs to
override some of the window manager focus processing. i am
using x11r4 and motif 1.1 currently , although i will also be
working with open look in the future.

what i need to do is under certain circumstances prevent the
user from switching from one window of the application to
another window. let 's say , for example , that window a is on top
of window b in the window hierarchy. normally , if the user clicks
the mouse in window b it will be brought to the top of the
window hierarchy and placed on top of window a. under certain
circumstances if the user clicks the mouse in window b i need to
beep and prevent window b from being raised on top of window
a.

from the research and testing i 've done so far , it appears that
this window ordering is handled by the window manager , in this
case motif. i have n't found any way to override this default
processing through standard x window functions. i can tell
when this switching occurs through focus change and mapping
notify events , but i ca n't find any way to tell motif not to make the
switch.

the temporary solution i 've currently come up with is very
kludgy but it partially works. when i detect such a window switch
in those cases when the switch is not allowed , i manually force
the formerly top window back on top with an xraisewindow call
and beep with the xbell function. this provides the necessary
functionality but looks ugly when the windows switch places
twice.

does anyone know how i can tell motif (or preferably any
window manager) when i do n't want the window order switch to
actually take place \? respond either by e mail or posting to this
newsgroup.

the application creates window with a button quit and press me .
the button press me pops up a dialog box. the strange feature of
this program is that it always pops up the dialog box much faster the
first time. if i try to pop it up a 2nd time (3rd , 4th .... time) ,
it is much slower.

the shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its
positioning request. the window manager is not responding because
it thinks the window is already in the right place.

exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to
me all information greatly received.

thanks for this clue , and thanks to derek ho also for a pointer in the
same direction.

one solution , due to derek ho when the popup is popped up , we setvalue
its location which on repeat popups will be unchanged from the
previous popup. the slow response can be avoided by calling getvalue
first , and only using setvalue if the required location is different.
the problem can also be avoided by making a tiny alteration in the
location of the popup , so that the setvalue really does change the
location of the popup. (we tried this just for a double check on the
source of the problem.)

the solutions we have tried successfully are now as follows

1) use twm or mwm rather than olwm
2) use olwm , with resource wmtimeout 10
3) only reset the location of the popup window if it is truely changed.

this is obviously working around some bug somewhere.

prescod@undergrad.m (1132)

i get the impression andrew is from the fsf , but i do n't know what it
looks like either.

the andrew user interface system is supported , maintained , enhanced , and
distributed by the andrew consortium , carnegie mellon. the distribution
terms are those of the x consortium , not the gnu public license. thus
anyone can commercially exploit the andrew code without restriction.
(to encourage membership , however , we defer universal release of the
latest versions until consortium members have had an opportunity to
explore the new capabilities.)

to se what auis looks like , you can try a remote demo. you need an x
server (r5 is best) on a machine linked to the internet. give the
command

finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

for instructions.

note the demo version does not use the motif look and feel scrollbar ,
but one is available. you can use it on the demo by changing an option
in the preferences file and starting a new editor.

the andrew toolkit component of auis is ideal if you want to build
applications using compound documents. andrew 's major feature is its
architecture for recursive embedding of objects equation in table in
figure in text , for example. this architecture extends to areas not
usually found in toolkits , including file stream formats , cut paste , and
printing.

andrew also provides some of the most commonly requested applications
word processor , spreadsheet , drawing editor , and font editor (the latter
two are in version 5.2 which will be generally released on the xr6 tape
in december.)

to return the nearest size to what i require however it returns 72 and 71 as
the width and height respectively. what am i doing wrong \? and if not
how can i
get round the problem ! !

does the workstation you 're using have hardware cursor support \? or does
the server generate a software cursor. you can generally tell the difference
just by using it. if the cursor blinks a lot when there 's screen activity ,
it 's probably a software cursor. if it has a hardware cursor , i think you 're
probably battling a bug in hp 's x server. i'm not familiar with any hardware
cursor chips that display cursors greater than 64x64. it 's quite possible
that the server is just echoing your preferred cursor size without actually
checking it. i vaguely recall that very old mit server revisions did just
that.

in reality you 're probably stuck with a 64x64 maximum size cursor regardless
of what the server returns.

hear ! hear ! i agree completely. one thing i ca n't stand about
the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use
the mouse(what if your mouse breaks your whole system is
down ! ). i like the mouse it is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around , etc. but for most
work , the keyboard and hot keys are 10 20 times faster than
using the mouse. sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user , but how long is it
before your are experienced \? a month \? two \? (speaking of pcs at
the moment.)
i do n't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menu mouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces , which usually allows you to do more in
less time if you are experienced.
all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
unix (especially since unix is at least 500 more powerful than
dos).

and at least 500 more user unfriendly as well !

if you specify the rootwindow when you are creating your gc. you may
use xlib to draw over multiple windows.
i have an application that does something similar for rubber banding.

in plain motify using a dialog 'in line' like this simply is n't done. you need
to set callbacks from the buttons widgets in your dialog and let the callback routines
do the work. in the callbacks you can then carry on the flow of logic.

xview from sun actually supports this very neatly with a 'notify' box , which can

welcome to the motif mailing list !

the motif mailing list is a mailing list dedicated to motif , the pd c
wrapper library for motif , where people can ask questions about motif ,
swap stories , and give new ideas about new directions and improvements for the
bindings.

all requests of an administrative nature , like subscription , removal , etc.
should be directed to motif request@cv.ruu.nl

all e mail sent to motif @cv.ruu.nl will be sent to the entire list , so
please make sure when using 'vacation' type programs that will reply to
messages automatically , that the address for the mailing list is excluded
from auto replies.

enjoy !

hello motif world ,

over the past half year there have been a lot of relatively minor changes to
the motif bindings. imake support has been improved , a few defaults have
been changed , and a lot of other small things have been added.

this is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. next release will
incorporate some improvements by stefan schwarz , and possibly will support
x11r5 and motif 1.2.x.

note to all of those who keep copies of the archive please retrieve this
distribution (during off peak hours) , and delete all previous copies.

here is the original announcement

history

the university of lowell , supported by a grant of the open software foundation ,
has developed a wrapper library , that encapsulates motif widgets in c
classes. all resources of these widgets can now be set through
member functions , while objects can be used in callback functions. the library
was made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.
however , the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights , and only
worked under x11r3. due to lack of subsequent fundings , the bindings are no
longer actively supported by the university of lowell.

i , ronald van loon , at a certain point last year , have taken the lowell
bindings , fixing the bugs i came across , adding missing memberfunctions , and
enhancing functionality and made the bug fixed library available for the
general public for anonymous ftp (made possible by rick murphy at dec).

new release

i am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the motif
bindings.

this release offers

full motif1.1 and x11r4 support
support for xbae widgetset
two additional widgets , written by myself , that can be used to indicate
progress in an application.
imake support. nb this release relies heavily on the existence of imake
and its config files on your site. i have tried to
provide the bindings with a standard makefile , tweakable
for those unfortunates without imake. i have not severely
tested the standard makefile though. contact me if you
have problems. the reason for calling this a gamma
release lies in the fact that i do not have a multitude
of platforms to test the imake files on.
lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)
an article i wrote on the usage of motif , x and c , previously posted
on usenet.

where to get the new motif bindings

ftp

anonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1) , directory pub x11.

note

please be patient as the network link is quite slow. please do not ftp large
files during working hours.

also note that there is also a motif .31.jan.92.tar.z file at this site this
is an old version of the bindings.

e mail

those who do n't have ftp can send me e mail , and i will send the bindings by
e mail.

request

those who use the bindings and find bugs , or see room for improvement , please
contact me , and i will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of
bugs , a bug fix of course ).

more information

contact me at rvloon@cv.ruu.nl .
if you are desperate , then you can call me at
31 30 506711 (that is utrecht , the netherlands those within the netherlands
call 030 506711).

not being an xt programmer by any stretch of the imagination , this is
driving me crazy and it 's probably really simple to do.

i need to make a composite widget that does nothing at all but is
merely a placeholder in a widget instance heirarchy allowing me an
additional resource name level.

to illustrate i have an application with the following widget
heirarchy

shell widget

application widghet

i want the following

shell widget

intermediate widget

application widget

where the intermediate widget has a name but gets all its other
properties (and propagates down new values) from the shell widget.

i assume there 's a simple way to do this but i ca n't find an example
and the documentation i have is rather vague about implementing
composite widgets.

please respond via email. any help will be very much appreciated.

animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident ximages into

can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using xcopyarea from the pixmaps to the windows drawable.

hope this is helpfull.

john


i just implemented this and it seems i can just about achieve the display
rates (20 400x400x8 frames sec on ipx) that i get with sunview , though
it 's a bit choppy at times. also , loading the data , making an ximage ,
then xput'ing it into a pixmap is a bit cumbersome , so the animation is
slower to load than with sunview. is there a better way to load in the
data \?

rgooch@rp.csiro.au (richard gooch) writes
if you need speed , and your client can run on the same host as the x server ,
you should use the shared memory extension to the sample x server (mit shm).
xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this extension. this is certainly
available with the sample mit x server running under sunos.
a word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
memory. and another word of warning openwindows is slower than the mit
server.
i have written an imaging tool (using xview for the gui , by the way) which
yields over 10 frames per second for 512 512 8 bit images , running on a sparc
ipc (half the cpu grunt of an ipx). this has proved quite sufficient for
animations.

regards ,

richard gooch....

shared memory putimage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu ,
nick kisseberth) looks interesting , but i need someone to point me to some
documentation. is this method likely to give better results than server
resident pixmaps \? i 'd also be interested in looking at the xview code
mentioned above...

thanks for the help so far. if i get something decent put together , i 'll
definitely post it to the net.

unless you run `xlock mode blank` , xlock consumes cpu time generating
the nice animated display. the code you are running is competing with
xlock for the cpu. if you run top (via a remote login) , you can really
see what is going on.

i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the user window. maybe other window managers
have similar options.
another way to figure out the difference between the user window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. unfortunately , you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

another way would be to use getgeometry to find out where
you are relative to the frame , and translatecoordinates to find
out where your window 's upperleft corner really is.

even 24bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated
8 bit pseudocolor visual , only to get standard x clients , motif apps and
thelike to run. i strongly suppose you to emulate at least

24 bit truecolor. should be no problem , only some translation. rounding
should not make big misfits

depends on the nature of the rounding. x allows the user to do bit
arithmetic on pixel values , (i.e. , xor foreground and backgroun pixel
values together to calculate a foreground color that when used with a
function of gxxor fill change foreground to background and vice versa).
if your rounding does not preserve these types of calculations then
clients that use them will break.

subject calling a library which creates widgets (multiple times)
nntp posting host bruno.cs.colorado.edu
organization university of colorado , boulder
lines 91

a few days ago i posted a question about trying to call a function which set
up an x app multiple times. it was pointed out that xtappinitialize() should
never be called more than once. this helped. however , i am still having
some problems. below is a new little test program that more closely models
my real program. in the actual program , i am writing a library , callable
from any other program. this means that the first time the lib function is
called , it must initialize things , and after that , it should just use the
old stuff (still around because of static variables). in the demo below ,
main() represents the main program calling my library and doit() represents
the interface to the library function.

include x11 xlib.h
include xm xm.h
include xm pushb.h
include stdio.h
include stdlib.h

void bla(xtappcontext app , widget top)

widget topone top in real prog , these are member vars
xtappcontext theapp app of a class

null)

widget box xtvacreatemanagedwidget( blaaa , xmpushbuttonwidgetclass ,
topone ,

xevent event
xtappnextevent(theapp , event)
xtdispatchevent( event)

xtdestroywidget(box)
xtclosedisplay(dis)


setitup should be called once only
void setitup(xtappcontext app , widget top)

int junk 0
( top) xtappinitialize (app , test , null , 0 , junk , null ,
null , null , 0)


doit some library function callable from the outside
void doit()

static xtappcontext app use these every time called
static widget top

static int setup 0

if ( ! setup)

setitup( app , top)
setup 1

bla(app , top)


main program which links to my library
main()

for (int i 0 i 20 i )

doit()
printf( sleeping... n ) widget still on screen at this point
sleep(5)




the problem is that the widget does not go away until the new one is created.
(it is still on the screen unusuable during the sleep in the main prog ,
despite the xtdestroywidget call).

anyone see something i'm missing \?

thanks very much.

my question is this is there a means of determining what the state

i do n't know any way except to see what modifiers are on in th
keypress event. of course if there is some reason why you need to
always know the state of modifiers even if your windows do n't have the
keyborads focus you can always ask for keypress events from the root
window. then you get all the keypresses and you always know what have
been pressed.

an even more pointed question is there an easy means of making an x
keyboard act like a pc keyboard \? ie , capslock is active , and the user
presses shift a , i 'd like to get a lowercase 'a' instead of 'a'.

i think this is just a question of how to implement xlookupstring.
you can always write another function that interprets the keypresses
as you like. you can look at the implementation of xlookupstring from
the xlib sources and then modify it a little bit.

i am developing an x (xt , xm) application that will include a graphics window

could be implemented with motif widgets , one of which would be an
xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib. but i would like to take advantage of
the graphics library (gl) available on our ibm rs 6000 (sgi 's gl i believe).

is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program \?
can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me
with xopenwindow \?

i have never used gl before , but the doc on gl winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server. also , most of
the gl calls do not require a display or gc , unlike most x calls. from this
initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily. is this
true \?

does pex (graphigs \? ) have the same functionality of gl \?

hello netlanders

i am a novice x user with a question for any xgod.

my computer configuration with the x problem is as follows

486dx50 256 16ram running esix 4.0.4
wangtek at style interface 250 m tape drive.
i have loaded the basic os (which includes nsu) and
inet utilities (tcp ip).
i ftp ed the xfree86 (x11r5) binaries and installed properly.

i can execute startx and run x windows with no problems.
however , if i try to access the tape drive while in x , the
machine locks up instantly. if i am out of x and access the
tape , the tape drive works fine. soon as i try to
startx again the screen changes modes , but , the grey background
pattern does not come up and no xterm is forked. i have to login
from another terminal and execute a shutdown to reset the system.

i 've contacted esix about this problem. they claim their x window x11r4
server (which i have) works with the wangtek tape drive. they also
claim i only need the nsu (network system utilities) to run x i do n't
need inet (tcp ip). my experience has been that i need both to get
xfree86 to work. i'm not too concerned about having to load both nsu and inet
packages to get x to work unless the inet package is causing my problem.

i would like to get both x and my tape drive to co exist on the same
system. if you can shed any light on the problem , it would be appreciated.

one colleague implied this might be a hardware conflict. if this is true ,
what direction should i look to resolve the conflict \?

the default visual for the xnews server is the monochrome , and we are unable to change it to
the 24 bit visual. we have tried using xgetvisualinfo to get a visual of depth 24 , but had no
success. xdpyinfo gives no information about a 24 bit deep visual , only monochrome.

there are two possible solutions
if someone has patches for x11r5 xsun server , could they forward them to us \?

otherwise , could someone instruct us how to access the 24 bit color in openwindows \?

there 's a bug in sunos 4.1.3 , which is alluded to in the faq (although
there it 's talking about x11r4 as being affected). you need to force
libxmu to be linked statically , rather than dynamically , which works
around the linker error. the simplest thing to do is edit each of
the makefiles where there 's a failure and change the line which reads
xmulib l (xmusrc) lxmu
to
xmulib l (xmusrc) bstatic lxmu bdynamic

no. this is only relevant for openwindows 3.x as shipped with sunos.
it is not relevant for mit r5. mit r5 should compile without problems.

subject 58) ! where can i get patches to x11r5 \?

the release of new public patches by the mit x consortium is announced
in the comp.windows.x.announce newsgroup.

patches themselves are available via ftp from export and from other
sites from which x11 is available. they are now also distributed through the
newsgroup comp.sources.x. some source re sellers may be including patches in
their source distributions of x11.

people without ftp access can use the xstuff mail server. it now has
23 patches for x11r5 3 93 . send to xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu the subject line
send fixes
where is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch.

here are a few complications
1) fix 5 is in four parts you need to request 5a , 5b , 5c and
5d separately
2) the file sungx.uu , which was part of an earlier patch , was
re released with patch 7 note the file does n't work with solaris
3) fix 8 is in two parts 8a and 8b
4) fix 13 is in three parts 13a , 13b , and 13c
5) fix 16 is in two parts 16a and 16b
6) fix 18 replaces the r5fix test1 for the x test suite , which
previously was optional
7) fix 19 also needs pexlib.tar.z , which you can obtain from xstuff
by asking for pexlib.uu. 1234 .
8) fix 22 is in 9 parts , 22a through 22i


subject 59) what is the xstuff mail archive \?

the xstuff server is a mail response program. that means that you mail
it a request , and it mails back the response.
any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line. the
xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything , so you can
have several different commands in a single message (unless you ask for help).
the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line
of the message.
the archives are organized into a series of directories and
subdirectories. each directory has an index , and each subdirectory has an
index. the top level index gives you an overview of what is in the
subdirectories , and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it.

1) the command help or send help causes the server to send you a
more detailed version of this help file.
2) if your message contains a line whose first word is index , then
the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive. if
there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories , then
the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index.
for example , you can say send index fixes (or index fixes ). a message that
requests an index cannot request data.
3) if your message contains a line whose first word is send , then the
xstuff server will send you the item(s) named on the rest of the line. to name
an item , you give its directory and its name. for example
send fixes 1 4 8a 8b 9
you may issue multiple send requests. the xstuff server contains many
safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large
amounts of data. the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed
amount of data each day. if the work queue contains more requests than the
day 's quota , then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day.
whenever the mailer is run to send its day 's quota , it sends the requests out
shortest first.
4) some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting
return addresses. if you use such a mailer , you wo n't get any response. if
you happen to know an explicit path , you can include a line like
path foo bar.bitnet@mitvma.mit.edu
or
path bar ! foo ! frotz
in the body of your message , and the daemon will use it.

the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff@expo.lcs.mit.edu. if
your mailer deals in ! notation , try sending to
someplace ! mit eddie ! expo.lcs.mit.edu ! xstuff.

subject 62) does motif work with x11r4 \? x11r5 \?

motif 1.2 is based on x11r5.
motif 1.1 , available in source form from osf as of august 1990 , uses
the vanilla x11r4 intrinsics , where vanilla means with just a few
patches the file fix osf which osf distributes is obsoleted by mit 's patches
15 17. the file fix osf 1.1.1 distributed with the 1.1.1 version or its
subsequent modification needs to be applied after mit fix 18 , though.

motif 1.1.1 to 1.1.3 will work with x11r5 if x11r5 is compiled with
dmotifbc 1.1.4 and later should work with the vanilla r5 , although there are
some known new geometry management problems.

if you 're willing to do a little work , you can make drawnbuttons do what you
want , more or less. one of my colleagues here at ge crd has done just that
in our internal lymb system.

we have a matrix transform class that makes it easy to compute a series of
dial positions from a single set of vectors. each set of vectors is then
drawn into a pixmap. clicking the button advances the knob 's state and
changes to the next pixmap in the sequence.

using drawnbuttons obviously still constrains you to taking up a rectangular
portion of the parent widget , but that 's normally not a big shortcoming. you
can make things look circular enough.

i'm an new to this. having found some files (public) to look into , i
ftp'ed them to a system i have access to. i then used kermit to transmit
them via modem to my host computer , a pc based file system. i access
internet through modem access to a university mainframe. from the pc
file server , i pull the files to a disk , and then pull them from disk
to a sgi indigo (the sgi is not networked yet). when i try to uncompress
and un tar the files , they either come out as garbage or i get an error
in the tar process about directories being invalid.
what i'm wondering about is the transfer of unix files (compressed ,
binary , ascii) about multiple platforms. my guess is that it is the copy
to a 'dos' disk that is screwing things up. any help is appreciated.

return place is probably incorrect. it should be a pointer , not an

x
xabout this file
x
x this file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
x the international obfuscated c code contest (ioccc for short).
x
x this is not the ioccc rules , though it does contain comments about
x them. the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions.
x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
x allowed. even so , you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
x
x you should read the current ioccc rules , prior to submitting entries.
x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
x
x
xwhat is new in 1993
x
x the entry format is better (for us anyway). the program mkentry.c
x has been updated. see entry format.
x
x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c
x compiler. certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers
x fits are no longer permitted. some of the new issues deal with
x non integral array types , variable number of arguments , c preprocessor
x directives and the exit() function. see our likes and dislikes.
x
x
xhints and suggestions
x
x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. see
x for more information for details on how to get previous winners.
x
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year , so some winning entries
x may not be valid entries this year. what was unique and novel one year
x might be 'old' the next year.
x
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply
x a number of tests to an entry
x
x look at the original source
x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii
x c pre process the source ignoring ' include' lines
x c pre process the source ignoring ' define' and ' include' lines
x run it through a c beautifier
x examine the algorithm
x lint it
x compile it
x execute it
x
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
x 'cleaned up' by the c pre processor and a c beautifier.
x
x your entry need not do well under all , or in most tests. in certain
x cases , a test is not important. entries that compete for the
x 'strangest most creative source layout' need not do as well as
x others in terms of their algorithm. on the other hand , given
x two such entries , we are more inclined to pick the entry that
x does something interesting when you run it.
x
x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. as such , we leave
x the contest open for creative rule interpretation. as in real life
x programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
x is important. for this reason , we often award 'worst abuse of the
x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
x
x if you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know
x in the remarks section. please note that an invitation to abuse
x is not an invitation to break. we are strict when it comes to the
x 3217 byte size limit. also , abusing the entry format tends to
x annoy more than amuse.
x
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules , and invite entries
x to attempt to exploit them. we will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
x and then plug the hole next year. even so , we will attempt to use
x the smallest plug needed , if not smaller. )
x
x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make
x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem , particularly
x in or near the final round. on the other hand , we have seen some
x of the best entries fall down because they did n't work.
x
x we tend to look down on a prime number printer , that claims that
x 16 is a prime number. if you do have a bug , you are better off
x documenting it. noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry. and sometimes ,
x a strange bug feature can even help the entry ! of course , a correctly
x working entry is best.
x
x
xour likes and dislikes
x
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'. we
x tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our pre processor tests
x that we apply. simply abusing defines or dfoo bar wo n't go as far
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
x
x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code , and so do we
x
x define d define
x d foo do n't expect this to turn into define foo
x
x int i
x j do n't use such implicit type declaration
x int k
x
x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler. if you
x must use non ansi c , such as k r c , you must avoid areas that result in
x compile link errors for ansi c compilers.
x
x unfortunately , ansi c requires array indexes to be of integral type.
x thus , the following classical obfuscation hacks are no longer allowed
x
x int i
x char c
x i c use c i instead
x (i 3) string use string i 3 instead
x
x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
x arguments , be careful. systems implement va list as a wide variety
x of ways. because of this , a number of operations using va list are
x not portable and must not be used
x
x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable
x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable
x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg
x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg
x performing arithmetic on va list variables
x using va list as a structure or union
x
x in particular , do not treat va list variables as if they were a char 's.
x
x avoid using varargs.h , use stdarg.h instead.
x
x if you use c preprocessor directives ( define , if , ifdef , ...) ,
x the leading ' ' must be the first character on a line. while some
x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' ' , many do not.
x
x because the exit() function returns void on some systems , entries
x must not assume that it returns an int.
x
x small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise.
x while such programs are not as complex as other winners , they do
x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people
x attempt to completely understand. for this reason , we look for
x programs that are compact , and are instructional.
x
x one line programs should be short one line programs , say around 80
x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
x
x we tend to dislike programs that
x
x are very hardware specific
x are very os or un x version specific
x (index strchr differences are ok , but socket streams specific
x code is likely not to be)
x dump core or have compiler warnings
x (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
x wo n't compile under both bsd or sys v un x
x abusing the build file to get around the size limit
x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs
x are longer than they need to be
x are similar to previous winners
x are identical to previous losers )
x
x unless you are cramped for space , or unless you are entering the
x 'best one liner' category , we suggest that you format your program
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
x
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size
x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several d 's to help out ,
x but it is quite another to use 200 bytes of d 's in order to
x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel
x free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off
x if you show some amount of restraint.
x
x we allowed whitespace , and in certain cases or do not impact
x your program size (up to a certain point) , because we want to get
x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
x
x given two versions of the same program , one that is a compact blob
x of code , and the other that is formatted more like a typical c
x program , we tend to favor the second version. of course , a third
x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
x and or obfuscated way , would definitely win over the first two !
x
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self replicating'
x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self replicating
x programs. in fact , a number of winners have been self replicating.
x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' , lest we (or others)
x know of a smaller one !
x
x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that
x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. do n't
x depend on a particular type of display. for example , do n't depend
x on color or a given size. do n't require backing store.
x
x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and
x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client
x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the
x athena widget set (libx11.a , libxaw.a , libxmu.a and libxt.a).
x do n't use m tif , xv ew , or openl ok toolkits , since not everyone
x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not
x everyone has x11r5 , and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or
x earlier) , so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better
x yet , try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems.
x
x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on
x .xdefaults. if you must do so , be sure to note the required lines
x in the remark section.
x
x we like programs that
x
x are as concise and small as they need to be
x do something at least quasi interesting
x pass lint without complaint (not a requirement , but it is nice)
x are portable
x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation
x make us laugh and or throw up )
x
x some types of programs ca n't excel in some areas. of course , your
x program does n't have to excel in all areas , but doing well in several
x areas really does help.
x
x we freely admit that interesting , creative or humorous comments in
x the remark section helps your chance of winning. if you had to
x read of many twisted entries , you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
x
x be creative !
x
x
xentry format
x
x in order to help us process the many entries , we must request your
x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format ,
x in addition , allows us to quickly separate information about the
x author from the program itself. (see judging process)
x
x we have provided the program , mkentry , as an example of how to
x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that
x is found in mkentry.c
x
x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules. every
x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
x an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases ,
x where this program differs from the contest rules , the
x contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the
x contest rules before submitting an entry.
x
x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient , however ,
x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files , and attempt to check
x the entry against the size rules.
x
x if you have any suggestions , comments , fixes or complaints about
x the mkentry.c program , please send email to the judges. (see below)
x
x the following is a sample entry
x
x entry
xrule 1993
xfix n
xtitle chonglab
xentry 0
xdate mon mar 1 08 45 20 1993
xhost un x v6 , pdp11 45
x 2.9bsd , pdp11 70
x remark
x this is a non obfuscated obfuscated c program.
x
x it is likely not to win a prize. but what do you expect from
x a short example !

x program
x typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
x and will compile into prog. if an entry wins , we will rename
x its source and binary to avoid filename collision. by tradition ,
x we use the name of the entry 's title , followed by an optional
x digit in case of name conflicts.
x
x if the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award ,
x we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
x
x if your entry depends on , or requires that your build , source
x and or binary files be a particular name , please say so in the
x remark section. if this case applies , it would be be helpful
x if you did one of the following
x
x tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
x
x have the build file make copies of the files. for example
x
x cc prog.c o special name need special binary
x
x or rm f special src.c need special source
x cp prog.c special src.c
x cc special src.c o special name
x
x or rm f special build need special build
x tail 4 build special build
x sh special build
x
x assume that we will use the entry title. send us a version of
x your build program files that uses the name convention. you
x should uuencode these files in data sections.
x
x if your entry needs to modify its source , info or binary files ,
x please say so in the remark section. you should try to avoid
x touching your original build , source and binary files. you should
x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify. this
x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch.
x
x remember that your entry may be built without a build file. we
x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile. if the
x build file must exist , say so in the remark section.
x
x if your entry needs special info files , you should uuencode them
x into info sections. in the case of multiple info files ,
x use multiple info sections. if no info files are needed ,
x then skip the info section.
x
x info files are intended to be input , or detailed information that
x does not fit well into the remark section. for example , an
x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
x programs for the user to compile. an entry might want to include a
x lengthy design document , that might not be appropriate for a
x 'hints' file.
x
x info files should be used only to supplement your entry. for
x example , info files may provide sample input or detailed
x information about your entry. because they are supplemental ,
x the entry should not require them exist.
x
x in some cases , your info files might be renamed to avoid name
x conflicts. if info files should not be renamed for some reason ,
x say so in the remark section.
x
x info files must uudecode into the current directory. if they
x absolutely must be renamed , or moved into a sub directory , say
x so in the remark section.
x
x when submitting multiple entries , be sure that each entry has
x a unique entry number from 0 to 7. your first entry should
x have entry number 0.
x
x with the exception of the header , all text outside of the entry
x format may be ignored. that is , do n't place text outside of the
x entry and expect the judges to see it. (our decoding tools are n't
x ai progs ! ) if you need tell the the something , put it in the
x remark section , or send a email to the judges at
x
x ... ! apple , pyramid , sun , uunet ! hoptoad ! judges (not the address for
x judges@toad.com submitting entries)
x
x the date should be given with respect to utc. (some systems refer
x to this as gmt or gmt0) the format of the date should be that as
x returned by asctime() in the c locale. an example of such a string is
x
x thr apr 01 00 47 00 1993
x
x this format is similar to the output of the date(1) command. the
x string does not include the timezone name before the year. on many
x systems , one of the following command will produce a similar string
x
x date u a h d t 19 y
x date u sed e 's ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x sh c 'tz utc date sed e s ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x sh c 'tz gmt date sed e s ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x sh c 'tz gmt0 date sed e s ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x
x you are allowed to update fix revise your entry. to do so , set
x the 'fix' line in the entry section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
x as well , as these are used to determine which entry is to be
x replaced.
x
x
xjudging process
x
x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll.
x
x entries are unpacked into individual directories. the email message
x is unpacked into individual files , each containing
x
x entry section
x all author sections
x all info sections
x build section
x program section
x any other text , including the email message headers
x
x prior to judging , the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
x it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
x malformed and did not unpack correctly). information from the
x author sections are not read until the judging process is
x complete , and then only from entries that have won an award.
x
x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular
x individual. we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
x until the final awards are given. we like the surprise of finding
x out in the end , who won and where they were from.
x
x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous , unless they win an award.
x because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced , we make all
x attempts to send non winners into oblivion. we remove all non winning
x files , and shred all related paper. by tradition , we do not even
x reveal the number of entries that we received. (for the curious ,
x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc
x winners at talks)
x
x after the usenix announcement , we attempt to send email to the
x authors of the winning entries. one reason we do this is to give
x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
x entry. they are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos. we
x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well.
x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
x
x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. during a round ,
x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles
x the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does
x not. we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the
x previous round. thus , an entry gets at least two readings.
x
x a reading consists of a number of actions
x
x reading the entry section
x reading the uudecoded build section
x reading the uudecoded program section
x reading the uudecoded info section(s) , if any
x passing the source thru the c pre processor
x shipping over any include files
x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source
x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor
x shipping over any include files
x
x in later rounds , other actions are performed
x
x linting the source
x compiling building the source
x running the program
x performing misc tests on the source and binary
x
x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries , entries
x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it
x does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round.
x when the number of entries thins to about 25 entries , we begin to form
x award categories. entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
x an entry often will compete in several categories.
x
x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
x we receive. a typical category list might be
x
x best small one line program
x best small program
x strangest most creative source layout
x most useful obfuscated program
x best game that is obfuscated
x most creatively obfuscated program
x most deceptive c code
x best x client (see our likes and dislikes)
x best abuse of ansi c
x worst abuse of the rules
x anything else so strange that it deserves an award
x
x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example , a few entries are so
x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
x we will invent awards categories for them , if necessary.
x
x in the final round process , we perform the difficult tasks of
x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round , is
x less clear cut.
x
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is beat out
x by a similar , but slightly better entry. for this reason , it is
x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry
x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes , of course ,
x that the entry is worth improving in the first place !
x
x more often that not , we select a small entry (usually one line) , a
x strange creative layout entry , and an entry that abuses the contest
x rules in some way.
x
x in the end , we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such
x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often , the
x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
x
x
xannouncement of winners
x
x the first announcement , occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition ,
x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof , just prior to
x the berkeley bsd , and bsdi bof.
x
x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups
x
x comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards alt.sources
x
x in addition , pointers to these postings are posted to the following
x
x comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc
x comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x
x
x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see
x below for details.
x
x often , winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners
x have appeared in books ( the new hackers dictionary ) and on t shirts.
x
x last , but not least , winners receive international fame and flames ! )

subject 24) ! how do i make a screendump or print my application \?

the xwd client in the x11 distributions can be used to select a window
or the background. it produces an xwd format file of the image of that window.
the file can be post processed into something useful or printed with the xpr
client and your local printing mechanism. you can use this command
csh sleep 10 xwd root output.xwd
and then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen the entire current
display will be saved into the file output.xwd. note that xwd also has an
undocumented (before r5) id flag for specifying the window id on the
command line. there are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for
specifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.

two publicly available programs which allow interactive definition of
arbitrary portions of the display and built in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.
there are several versions of xgrabsc version 2.2 , available on export 8 92
is the most recent.
xsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it it also renders
xpm output version unknown . it is available on export or avahi.inria.fr
see xsnap pl2.tar.z.
a screen dump and merge edit program combining features of xwd and xpr
is available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.z. information
soft eng@cs.uwm.edu.
xprint , by alberto accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available
from cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export 2.1.tar.z.

to post process the xwd output of some of these tools , you can use xpr ,
which is part of the x11 distribution. also on several archives are xwd2ps
and xtops , which produce encapsulated postscript with trimmings suitable for
use in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu contrib xwd2ps.tar.z and
contrib imagemagick.tar.z). also useful is the pbmplus package on many archive
servers and the xim package contains level 2 color postscript output.

the xv program can grab a portion of the x display , manipulate it , and
save it in one of the available formats. imagemagick has similar capabilities.

also

bristol technology (info@bristol.com , 203 438 6969) offers xprinter
2.0 , an xlib api for postscript and pcl printers a demo is on ftp.uu.net
in vendor bristol xprinter.

colorsoft 9619 459 8500) offers openprint package includes a screen
capture facility , image processing , and support for postscript and
non postscript printers.

some vendors' implementations of x (e.g. decwindows and openwindows)
include session managers or other desktop programs which include print portion
of screen or take a snapshot options. some platforms also have tools which
can be used to grab the frame buffer directly the sun systems , for example ,
have a 'screendump' program which produces a sun raster file. some x terminals
have local screen dump utilities to write postscript to a local serial printer.

some vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. sony) include direct
support for printing xwd files , but you 'll typically need some other package
to massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.


subject 25) how do i make a color postscript screendump of the x display \?

if you need color postscript in particular , you can
grab the screen image using a program which can produce color
postscript , such as xgrabsc and xv
grab the screen image using xwd and post process xwd into color ps.
you can do this using xwd2ps or the xtops program from the imagemagick
distribution. the pbmplus package is also good for this , as is the xim package.


subject 26) how do i make a screendump including the x cursor \?

this ca n't be done unless the x server has been extended. consider
instead a system dependent mechanism for , e.g. , capturing the frame buffer.


subject 27) how do i convert view mac tiff gif sun pict img fax images in x \?

the likeliest program is an incarnation of jef poskanzer 's useful
portable bitmap toolkit , which includes a number of programs for converting
among various image formats. it includes support for many types of bitmaps ,
gray scale images , and full color images. pbmplus has been updated recently
the most recent version 12 91 is on export in contrib pbmplus10dec91.tar.z.
another tool is san diego supercomputing center 's imtools ('imconv' in
particular) , which packages the functionality of pbm into a single binary.
it 's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).

useful for viewing some image formats is jim frost 's xloadimage , a
version of which is in the r4 directory contrib clients xloadimage there are
later versions available , including contrib xloadimage.3.03.tar.z on export.
graeme gill 's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export
see xli.readme and xli.tar.z.uu version 1.14 was released 2 93.

xv (x image viewer) , written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (john bradley) ,
can read and display pictures in sun raster , pgm , pbm , ppm , x11 bitmap , tiff ,
gif and jpeg. it can manipulate on the images adjust , color , intensity ,
contrast , aspect ratio , crop). it can save images in all of the aforementioned
formats plus postscript. it can grab a portion of the x display , manipulate on
it , and save it in one of the available formats. the program was updated 5 92
see the file contrib xv 2.21.tar.z on export.lcs.mit.edu.

the fuzzy pixmap manipulation , by michael mauldin mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu .
conversion and manipulation package , similar to pbmplus. version 1.0 available
via ftp as nl.cs.cmu.edu usr mlm ftp fbm.tar.z , uunet.uu.net pub fbm.tar.z ,
and ucsd.edu graphics fbm.tar.z.

the img software set , by paul raveling raveling@venera.isi.edu , reads
and writes its own image format , displays on an x11 screen , and does some image
manipulations. version 1.3 is available via ftp on expo.lcs.mit.edu as
contrib img 1.3.tar.z , along with large collection of color images.

the utah rle toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar
to pbmplus. available via ftp as cs.utah.edu pub urt ,
weedeater.math.yale.edu pub urt , and freebie.engin.umich.edu pub urt .

xim , the x image manipulator , by philip thompson , does essential
interactive displaying , editing , filtering , and converting of images. there is
a version in the x11r4 contrib area but a more recent version (using r4 and
motif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). xim reads writes gif ,
xwd , xbm , tiff , rle , xim , (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a
library and command line utilities for building your own applications.

imagemagick 2.3 2 93 by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from
export 's contrib area. it is a collection of utilities to transform and display
images on any x server. the tool uses the miff format filters to and from miff
from other popular formats (ppm , tiff , gif , sun raster , etc) are included.

xtiff is a tool for viewing a tiff file in an x window. it was written
to handle as many different kinds of tiff files as possible while remaining
simple , portable and efficient. xtiff illustrates some common problems
with building pixmaps and using different visual classes. it is distributed
as part of sam leffler 's libtiff package and it is also available on
export.lcs.mit.edu , uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. dbs@decwrl.dec.com , 10 90
xtiff 2.0 was announced in 4 91 it includes xlib and xt versions.

a version of lee iverson 's (leei@mcrcim.mcgill.edu) image viewing tool
is available as contrib vimage 0.9.3.tar.z on export.lcs.mit.edu. the package
also includes an imageviewport widget and a filedialog widget. 12 91 5 92

subject 28) how can i change the titlebar of my xterm window \?

the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will
cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the
string which appears in the window titlebar.
a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell
echo esc 2 text g
where esc is the escape key , text is the string you wish to have displayed ,
and g is a control g (the bel character).

here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to
the current working directory when you change directories
alias newcd 'cd ! echo n esc 2 cwd g'

the digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should
change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name
used in the icon , use the digit '0' instead , and use '1' to change only the
icon name.

note another way to do this , which prevents an incorrect display of
the local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell , is to wrap the
escape sequences into the ps1 prompt itself.

note on an ibm rs 6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with
a v.


subject 29) where can i find the xterm control sequences \?

the best source of such information is in your r5 sources in the file
ctlseqs.ms a postscript version is in mit hardcopy clients ctlseqs.ps.z.

o'reilly 's volume 3 , the x user 's guide , includes an r5 version of the control
sequences the standard volume will be available 3 93 , and a motif version of
the book is available now. the current (r4) guide includes an outdated version
of the control sequences. 1 93

other good sources of information include the r4 version of that document
and also the file in the r4 sources called mit clients xterm ctlseq2.txt , a
compilation put together by skip montanaro (ge cr d) listing the vt100
sequences. it dates from r3 but is fairly accurate. a hardcopy version was
published in the december 1989 xnextevent (the xug newsletter).

in a pinch , a vt100 manual will do.

subject 30) why does the r3 xterm , et al , fail against the r4 server \?

subject 31) how can i use characters above ascii 127 in xterm \?

in order to use special characters such as the o umlaut , you need to
stty pass8 but also to use a charcell iso8859 font , such as
xterm font medium r normal 130 c iso8859 1
xterm boldfont bold r normal 130 c iso8859 1
the family is intentionally unspecified in this example.

in addition , you may want to set this in your shell
setenv lc ctype iso 8859 1

for a given character above 127 , you can determine the key to use with
the alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using
`man ascii`). for example , o umlaut (v) is alt v and the section character (')
is alt '.

subject 32) why are my xterm menus so small \?

you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. if you give
a resource specification like this
xterm geometry 80x24
then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to
80x24. for the main window , this is ok , as it uses characters for its size.
but its popup menus do n't they are in pixels and show up small. to set only
the terminal widget to have the specified geometry , name it explicitly
xterm vt100.geometry 80x24


subject 33) how can i print the current selection \?

you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command.
however , a program by richard hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for
manipulating the selection will help e.g.
xselection primary lpr
finds the primary selection and prints it. this command can be placed in a
window manager menu or in shell scripts. xselection also permits the setting of
the selection and other properties. a version is on export.
also available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca pub xget selection.tar.z , which can be
adapted to do this.


subject 34) how does xt use environment variables in loading resources \?

you can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your xt based programs xfilesearchpath , xuserfilesearchpath , and
xapplresdir. these environment variables control where xt looks for
application defaults files as an application is initializing. xt loads at most
one app defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from
the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath.

set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.
suppose , for example , that you are running sun 's open windows , and you also
have some r4 x applications installed in usr lib x11 app defaults. you could
set a value like this for xfilesearchpath , and it would cause xt to look up
app defaults files in both usr lib x11 and usr openwin lib (or wherever your
openwinhome is located)
setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x11 t n openwinhome lib t n

the value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of pathnames. the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see
xtresolvepathname())

n the value of the filename parameter , or the
application 's class name.
t the value of the file type . in this case , the
literal string app defaults
c customization resource (r5 only)
s suffix. none for app defaults.
l language , locale , and codeset (e.g. ja jp.euc )
l language part of l (e.g. ja )
t the territory part of the display 's language string
c the codeset part of the display 's language string

let 's take apart the example. suppose the application 's class name is
myterm . also , suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin. (notice the
example omits locale specific lookup.)
usr lib x11 t n means usr lib x11 app defaults myterm
openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm

as the application initializes , xt tries to open both of the above
app defaults files , in the order shown. as soon as it finds one , it reads it
and uses it , and stops looking for others. the effect of this path is to
search first in usr lib x11 , then in usr openwin.

let 's consider another example. this time , let 's set
xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm.ad in the current working
directory , then for myterm in the directory app defaults.
setenv xuserfilesearchpath . n.ad home app defaults n

the first path in the list expands to . myterm.ad. the second expands
to home app defaults myterm. this is a convenient setting for debugging
because it follows the imake convention of naming the app defaults file
myterm.ad in the application 's source directory , so you can run the application
from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded
properly. note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath ,
for some bizarre reason , neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and
s are useless.

with r5 , there 's another twist. you may specify a customization
resource value. for example , you might run the myterm application like this
myterm xrm customization color

if one of your pathname specifications had the value
usr lib x11 t n c then the expanded pathname would be
usr lib x11 app defaults myterm color because the c substitution character
takes on the value of the customization resource.

the default xfilesearchpath , compiled into xt , is
usr lib x11 l t n c (r5)
usr lib x11 l t n c (r5)
usr lib x11 t n c (r5)
usr lib x11 l t n
usr lib x11 l t n
usr lib x11 t n

(note some sites replace usr lib x11 with a projectroot in
this batch of default settings.)

the default xuserfilesearchpath , also compiled into xt , is
root l n c (r5)
root l n c (r5)
root n c (r5)
root l n
root l n
root n

root is either the value of xapplresdir or the user 's home directory
if xapplresdir is not set. if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other
than the default , xt ignores xapplresdir altogether.

notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir
to . , a single dot. in r3 , all this machinery worked differently for r3
compatibilty , many people set their xapplresdir value to . , a dot followed
by a slash.

subject 35) how to i have the r4 xdm put a picture behind the log in window \?

the answer lies in changing xdm 's xrdb resource in the xdm config file to run a
program to change the background before loading the resources for example ,
your usr lib x11 xdm xdm config file may add the line
displaymanager.0.authorize false
to permit unrestricted access to the display before log in (beware ! ) and also
displaymanager xrdb usr lib x11 xdm new.xrdb
where that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of
! bin sh
comes in with arguments display 0 load usr lib x11 xdm xresources
usr bin x11 xsetroot display 2 bitmap usr lib x11 xdm new.bitmap
usr bin x11 xrdb
substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot , to taste. note that this is a
general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.

subject 36) why is n't my path set when xdm runs my .xsession file \?

when xdm runs your .xsession it does n't source your .cshrc or .login
files. you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script
or you can place all environment setting statements in a separate file and
source it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file or ,
if you set your path in your .cshrc file , the normal place , you can make your
.xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script , i.e. by starting
your .xsession file off with ! bin csh .
if this does n't work , also try starting off with
! bin sh
reset path
path `csh c 'echo path'` export path


subject 37) how do i keep my display when i rlogin to another machine \?

there are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv display ...
whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x.
one solution is to use the clients xrsh on the r5 contrib tape. it
includes xrsh , a script to start an x application on remote machine , and
xrlogin , a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.
a more recent version is on export in xrsh 5.4.shar.
one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse
(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). you can ftp caveat emptor versions from
132.206.1.1 , in x xrlogin.c and x xrlogind.c. the program packages up term and
display into a single string , which is stuffed into term. rlogin then
propagates term normally your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain
eval `xrlogind`
where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special
format it recognizes , unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to
recreate the environment variables. 11 90

in addition , if all you need to do is start a remote x process on
another host , and you find
rsh host n usr bin x11 xterm display display
too simple (display must have your real hostname) , then this version of xrsh
can be used to start up remote x processes. the equivalent usage would be
xrsh host xterm

! bin sh
start an x11 process on another host

rsh host n setenv display display exec @ dev null dev null

an improved version
rxcmd (suggested by john robinson , jr@bbn.com)
(generalized for sh , ksh by keith boyer , keith@cis.ohio state.edu)

but they put the rcmd in () 's which left zombies again. this
script combines the best of both.

subject 38) how can i design my own font \?

one way is to use the bitmap client or some other bitmap editor (e.g.
sun 's icon editor tool , post processed with pbmplus) to design the individual
characters and then to do some large amount of post processing to concatenate
them into the bdf format. see ollie jones 's article in the november 91 x
journal for more information.
the r3 contrib area (in fonts utils and in clients xtroff) contained
a number of useful utilities , including some to convert between bdf font format
and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.
an easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a
version is on the r4 or r5 x11r5 contrib tape in contrib clients xfed. xfed is
available for anonymous ftp on ftp.informatik.uni dortmund.de 129.217.64.63 ,
possibly as file pub windows x diverse x11 sourcen xfed.tar.z. it can produce
bdf format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of x servers.
the xfedor client from group bull permits creation of bitmaps , cursors ,
xpm1 pixmaps , and fonts. binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in
pub in addition , the sources (an old xlib implementation) have been placed
5 91 in export contrib.
if you are a metafont user you can use mftobdf from the seetex
distribution to convert pk , gf , and pxl fonts to bdf format the distribution
is on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.
the gnu package fontutils 0.4.tar.z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe ,
a font editor , and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.
the o'reilly x resource issue 2 contains an article on using these
tools to modify a font.
fonts can be resized with hiroto kagotani 's bdfresize a new version is
in ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp x11 contrib.


subject 39) why does adding a font to the server not work (sic) \?

after you have built the font using your system 's font compiler ,
installed it in some directory , and run `mkfontdir` or your system 's equivalent
(e.g. bldfamily for openwindows) in that directory , be sure to use `xset fp
dir` to add that full path name to the server 's font path , or if the
directory is already in the path , use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in
that directory are actually found it is this last step that you 're probably
leaving out. (you can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in
the path.)
sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a badvalue error
x error of failed request badvalue
(integer parameter out of range for operation)
major opcode of failed request 51 (x setfontpath)

this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory , or
that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server. (the
mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious.)

is the font directory you 're specifying readable from the server 's file
system \? remember , it 's the server , not the client , which interprets your
font directory. trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an
xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. xset fp myfonts ) and
the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm.

is the directory really a font directory \? if you 're running an mit server
(or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file
fonts.dir . if you ca n't find that file , run mkfontdir(1). (if you 're
running openwindows , look for the file families.list . if you ca n't find
it , run bldfamily(1).)

if you 're in a site where some people run x11rn servers and others run a
proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (openwindows , for
example) , make sure the font directory is right for the server you 're using.
hint if the directory contains .pcf and or .snf files , it wo n't work for
open windows. if the directory contains .ff and or .fb files , it wo n't work
for x11rn.

subject 40) how do i convert a .snf font back to .bdf font \?

a tool called snftobdf 1.4 is part of the bdftools package , which is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu contrib bdftools.tar.z and from
crl.nmsu.edu pub misc bdftools.tar.z. 2 91


subject 41) what is a general method of getting a font in usable format \?

der mouse 's getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and
produces a .bdf file for any font the server is willing to let it. it can be
used as an anything to bdf converter , but requires access to a server that can
understand the font file , thus is both more and less powerful than other tools
such as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in x getbdf.c or available via mail
from mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu. 5 91
in addition , the r5 program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that
the r5 server has access to.


subject 42) how do i use decwindows fonts on my non decwindows server \?

the decwindows fonts typically do n't exist on a non dec installation ,
but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by decwindows applications to
standard mit fonts of similar characteristics and size. pick up the file
contrib decwindows on x11r4 font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu this file is
for a standard mit r4 server. it can also serve as a starting point for
creating a similar aliases file for the open windows server or other servers
which do not use the mit font scheme.


subject 43) how do i add .bdf fonts to my decwindows server \?

the format of fonts preferred by dec 's x server is the .pcf format.
you can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using dec 's dxfc
font compiler. note that the dec servers can also use raw .bdf fonts , with a
performance hit.


subject 44) ! how can i set backgroundpixmap in a defaults file \? (what is xpm \? )
i want to be able to do something like this
xclock backgroundpixmap usr include x11 bitmaps rootweave

you ca n't do this. the backgroundpixmap resource is a pixmap of the
same depth as the screen , not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). because
of this , writing a generic string to pixmap converter is impossible , since
there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. therefore ,
neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap
converter , because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a
resource. the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for
use in many of its widgets , however.
courtesy chris d. peterson (now kit@ics.com) , 4 90

however
a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of
the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted 12 90 by sebastian wangnick
(basti@unido.informatik.uni dortmund.de) it permits loading of a number of
image formats as a pixmap.

the leading general purpose format for pixmaps is the xpm format used
by groupe bull in several of its programs , including the gwm window manager , by
at t in its olpixmap editor , and by ics in its interface builder. xpm
distribution , available on export as contrib xpm.tar.z , includes read write
routines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to
allow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner. see information
on the xpm talk mailing list above. xpm 3.0f was announced in 3 93 and is
available from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr an older version is on
the r5 contrib tape. a set of xpm icons collected by anthony thyssen
(anthony@kurango.cit.gu.edu.au) is on export in contrib aicons.


subject 45) why ca n't i override translations \? only the first item works.

you probably have an extra space after the specification of the first
item , like this
basic text.translations override
ctrl key a beginning of line() n
ctrl key e end of line()
extra space
the newline after that space is ending the translation definition.
thanks to timothy j. horton , 5 91


subject 46) how can i have xclock or oclock show different timezones \?

one solution is xchron , in volume 6 of comp.sources.x , which can show
the time for timezones other than the local one.
alternatively , you can probably set the timezone in the shell from
which you invoke the xclock or oclock , or use a script similar to this
! bin sh
tz pst8pdt xclock name san luis obispo ca 2 dev null
tz est5edt xclock name king of prussia pa 2 dev null


subject 47) i have xmh , but it does n't work. where can i get mh \?

subject 48) why am i suddenly unable to connect to my sun x server \?
after a seemingly random amount of time after the x server has been started , no
other clients are able to connect to it.

the default cron cleanup jobs supplied by sun (for 4.0.3 , at least)
delete old (unreferenced) files from tmp including tmp .x11 unix , which
contains the socket descriptor used by x. the solution is to add ! type s to
the find exclusion in the cron job.

subject 49) why do n't the r5 pex demos work on my mono screen \?

the r5 sample server implementation works only on color screens , sorry.


subject 50) ! how do i get my sun type 45 keyboard fully supported by xsun \?

many users wants the num lock key to light the num lock led and have the
appropriate effect on the numeric keypad. the xsun server as distributed by mit
does n't do this but there are two different patches available.

the first patch is written by jonathan lemon and fixes the num lock related
problems. it is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in the file
contrib xsun r5.numlock patch.z .

the second is written by martin forssen and fixes the num lock and compose keys
and adds support for the different national keyboard layouts for type 4 and
type 5 keyboards. this patch is available from export.lcs.mit.edu in
contrib sunkbd1216 0314.tar.z or via email from maf@dtek.chalmers.se.

thanks to martin forssen (maf@dtek.chalmers.se or maf@math.chalmers.se) , 8 92

a set of patches by william bailey (dbgwab@arco.com) was posted to newsgroups
11 92 to provide support for the type 5 keyboard.


subject 51) how do i report bugs in x \?

generally , report bugs you find to the organization that supplied you
with the x window system. if you received the r5 source distribution directly
from mit , please read the file mit bug report for instructions. look in
mit doc bugs bug report in r4.

subject 52) why do i get warning widget class version mismatch \?

this error , which typically goes on to say , widget 11004 vs.
intrinsics 11003 indicates that the header files you included when building
your program did n't match the header files that the xt library you 're linking
against was built with check your i include path and l link path to be sure.
however , the problem also occurs when linking against a version of the
x11r4 xt library before patch 10 the version number was wrong. some sun ow
systems , in particular , were shipped with the flawed version of the library ,
and applications which link against the library typically give the warnings you
have seen.


subject 53) where can i find a dictionary server for xwebster \?

webster 's still owns the copyright to the on line copies of webster 's
dictionary which are found at various (university) sites. after it became aware
that these sites were then acting as servers for other sites running xwebster
and gnuemacs webster , it asked that server sites close off external access.
the next machine apparently is also licensed to have the dictionary. a
webster daemon for next machines is available from iuvax.cs.indiana.edu
(129.79.254.192) in pub webster next 2.0 .
unless you want to get a legal on line copy yourself or can find a site
which can grant you access , you are probably out of luck.

however , if you are a legitimate site , you 'll want to pick up the
latest xwebster , as is on export contrib xwebster.tar.z 10 91 the file
xwebster.readme includes discussions of the availability , illegality , and
non availability of dictionary servers.

subject 54) topic obtaining x and related software and hardware

subject 55) is x public domain software \?

no. the x software is copyrighted by various institutions and is not
public domain , which has a specific legal meaning. however , the x
distribution is available for free and can be redistributed without fee.
contributed software , though , may be placed in the public domain by
individual authors.


subject 56) how compatible are x11r3 , r4 , and r5 \? what changes are there \?

the release notes for each mit release of x11 specify the changes from the
previous release. the x consortium tries very hard to maintain compatibility
across releases. in the few places where incompatible changes were necessary ,
details are given in the release notes. each x11 distribution site on the
network also offers the release notes that go with the release they offer the
file typically can be found at the top of the distribution tree.

stephen gildea , 1 92

the comp.windows.x.intrinsics faq xt lists xt differences among these versions.


subject 57) ! where can i get x11r5 (source and or binaries) \?

information about mit 's distribution of the sources on 6250bpi and qic 24 tape
and its distribution of hardcopy of the documents is available from
software center , technology licensing office , massachusetts institute of
technology , 28 carleton street , room e32 300 , cambridge ma 02142 1324 ,
phone 617 258 8330.

you will need about 100mb of disk space to hold all of core and 140mb to hold
the contrib software donated by individuals and companies.

please use a site that is close to you in the network.

note that the release notes are generally available separately in the same
directory the notes list changes from previous versions of x and offer a
guide to the distribution.

the multi lingual archives at the computing research labs , new mexico

archives are being put under control of the consortium for lexical
research.

the new ftp address will be clr.nmsu.edu (the current ip address
is 128.123.1.12 but may change , so use clr.nmsu.edu whenever
possible).

please note that there is a difference between ftp sites crl.nmsu.edu and
clr.nmsu.edu. the crl.nmsu.edu site will be our ftp site for items
not related to the consortium for lexical research.

the arabic , chinese , french , italian , indian , japanese , korean ,
tibetan , and vietnamese archives will all be moved.

we will announce the new locations of the relevant directories once
the archives have been moved.

please be patient if you discover directories missing when you ftp to
either crl.nmsu.edu or clr.nmsu.edu. it will take a few days to move
everything.

if you are not familiar with our multi lingual archives , we have been
slowly collecting various software , fonts , and text for different
languages over the past 2 years. most of the software is currently
unix oriented. we would also like to encourage people to continue to
contribute items to the archives to help improve the quality and
quantity of multi lingual tools.

if you have an item to contribute , please put it in

clr.nmsu.edu incoming

and send a note to lexical@nmsu.edu telling them about your
contribution.

if you have any questions or comments , please send them to
lexical@nmsu.edu

i found this invaluble. unfortunately , there is a bit of work to set up the
shared memory segments , making an ximage from it , etc. also , there is an
extension query to determine if the server supports it , but you still need to
test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
in the kernel. i have written layers of convience routines which make all this
transparent.
as for the xview code , well , i doubt that would be considered interesting.
the interesting stuff is done in a c object library. people interested in this

has anyone found a fix for the following problem \?

client software sunos 4.1.1 , x11r5
server hardware sun ipc
server software sunos 4.1.1 , open windows 3.0 (w patch 100444 37)

a motif 1.2.2 application will periodically hang when run against the
openwindows 3.0 server (xnews). the pulldown is displayed but then no
button actions have any effect. sometimes pressing return will
unstick the application but not usually. it looks like the pulldown is
grabbing the focus and never letting go. other windows on the display
continue to get updated so the server is n't hanging. if i log in from
another terminal and kill the motif application then everything gets
back to normal. the same application when run against other x servers
(including mit x11r5 xsun , decwindows , tektronix x terminal) has no
problems. this is obviously a openwindows problem but i need a
work around since most of our customers are openwindows users.

i have tried the following things

1. installing the latest version of the openwindows server patch
(100444 37).

2. using mwm (version 1.2.2) instead of olwm.

3. applying the patch specified in the motif faq (question 110).
this had the effect of disabling the point and click method of
menu interaction (as opposed to the click and drag method) , and
screwing up the menu mnemonics keys. it did seem to help , but i
was still able to get the application to hang.

repeat by

this is an intermittent problem so you 'll have to try several times.

click and release on a menu heading (pulldown menu will pop up)

click and release on a menu item

repeat until application hangs


any help would be appreciated. thanks in advance.

i am trying to write an image display program that uses
the mit shared memory extension. the shared memory segment
gets allocated and attached to the process with no problem.
but the program crashes at the first call to xshmputimage ,
with the following message

x error of failed request badshmseg (invalid shared segment parameter)

minor opcode of failed request 3 (x shmputimage)

problems.

if anybody has had the same problem or has used mit shm without

for image display , about 10 frames per second seems to be the lower limit

i am working on a project to provide an emergency management
information system. in keeping with more classic command and
control type systems , we are considering developing a dual screen monitor
system in order to provide a status board on it 's own monitor.
i have a number of x level questions regarding this

(we are devloping on unix systems using x motif. platform will be
predominantly sun 's , probably with ports to rs 6000 as well).

i am assuming the standard dual monitor systems are configured
such that we are talking about one x display and multiple screens ,
and not multiple x displays. given this

is changing input focus from one screen to the other as simple
as tracking your mouse from one screen to the other \? there 's
nothing special that needs to be done to shift focus between
screens \?

do i have to run separate window managers on the separate
screens or are there multiscreen window managers out there \?
what are they who sells them...

is a multi screen window manager the only way i can grab a
window frame and move a window from one screen to the next \?

is there any way for the application to transparently see
multiple screens as one logical x y plane , or does the hardware
only provide for each screen to start at 0 , 0 \?

any thoughts on the difficulties involved with designing a
system capable of using either multiple screens or a single
screen (perhaps running a virtual window manager to simulate
multiple screens instead) \?
i am assuming that this is not a major issue that i can rely
on providing config files which will specify for each
configuration the screen placement of each window in the
application. any thoughts or suggestions from past experience
are more than welcome.

what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls \? i am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running
dv x is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response
time. anyone have any ideas \? \?

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network
itself. to give you a real world example , here at quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , novell
file servers , and each other. it 's not too much of a load on our
ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators , so you have 20 30 people on each
segment). if you had a badly loaded net , or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive , you could run into some slowdowns.

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself. say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. if you have
10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some slowdowns
because you 're now on (effectively) a 3.3 mhz 486. of course , dvx will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice , but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it.


well i can buy a bigger and more powerful server machine because of the
significant drop in price year after year. the link i want to use
though (isdn 64k) is costly and the bandwidth limited. that 's why my
interest lies in seeing if such a link can be used and see what traffic
goes through it.


having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing) , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).

hmmm. has anyone at your centre monitored the traffic at all \? are you
running any standard ms windows programs like word \? what sort of
packets go blazing through \? what size link do you have (2mb or 10mb \? ).
what is the average traffic flow going through your network or do you
have few high peaks and then many low points \?


it all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you 're going
to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)


what do you mean by network things \? i vision using ms windows and other
windows applications over the network were the processes are running on
the server and all i am getting are the displays. i am wondering how
good is the x and subsequently dv x protocol in transferring these
images with x calls and displaying them on a client 's machine.

do is to follow the tips given in the gcc release. gcc generates code
that requires libgcc2 and you should take that into account when

subject dynamic squeezetitle configuration in twm
keywords twm , twm , vtwm , tvtwm , ctwm
organization systems strategies , inc. , ny , ny
lines 123

i consider twm style squeezed titles indispensable in a window
manager. i like to have two tall xterm windows visible at the same
time , with no overlap and since two windows are n't enough , i have
other xterm windows underneath them , with exactly the same positioning.

in case you 're not familiar with squeezed titles , here 's a crude
picture

figure 1


title a title b title c

this is the window b hides window c , but
body of the you can still see c 's title
window , window a which is squeezed right.


figure 1

squeezed titles allow me to have about 5 such windows in each stack ,
with easy access and 3 per stack is usually more than i really
need , since i also insist on having a virtual wm.

the only problem is that the title location is static , that is , it
is configured in .twmrc , and in order to change it you have to edit
that file and restart the window manager. doing so is cumbersome and
time consuming.

therefore , i have implemented f.squeeze left , center , right
functions in my own copy of vtwm the idea being that with one click
of a button , you can change this


title a

this is the
body of the
window , window a


to this


title a

this is the
body of the
window , window a




okay. so far , so good. now , how the heck do i get them to put this
into the next official twm , and the next tvtwm , and the next vtwm ,
and the next ctwm \? and the next xyztwm that i never heard of \?

one way would be to post , in comp.windows.x , a description of this
enhancement , together with an explanation of why i think it is a
very good thing , and hope that someone reads it. )

in case it is n't already clear why i think it 's a very good thing ,
look back up at figure 1 , and picture window a moved over on top of
windows b and c now window a 's title hides window b 's title
but when you hit f.squeezecenter , the result is


title b title a title c

this is the body of the window ,
window a , which is on top.




the rest of this posting explains how to implement it , based on my
x11r4 copy of vtvwm.shar it 's just a sketch because posting the
full diffs would be too long.

the key to this enhancement is to add the following lines in the
executefunction() routine in menus.c

ifdef shape
case f squeezeleft
static squeezeinfo left squeeze j left , 0 , 0
if (deferexecution (context , func , scr selectcursor))
return true

tmp win squeeze info left squeeze
setframeshape( tmp win )
break

.... and similarly for squeezeright ( j right ) and
squeezecenter ( j center ) ...
endif

( of course , you also have to define f squeezeleft in parse.h
and add
f.squeezeleft , fkeyword , f squeezeleft ,
... and so forth ...
to parse.c

in order to use these functions , add something like the
following to your .twmrc file

button2 m s w v d r i t door f.squeezecenter



about a year ago , i posted this , but our news was broken and i
think it did n't get out.

since then , blast has appeared in comp.sources.x , volume 19 ,
issue 41 you could use blast to achieve a similar effect , by
chiseling away at an mwm style wide title. better to have a
twm style window manager , i think.

this is possible. has anybody sucessfuly done this before \?

if it 's any consolation , i have two 2 headed sun 3 60 systems , though the
color and mono monitors for each are rated 1152x900. their configuration
is the same as yours , so it should be a plug'n'play situation , except

i do n't know if your hi res mono monitor will function this way. however ,
you may simply be able to pull the motherboard and set the hi res jumper
(located in the same jumper array as the jumpers for the ram simm selects
and ethernet connection) and be happily on your way. when you pull the
motherboard , the jumpers are in the left rear (e.g. north west ) quadrant
of the motherboard (to the left of the simm sockets).

for some reason the following code causes my x application to beep whenever i
intercept a keystroke and change it 's meaning. the intent of this code it to
allow date fields the following special keys

tt insert today 's date
bump day up by one
bump day down by one

i hardcoded some dates for this example. perhaps i should n't be using an
xmtext field for this.



for some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys
of tt are hit. why \? the idea of this code is to interpret these
keys having the special meaning implied by the code. i would like to get
rid of the beeping but , as far as i can tell , i'm not doing the beep and
am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring.



code deleted...

from the xmtextfield man page (during discussion of resources)

xmnverifybell

specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
during a verification callback.

you are setting doit to false in the callback , and text field is beeping
as it should. to turn off this behavior , set this boolean resource to false.

i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the user window. maybe other window managers
have similar options.
another way to figure out the difference between the user window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. unfortunately , you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

another way would be to use getgeometry to find out where
you are relative to the frame , and translatecoordinates to find
out where your window 's upperleft corner really is.


as i 've said before , there 's no reliable way to find out the size of
the window manager decoration. if your window has been reparented , you
ca n't assume that the window you 're parented to is the window that
holds all of the window manager decoration. there may be several
layers of windows. doing multiple xquerytree 's until you get to the
root will work in most cases , but there 's no guarantee that the outside
decoration window is parented to the root window of the display (tvtwm).

hello ,

i am testing a port of x11r5 to coherent , a unix clone os for intel architecture
machines. i am seeing a strange problem with text in clients like xvt (a simple
terminal emulator program).

the problem manifests it self when the shell echoes typed characters back to the
server for display , one at a time. the characters appear to be too closely
spaced , with the result being that the 2nd character echoed destroys the
rightmost edge of the first character , then the 3rd character destroys the
rightmost edge of the second character , and so on. it looks like there is an
invisible boundary around a character which obscures a portion of the previous
character. there is no problem between the characters when the shell returns
a complete line of text... only when the output is a series of individual
characters.

if anyone has any ideas what the problem might be , or where i should look to
find it , it would be much appreciated.

regards and thanks , jon dhuse.

if anyone has any information about the existence or location of a
dedicated x server kernel for the sun3 , please send email. i am
trying to put some neglected sun3s to good use but they do n't have
enough memory for sunos 4.1.1. thanks in advance for any help.

there is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
it is by seth robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu). it takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run x. we converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
i find them faster than an ncd 15inch black white xterminal that we
are playing with , and a bigger screen to boot ! as a matter of fact ,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert !

xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
128.59.64.40 in xkernel xkernel.shar ( xkernel is a symlink to the
latest version of xkernel)

note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3 50 , but compiling to work for a sun 3 1xx should be quite easy.

i am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8). i may be able to answer questions feel free
to email me.

display....when i popup a dialogshell to prompt the user for
some input i want the xmndialogstyle to be set to
xmdialog primary application modal. the result is that if my cursor is
over the dialogshell i get my colormap , but if the cursor is over the
applicationshell (or any window other than the dialogshell) i get the
default colormap. but i 'd like it so that if my cursor is over any
window of my application , i get my colormap.

i think this is correct behavior. remember the default
colormapfocuspolicy is keyboard (meaning the cmap focus follows the
keyboard focus). since the dialog is modal , mwm wo n't allow keyboard
focus onto your main shell , and so it wo n't allow cmap focus either.

since it sounds as though you have keyboardfocuspolicy pointer , i
suggest you set colormapfocuspolicy pointer also. that way , the cmap
focus wo n't slavishly follow keyboard focus , but will beat its own path.

(if you have keyboardfocuspolicy explicit , you can set cmap focus
explicit also , but you then need a binding to f.focus color , probably on
mb1).

does xdm work with decnet \? i have an ultrix machine running both tcp ip
and decnet. i have a number of x terminals hanging off the ultrix host also
running tcp ip and decnet. presently i am using xdm for the login procedure
on the x terminals using tcp ip. since xdm is basically just an x windows
client , should n't i be able to run xdm on the decnet protocol tower as well \?

my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client. it is making
tcp ip specific socket calls. in this case the answer would be no you can
not run xdm over decnet. is this right or not \? any feedback is appreciated.

if the client is executing on host foo then 0 , unix 0 , foo 0 ,

i'm writing an x server for some video generation equipment. the
hardware is truecolor in yuv space in x terms it has a 24 bit
static color visual. i would really like to have the server just
present this static visual , but i'm not sure if this will be
acceptable to most x clients. the three problems i see are

1) the colormap , though huge , is static.
2) all pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
3) because the hardware actually lives in yuv space , the
translation rgb yuv will introduce some rounding error.

being more of a server guy than a client guy , i ask will these
limitations thwart many x clients \? or will most of the x stuff
floating around blithely accept what they 're given \? i could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of , e.g. , 8 bits ,
but i 'd rather avoid this if not necessary.


even 24bit truecolor machines are in most cases running an emulated
8 bit pseudocolor visual , only to get standard x clients , motif apps and
thelike to run. i strongly suppose you to emulate at least

24 bit truecolor. should be no problem , only some translation. rounding
should not make big misfits
8 bit pseudocolor. more of a problem , you have to emulate a colormap ,
pixel indices , conversion stuff. furthermore , you should run your default

news software vax vms vnews 1.41


the situation running a fortran executable that creats an xterm. an option
in the menu contained in the xterm runs a fortran subroutine that creats
a tektronics mode xterm for displaying some graphics. typing a ret while
the tektronics mode xterm (future reference to this will be tek term ) is
active makes the xterm read future keystrokes but does not shift input focus
to the xterm (i'm basing that statement on the fact that the border of the
tek term stays the highlighted color and that the tek term stays on top of
xterm. if what i'm describing is n't input focus , let me know.)

the xterm can be brought to the top by clicking the mouse button on it.

subsequent selections from the xterm of the menu item that displays graphics
highlihts the border and displays the updated graphics , but does not move
the tek term to the top. if the tek term has been iconized to conserve
screen space , it stays an icon.


the desired behavior one of two options

1. whichever of the windows that is active is always on top of the
inactive one.

2. whenever the tek term is inactivated , it should revert to a icon
but when it is activated it should become a window on a higher
level than the xterm.

what i think i need a means of specifying that a xterm or tek term will
be at the highest level and a way to iconify expand a xterm and tek term.
these commands , would , i 'd guess , need to be in the fortran or in the
command that starts up the xterm and tek term.

i have a peculiar color problem with macx , apple 's macintosh x server.
i 'd like to know if others have seen the same problem. it 's happened
with the current version (1.2) , and with version 1.1.7.
when some types of client windows are displayed , parts of the windows
are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly , forcing the server
to repaint it , it is repainted in the correct colors. it does n't happen
for xterm windows , but has happened for graphic windows and with some
motif clients.

i expect what is going on here is that your colormap is full and , when the new application starts up , it cannot add the colors that it needs to the colormap.
it therefore has to pick and choose from the existing colors. this makes it look
ugly until it 's window gets priority. then macx changes the colormap so that
the selected app is getting the exact colors it wanted , but now other applications
are having to make do with it 's colormap.

this is a problem with all color x servers (or at least all color xservers i have
seen) when the demands of the applications exceed the size of the colormap.
my solution is usually to (1) avoid colormap greedy apps and (2) display
applications where color is just icing on the cake in monochrome mode rather
than in color (if this is an option for the application).

writes
(2nd posting of the question that just does n't seem to get answered)

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that
contains
xlib graphics. a button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()
(or equiv) directly instead , it should register the existence of the
new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that
handles
regular expose events (e.g. window manager driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image. using an expose event handler is a proper
way
to do this because at the time the handler is called , the xlib window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped. what we need to do is somehow tickle the
window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item.

what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior \?

to incrementally update the contents of windows , i use the following trick

1. set the window background to none ,
2. call xcleararea(display , window , 0 , 0 , 0 , 0 , true) ,
3. restore the window background to its correct value.

the call to xcleararea does not repaint the window background , but still
generates exposure events for visible parts of the window.

in order to let my application know that these expose events must be handled
incrementally (something is already displayed on the screen and may need to
be erased) , i encapsulate the 3 operations with 2 self addressed client
messages , which preserve asynchronicity between the client and the server.

xgrabserver(display)
client message (start incremental)
background none
xcleararea
restore background
client message (end incremental)
xungrabserver(display)

the grabserver prevents other events to be inserted by the server in the
critical section.

i posted this a while ago and did n't receive one reply , and now we
have another bug report on the same subject. can anybody help me out \?

the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators ,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply. unfortunately ,
the specification for xgrabkey does n't allow anymodifier to be combined
with other modifiers , which is exactly what would be desired in this case
ctrl any key q .

in ora vol. 6 , in the section on accelerators it says for information
on how to specify translation tables see vol. 4... , this is so you
know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource. if you go to
vol. 4 it says , likewise , if a modifier is specified , there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. for
example , the translation
shift key q quit()
will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the shift key (and the q key).

this is true for accelerators and mnemonics , which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs it 's not true for menu accelerators. if
you 're a motif implementor , i 'd suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics
changed to support the feature i described above. otherwise , change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user 's
expectations , because menu accelerators are not the same thing as
translations.

is it possible to supply 1 accelerator for a menu entry \?

if you mean menu accelerator , no it 's not possible. that 's according to
the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page.

keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you
ca n't use xtinstallaccelerators().

i ca n't think of a reason why not.

how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case \? what i want is ctrl o and ctrl o to both be accelerators on one
menu entry.

there is a workaround for motif users. in addition to the normal menu
accelerator you install on the xmpushbutton gadget , set an xtnaccelerators
resource on the shell (toplevel or application). install the shell 's
accelerators on itself and all of its descendants with
xtinstallallaccelerators (shell , shell).

for example ,

applicationshell mainwindow menubar filecascade
filepulldown openpushbutton
exitpushbutton

openpushbutton.accelerator ctrl key o
openpushbutton.acceleratortext ctrl o
exitpushbutton.accelerator ctrl key q
exitpushbutton.acceleratortext ctrl q

applicationshell.accelerators override n
ctrl key o performaction( openpushbutton , armandactivate) n
ctrl key q performaction( exitpushbutton , armandactivate)

you have to write and add the application action performaction , which you
can implement by using xtnametowidget on the first argument and then
xtcallactionproc with the rest of the arguments.

i tested out something similar to this. to shorten development time , i
used teleuse 's tuninstallaccelerators resource to install the accelerators
on the shell , and i directly invoked the open and quit d actions instead
of asking the pushbuttons to do it for me , but the more general approach i
described above should work.

hardware is truecolor in yuv space in x terms it has a 24 bit
static color visual. i would really like to have the server just
present this static visual , but i'm not sure if this will be
acceptable to most x clients. the three problems i see are

1) the colormap , though huge , is static.
2) all pixels would be 3 bytes wide.
3) because the hardware actually lives in yuv space , the
translation rgb yuv will introduce some rounding error.

being more of a server guy than a client guy , i ask will these
limitations thwart many x clients \? or will most of the x stuff
floating around blithely accept what they 're given \? i could write
the server to also present a pseudocolor visual of , e.g. , 8 bits ,
but i 'd rather avoid this if not necessary.

i know there are no absolutes , but i 'd appreciate hearing people 's

i 've added a line in the start up file before the line

i think that the problem has to do with a conflict between

the odd thing is that i do n't see these errors if i run

can anyone suggest a way to modify the key map , specifically

no , it is n't. it is the x window system , or x11 , or x or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the x consortium. in fact ,
doing man x on pretty much any x11 machine will tell you

the x consortium requests that the following names be used
when referring to this software

x
x window system
x version 11
x window system , version 11
x11

there is no such thing as x windows or x window , despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags. this probably tells you something about how much to trust the trade rags if they ca n't even get the name
of the window system right , why should one trust anything else they have
to say \?

i used to think this way , and not just about x. for example , incorrect
english constructs such as its raining or it 's window id annoy me.
however , there comes a time when popular usage starts to dictate the way
things really are in the world. indeed , the fact that x won out over news
was really down to popular opinion (i know , we all think it 's( ! ) technically
superior as well ! ).

on a related topic , who is to say that color is more or less correct
than colour being irish , and hence using english english as opposed
to american english , i always use the latter except , of course , for api
terms such as xalloccolor and colormap .

in a world that uses the term windows to refer to microsoft windows ,
perhaps the time has come to accept x windows as a valid term for x.
i think that this is a more concise and uncluttered term than , say ,
the x window system and , let 's face it , almost everyone uses it.
ultimately , we all need product sales to more than just x literate
people. in this respect , product recognition is important and a short ,
snappy , descriptive title ( x is positively obscure) will help
when dealing with the average punter (it 's sad i thought i was a
software engineer ! ). indeed it is unfortunate that x did not become
popularly known as windows and let ms worry about whether it should
be called microsoft windows or the microsoft window system or
how about just plain microsoft !

to summarise (or should that be summarize ) the point of this message
i think there are far more pressing issues facing the x community than
worrying about subtle distinctions in the naming of the window system
(or should that be windowing system ). whatever gets recognised is
fine by me. i agree that one should be careful in interpreting what
trade papers say. however , i would be reluctant to come to this
conclusion purely on the basis of how they name the x window system.

xdm is not just an x window client. xdm has its own protocol (xdmcp) that
operates of ucp on port 177. it does provide a login window which is an
x window client. as to using decnet protocol. looking through the source
for xdm from x11r5 that i have here , it seems that the bare bones code is
there but not completely there.


my first inclination is that xdm is not your typical x client. it is making
tcp ip specific socket calls. in this case the answer would be no you can
not run xdm over decnet. is this right or not \? any feedback is appreciated.

from my look at the source , it seems you cannot run it over decnet as shipped

hi , i'm new to this group so please bear with me !

two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. with sunview becoming rapidly obselete , i 've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview.
i put together a quick test , and i 've found that xputimage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average \? ) than the
sunview command pw rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that
(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down or
(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both !

using xputimage , your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server , thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever client server communications
mechanism you are using.

is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps \?
these are maintained by the server , so copying them into a window is
much cheaper.

also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary xsyncs , or running
in xsynchonize mode.

if you need speed , and your client can run on the same host as the x server ,
you should use the shared memory extension to the sample x server (mit shm).
xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this extension. this is certainly
available with the sample mit x server running under sunos.
a word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
memory. and another word of warning openwindows is slower than the mit
server.
i have written an imaging tool (using xview for the gui , by the way) which
yields over 10 frames per second for 512 512 8 bit images , running on a sparc
ipc (half the cpu grunt of an ipx). this has proved quite sufficient for
animations.

tcpview is the result of several problems we had at uw. we have several
network general sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on
several hundred subnets. these are good tools , but they are 1) heavy ,
2) hard to find when you need one , 3) limited in their software expandibility ,
4) difficult to use to upload data for analysis , 5) cannot be remotely
operated , and 6) cannot resolve names with dns , requiring much manual
manipulation of the name table. we also sometimes use tcpdump , but we found
it 1) too difficult for most people , 2) did not have enough information for
many protocols , 3) could not be used interactively , 4) could not handle
tcp streams and 5) could not read sniffer files. however , tcpdump did do
a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols , and could be easily
modified. tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems
by adding a motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features.

tcpview has been tested on a decstation 5000 and sun 4 under ultrix 4.2 and
sunos 4.1 respectively. it should work on the same systems as tcpdump.
it compiles with cc and gcc on the dec and sun. to build tcpview you will
need motif 1.1 or better.

the following files are available for anonymous ftp from
ftp.cac.washington.edu in pub networking

tcpview 1.0.tar.z tcpview and tcpdump source code
tcpview 1.0.sun.tar.z sun4 binaries
tcpview 1.0.dec.tar.z dec mips ultrix 4.2 binaries

what tcpview adds to tcpdump
easier interface
enhanced protocol decoding
hex display of frame
capture based on time , number of frames , or user interrupt
can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer 's name
ethernet address host table
can easily follow a stream , highlighting out of order frames
can send tcp data to an external file or filter for additional
processing.


changes to tcpdump 2.2.1

new features

now reads and writes network general sniffer files. when used with ' r' , the
file type will be automatically detected.

can now read in (and use) an snmp mib file.

the hex format has been changed.

new time options have been added.

options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in tcp packets.

bugs were fixed in the relative tcp sequence numbers. ( s flag)

new flags
r read sniffer file. not usually needed , except for reading from stdin

i 've seen a lot of different terms , which seem to mean the same
thing. who can give an exact definition what these terms mean

) multi screen
) multi headed
) multi display
) x server zaphod mode

as applied to servers , the first three are fuzzy terms. multi headed
tends to be used for any system with multiple monitors , sometimes even
multiple screens even if they 're multiplexed onto the same monitor (eg ,
a sun with a cg4 display). multi screen and multi display would ,
if taken strictly , mean different things , but since the strict meaning
of multi display would refer to a system with multiple keyboards and
pointers , when it 's used it probably refers to the same thing
multi screen would a system that provides multiple screens.

zaphod is a term applied to the way the mit server switches the
pointer from one screen to another by sliding it off the side of the
screen.

is there a limit how many screens displays a single server can handle
(in an articel a read something about an upper limit of 12) \?

there is a protocol limitation that restricts a given display to at
most 255 screens. i know of no server that handles multiple displays
on a single invocation , unless possibly my kludges to the r4 server can
be looked upon as such on a tcp based system there is necessarily a
limit of 65535 displays per machine , but this is not a limitation
inherent to x.

what you read was most likely talking about a limit in some particular
implementation (probably the mit one). if it claimed there was a limit
of 12 inherent to x , the author of the article had no business writing
about x.

slower to load than with sunview. is there a better way to load in the

rgooch@rp.csiro.au (richard gooch) writes
if you need speed , and your client can run on the same host as the x server ,
you should use the shared memory extension to the sample x server (mit shm).
xdpyinfo will tell you if your server has this extension. this is certainly
available with the sample mit x server running under sunos.
a word of warning make sure your kernel is configured to support shared
memory. and another word of warning openwindows is slower than the mit
server.
i have written an imaging tool (using xview for the gui , by the way) which
yields over 10 frames per second for 512 512 8 bit images , running on a sparc
ipc (half the cpu grunt of an ipx). this has proved quite sufficient for
animations.

regards ,

richard gooch....

shared memory putimage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu ,
nick kisseberth) looks interesting , but i need someone to point me to some
documentation. is this method likely to give better results than server
resident pixmaps \? i 'd also be interested in looking at the xview code
mentioned above...

thanks for the help so far. if i get something decent put together , i 'll
definitely post it to the net.


the mit tapes come with documentation written by keith packard on the shared
memory extension to x. look in mit doc extensions mit shm.ms
i found this invaluble. unfortunately , there is a bit of work to set up the
shared memory segments , making an ximage from it , etc. also , there is an
extension query to determine if the server supports it , but you still need to
test if the server is running on the same host and if shared memory is enabled
in the kernel. i have written layers of convience routines which make all this
transparent.
as for the xview code , well , i doubt that would be considered interesting.
the interesting stuff is done in a c object library. people interested in this
code can email me.

subject 7) how do i ask a net question so as to maximize helpful responses \?

when asking for help on the net or x mailing lists , be sure to include
all information about your setup and what you are doing. the more specific you
are , the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing. without
all the details , people who want to help you often have to guess if they are
able to respond at all.

always mention what version of x you are using and where you got it
from. if your server came from a different source as the rest of your x system ,
give details of that , too. give the machine type , operating system , and o s
version for both the client and server machine. it may also be appropriate to
mention the window manager , compiler , and display hardware type you are using.

then tell exactly what you are doing , exactly what happens , and what
you expected wanted to happen. if it is a command that fails , include the
exact transcript of your session in the message. if a program you wrote
does n't work the way you expect , include as little of the source necessary
(just a small test case , please ! ) for readers to reproduce the problem.

subject 9) what are these common abbreviations acronyms \?

xt the x toolkit intrinsics is a library layered on xlib which
provides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. an xt based
program is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses
intrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.

useful in building various applications and widgets.
xaw the athena widget set is the mit implemented sample widget set
distributed with x11 source.
xm the osf motif widget set from the open software foundation binary
kits are available from many hardware vendors.
xhp (xw) the hewlett packard widget set was originally based on r2 ,

subject 10) what is the icccm \? (how do i write x friendly applications \? )

the inter client communication conventions manual is one of the
official x consortium standards documents that define the x environment. it
describes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with
other clients sharing the same server. if you are writing x clients , you need
to read and understand the icccm , in particular the sections discussing the
selection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window
manager. get it either
as part of the r4 distribution from mit
in the later editions of the scheifler gettys x window system book
as an appendix in the new version of o'reilly 's volume 0 , x protocol
reference manual. a version in old copies of their volume 1 is obsolete.
the version in the digital press book is much more readable , thanks to
the efforts of digital press 's editors to improve the english and the
presentation.

from david rosenthal , 10 90

the icccm was updated for r5 updates are published in o'reilly 's
programmer 's supplement for release 5 . the complete document is on the r5
tapes.

alternate definition the icccm is generally the m in rtfm and is
the most important of the least read x documents.


subject 11) what is the x consortium , and how do i join \?

the mit x consortium was formed in january of 1988 to further the
development of the x window system and has as its major goal the promotion of
cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software
interfaces at all layers in the x window system environment.
mit 's role is to provide the vendor neutral architectural and
administrative leadership required to make this work. membership in the
consortium open to any organization. there are two categories of membership ,
member (for large organizations) and affiliate (for smaller organizations).
most of the consortium 's activities take place via electronic mail ,
with meetings when required. as designs and specifications take shape ,
interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.
typically a small multi organization architecture team leads the design , with
others acting as close observers and reviewers. once a complete specification
is produced , it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium
as a proposed standard. the standards process typically includes public
review (outside the consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.
your involvement in the public review process or as a member or
affiliate of the consortium is welcomed.

subject 12) just what are open look and motif \?

open look and motif are two graphical user interfaces (guis). open look
was developed by sun with help from at t and many industry reviewers motif was
developed by the open software foundation (osf) with input from many osf
members.

open look is primarily a user interface specification and style guide
there are several toolkits which can be used to produce open look applications.
motif includes an api specification the only sanctioned motif toolkit is the
one from osf. however , there are other toolkits which can be used to produce
programs which look and behave like osf motif one of these , parcplace 's
(formerly solbourne 's) oi , is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the
style of open look and motif , at the user 's choice.

open look gui is also the name of a product from at t , comprising
their open look intrinsics toolkit and a variety of applications.

subject 13) just what is openwindows \?

open windows (3.0) is a sun product that encompasses a window system
that combines a news and x11 compliant server (x news) a user interface
specification (open look) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including
the sunview like xview and the xt based olit) xlib and xt implementations and
a number of utilities (olwm window manager , filemgr , shelltool , etc.).

decwindows is a dec product that encompasses an x11 server the xui
toolkit , including the dwt widget set and uil xlib and xt implementations a
session manager and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager , dxcalendar ,
dxpsview , etc.).

(at some point motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)

subject 15) what is pex \?

pex is the phigs extension to x .
phigs stands for programmer 's hierarchical interactive graphics
system and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation
and manipulation of 3d graphics. many platforms are capable of performing in
hardware the computations involved in rendering 3d objects the extension
allows the client (phigs in this case) to take advantage of the specialized
hardware for 3d graphics.
sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely
redistributable (copyright similar to the current x copyright) sample
implementation. source and documentation are available in the r5 release.
several vendors are currently selling independently developed pex servers for
their workstations and x terminals.

subject 16) what is low bandwidth x (lbx) \? xremote \? ppp \? slip \? cslip \?

there are several options for using x over serial lines

slip serial line ip this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip
packets over point to point serial links. it has been around for several years ,
and implementations are available for many of the major tcp ip implementations.
most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item , although nobody really
ever uses it since it is horribly slow. the tcp ip headers add 40 bytes per
packet and the tcp ip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose (rightfully
so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high speed links).

cslip compressed header slip this is a variant of slip that compresses the
40 bytes of tcp ip headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes. it still does n't do
anything about reencoding the x protocol. modems that do compression can help ,
but they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed
data through typical serial interfaces , plus the compression assembly time).

ppp point to point protocol this is an emerging standard for point to point
links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than
slip. a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial
line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for
running normal tcp ip protocols over serial lines. running raw x over the wire
still needs compression somewhere to make it usable.

xremote this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally
developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines. in addition
to using a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp cslip , xremote removes
redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and
using lzw to compress the entire data stream. this work is done by either a
pseudo x server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server. there
are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem
(1) you do n't have to have compressing modems in there if you would n't
otherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly
connected) , and
(2) it reduces the i o overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that
have to cross the serial interface , and
(3) in addition to the effects of 2 , it reduces the latency in delivering
packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for
blocks to compress.

lbx low bandwidth x this is an x consortium project that is working on a
standard for this area. it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using
ncd 's xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol. lbx
will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonly used information
(e.g. connection setup data , large window properties , font metrics , keymaps ,
etc.) and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol. the hope is to have a
standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample
implementation available in r6.

additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how
lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu
in contrib in the following files
xremote slides.ps slides describing xremote
xremote lbx diffs.ps more slides describing some of lbx

the 7th mit x technical conference.


subject 17) topic using x in day to day life

subject 18) ! what are all these different window managers \?

the window manager in x is just another client it is not part of the
x window system , although it enjoys special privileges and so there is
no single window manager instead , there are many which support different ways
for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout ,
decoration , and keyboard and colormap focus. in approximate chronological order
(generally , the more recent ones are more conformant with the icccm)

wm this simple title bar window manager was phased out in r2 or r3
uwm the universal window manager is still popular for its speed ,
although it is very outdated. moved to contrib on the r4 tape.
twm (old) tom 's window manager was among the first non mit window
managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a
re parenting window manager.
awm the ardent window manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers
some features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers
cwm cwm is part of the andrew system.
rtl siemen 's window manager tiles windows so that they do n't overlap
and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.
dxwm digital 's dxwm is part of the decwindows offering
hpwm hp 's window manager offers a 3d look it is a precursor of mwm
mwm the motif window manager is part of the osf motif toolkit
tekwm tektronix 's window manager offering
olwm (sun) olwm implements the open look gui and some of the style
guide functionality
olwm (at t) ditto
gwm bull 's generic window manager emulates others with a built in
lisp interpreter. version 1.7h (10 91) is on the r5 contrib tape 1.7n is on
avahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. 3 93
m swm the sigma window manager is on the r4 tape
pswm sun 's postscript based pswm is part of the openwindows release
swm solbourne 's swm is based on the oi toolkit and offers multiple
gui support and also a panned virtual window configuration information comes
from the resources file
twm (new) mit 's new tab window manager from the r4 tape is a reworked
twm and is the basis for several derivatives , including the one on the r5 tape
vtwm vtwm offers some of the virtual desktop features of swm , with a
single root window implementation it is based on the r4 twm and is available
on archive servers. a new version , vtwm 5.0 , is based on r5.9 and is available
from export. 3 92
tvtwm tom 's virtual tab window manager is also based on the r4 twm
and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual root window of swm. it is
available on archive servers
olvwm the vtwm style virtual desktop added to sun 's olwm. it is
available on archive servers version 3.3 1 93 is on export.
mvwm the vtwm style virtual desktop added to osf 's mwm. a beta version
is floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a
source license to osf motif 1.1.3 3 92 .
ncdwm the window manager local to ncd terminals offers an mwm look
xdswm the window manager local to visual technology 's terminals
ctwm claude lecommandeur 's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the r5
twm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of hp vuewm source is on export.
version 2.2.2 2 93 also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.
vuewm hp 's mwm based window manager offers configurable workspaces.
4dwm sgi 's enhanced mwm
piewm this version of tvtwm offers pie menus


subject 19) why does my x session exit when i kill my window manager (sic) \?

it need n't. what is probably happening is that you are running your
window manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file your x
session runs only as long as the last job is running , and so killing your
window manager is equivalent to logging out. instead , run the window manager in
the background , and as the last job instead invoke something safe like
exec xterm name login rv iconic
or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.
your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window ,
whether or not you kill or restart your window manager.


subject 20) can i save the state of my x session , like toolplaces does \?

although no known window manager directly supports such a feature
which may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the
geometry and wm command of each application (but olvwm may have something
close) there is a contributed application which does much of what you are
looking for , although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces.
look for the application xplaces on an archive server near you. there are
several versions of this program floating around look for a recent vintage.
10 90
some new pseudo session managers such as hp 's vuewm provide for the
saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently running
applications and the resource database.
bjxrn stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no) 3 93.


subject 21) how do i use another window manager with dec 's session manager \?

dec 's session manager will start dxwm up by default. to override this ,
add to your .xdefaults file something like this line , naming the full pathname
sm.windowmanagername wherever usr bin x11 your favorite wm


subject 22) how do i change the keyboard auto repeat rate \?

you can turn auto repeat on or off by using xset r on off . the x
protocol , however , does n't provide for varying the auto repeat rate , which is
a capability not supported by all systems.
some servers running on systems that support this , however , may provide
command line flags to set the rate at start up time. if you have control over
server start up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm) , you can invoke the
server with the chosen settings for example , you can start the xsun server
from mit with the options ar1 350 ar2 30 to reduce the sensitivity of the
keyboard.


subject 23) how do i remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string \?

there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be
produced when you press a particular key. the xmodmap client , which is useful
for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places , just rearranges keys and
does not do macro expansion.
some (few) clients , including xterm and several x based editors ,
accept a translation resource such as
xterm vt100.translations override
key f1 string( setenv display unix 0 )
which permits the shorthand f1 to be pressed to reset the display locally
within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients. to include control
characters in the string , use nnn , where nnn is the octal encoding of the
control character you want to include.
window managers , which could provide this facility , do not yet nor
has a special remapper client been made available.

environment

i bring up x server using 'startx' and usr bin x11 xsun. the following sequence
of actions crashes the x server (sigpipe , errno 32 , 'xinit' reports that connexion
to x server lost)

1. xinit xsun
2. start mwm
3. start a client with a 100dpi 75dpi font.
4. move the window by dragging the title bar.

the server dumps core due to sigpipe. one of the two messages is printed

connection to x server lost

or

connection broken (errno 32)

(i believe the first is reported by a client and the second by the server itself).

next , i ran xdm in debug level 5. after the same set of actions , xdm reports

select returns 1
server for 0 terminated unexpectedly status 2560


note
the problem does n't occur with other window managers (twm or olwm).
i have not set ld library path.
i am not running font server.
if i start the client with fixed width font , i do not see this problem.
my font path
usr lib x11 fonts misc , usr lib x11 fonts speedo , usr lib x11 fonts 75dpi , usr lib x11 fonts 100dpi

(i did mkfontdir in usr lib x11 fonts 100dpi , usr lib x11 fonts 75dpi ,
usr lib x11 fonts pex , usr lib x11 fonts speedo ,
and in usr lib x11 fonts misc).

this problem seems to occur only on ipx machines. i do not see this
problem on ipc workstations.

questions
what the hell is goin on \? )
what does status 2560 mean (of the server).

i 'd greatly appreciate any hints as to the cause of the problem.

hi xperts ,

this is a repost (no one responded to my desperate yell 8 (
i ca n't believe there is no xview wizards any more 8 )...

i'm using sliders in my xview apps , usually with editable numeric
field. but i seem to have no control over the length of this field.
in some apps it appears long enough to keep several characters ,
in some it cannot keep even the maximum value set by
panel max value !

as i understand , panel value display length , which controls
number of characters to be displayed in text items , does n't
work in the case of slider , despite the fact that panel.h
contains the following bit

panel multiline text item , panel numeric text item ,
panel slider item and panel text item attributes

panel notify level panel attr(attr enum , 152) ,
panel value display length panel attr(attr int , 182) ,

which gives a hint that this attribute can be used for sliders.
but 1) setting this attribute gives nothing , and 2) xv get'ting
this attribute gives warning bad attribute , and returns value 0.

strange thing is that dec 's port of xview gives plenty of space
in a text fields , but not sun 's xview...

can someone share his experience in managing sliders in xview with me ,
and clear this problem \?

any help is very much appreciated.

cutsie little macintrash like icons that are an instant recipe for
mousitis imho. system 7 is undoubtedly the worst gui i have used (out of
that , riscos , mswombles , and x11) simply because it does not provide enough
keyboard shortcuts. windows i must confess i quite like (cover your ears
) ) because you can actually use it without having to ever touch the
mouse.
stuff delete
the user rather than making things easier and there should always be
the option to do it your way if you want to , which is why i like the
unix x combination so much it 's so customizable.

hear ! hear ! i agree completely. one thing i ca n't stand about
the mac interface is its shear determination to force you to use
the mouse(what if your mouse breaks your whole system is
down ! ). i like the mouse it is handy on some occassions such
as cut and past and moving icons around , etc. but for most
work , the keyboard and hot keys are 10 20 times faster than
using the mouse. sure it is a plus to be able to do something
simple if you are an inexperienced user , but how long is it
before your are experienced \? a month \? two \? (speaking of pcs at
the moment.)
i do n't think it is too much to ask that window
programmers provide not only a menu mouse interface but also
look forward to those who would like to move on to hot keys and
command line interfaces , which usually allows you to do more in
less time if you are experienced.
all of the above equally applies to windowing systems on
unix (especially since unix is at least 500 more powerful than
dos).

bad idea. using usr 5bin echo is slower than the built in echo.
this is what i do. it does execute `hostname` once per shell window ,
and does read in one extra file. but manipluating the titles does not
require executing extra programs.

oh yes , it does execute some programs once per each system.
but it stores them in a file for the next time...

setenv hostname `hostname`

figure how how to generate escape , bell ,

one ca n't. the application may not have been started from a terminal
emulator if it was , the terminal emulator may not still exist , and if
it does it may be in no condition to be pop ped to the top (eg , it
may be iconified). and even if you can , it may not do what you want
consider a virtual root window manager like tvtwm , with the relevant
window in a portion of the virtual desktop that 's outside the real
desktop.

some (but not all) x terminal emulators provide environment variables
giving a window id. even if such a thing is present in the
environment , it may not be what you want it may correspond to a window
on a different server , for example.

it might be that the x terminal does n't support the postscript

forgive me if this is a faq (i have checked the list but i cant find it).

i have a problem with the cursor within xterm on mono (not grayscale monitors)
the problem is that when i have an character application that displays input
fields in reverse video the xterm text cursor gets lost on the edge of the
input field.

the solution would appear to be to set the xterm cursor to a line rather
than a block , but how do you do this. i ca n't find any means although
various sources seem to indicate it can be done.

when the xterm loses the input focus the cursor becomes an outlined block.
this would also be preferable but i ca n't seem to force this to be the
default either.

configuration is motorola 88k x11r4

please reply by email if poss.

thank you

look up xv depth. also , you might want to try using xview colormap segments
instead of xlib for your colormap stuff. they will probably be easier
for you to use , and since you are using a truecolor visual , you wo n't
be losing anything compared to straight xlib.

g'day

windows nt is a step forward , but not by much. i guess for dos users who
think multi tasking is really neat (add puke here) and are overjoyed to
be able to use more than 64k of memory , its a major improvement. for windows
users its more like an upgrade with facilities most unix users take for
granted. most of windows users only use pcs for text processing or running
3rd party applications anyway so the operating system features are not even
a real issue. my ideal operating system

binary compatible across all plaforms. it should recognize
binaries and configure on the fly , so i do n't have to have
bin mac bin dos bin dec bin sun bin hp etc...

multi cpu. so i can use the cpus on my pc and w s and mac
and transputers and dsps. i do n't know a single site which
has gone for a single vendor. i am not going to trade in
80mflops per h1 transputer or ultra fast fft on dsp chips.
note nt runs on symmetric multi cpu systems.

built in portable gui graphics tools. you can call drawbutton
or drawline and it does the same thing no matter what platform
or display. it should also translate graphics commands on the fly.
so i can use pc graphics s w on my workstation and x software on
my pc. i think guis are not just nice to have but essential.

configurable front end. so you can make it look like unix or dos
or nt or os 2 , and run shell scripts or command bat files.

object oriented. so i can program easily under it and not have
to re invent the wheel if the networking is not up to scratch
or my application needs to access source object code on the fly.

in other words it should have some ai capability. that and a tight , clean
kernel so you can actually understand it. anyone know of something like this \?

berry@durian.citr.uq.oz.au (andrew berry) writes

my impression is that most people use motif because their os vendor
supplies it with x (sunos users excluded) , and because it is similar in
look and feel to ms windows and os 2 pm. personally , i also prefer
the look and feel of motif (no flames please just an opinion).

seeing as motif has been adopted by sun , ibm , hp (ca n't remeber the
other members in the recent announcement) , i'm sure you 'll see it on
virtually every workstation (ie. sun , ibm , hp and dec must make up the
vast majority of all hardware).


i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif , particularly from the
point of view of writing and obtaining free software. as the linux and
386bsd communities grow , however , i think that motif will lose some of
its grip , at least in the non commercial marketplace.


ports of motif to both 386bsd and linux are available for a fee of about
100. this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute. the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups
pertaining to motif has been high.


i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial
and non commercial software (ie. you will only get free software using
athena or openlook widget sets , and only get commercial software using
the motif widget sets).


i ca n't see why. if just about every workstation will come with motif
by default and you can buy it for under 100 for the free unix
platforms , i ca n't see this causing major problems.


side note

all the x based code i am writing (and will distribute freely when
completed) is based on motif because from a programmatic and also look
and feel point of view i like it the best (no flames on this one
please).

this article does not include answers to general x questions , since these
are already covered by the x faq that is regularly posted by david b. lewis
faq craft@uunet.uu.net .

if you have anything to add or change on the faq just let me know.
(especially if you had a problem that someone else was able to help you with)
send changes to steve@ecf.toronto.edu , please put 'faq' somewhere
in the subject line so that my mail filter will put it in the correct
mail folder.

please do not ask me questions that are not answered in the faq. i do not
have time to respond to these individually. instead , post your question
to the net , and send me the question and answer together when you get it.

frequently asked questions about x on intel based unix (with answers)


i) what options do i have for x software on my intel based unix system \?

1. free options
the best option is xfree86 , which is an enhanced version of x386 1.2.
any other version of x386 will have slower performance , and will
be more difficult to compile. information on how to obtain xfree86
is listed below.

x386 is the port of the x11 server to system v 386 that was
done by thomas roell (roell@sgcs.com).
it supports a wide variety of svga boards.
there are 2 major free versions x386 1.1 is based on x11r4 ,
x386 1.2 is included in mit 's x11r5 distribution (ie. you
do n't need to patch it into the mit source any more).
x386 1.3 is the current commercial offering from sgcs (see below).

ii) what is xfree86 and where do i get it \?

3. what is xfree86 \?

xfree86 is an enhanced version of x386 1.2 , which was distributed with
x11r5. this release consists of many bug fixes , speed improvements , and
other enhancements. here are the highlights of the enhancements

1) the speedup package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfree86 ,
selectable at run time via the xconfig file. some speedups require
an et4000 based svga , and others require a virtual screen width of
1024. the speedups suitable to the configuration are selected by
default. with a high quality et4000 board (vram) , this can yield
up to 40 improvement of the xstones benchmark over x386 1.2.
2) the fx386 packages from jim tsillas are included as the default
operating mode if speedup is not selected. this mode is now
equivalent in performance to x386 1.1b (x11r4) , and approximately
20 faster than x386 1.2.
3) support for localconn , compile time selectable for server , clients ,
or both. this support is for both svr3.2 and svr4. for svr4.0.4
with the 'advanced compatibility package' , local connections from
sco xsight odt clients are supported.
4) drivers for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipsets.
refer to the files readme.ati and readme.trident for details about
the ati and trident drivers.
5) support for compressed bitmap fonts has been added (thomas eberhardt 's
code from the contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu).
6) type1 font code from mit contrib tape has been included , and is
compile time selectable. there are contributed type1 fonts in the
contrib directory on export.lcs.mit.edu.
7) new configuration method which allows the server 's drivers and font
renderers to be reconfigured from both source and binary
distributions.
8) integrated support for 386bsd , mach , and linux.
9) a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga
cards is now included.

the following key features were added with the release of xfree86 1.2
(they were not in xfree86 1.1)

1) the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank switching of
available svga memory to allow virtual screens up to 1600x1200
(see the x386(1) manual page for more information).
2) support for the hercules mono card has been added to the
monochrome server , and with it the ability to support a two
headed server one vga , and one hercules. so far this has only
been tested on svr4 (it is also reported to work under linux).
3) svr3 shared libraries , tested under isc svr3 2.2 and 3.0.1.
4) support for svr4.2 (there are some special considerations to
consider , due to new usl bugs see the readme.svr4 file for
more information.)
5) support for ps 2 mice , and logitech mouseman trackman (some
versions of these devices were not previously compatible).
6) a new tutorial on how to develop correct video card and monitor
timing data , written by eric raymond (derived from previous
documentation and a lot of experimentation).
7) greatly improved support for international keyboards , including
implementation of the compose key functionality found on many
vendor servers (see the x386keybd(1) manual page for more
information).
8) the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has
been improved , and the timings are now stored at accuracies of
0.1 mhz. users may want to consider removing an existing clocks
line from their xconfig file and re probing using the new server.
9) many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig
configuration file. error messages are much more informative
and intuitive , and more validation is done. there are many new
options that can be enabled in the xconfig file (see the x386(1)
manual page for more information on the format of this file).

plus a number of other small things. refer to the changelog file
in the source distribution for full details.

also included are a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond , and the
current x386 mode database and a sample xdm configuration by david wexelblat.

4. what oss are supported \?

xfree86 supports
svr4.2 consensys v4.2
svr4.0 microport , dell , esix , isc , at t , mst , consensys , uhc
svr3 isc 2.2 3.0 , at t 2.2
linux , mach 386 , 386bsd 0.1

bsd 386 is not supported , but it should work. the most active
bsd 386 person is greg lehey grog@lemis.de .

note that esix 3.2d and sco are not supported yet ,
but anyone should feel free to submit patches.
if you are interested in tackling this , send mail to
xfree86@physics.su.oz.au

5. what video hardware is supported \?

at this time , xfree86 1.2 supports the following svga chipsets

tseng et4000
tseng et3000
paradise pvga1
western digital wd90c00 , wd90c10 , wd90c11 (these are supersets of
the pvga1 , and use its driver)
genoa gvga
trident tvga8900c , tvga9000
ati 18800 , 28800

all of the above are supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes ,
with the exception of the ati chipsets , which are only supported in
256 color mode.

the monochrome server also supports generic vga cards , using 64k of
video memory in a single bank , and the hercules card. on the
et3000 , only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome
server , and the gvga has not been tested with more than 64k.

it appears that some of the svga card manufacturers are going to
non traditional mechanisms for selecting pixel clock frequencies. to
avoid having to modify the server to accommodate these schemes xfree86
1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel
clock. this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms are
discovered. refer to the readme.clkprog file for information on how
these programs work , if you need to write one. if you do develop such
a program , the xfree86 team would be interested in including it with
future xfree86 releases.

if you are purchasing new hardware for the purpose of using xfree86 ,
it is suggested that you purchase an et4000 based board such as the
orchid prodesigner iis. avoid recent diamond boards xfree86 will not
work with them , because diamond wo n't provide programming details.
in fact , the xfree86 project is actively not supporting new diamond
products , as long as such policies remain in effect. contributions
of code will not be accepted (because of the potential liabilities).
if you would like to see this change , tell diamond about it.

some people have asked if xfree86 would work with local bus or eisa
video cards. theoretically , the means of communication between the
cpu and the video card is irrelevant to xfree86 compatibility. it
could be isa , eisa , or local bus. what should matter is the chipset
on the video card. unfortunately , the developers do n't have a lot
of access to eisa or vlb machines , so this is largely an untested
theory. however , we have yet to see any reports of things not
working on one of these buses and we have several reports of xfree86
working fine on them.

6. what about accelerated boards \?

at this time , there is no support in xfree86 for accelerated boards
like the s3 , ati ultra (8514 a) , tiga , etc. this support is available
in commercial products from sgcs and metrolink (for svr3 and svr4).

an s3 server is available for 386bsd and linux. contact
hasty@netcom.com for 386bsd or jon@robots.ox.ac.uk for linux.

a beta 8514 a server is available for linux. contact martin@cs.unc.edu
or jon@robots.ox.ac.uk . note these servers are not part of xfree86.

7. why does n't xfree86 support 16 color vga modes \?

the reason that this is not supported is the way vga implements the
16 color modes. in 256 color modes , each byte of frame buffer memory
contains 1 pixel. but the 16 color modes are implemented as bit
planes. each byte of frame buffer memory contains 1 bit from each
of each of 8 pixels , and there are four such planes. the mit frame
buffer code is not designed to deal with this. if vga handled
16 color modes by packing 2 4 bit pixels into each byte , the mit code
could be modified to support this (or it already may i'm not sure).
but for the vga way of doing things , a complete new frame buffer
implementation is required. some beta testers are looking into this ,
but nothing is yet available from the project.

8. what other hardware or software requirements are there \?

obviously , a supported svga board and os are required. to run
x efficiently , 12 16mb of memory should be considered a minimum.
the various binary releases take 10 40mb of disk space , depending
on the os (e.g. whether or not it supports shared libraries).
to build from sources , at least 80mb of free disk space will
be required , although 120mb should be considered a comfortable
lower bound.

9. where can i get source for xfree86 \?

source patches for the current version (1.2 , based on x11r5 pl22
from mit) , are available via anonymous ftp from
export.lcs.mit.edu (under contrib xfree86)
ftp.physics.su.oz.au (under xfree86)
ftp.win.tue.nl (under pub xfree86)
(for the rest of this faq , these 3 location will be called ftp)

refer to the readme file under the specified directory for information
on which files you need to get to build your distribution.

10. where can i get binaries for xfree86 \?

binaries are available via anonymous ftp from
ftp.physics.su.oz.au svr4 binaries
under xfree86 svr4
ftp.win.tue.nl svr4 binaries
under pub xfree86 svr4
ferkel.ucsb.edu svr4 binaries
under pub svr4 xfree86
stasi.bradley.edu svr4 binaries
under pub xfree86 svr4
blancmange.ma.utexas.edu svr3 (isc) binaries
under pub isc
ftp.prz.tu berlin.de svr3 (isc) binaries
under pub pc isc xfree86
tsx 11.mit.edu linux binaries
under pub linux packages x11
agate.berkeley.edu 386bsd binaries
under pub 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86
ftp.cs.uwm.edu mach binaries
under i386

ensure that you are getting xfree86 1.2 some of these sites may
archive older releases as well. each binary distribution will
contain a readme file that describes what files you need to take
from the archive , and which compile time option selections were
made when building the distribution.

iv) what general things should i know about running xfree86 \?

11. installation directories

the top level installation directory is specified by the projectroot
( usr x386 , by default) variable in config site.def. binaries , include
files , and libraries are installed in projectroot bin , include , lib .

this can be changed when rebuilding from sources , and can be modified
via symbolic links for those oss that support them. this directory is
nonstandard , and was chosen this way to allow xfree86 to be installed
alongside a commercial vendor supplied x implementation.

12. configuration files

the xfree86 server reads a configuration file ( xconfig ) on startup.
the search path , contents and syntax for this file are documented in
the server manpage , which should be consulted before asking questions.

13. determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes

david e wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att.com) maintains a database of known
clock settings for vga cards and monitor settings.
the database is installed in usr x386 lib x11 etc modedb.txt , and
is in the source tree under mit server ddx x386 etc. this database is
also available from him (for the latest copy) , and is kept on
export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib x386.modedb.z , which is updated
occasionally. obtain a copy of this database. it just might have the
settings you need. if you create new settings , please send them to
david for inclusion in the database.

if this does n't help you , the videomodes.doc (by eric raymond) file
with xfree86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.
it may be helpful to start with settings that almost work , and use
this description to get them right. when you do , send the information
to david wexelblat for inclusion in the database.

note the old 'clock.exe' program is not supported any more , and
is completely unnecessary. if you need to determine dot
clock values for a new board , remove the 'clocks' line from
your xconfig file (if present) , and start the server. the
server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.
you can use these values to put a 'clocks' line into your
xconfig file , which is not necessary , but will speed up
starting the server in the future.

14. rebuilding reconfiguring the server from the link kit

if you have installed the server binary link kit , it is possible to
reconfigure the drivers and font renderers in the server. this is
fully explained in the readme file that is available with the link kit.

v) what os specific things should i know about running xfree86 \?

first of all , the server must be installed suid root (mode 4755).

15. svr4
why wo n't my xterm run properly \?

if your kernel is not built with the consem module , you should define
consem no in you environment. otherwise xterm wo n't run.
csh users should use 'setenv consem no'

the esix console driver patch 403019 is known to cause keymapping
problems with xfree86. it recommended that this patch not be
installed. alternatively they keymap can be fixed with xmodmap.

16. svr3

make sure you look at ftp readme.isc , if that 's what you are running.

17. 386bsd

make sure you look at ftp readme.386bsd.

also , a separate 386bsd faq is maintained by richard murphey
rich@rice.edu . the latest version should be available in the
file xfree86 1.2 386bsd faq at the following ftp sites

agate.berkeley.edu pub 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86 1.2
wuarchive.wustl.edu mirrors4 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86 1.2
grasp1.univ lyon1.fr pub 386bsd 0.1 ports xfree86 1.2

18. linux

you must be running linux 0.97pl4 or greater , and have the 4.1 gcc
jump libraries installed.

make sure the binaries x386 , x386mono , xload and xterm are setuid root.

if your kernel does n't have tcp support compiled in , you 'll have to
run the server as x pn . the default startup configuration assumes
that tcp is not available. if it is , change the two files
usr x386 bin startx and usr x386 lib x11 xdm xservers , removing the
pn argument to x386.

make sure dev console is either a link to dev tty0 or has the major
number 4 , minor number 0. also note that if dev console is not
owned by the user running x , then xconsole and xterm will not permit
console output redirection. xdm will properly change the owner , but
startx wo n't.

when running xdm from rc.local , you will need to provide it with
a tty , for example xdm dev console .

for more detailed information , please read the file readme present
with the distribution on tsx 11.mit.edu.

19. mach

make sure you look at ftp readme.mach.

vi) what things should i know for building xfree86 from source \?

this section has been removed from the faq , since it is
fully explained in ftp readme and the os specific readmes.
please look at those files for information on building xfree86.

vii) is there anything special about building clients with xfree86 \?

20. bsd compatibility library

a lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy() , etc.
the default configuration files are set up to link with libxbsd.a
which contains emulation for bcopy() , bzero() , bcmp() , ffs() , random() ,
seed(). a better way of providing the 'b' functions is to include
x11 xfuncs.h in source files that call them. xfuncs.h provides macro
definitions for these in terms of the sysv 'mem' functions. if you are
linking with a vendor supplied library which calls some of these
functions , then you should link with libxbsd.a

21. ansiccoptions

this is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the
ansi ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to rewrite
the entire ccoptions line. for example , with stock mit , you 'd see
something like
ccoptions ansi o2 fwritable strings
and to get rid of the ansi ness , the developer would have to put
ccoptions o2 fwritable strings
in his imakefile. with this change , you would see a default of
ansiccoptions ansi
ccoptions o2 fwritable strings
and all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is
ansiccoptions
to get rid of the ansi ness (many x clients will die a horrible death
with ansi). the effect is even more dramatic in practice , because
ccoptions is actually quite complex. the other issue is that one must
add 'ansiccoptions (ansiccoptions)' to a passcdebugflags definition.

when some types of client windows are displayed , parts of the windows
are in the wrong color if the window is moved slightly , forcing the server
to repaint it , it is repainted in the correct colors. it does n't happen

i have the exact same problem when running hewlett packard 's microwave design
system (mds) from an hp 380 unix box and running macx 1.2 , sys 7.0.1 .
normally , mds draws a window with a deep blue backround , but occasionally
it becomes a light blue and all the text , etc , inside the window become
washed out (nearly invisible). i thought that it was just something
brain dead that i was doing or a subtle conflict with another app or init.

by slightly moving the window , and forcing a re draw , the colors get corrected.

sorry , but olwm and tvtwm do n't do it. they place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

currently , my solution is

xcreatewindow(...)
xsetwmproperties(..)
xmapwindow(...)
xflush(...)
xmovewindow(...)


it works with olwm , but is less than elegant. all this leaves me wondering
if i'm overlooking something obvious.

richard.


i know that the mwm has an resource to specify if positions are to be used for
the border of a window or for the user window. maybe other window managers
have similar options.
another way to figure out the difference between the user window position
and the window manager decoration window position is to subtract their
positions. you just have to use xquerytree and remember that the window manager
decorations window is the parent of your window. unfortunately , you can only
figure out the decoration width and height after the window has been mapped
this way.

can be either public domain or commercial , although a commercial package
ca n't have royalties required for binary only distribution. we need 2 d
graphing capabilities at a minimum , but 3 d would be nice. any info would
be appreciated and i will summarize if there is interest.

any hints greatly appreciated ! please reply via e mail.

they are n't functions , they are character arrays. the standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
xtshellstrings and xtstrings determined by xtstringdefines. your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other. it is probably worth
adding dxtstringdefines to your cflags.

dear sgi and netter gl x mixed model experts ,
i am writing a mixed model application that creates a couple different
color maps for different windows , and i 've been having trouble getting
the window manager to reliably honor my requests. in some environments
(entry level r3000 indigo w 4.0.5) all windows are getting properly
connected to their designated color maps , but on others (an iris 4d 240 gtx
also a different entry level indigo) the color mapping is unreliable
and changes behavior when i compile at different times. the most common
problem is that all non top level windows fail to be displayed according
to their colormap. my application starts out by creating three top level
windows in some cases all but the first of these also fail to be
displayed by their colormap. this is spectacularly aggravating.

i would dearly appreciate
1. an explanation of the standard , right , correct way to give a window
a colormap such that the window manager will honor and obey it

2. any advice about problems that could cause my failure to get my
desired colormaps.

by now i have exhausted my own attempts on this , having tried everything
reasonable or imaginable.

below is example code giving the schematic for how i have been trying
to do this. please , please , please somebody tell me what i am doing
wrong how to do it right ! ! !

nntp posting host carol.fwi.uva.nl

greetings ,


i am using an x server that provides 3 visuals
pseudocolor 8 bit , truecolor 24 bit and directcolor 24 bit.

a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is tc24).

in the xlib reference guide from 'o reilly one can read in the
section about xcteatewindow , something like
in the current implementation of x11 when using a visual other than the
parent 's , be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap which is to be used
in the window attributes when creating , or else a badmatch occurs.

this warning , strangely enough , is only mentioned in the newer editions
of the x11r5 guides.

however , even if i pass along a suitable colourmap , i still get a badmatch
when i create a window with a non default visual.
the code looks like this

cut here and you 'll destroy your crt

window create 8bit window on truecolour display(dpy , width , height)
display dpy
int width , height

window win
xvisualinfo vinfo
xsetwindowattributes attr

fprintf(stderr , opening 8 bit window... n )
if ( ! xmatchvisualinfo(dpy , defaultscreen(dpy) , 8 , pseudocolor , vinfo))
fprintf(stderr , your display ca n't handle 8 bit pseudocolor. n )
exit(1)

fprintf(stderr , using visual x n , vinfo.visual visualid)
cmap xcreatecolormap(
dpy ,
defaultrootwindow(dpy) ,
vinfo.visual ,
allocnone
)
xsync(dpy , false)
xinstallcolormap(dpy , cmap) ommision of this line gives same result

10 , 10 ,
width , height ,
copyfromparent , border width
8 , depth
inputoutput , class
vinfo.visual , visual
cwcolormap ,
attr
)
return win


cut here and you 'll destroy your crt

executing this piece of code results in a badmatch error.
anybody who knows why \?
if so , please drop me a line.



take care ,

x
it is x window.

no , it is n't. it is the x window system , or x11 , or x or any of
a number of other designations accepted by the x consortium. in fact ,
doing man x on pretty much any x11 machine will tell you

the x consortium requests that the following names be used
when referring to this software

x
x window system
x version 11
x window system , version 11
x11

there is no such thing as x windows or x window , despite the repeated
misuse of the forms by the trade rags. this probably tells you something
about how much to trust the trade rags if they ca n't even get the name
of the window system right , why should one trust anything else they have
to say \?

with regard to dialup x11 implementations , there are several. you can
buy serial x11 terminals from a couple of companies , including both
graphon and ncd. (in fact , i'm composing this from an ncd running x11
over serial lines across 14.4 kbaud connection.)

ncd also sells a software only package that provides xremote (which is
ncd 's implementation of serial x11) for pc 's. there may be other such
software packages available.

x11r6 is supposed to include a standardized compression scheme for running
x11 over low speed connections. it 's called low bandwidth x (lbx) , and
is based on improved versions of the techniques used in ncd 's xremote.

it seems likely that once lbx is released as a consortium standard , there
will be several vendors willing to supply implementations for various
sorts of hardware.

hi ,

please reply to me direct as i am not a member of this list.

i am new to x , so please excuse my lax (read probably incorrect )
terminology !

environment sun sparc 10 , sunos 4.1.3. x11r5 path level 23. my x process
is started by xdm.

i) i want to setup the backgroud (root window \? ) of the tvtwm display to
display the escherknot etc (grey is a very boring colour to work on) !

the setup is as follows

lib x11 xdm xsetup 0 xsetroot bitmap ... etc
user .xsession xsetroot .... etc
tvtwm

there are also .tvtwmrc and .xdefaults files in the ( user) home
directory.

the xsetroot in xsetup 0 displays the appropriate bitmap in the xdm
login window as expected very nice !

unfortunately , when the users session is started , the background of the
tvtwm window reverts to grey. if i manually type xsetroot... in an
xterm window when the session has started , the background is changed as
expected.

the question is how do i retain the background from the login window
and or specify a new background on a per user basis as part of the
the users session startup \?

ii) when i open an xterm on the sparc 10 , not all of the keys are recognised
and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

ie real key key shown on screen

hash back slash
tilde pipe
double quote at symbol
pound hash
cursor key not recognised

this is very annoying ! is x at fault here or the machine setup \? i have
installed the xterm drivers that came with x11r5 in both terminfo and
termcap as they seemed more uptodate.

typing set in an xterm window shows a terminal type of xterm as
expected !

any help on how to correct either of these problems much appreciated !

this is a simple x graphics question

assume you have a valid window w , an icon pixmap , and the background
mask (also a pixmap) for that icon. you wish to place the icon at (x , y)
in w without the background.

question what combination of xcopyarea() and gc functions are necessary \?
i think the idea is to merge only those pixels of pixmap into w as
indicated by the corresponding mask pixel value. specifically , the
problem involves a pixmap and mask generated by the xpm libs.

any clues would be most appreciated.


xpm provides you with symbolic color names which can be specified at load time.
so , for doing what you want i would suggest you to define a background symbol
in your pixmap file which you 'll set to whatever color is used by the widget or
the window on which you want to put your pixmap.
this would surely be the simplest and fastest way to do what you want.

no. as soon as you blit two of this icons once on top of the other with a
little dislocation , you see the rectangular blit crashes too much of the
icon first blitted , because it draws a full rectangle. the way to do it
is masking create a bitmap with all pixels to be merged are 1 and all
not to be merged are 0. then , set the clip mask of the gc to this
bitmap , set the clip x origin and clip y origin of the gc to the x y
coordinates where you blit the icon to the destination drawable , use gxcopy ,
and xcopyarea() the icon pixmap to the destination drawable using this gc.

well i am not sure if this is the right newsgroup to ask , but let me try anyway.
i am running xterm and like all unix users , i run man something . recently ,
i switched to solaris 2.1 , and their man pages are littered with .i directives
that are somehow translated into reverse video when displayed by man under xterm.
the resulting output (admittedly a personal taste) is very annoying to look at.
back when i was using sunos 4.1.2 , i remember their man pages have some keywords
displayed with underlining....

so my question is how do i change the xterm 's behaviour under .i directives
for nroff man pages , to perhaps underlining , or at least disabling it. ( .b
directives are fine , i like them. and of course , i do n't want to go in and edit
the man pages inputs...) somehow , xterm allows one to specify both a normal font
and a bold font , but not an italic font \? \?

any pointers , suggestions are greatly appreciated.

these are two common subjects so i hope someone has had to deal with these
specific questions.

1. if my application depends on modifiers , what is the best lookup method \?
my choices are to call xgetmodifiermapping() for each key press with a
modifier , or make the call once at the init of the app and store the modifiers
in a lookup table. i would like to do it the second way , but i ca n't seem to
get the notify when the user uses xmodmap to remap the modifiers. i know that
when an app calls xsetmodifiermapping() a mappingnotify event is generated
(non maskable) which i can pick up and modify my internal table. but , i do n't
seem to get any notify events when the user uses xmodmap. if i use xt , all
o'reilly has to say is '...is automatically handled by xt...'. if i use xlib , ala xnextevent() , i get nothing. this all stems from problems with users of
the sun 4 5 keyboard and the numlock plus various alt meta etc. modifier
requirements.

2. i would like to place a popup so that it will be to the immediate right
of my main window. i want it at the same y coord , and their right left
sides touching. what i need to ask for is the x , y coord of the window
manager 's border for the main window. this should ring a bell with anyone
who has called xtmovewidget() , immediately checking the x , y after the move
and seeing that it is right , and in their next callback asking for the x , y
and seeing that it is now offset by the wm border.

any help would be most appreciated.

(2nd posting of the question that just does n't seem to get answered)

how can we resist a questions that says something like this \?

the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped. what we need to do is somehow tickle the
window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item.

what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior \?

if your expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information , then you can use xcleararea to generate an
expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not none) for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item.

this is still not great , since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.

if your expose event handler simply redraws everything , you 'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item on top of the
existing scene.

will look. i get the impression andrew is from the fsf , but i do n't
know what it looks like either.

if you 're on the internet and your site is n't sheltered from external
tcp ip traffic , you can use the remote andrew demo to see what the
andrew toolkit looks like

remote andrew demo service

this network service allows you to run andrew toolkit applications
without the overhead of obtaining or compiling the andrew software. you
need a host machine on the internet , and you need to be running the x11
window system. a simple finger command will allow you to experience
atk applications firsthand. you 'll be able to compose multimedia
documents , navigate through the interactive andrew tour , and use the
andrew message system to browse through cmu 's three thousand bulletin
boards and newsgroups.

to use the remote andrew demo service , simply run the following command
on your machine

finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

the service will give you further instructions.

0. xt glossary


o the xt intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to c code
to allow useful graphical components to be created. included with
this are classes that provide the base functionality object ,
rectobj , core , composite , constraint , shell , overrideshell , wmshell ,
etc. the terms xt and intrinsics are used interchangeably ,
however , they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the x
window system. in particular , it does not include the athena ,
motif , olit or any other widget set. without further widgets the
intrinsics are not especially useful.

o a widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via xt. the
precise use , is any object that is a subclass of the core class. it
is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the
object class although these are more accurately called windowless
widgets or gadgets.

o xlib is the c interface to the x11 protocol. it is one layer below
the xt intrinsics. typically a widget uses relatively few xlib
functions because xt provides most such services although an
understanding of xlib helps with problems.

3. why does my application core dump when i use signals alarms cthreads \?


in brief , xlib , xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for
critical sections. any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of
the above libraries in an inconsistent state such as all the
appropriate flags not yet set , dangling pointers , in the middle of a
list traversal , etc. note that the ansi c standard points out that
behavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls
any function other than signal() itself , so this is not a problem
specific to xlib and xt the posix specification mentions other
functions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that
these functions are called by xlib or xt functions.

the only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the
interrupt handler. this flag later needs to be checked either by a
work procedure or a timeout callback. it is incorrect to add either
of these in the interrupt handler. as another note , it is dangerous
to add a work procedure that never finishes. this effectively
preempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never
be called. another option is to open a pipe , tell the event loop
about the read end using xtappaddinput() and then the signal handler
can write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.
however , this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.

why do n't the intrinsics deal with this problem \? primarily because it
is supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating
system. is that a good enough reason i do n't think so.

note the article in the x journal 1 4 and the example in o'reilly
volume 6 are in error.


4. how do i use a different visual than the default \?


this requires a more complicated answer than it should. a window has
three things that are visual specific the visual , colormap and
border pixmap. all widgets have their own colormap and borderpixmap
resource only shell widgets have visual resources (another questions
deals with why shells have a visual). the default value of these
resources is copyfromparent which does exactly what it says. in the
shell widget copyfromparent gets evalulated as defaultvisualofscreen
and defaultcolormapofscreen. when any one of the three resources is
not properly set , a badmatch error occurs when the window is
created. they are not properly set because each of the values depends
on the visual being used.

how to get this to work \? there are two parts to the answer. the
first is if you want an application to start with a particular visual
and the second is if you want a particular shell within an application
to start with a different visual. the second is actually easier
because the basic information you need is available. the first is a
little harder because you 'll need to initialize much of the toolkit
yourself in order to determine the needed information.


some sample code to start up an application using something other
than the default visual.

to compile
cc g visual.c o visual lxaw lxmu lxt lxext lx11 lm

you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap

5. which visual should an application use \?


this is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is
no way for an application to know the appropriate visual it has to
be specified by the user. if you disagree with this then your
application probably falls into the category of always using the
default visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular
visual such as 24bit truecolor with an overlayplane extension (or some
such).

why \? no application runs in isolation. depending on the way a server
allocates resources i may not always want your application to run in
truecolor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications. i may
be very upset if it chooses to run in greyscale instead of psuedocolor
or just monochrome.

as an example , on a low end color sun server there are many different
possible visuals monochrome , 256 entry colormap , static gray , static
color , and a 3 3 2 truecolor. the sgi iris 's offer all the above
plus 12 bit truecolor , 24 bit truecolor , an overlay plane.


6. why do only shell widgets have a visual \?


this is strictly by convention. it makes it possible for an arbitrary
widget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the
shell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that
shell.

a widget can have its own visual resource. if it does , it must have
its own realize method to use the visual when it calls
xcreatewindow(). you should also make this a resource that can be
obtained with xtgetvalues() so other widgets can find it. a
reasonable value is probably xtnvisual.


7. which visual , depth and colormap do shells inherit \?


the default value for these resources are set to copyfromparent. this
is interpreted as the defaultcolormapofscreen() , defaultdepthofscreen()
and the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent i.e.
it is an applicationshellwidgetclass and the root of your widget tree.

if the parent of the widget is not null , then the shell copies
colormap and depth from its parent and uses copyfromparent as the
visual.


8. i 've done all the above and i still get a badmatch error. why \?


some resource converters improperly cache references. this was
especially true of x11r3 and earlier versions of motif.


9. why does n't my widget get destroyed when i call xtdestroywidget() \?


see section 2.8 of the xt specification.

it eventually does get destroyed , just not immediately. the
intrinsics destroy a widget in a two phase process. first it and all
of its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.
it is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed. this way any
pending x events or further references to that widget can be cleaned
up before the memory is actually freed. the second phase is then
performed after all callbacks , event handlers , and actions have
completed , before checking for the next x event. at this point the
list is traversed and each widget 's memory is actually free() 'd , among
other things.

as some further caveats trivia , the widgets may be destroyed if the
intrinsics determine that they have no further references to the
widgets on the list. if so , then the phase 2 destruction occurs
immediately. also , if nested event loops are used , widgets placed on
the destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not
destroyed until returning to the outer event loop.


10. how do i exit but still execute the destroycallbacks \?


the problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting
an application is used , such as calling exit() directly , then a widget
may not have a chance to clean up any external state such as open
sockets , temporary files , allocated x resources , etc. (this code for
simplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget)


widget
toplevelget (gw)
widget gw widget to find toplevel

widget top

for (top gw xtparent (top) top xtparent (top))
empty
return (top)


void
exitcallback (gw , closure , call data)
widget gw widget
xtpointer closure data the app specified
xtpointer call data widget specific data

widget toplevel

toplevel toplevelget (gw)
xtunmapwidget (toplevel) make it disappear quickly
xtdestroywidget (toplevel)
exit (0)


one can see that the above code exit 's immediately after destroying
the toplevel widget. the trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never
occur.

this works for most widgets and most applications but will not work
for those widgets that have any external state. you might think that
since it works now it will always work but remember that part of the
reason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant
of the implementation details for each widget. which means that the
widget may change and someday require that some external state is
cleaned up by the destroy callbacks.

one alternative is to modify exitcallback() to set a global flag and
then test for that flag in a private event loop. however , private
event loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy , and
difficult to maintain practices.

try the following code instead.

include x11 intrinsic.h

extern widget toplevelget (
if needfunctionprototypes
widget gw
endif
)

extern boolean exitworkproc (
if needfunctionprototypes
xtpointer closure
endif
)

extern void exitcallback (
if needfunctionprototypes
widget gw ,
xtpointer closure ,
xtpointer call data
endif
)

widget
toplevelget (gw)
widget gw widget to find toplevel

widget top

for (top gw xtparent (top) top xtparent (top))
empty
return (top)



void
exitcallback (gw , closure , call data)
widget gw widget
xtpointer closure data the app specified
xtpointer call data widget specific data

widget toplevel

toplevel toplevelget (gw)
xtunmapwidget (toplevel) make it disappear quickly
xtdestroywidget (toplevel)
xtappaddworkproc (xtwidgettoapplicationcontext (gw) ,
exitworkproc , (xtpointer) null)


boolean
exitworkproc (closure)
xtpointer closure

exit (0)
notreached



exitcallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the
application is next idle which happens after all the events are
processed and the destroy callbacks are executed.


11. how do i resize a shell widget \?


after it is realized , one does n't resize a shell widget. the proper
thing is to resize the currently managed child of the shell widget
using xtsetvalues(). the geometry change is then propagated to the
shell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the
request. however , the shell must have the resource
xtnallowshellresize set to true otherwise it will not even ask the
window manager to grant the request and the shell will not resize.

to change the position of a shell , use xtsetvalues() on the shell , not
the child , and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.


12. why ca n't xtappaddinput() handle files \?


it does , however unix semantics for when i o is ready for a file does
not fit most peoples' intuitive model. in unix terms a file
descriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not
block , ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to
block. this works as expected for terminals , sockets and pipes. for
a file the read() will always return but the return indicates an eof
i.e. no more data. the result is the code in the intrinsics always
calls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to
be read. the culprit is the select() system call or on sysv based
os 's it is the poll() system call.

how to get around this on a unix system \? the best approach is to use
another process to check for available input on the file. use a pipe
to connect the application with this other process and pass the file
descriptor from the pipe to xtappaddinput(). a suitable program on
bsd systems is tail f filename .

it 's rumored that select() on some systems is not completely
reliable. in particular

ibm aix 3.1 this is one where it would work for a while
(several thousand times) and then stop until some other
event woke it up. this seemed to be the result of a race
condition in the kernel. ibm claims to have a fix for this.

pyramid , does n't work at all.

ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as
sockets) , was n't completely broken , but although the writing
side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it
all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at
a time. you can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks
(get raound it by detecting the situation and having
select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds by then it had
been given the whole block).


note that all the above descriptions used unix terminology such as
read() , file descriptor , pipes , etc. this is an os dependent area and
may not be identical on all systems. however the intrinsic designers
felt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with
part of the toolkit. why they did n't also deal with signals at this
point i do n't know.


13. what good books and magazines are there on xt \?


i have a favorite that is the definitive reference. to my perspective
it offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full
details of the intrinsics. when i started using it i was already
familiar with xt and the concepts behind it , so newcomers may or may
not find it useful. i 've always found it accurate and complete , which
means its a 1000 pages.

asente , paul j. , and swick , ralph r. , x window system toolkit , the
complete programmer 's guide and specification , digital press ,
1990 , isbn 1 55558 051 3 , order number ey e757e dp and by
prentice hall , isbn 0 13 972191 6. also available through dec
direct at 1 800 digital.

the other book i commonly recomend to novices is

young , doug. the x window system applications and programming with
xt (motif version) , prentice hall , 1989 (isbn 0 13 497074 8).
(isbn 0 13 972167 3)

and of course o'reilly has an entire series of manuals on x and xt.
o'reilly ordering is 800 998 9938. in particular , volume 5 is an xt
reference done in manual page style. the 3rd edition is extensively
overhauled and goes far beyond the mit manual pages. i'm finding it
very useful. in particular , the permutted index and references to
other manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related
information.

i read two periodicals , the x resource and the the x journal .
these are the only two dealing specifically with x. the x resource
is published quarterly , by o'reilly , with one of the issues being the
mit x consortium technical conference proceedings. there is no
advertising. i 've found it informative with pretty good depth. for
orders , call 1 800 998 9938 , or email cathyr@ora.com. for editorial
matters , email adrian@ora.com. table of contents are posted at
math.utah.edu in ftp pub tex bib in tex form and on ftp.uu.net in
ftp published oreilly xresource in ascii form.


the x journal is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.
the articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical
audience. i read it more to see what 's going on then with an
expectation of learning a great deal (but remember , i represent a
fairly small percentage of people). also , they have a pretty good
collection of people on the advisory board and as columnists. call
(908) 563 9033.


14. what widgets are available \?


there are three popular widget sets

athena the set provided with x11. this is sufficient for most
purposes but is on the ugly side. recently , a 3d look is
available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu contrib xaw3d.tar.z.
motif from osf available for a license fee and commonly shipped on
many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but
sun). it looks good and works well but personally i think
it is poorly implemented.
olit the open look intrinsics toolkit is a set of widgets
implementing sun 's open look specification. developed by
at t. i 've never used it so ca n't comment on its quality.
i 've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.

in addition the following collection of widgets are also available

xtra a library of widgets for sale from graphical software
technology (310 328 9338). it includes bar graph , stacked
bar graph , line graph , pie chart , xy plot , hypertext , help ,
spreadsheet , and data entry form widgets. i 've never seen
them so i ca n't comment.
fwf the free widget foundation is attempting to collect a set of
freely available widgets. included are a pixmap editor ,
filedialog , and a few others. the current set of widgets
can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine
a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub fwf.shar.z.
xcu the cornell university widgets from gene dykes. one of the
early widget sets released. provides a nice appearance for
buttons and has a mini command language. probably not so
widely used.
xs the sony widget set. this was around during r3 days but
seemed to disappear. it looked like it had promise.
xw the hp widgets. the precursor to motif. originally written
for r3 there exists diffs to get it to work under r4 r5.
again , a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.
the precursor to this was the xray toolkit which was
originally implemented for x10r4 and apparently provided
much experience for the designers of xt.
xo a widget set i'm working on. it 's still primitive but you
can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio state.edu pub xo

the following specialized widgets are also available

tbl implements a tabular layout of widgets. supports motif
widgets as children. part of wcl.
plots the athena plotting widgets (not the athena widgets).
contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@athena.mit.edu.


15. what alternatives to the intrinsics are there \?



name language vendor

xview c sun
oi c parcplace
interviews c stanford
tcl tk c sprite.berkeley.edu



however much i like c and admire the skill in both designing and
implementing the intrinsics , hopefully some alternative will develop
in the next 3 5 years that uses an object oriented language. keep
your eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language
other than c starts gaining acceptance.


16. how do i pass a float value to xtsetvalues \?


first , what is going wrong is the structure for an arg is (essentially)
typdef struct

string name
long value
arg

and the code
arg arg

xtsetarg (arg , name , 3.2)

expands to
arg arg

arg.name name
arg.value 3.2

you can see that with normal c type conversions , the arg.value
gets the integer 3 instead of the floating point value 3.2 . when
the value is copied into the widget resource , the bit pattern is
wildly different than that required for a floating point value. so ,
how to get around this \?

the following macro is from the athena widgets document and i am now
recomending it over the previous suggestions.

define xtsetfloatarg(arg , n , d)
if (sizeof(float) sizeof(xtargval))
xtsetarg(arg , n , (d))
else
xtargval ld (xtargval ) (d)
xtsetarg(arg , n , ld)




17. how do i write a resource converter \?


courtesy of rich thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com)

the following discussion of resource converters assumes r4 (or r5)
intrinsics. resource converters changed between r3 and r4 to allow
for destructors and caching of converted values.

there are several main types of resource converters

string to data type
data type to string
data type to data type

i) string to data type
usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings
that will be converted to data type values. this is most often
used to map enumerated names to enumerated values

name value
true 1
false 0

in this case , the string to data type converter needs to compare
the resource value to the list of fixed strings. this is most
readily accomplished by the use of the quark mechanism of the
resource manager. the resource value is turned into a quark ,
which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a
single word. then the resource quark is compared against the
quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.

if there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many
converters , each with a small number of enumeration strings) , then
a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the
resource strings into quarks. that way , the first time one of
these converters is used , the strings will be turned into quarks
and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one
of the converters.

ii) data type to string
this type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data
type converters since the use of quarks is n't necessary. instead ,
the data type value is simply converted to a string value ,
probably by the use of sprintf.

data type to string converters are useful for applications that
wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that
they can write out a valid resource specification to a file. this
mechanism can be used to provide a snapshot of application state
into a file. this snapshot can be used to restore the program to
a known state via the usual x resource database mechanisms.

if you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type
converter , it is n't much extra effort to write the data type to
string converter. writing both at the same time helps to ensure
that they are consistent.

iii) data type to data type
this type of converter is used to convert an existing data type
value to another data type. for instance , an x pixel value can be
converted to an rgb data type that contains separate fields for
red , green and blue.


the type signature for a resource converter is as follows

typedef boolean ( xttypeconverter)(display , xrmvalueptr , cardinal ,
xrmvalueptr , xrmvalueptr , xtpointer )
display dpy
xrmvalueptr args
cardinal num args
xrmvalueptr fromval
xrmvalueptr toval
xtpointer converter data

when the converter is invoked , the fromval argument points to the source
x resource manager value and the toval argument points to the
destination x resource manager value. the converter data argument
is an opaque pointer to some converter specific data that is specified
when the converter is registered. the args and num args arguments
allow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is
invoked. for instance , the pixel to rgb structure converter discussed
above would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the
pixel to obtain the rgb values corresponding to that pixel.

care must be taken with the toval argument. an xrmvalue has the
following type definition and specifies a size and location for a
converted value

typedef struct
unsigned int size
caddr t addr
xrmvalue , xrmvalueptr

when the converter is invoked , the address may point to a location of
the given size for the converted value or the location can be null.
in the former case , the converter should ensure that the size of the
destination area is large enough to handle the converted value. if
the destination area is not large enough , then the converter should
set the size to the amount of space needed and return false. the
caller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the
converter. if the size is large enough , then the converter can simply
copy the converted value into the space given and return true.

if the location is null , then the converter can assign the location to
the address of a static variable containing the converted value and
return true.

when writing a group of converters , this code is often repeated and it
becomes convenient to define a macro

define done(var , type)
if (toval addr)

if (toval size sizeof(type))

toval size sizeof(type)
return false

else
((type ) toval addr) var

else
toval addr (caddr t) var
toval size sizeof(type)
return true

define donestr(str)
if (toval addr toval size sizeof(string))

toval size sizeof(string)
return false

else
toval addr (caddr t) str
toval size sizeof(string)
return true

inside the converter , it is a good idea to perform a little safety
checking on the num args and args arguments to ensure that your
converter is being called properly.

once you have written your converter , you need to register it with the
intrinsics. the intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating
widgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.

to register a converter with a single application context , use
xtappsettypeconverter

void xtappsettypeconverter(context , from , to , converter , args , num args ,
cache , destructor)
xtappcontext context
string from
string to
xttypeconverter converter
xtconvertarglist args
cardinal num args
xtcachetype cache
xtdestructor destructor

to register a converter with all application contexts , use
xtsettypeconverter

void xtsettypeconverter(from , to , converter , args , num args ,
cache , destructor)
string from
string to
xttypeconverter converter
xtconvertarglist args
cardinal num args
xtcachetype cache
xtdestructor destructor

in the r3 intrinsics , there were the routines xtappaddconverter and
xtaddconverter these have been superseded by xtappsettypeconverter
and xtsettypeconverter. whenever possible , the newer routines should be
used.

when a converter is registered with the intrinsics , a cache argument
specifies how converted resource values are to be cached

xtcachenone do n't cache any converted values
xtcacheall cache all converted values
xtcachebydisplay cache converted values on a per display basis

caching converted values that require a round trip to the server is a
good idea (for instance string to pixel conversions).

the destructor argument is a routine that is invoked then the
resource is destroyed , either because its cached reference count has
been decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is
being destroyed. xtdestructor has the following type definition

typedef void ( xtdestructor)(xtappcontext , xrmvalueptr , xtpointer ,
xrmvalueptr , cardinal )
xtappcontext context
xrmvalueptr to
xtpointer converter data
xrmvalueptr args
cardinal num args

the destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated
with the to argument , but does not actually free the storage pointed
to by the to argument itself (to addr). the destructor is passed
the extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the
conversion was performed (for instance , colormap and visual arguments
for the string to pixel converter since the destructor would need to
free the allocated pixel from the colormap) as well as the private
data passed in when the converter was registered.

sample converter code can be found in the following files in the mit
r5 distribution

mit lib xt converters.c
contrib lib pext converters.c
contrib lib pext converters.h


18. how do i open multiple displays \?


see multi user application software using xt , the x resource , issue 3 ,
(summer 1992) by oliver jones for a complete coverage of the issues
involved. most of this answer is based on that article. in a
nutshell , one uses xtopendisplay() to add each display to a single
application context and then xtclosedisplay() to shutdown each display
and remove it from the application context.

the real problems occur when trying to close down a display. this can
happen 3 ways
1. user selects a quit button on one of the displays ,
2. user has window manager send a wm delete window message ,
3. server disconnect possibly from a killclient message ,
server shutdown crash , or network failure.

i 'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 2 since it is merely a
problem of translating a widget to a display and removing that
display. if not , then read the oliver jones article.

the third one is difficult to handle. the following is based on the
oliver jones article and i include it here because it is a difficult
problem.

the difficulty arises because the xlib design presumed that an i o
error is always unrecoverable and so fatal. this is essentially true
for a single display x based application , but not true for a
multiple display program or an application that does things other than
display information on an x server. when an x i o error occurs the
i o error handler is called and if it returns then an exit()
happens. the only way around this is to use setjmp longjmp to avoid
returning to the i o error handler. the following code fragment
demonstrates this

include setjmp.h
jmp buf xiorecover

void
xiohandler (dpy)
display dpy

destroydisplay (dpy)
longjmp (xiorecover , 1)


main ()

...
if (setjmp (xiorecover) 0)
xsetioerrorhandler (xiohandler)
xtappmainloop (app context)


the destroydisplay() is something that given a display pointer can go
back to the application specific data and perform any necessary
cleanup. it should also call xtclosedisplay().

for those of you unfamiliar with setjmp longjmp , when setjmp() is
first called it returns a 0 and save 's enough information in the
jmp buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to
the same state as if the setjmp() was just executed. the return value
of this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to
longjmp(). there are several caveats about using these but for this
purpose it is adequate.

some other problems you might run into are resource converters that
improperly cache resources. the most likely symptoms are xlib errors
such as badcolor , badatom , or badfont. there may be problems with the
total number of displays you can open since typically only a limited
number of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical
value. you may also run into authorization problems when trying to
connect to a display.

there was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in
november of 91. robert scheifler posted an article which basically
said this is the way it will be and xlib will not change.

20. where are the resources loaded from \?


the resources of a widget are filled in from the following places
(from highest priority to lowest priority)

1. args passed at creation time.
2. command line arguments.
3. user 's per host defaults file
4. user 's defaults file.
5. user 's per application default file.
6. system wide per application default file.

note that 2 6 are read only once on application startup. the result
of steps 3 6 is a single resource database used for further queries.

the per host defaults file contains customizations for all
applications executing on a specific computer. this file is either
specified with the xenvironment environment variable or if that is not
set then the file home .xdefaults host is used.

the user defaults file is either obtained from the resource manager
property on the root window of the display or if that is not set then
the file home .xdefaults is used. typically , the program xrdb is
used to set the resource manager property. please note that this
should be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the
display must transfer the property. a size of around 1 3kbyte is
reasonable. some toolkits may track changes to the resource manager
but most do not.

a user may have many per application default files containing
customizations specific to each application. the intrinsics are quite
flexible on how this file is found. read the next part that describes
the various environment variables and how they effect where this file
is found.

the system wide per application default files are typically found in
usr lib x11 app defaults. if such a file is not found then the
fallback resources are used. the intrinsics are quite flexible on how
this file is found. read the next part that describes the various
environment variables and how they effect where this file is found.

thanks to oliver jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following , 6 92

you can use several environment variables to control how resources are
loaded for your xt based programs xfilesearchpath ,
xuserfilesearchpath , and xapplresdir. these environment variables
control where xt looks for application defaults files as an
application is initializing. xt loads at most one app defaults file
from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path
defined in xuserfilesearchpath.

set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a
way that app defaults files appear in several different directory
hierarchies. suppose , for example , that you are running sun 's open
windows , and you also have some r4 x applications installed in
usr lib x11 app defaults. you could set a value like this for
xfilesearchpath , and it would cause xt to look up app defaults files
in both usr lib x11 and usr openwin lib (or wherever your
openwinhome is located)

setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x11 t n openwinhome lib t n

the value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of
pathnames. the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows
(see xtresolvepathname())

n the value of the filename parameter , or the
application 's class name.
t the value of the file type . in this case , the
literal string app defaults
c customization resource (r5 only)
s suffix. none for app defaults.
l language , locale , and codeset (e.g. ja jp.euc )
l language part of l (e.g. ja )
t the territory part of the display 's language string
c the codeset part of the display 's language string

let 's take apart the example. suppose the application 's class name is
myterm . also , suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin.
(notice the example omits locale specific lookup.)

usr lib x11 t n means usr lib x11 app defaults myterm
openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm

as the application initializes , xt tries to open both of the above
app defaults files , in the order shown. as soon as it finds one , it
reads it and uses it , and stops looking for others. the effect of
this path is to search first in usr lib x11 , then in usr openwin.

let 's consider another example. this time , let 's set
xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm.ad in the current
working directory , then for myterm in the directory app defaults.

setenv xuserfilesearchpath . n.ad home app defaults n

the first path in the list expands to . myterm.ad. the second expands
to home app defaults myterm. this is a convenient setting for
debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the
app defaults file myterm.ad in the application 's source directory , so
you can run the application from the directory in which you are
working and still have the resources loaded properly.

note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath ,
for some bizarre reason , neither the type nor file suffix is
defined so t and s are useless.

with r5 , there 's another twist. you may specify a customization
resource value. for example , you might run the myterm application
like this

myterm xrm customization color

if one of your pathname specifications had the value
usr lib x11 app defaults n c then the expanded pathname would be
usr lib x11 app defaults myterm color because the c substitution
character takes on the value of the customization resource.

the default xfilesearchpath , compiled into xt , is

usr lib x11 l t n c (r5)
usr lib x11 l t n c (r5)
usr lib x11 t n c (r5)
usr lib x11 l t n
usr lib x11 l t n
usr lib x11 t n

(note some sites replace usr lib x11 with a projectroot in this
batch of default settings.)

the default xuserfilesearchpath , also compiled into xt , is

root l n c (r5)
root l n c (r5)
root n c (r5)
root l n
root l n
root n

root is either the value of xapplresdir or the user 's home directory
if xapplresdir is not set. if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some
value other than the default , xt ignores xapplresdir altogether.

notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find
your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set
xapplresdir to . , a single dot. in r3 , all this machinery worked
differently for r3 compatibilty , many people set their xapplresdir
value to . , a dot followed by a slash.



21. what order are callbacks executed in \?

(courtesy of donna converse , converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu 5 10 92)

the intrinsics library do not guarantee an order. this is because
both the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to
modify the entire contents of the callback list. neither one
currently knows what the other is doing and so the intrinsics cannot
guarantee the order of execution.

the application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer the
widget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and
remove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have
therefore the functionality contained in a callback should be
independent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the
list.

even though the xt standard in the definition of xtaddcallback
says

callback name specifies the callback list to which the
procedure is to be appended.

you may not infer from the word appended that the callback routines
are called in the same order as they have been added to the callback
list.


22. how do i know if a widget is visible \?

(courtesy of donna converse , converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu 5 14 92)

i am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. i set the visible
interest field in core and if my window is completely obscured , the core
visible flag goes false. however , if my window is iconified , the flag
stays set to true.

right , everything is implemented correctly. this demonstrates a deficiency
in the x protocol , and the core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the
protocol. (the deficiency is that the information is available in one way ,
in this case an inconvenient way.) the xt specification is accurate , in
the second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2 , so read this section
carefully. the visible field will not change in response to iconification.

a visibilitynotify event will not be received when the window goes from
viewable to unviewable , that is , when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped
that is , when iconification occurs. this is the protocol deficiency.
visibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the x protocol
see the glossary in your xlib and x protocol reference manual.

is this a problem with mwm or is there something
else which needs to be done \?

you 'll see this with any window manager , with no window manager.

if the problem is mwm , what is the fastest
way to determine if a window is iconified \?

as an application writer , keep track with a global boolean in an action
routine with translations for mapnotify and unmapnotify on the shell widget
which contains your custom widget. as the custom widget writer , see the
map state field returned by a call to xgetwindowattributes. these are
suggestions.


23. how do i reparent a widget in xt , i.e. xtreparentwidget() \?


you ca n't.


24. why use xtmalloc , xtfree , etc \?


unfortunately , most code that calls malloc() , realloc() or calloc()
tends to ignore the possibility of returning null. at best it is
handled something like

ptr (type ) malloc (sizeof (type))
if ( ! ptr)

perror ( malloc in xyzzy() )
exit (1)

to handle this common case the intrinsics define the functions
xtmalloc() , xtcalloc() , xtnew() , xtnewstring() and xtrealloc() which
all use the standard c language functions malloc() , calloc() and
realloc() but execute xterrormsg() if a null value is returned. xt
error handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.

in addition , if xtrealloc() is called with a null pointer , it uses
xtmalloc() to get the initial space. this allows code like

if ( ! ptr)
ptr (type ) malloc (sizeof (type))
else
ptr (type ) realloc (ptr , sizeof (type) (count 1))
count

to be written as

ptr xtrealloc (ptr , sizeof (ptr) count)

also , xtfree() accepts a null pointer as an argument. generally , i 've
found the xt functions conveniant to use. however , anytime i'm
allocating anything potentially large i use the standard functions so
i can fully recover from not enough memory errors.

xtnew() and xtnewstring() are conveniant macros for allocating a
structure or copying a string

struct abc xyzzy
char ptr
char str abcdef

xyzzy xtnew (struct abc) takes care of type casting
ptr xtnewstring (str)

a strict interpretation of the intrinsics reference manual allow an
implementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with
malloc() and free(). i.e. code such as

char ptr

ptr xtmalloc (100)
...
free (ptr)

may not work. personally , i 'd call any implementation that did this
broken and complain to the vendor.

a common error for motif programmers is to use xtfree() on a string
when they should really be using xmstringfree().


25. how to debug an xt application \?

first , i 'd recomend getting purify from pure software. this is a
great package for tracing memory problems on sun 's. it 's a bit pricey
at 2750 but i 'd still recomend it. excuse the marketing blurb
(contact support@pure.com for more info).

purify inserts additional checking instructions directly into
the object code produced by existing compilers. these
instructions check every memory read and write performed by
the program under test and detect several types of access
errors , such as reading unitialized memory , writing past
malloc 'd bounds , or writing to freed memory. purify inserts
checking logic into all of the code in a program , including
third party and vendor object code libraries , and verifies
system call interfaces. in addition , purify tracks memory
usage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel
adaption of garbage collection techniques. purify 's nearly
comprehensive memory access checking slows the target program
down typically by a factor of two to five.

an alternative package that is n't as pricey ( 395 for a sun) , runs on
many unix 's and has pretty similar features is the sentinel debugging
environment . this replaces malloc() and several other c library
functions to add additional checks. (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com
for more info)

next , if you are getting any sort of xlib error , you 'll need to run in
synchronous mode , easily accomplished with the sync command line
argument or by setting the variable xdebug to 1 with your debugger. then
set a break point in exit(). this will let you trace back to the
original xlib function being called. if you do n't run in synchronous
mode , then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to
xlib previously since the xlib calls are buffered and replies from the
server are asynchronous.

next , if you are having trouble with window layout , you can use the
undocumented resource xtidentifywindows or the class resource
xtdebug to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.
for example

example xload xrm ' xtdebug true'
example xwininfo tree
click in new xload window

will give the normal information but the widget name and class of each
window is included. this can help for checking the location and size
of errant widgets.

next , if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to
test the way a widget manages it 's children , you can try
export.lcs.mit.edu contrib libxtgeo.tar.z. this acts as a filter
between any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour
of both. it 's a very clever idea.

the most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the
application is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from
a pulldown menu). the server effectively locks up and you 'll need to
go to another machine and kill the debugger manually. the server
locks up because the application being debugged has said no one else
can have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped
waiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.
unfortunately you ca n't give them because all the input is going to
your application which is stopped.

the best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on
your desk , running the program under a debugger (or other environment)
on one machine , and running the application on the other , possibly
using a command sequence like this

othermachine xhost thismachine
thismachine setenv display othermachine 0
thismachine gdb application your favorite debugger.
or this
othermachine xhost thismachine
thismachine gdb application
(gdb) set environment display othermachine 0
(gdb) run ...

i believe codecenter , a c interpreter graphical debugger has a method
of dealing with this by explicitely calling the xlib functions to
release any grabs during breakpoints.

debugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and
knowledge of how widgets work. you can go a long way without knowing
the internals of a particular widget but not very far without
understanding how a widget works. judicious use of conditional
breakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great
deal.


26. why do n't xtaddinput() , xtaddtimeout() and xtaddworkproc() work \?

i have got a delicate problem with the three routines xtaddinput ,
xtaddtimeout and xtaddworkproc. the problem i have is that when
i use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.
i have made a handy little testprogram where everything works
perfect , but in my real application nothing happens.

the introduction in r3 of the xtapp () functions obsoleted those
routines (see q19 for other changes in r3 , r4 , and r5). what happens is
they use a default application context different then the one you may
have created. since events and timeouts are distributed on a per
application context basis and you are using two application contexts ,
you wo n't get those events.

for example

...
cnt 0
toplevel xtappinitialize( app , class ,
desc , xtnumber (desc) ,
argc , argv ,
fallback , args , cnt)

xtaddtimeout (...)
xtaddworkproc (...)

xtappmainloop (app)

would never invoke the timeout.


27. what is and how can i implement drag and drop \?

(courtesy of roger reynolds , rogerr@netcom.com 19 feb 93)

drag n drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients , in an
``intuitive'' fashion.

motif version 1.2 supports drag n drop capabilities , openlook has
supported d n d all along. the two protocols are not compatable with
each other , and so far as i know , they are not published.

i wrote a package called rdd which is designed to be a flexible public
protocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients. my
intention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to
support a standard drag n drop protocol in the programs they develop
and contribute or sell , regardless of what widget set is used (as long
as it is based on xt).

the implementation is based upon my understanding of the icccm
conventions , for more details read the code.

i have heard from dozens of people using rdd who like it and feel that
it works a whole lot better than motif 1.2 stuff. also , there seem to
be many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use motif
anyway.

the latest rdd (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from
netcom.com , in pub rogerr. a (possibly older) version is also

actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why graphics
do n't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle \?

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
xlib graphics. a button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()
(or equiv) directly instead , it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
window is mapped.

the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped. do you know the best way to tickle a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item \?

i specifically made the above comment assuming that perhaps the code fragment
came from a simple open draw quit client.

as per your question why not have the button handler add the object , and
then call the window redraw() (or whatever) directly \? although , depending
on how the overall application is structured , there may be no problem with
rendering the object directly in response to the button press.

the title line says it. the galaxy package was just recently announced , and
includes a gui builder and portable toolkit. i'm interested in any
feedback from those who may have used it thus far.

we 've been using it for a year on unix (sun and hp) and windows platforms. in my
opinion , it is the best toolkit on the market. it supports a rich api to a high
level ipc mechanism , file system abstraction , memory management , command driven
application development , drawing , geometry management , and , oh yeah , open look ,

i need (probably) to write one or more new motif widgets on the hp ux
platform. do i need the motif private header files and source ,
or can i make do with the public headers that are provided \?
motif includes xt in this context.

yes. you 'll find it almost impossible without the source
at this point. it does depend on how ambitious you are and
how concerned you are about compliance with the general
interface and items like traversal.

one widget is a multi column list (which lots of people have
already written , i am sure) , and would therefore be probably be
a subclass of list rather than something simple like an xt class.
is this more difficult (in principle , not lines of code) \?

i'm not sure what you 're asking. you could create something
which is very much like a true multi column list by placing
several lists within a geometry manager , and putting that
manager within an automatic scrolled window. this would n't
be good for very large lists , but you might consider this
as an alternative.

alternatively , if anyone has a multi column list widget they
could sell me , this might save me from having to write one !
does it by any chance exist in motif 1.2 already (i do not
yet have the spec) \?

motif 1.2 does not have a multi column list in it. have you
looked at commercial sets \? there are also some pd
widget sets , one of these might have a multi column list
you could port.

dear xperts ,

i'm developing an application that uses a motif slider to select
an image file out of a directory. now i would like to display the
name of the file corresponding to the value of the dragged scale
button (i.e. with the mb1 pressed). as xmnshowvalue only displays
the current value of the scale button and not the actual corresponding
image file name , i thought of using an xtaddeventhandler to do
the mapping between the scale value and the file name

xtaddeventhandler(scaleimage , button1motionmask , false , slidermoved , null)


and in the eventhandler do a

while (xchecktypedwindowevent (display , event window , motionnotify , return))

xmscalegetvalue(scaleimage , value)
map value to file entry in directory and finally obtain file name to open


however , when i move the pointer in the scale widget i get callbacks , with of co
urse
a null effect as my mb1 is not pressed to move the scale button. so what is goin
g wrong \?
or is the a wrong approach to this problem \?
any hints are highly appreciated.

to beck@irzr17.inf.tu dresden.de , xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu


i think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
f.i. gouroud shading of triangles. this is fairly complex to do with plain
x. simpler shading models are implemented already , f.i. in x3d (ask archie
where to get the latest version).
for gouroud , a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only , either mit shm to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it , or pex opengl which should be able to shade themselves. the portable
'vanilla x' way would be to shade in a normal ximage and use xputimage() ,
what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
or such stuff.

to speak about povray , the x previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good , especially in speed , protocol friendlyness and
icccm compliance. have a look on x256q , my own preview code. it is on

141.76.1.11 pub gfx ray misc x256q

the readme states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from
povray 1.0


the version i have is using the x256q code instead of the default x windows
code. i have it currently running on a dec alpha running openvms axp and
so far have been pretty impressed. the only side effect of x256q is that
it requires xstdcmap best be run before it will work , annoyning but not a
show stopper.

dear folks

it 's a pleasure to be able to announce the release of a new freeware program ,
xavier , an audio and video extension to interviews.

xavier(extension av class for interviews) is a c class library
that adds multimedia capability to interviews. it allows composite
multimedia objects to be built from media objects.

specifically , it adds audio and video objects to the classes available
in interviews 3.0.1 3.1 , and it does so without changing the
source code for the original classes (though several configuration
files for interviews need to be changed via a patch file).

currently , the xavier audio classes are only supported on sun
workstations with an audio interface , such as the sparcstation2.

xavier has been tested in the following environments

sun
machine sparcserver470 sparcstation ipc
os sun os4.1.1 or later
c sun c ver2.1

nec(ews)
machine ews4800 210 , 230
os ews ux v(rel4.0) wsos41 release5.1 , release5.2
c c release3.1

it can be obtained via anonymous ftp from

interviews.stanford.edu in pub contrib
(xavier.large demo.tar , and xavier.tar)

we are preparing a mailing list for information regarding xavier.
if you are interested , please contact

xavier@tsl.cl.nec.co.jp.

i will add your e mail address to our list.

the subject does not describe the problem i am having very well. please read
on...

i am trying to write a function which creates an xtappcontext and a widget ,
displays the widget for a while , then destroys everything and returns. the
problem is that multiple calls to this function cause a variety of problems
including (depending on which calls i make to get rid of things)

core dump
badpixmap x error
widget not unmapped


here is a simple (c ) program i wrote to show the problem

include x11 xlib.h
include xm xm.h
include xm pushb.h

void bla()

xtappcontext app
display dis xopendisplay( )
int junk 0

widget top xtappinitialize ( app , test , null , 0 , junk , null ,
null , null , 0)

widget box xtvacreatemanagedwidget( blaaa , xmpushbuttonwidgetclass ,
top ,
xmnheight , 50 ,
xmnwidth , 50 ,
null)

xtrealizewidget(top)
same as xtappmainloop but with only 10 xevents
for (int i 0 i 10 i )

xevent event
xtappnextevent(app , event)
xtdispatchevent( event)


what should i put here \? \? \?
xtunrealizewidget(top)
xtdestroywidget(top)
xtdestroyapplicationcontext(app)
xclosedisplay(dis)
\? \? \?


main()

for (int i 0 i 20 i )
bla()


note that i rewrote xtappmainloop so that at a given time (in this example ,
after 10 xevents) the function will exit and return to the main program.
with this example , i get the following error on about (this is not consistent)
the 5th call to bla()

x error of failed request badpixmap (invalid pixmap parameter)
major opcode of failed request 55 (x creategc)
resource id in failed request 0xe0000d
serial number of failed request 71
current serial number in output stream 86

if i take out the xtunrealizewidget(top) line , it just dumps core on the
seconds call.

furthermore , every time i call xtappinitialize() (other than the 1st time) , i
get

warning initializing resource lists twice
warning initializing translation manager twice.


so finally , my question is this

what needs to be done in order to be able to call a function which creates
an xtappcontext and widgets multiple times \?

any help would be greatly appreciated.

please respond via email as i dont usually have time to read this group.

thanks very much.

x allowed. even so , you are safer if you remain within the guidelines.
x
x you should read the current ioccc rules , prior to submitting entries.
x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines.
x
x changes from the 1993 draft are noted by change bars.
x
x
xwhat is new in 1993
x
x the entry format is better (for us anyway). the program mkentry.c
x has been updated. see entry format.
x
x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c
x compiler. certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers
x fits are no longer permitted. some of the new issues deal with
x non integral array types , variable number of arguments , c preprocessor
x directives and the exit() function. see our likes and dislikes.
x
x
xhints and suggestions
x
x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests. see
x for more information for details on how to get previous winners.
x
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year , so some winning entries
x may not be valid entries this year. what was unique and novel one year
x might be 'old' the next year.
x
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways. we typically apply
x a number of tests to an entry
x
x look at the original source
x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii
x c pre process the source ignoring ' include' lines
x c pre process the source ignoring ' define' and ' include' lines
x run it through a c beautifier
x examine the algorithm
x lint it
x compile it
x execute it
x
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests.
x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
x 'cleaned up' by the c pre processor and a c beautifier.
x
x your entry need not do well under all , or in most tests. in certain
x cases , a test is not important. entries that compete for the
x 'strangest most creative source layout' need not do as well as
x others in terms of their algorithm. on the other hand , given
x two such entries , we are more inclined to pick the entry that
x does something interesting when you run it.
x
x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules. as such , we leave
x the contest open for creative rule interpretation. as in real life
x programming , interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
x is important. for this reason , we often award 'worst abuse of the
x rules' to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way.
x
x if you do plan to abuse the rules , we suggest that you let us know
x in the remarks section. please note that an invitation to abuse
x is not an invitation to break. we are strict when it comes to the
x 3217 byte size limit. also , abusing the entry format tends to
x annoy more than amuse.
x
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules , and invite entries
x to attempt to exploit them. we will award 'worst abuse of the rules'
x and then plug the hole next year. even so , we will attempt to use
x the smallest plug needed , if not smaller. )
x
x check out your program and be sure that it works. we sometimes make
x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem , particularly
x in or near the final round. on the other hand , we have seen some
x of the best entries fall down because they did n't work.
x
x we tend to look down on a prime number printer , that claims that
x 16 is a prime number. if you do have a bug , you are better off
x documenting it. noting this entry sometimes prints the 4th power
x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry. and sometimes ,
x a strange bug feature can even help the entry ! of course , a correctly
x working entry is best.
x
x
xour likes and dislikes
x
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become 'old'. we
x tend to 'see thru' masses of defines due to our pre processor tests
x that we apply. simply abusing defines or dfoo bar wo n't go as far
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion.
x
x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code , and so do we
x
x define d define
x d foo do n't expect this to turn into define foo
x
x int i
x j do n't use such implicit type declaration
x int k
x
x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler. if you
x must use non ansi c , such as k r c , you must avoid areas that result in
x compile link errors for ansi c compilers.
x
x unfortunately , some ansi c compilers require array indexes to be of
x integral type. thus , the following classical obfuscation hacks should
x not be used in 1993. this rule may be relaxed in future contests.
x
x int i
x char c
x i c use c i instead
x (i 3) string use string i 3 instead
x
x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of
x arguments , be careful. systems implement va list as a wide variety
x of ways. because of this , a number of operations using va list are
x not portable and must not be used
x
x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable
x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable
x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg
x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg
x performing arithmetic on va list variables
x using va list as a structure or union
x
x in particular , do not treat va list variables as if they were a char 's.
x
x avoid using varargs.h , use stdarg.h instead.
x
x if you use c preprocessor directives ( define , if , ifdef , ...) ,
x the leading ' ' must be the first character on a line. while some
x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading ' ' , many do not.
x
x because the exit() function returns void on some systems , entries
x must not assume that it returns an int.
x
x small programs are best when they are short , obscure and concise.
x while such programs are not as complex as other winners , they do
x serve a useful purpose. they are often the only program that people
x attempt to completely understand. for this reason , we look for
x programs that are compact , and are instructional.
x
x one line programs should be short one line programs , say around 80
x bytes long. getting close to 160 bytes is a bit too long in our opinion.
x
x we tend to dislike programs that
x
x are very hardware specific
x are very os or un x version specific
x (index strchr differences are ok , but socket streams specific
x code is likely not to be)
x dump core or have compiler warnings
x (it is ok only if you warn us in the 'remark' header item)
x wo n't compile under both bsd or sys v un x
x abusing the build file to get around the size limit
x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs
x are longer than they need to be
x are similar to previous winners
x are identical to previous losers )
x
x unless you are cramped for space , or unless you are entering the
x 'best one liner' category , we suggest that you format your program
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines.
x
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size
x limit. it is one thing to make use of a several d 's to help out ,
x but it is quite another to use 200 bytes of d 's in order to
x try and squeeze the source under the size limit. you should feel
x free to make use of the build file space , but you are better off
x if you show some amount of restraint.
x
x we allowed whitespace , and in certain cases or do not impact
x your program size (up to a certain point) , because we want to get
x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters.
x
x given two versions of the same program , one that is a compact blob
x of code , and the other that is formatted more like a typical c
x program , we tend to favor the second version. of course , a third
x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
x and or obfuscated way , would definitely win over the first two !
x
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the 'smallest self replicating'
x program. we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
x to be the smallest. there is nothing wrong with self replicating
x programs. in fact , a number of winners have been self replicating.
x you might want to avoid the claim of 'smallest' , lest we (or others)
x know of a smaller one !
x
x x client entries should be as portable as possible. entries that
x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored. do n't
x depend on a particular type of display. for example , do n't depend
x on color or a given size. do n't require backing store.
x
x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and
x software that is not in wide spread use. we ask that such x client
x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the
x athena widget set (libx11.a , libxaw.a , libxmu.a and libxt.a).
x do n't use m tif , xv ew , or openl ok toolkits , since not everyone
x has them. avoid depending on a particular window manager. not
x everyone has x11r5 , and some people are stuck back in x11r4 (or
x earlier) , so try to target x11r5 without requiring x11r5. better
x yet , try to make your entry run on all version 11 x window systems.
x
x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on
x .xdefaults. if you must do so , be sure to note the required lines
x in the remark section.
x
x we like programs that
x
x are as concise and small as they need to be
x do something at least quasi interesting
x pass lint without complaint (not a requirement , but it is nice)
x are portable
x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation
x make us laugh and or throw up )
x
x some types of programs ca n't excel in some areas. of course , your
x program does n't have to excel in all areas , but doing well in several
x areas really does help.
x
x we freely admit that interesting , creative or humorous comments in
x the remark section helps your chance of winning. if you had to
x read of many twisted entries , you too would enjoy a good laugh or two.
x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well.
x
x be creative !
x
x
xentry format
x
x in order to help us process the many entries , we must request your
x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way. this format ,
x in addition , allows us to quickly separate information about the
x author from the program itself. (see judging process)
x
x we have provided the program , mkentry , as an example of how to
x format entries. you should be aware of the following warning that
x is found in mkentry.c
x
x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules. every
x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
x an entry that conforms to the contest rules. in all cases ,
x where this program differs from the contest rules , the
x contest rules will be used. be sure to check with the
x contest rules before submitting an entry.
x
x you are not required to use mkentry. it is convenient , however ,
x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files , and attempt to check
x the entry against the size rules.
x
x if you have any suggestions , comments , fixes or complaints about
x the mkentry.c program , please send email to the judges. (see below)
x
x the following is a sample entry
x
x entry
xrule 1993
xfix n
xtitle chonglab
xentry 0
xdate mon mar 1 08 45 20 1993
xhost un x v6 , pdp11 45
x 2.9bsd , pdp11 70
x remark
x this is a non obfuscated obfuscated c program.
x
x it is likely not to win a prize. but what do you expect from
x a short example !

x
x typically the build file should assume that the source is prog.c
x and will compile into prog. if an entry wins , we will rename
x its source and binary to avoid filename collision. by tradition ,
x we use the name of the entry 's title , followed by an optional
x digit in case of name conflicts.
x
x if the above entry somehow won the 'least likely to win' award ,
x we would use chonglab.c and chonglab.
x
x if your entry depends on , or requires that your build , source
x and or binary files be a particular name , please say so in the
x remark section. if this case applies , it would be be helpful
x if you did one of the following
x
x tell us how to change the filename(s) in your entry.
x
x have the build file make copies of the files. for example
x
x cc prog.c o special name need special binary
x
x or rm f special src.c need special source
x cp prog.c special src.c
x cc special src.c o special name
x
x or rm f special build need special build
x tail 4 build special build
x sh special build
x
x assume that we will use the entry title. send us a version of
x your build program files that uses the name convention. you
x should uuencode these files in data sections.
x
x if your entry needs to modify its source , info or binary files ,
x please say so in the remark section. you should try to avoid
x touching your original build , source and binary files. you should
x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify. this
x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch.
x
x remember that your entry may be built without a build file. we
x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile. if the
x build file must exist , say so in the remark section.
x
x if your entry needs special info files , you should uuencode them
x into info sections. in the case of multiple info files ,
x use multiple info sections. if no info files are needed ,
x then skip the info section.
x
x info files are intended to be input , or detailed information that
x does not fit well into the remark section. for example , an
x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample
x programs for the user to compile. an entry might want to include a
x lengthy design document , that might not be appropriate for a
x 'hints' file.
x
x info files should be used only to supplement your entry. for
x example , info files may provide sample input or detailed
x information about your entry. because they are supplemental ,
x the entry should not require them exist.
x
x in some cases , your info files might be renamed to avoid name
x conflicts. if info files should not be renamed for some reason ,
x say so in the remark section.
x
x info files must uudecode into the current directory. if they
x absolutely must be renamed , or moved into a sub directory , say
x so in the remark section.
x
x when submitting multiple entries , be sure that each entry has
x a unique entry number from 0 to 7. your first entry should
x have entry number 0.
x
x with the exception of the header , all text outside of the entry
x format may be ignored. that is , do n't place text outside of the
x entry and expect the judges to see it. (our decoding tools are n't
x ai progs ! ) if you need tell the the something , put it in the
x remark section , or send a email to the judges at
x
x ... ! apple , pyramid , sun , uunet ! hoptoad ! judges (not the address for
x judges@toad.com submitting entries)
x
x the date should be given with respect to utc. (some systems refer
x to this as gmt or gmt0) the format of the date should be that as
x returned by asctime() in the c locale. an example of such a string is
x
x thr apr 01 00 47 00 1993
x
x this format is similar to the output of the date(1) command. the
x string does not include the timezone name before the year. on many
x systems , one of the following command will produce a similar string
x
x date u a h d t 19 y
x date u sed e 's ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x sh c 'tz utc date sed e s ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x sh c 'tz gmt date sed e s ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x sh c 'tz gmt0 date sed e s ... (19 0 9 0 9 ) 1 '
x
x you are allowed to update fix revise your entry. to do so , set
x the 'fix' line in the entry section to 'y' instead of 'n'.
x be sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number
x as well , as these are used to determine which entry is to be
x replaced.
x
x
xjudging process
x
x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll.
x
x entries are unpacked into individual directories. the email message
x is unpacked into individual files , each containing
x
x entry section
x all author sections
x all info sections
x build section
x program section
x any other text , including the email message headers
x
x prior to judging , the 'any other text' file is scanned to be sure
x it does not contain useful information (or in case the entry was
x malformed and did not unpack correctly). information from the
x author sections are not read until the judging process is
x complete , and then only from entries that have won an award.
x
x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular
x individual. we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are
x until the final awards are given. we like the surprise of finding
x out in the end , who won and where they were from.
x
x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous , unless they win an award.
x because the main 'prize' of winning is being announced , we make all
x attempts to send non winners into oblivion. we remove all non winning
x files , and shred all related paper. by tradition , we do not even
x reveal the number of entries that we received. (for the curious ,
x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc
x winners at talks)
x
x after the usenix announcement , we attempt to send email to the
x authors of the winning entries. one reason we do this is to give
x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their
x entry. they are given the chance to correct mistakes , typos. we
x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well.
x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world.
x
x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds. during a round ,
x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles
x the pile that advances on to the next round , and the pile that does
x not. we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the
x previous round. thus , an entry gets at least two readings.
x
x a reading consists of a number of actions
x
x reading the entry section
x reading the uudecoded build section
x reading the uudecoded program section
x reading the uudecoded info section(s) , if any
x passing the source thru the c pre processor
x shipping over any include files
x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source
x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor
x shipping over any include files
x
x in later rounds , other actions are performed
x
x linting the source
x compiling building the source
x running the program
x performing misc tests on the source and binary
x
x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about 25 entries , entries
x are judged on an individual basis. an entry is set aside because it
x does not , in our opinion , meet the standard established by the round.
x when the number of entries thins to about 25 entries , we begin to form
x award categories. entries begin to compete with each other for awards.
x an entry often will compete in several categories.
x
x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries
x we receive. a typical category list might be
x
x best small one line program
x best small program
x strangest most creative source layout
x most useful obfuscated program
x best game that is obfuscated
x most creatively obfuscated program
x most deceptive c code
x best x client (see our likes and dislikes)
x best abuse of ansi c
x worst abuse of the rules
x anything else so strange that it deserves an award
x
x we do not limit ourselves to this list. for example , a few entries are so
x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round.
x we will invent awards categories for them , if necessary.
x
x in the final round process , we perform the difficult tasks of
x reducing the remaining entries (typically about 25) down to 8 or 10
x winners. often we are confident that the entries that make it into
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
x make it. the selection of the winners out of the final round , is
x less clear cut.
x
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win , but is beat out
x by a similar , but slightly better entry. for this reason , it is
x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry
x that failed to win in a previous year. this assumes , of course ,
x that the entry is worth improving in the first place !
x
x more often that not , we select a small entry (usually one line) , a
x strange creative layout entry , and an entry that abuses the contest
x rules in some way.
x
x in the end , we traditionally pick one entry as 'best'. sometimes such
x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry. more often , the
x 'best' is picked because it does well in a number of categories.
x
x
xannouncement of winners
x
x the first announcement , occurs at a summer usenix conference. by tradition ,
x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof , just prior to
x the berkeley bsd , and bsdi bof.
x
x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups
x
x comp.lang.c comp.unix.wizards alt.sources
x
x in addition , pointers to these postings are posted to the following
x
x comp.sources.d alt.sources.d misc.misc
x comp.sources.misc comp.windows.x
x
x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives. see
x below for details.
x
x often , winning entries are published in selected magazines. winners
x have appeared in books ( the new hackers dictionary ) and on t shirts.
x
x last , but not least , winners receive international fame and flames ! )

if you
look closely at motif , you will see that it is just ms windows
with more eye pleasing color and texture. the only real difference
is that an ms application window can contain other toplevel children ,
while a motif application window launches its children out onto the
desktop.

aab to those of you familiar with both guis , is this correct \? my experience
aab with x makes me think that this msw behavior is easily duplicated
aab with x11. but i do n't know msw...

another important difference is that msw does n't have any window that
handle sophisticated geometry management (like xmform). also , i believe
that in windows 3.x you 're limited to 64k of resources (windows , menus ,
icons , etc.).

imho this whole discussion named motif looks like ms windogs is totally
stupid. the only thing remotely influenced here can be the motif window
manager , that features an arrangement of buttons and menus somewhat
similiar to this of the ms w windowmanaging agent , however its name is.
but mwm is only a small part of motif , in fact , mwm and motif can work
without each other , and if one does n't like mwms outfit for some reason ,
he switches to another windowmanager. all this does n't influence motif ,
which is a toolkit of widgets to write applications , and this toolkit
is imho uncomparable to ms w , because it is much more wellorganized and
features alot of goodies more than the ms w interface.

you cannot say a porsche looks like a vw k fer only because they have the
wheel and the gear at the same position. motif and ms w are complete
different worlds , only one element of the motif world has some gear and wheel
at the same position as ms w.

no. even if you could , the answer could be out of date even before you
get it (even if you grab the server , it could be taken up by buffering
user actions). you should just try to do whatever you want a badalloc

greetings.

i am developing an application that allows a user to interactively
create edit view a visual model (i.e. topology) of their network , and
i was wondering if anyone knew of any builder tools that exist to
simplify this task.

in the past i have used visual edge 's uim x product to develop other
guis , so i am familiar with uimss in general.

the topology will support objects and connecting links. once the
topology is created , i want to provide the user with capabilities to
support grouping , zooming , etc.

i am looking for some form of a higher abstraction other than x drawing
routines to accomplish this. specifically , the zooming and grouping
aspects may prove difficult , and certainly time consuming , if i have
to roll my own .

suggestions \?

i am developing an x (xt , xm) application that will include a graphics window
of some sort with moving symbols among other things. a pure x application
could be implemented with motif widgets , one of which would be an
xmdrawingarea for drawing with xlib. but i would like to take advantage of
the graphics library (gl) available on our ibm rs 6000 (sgi 's gl i believe).

is it possible to mix x and gl in one application program \?
can i use gl subroutines in an xmdrawingarea or in an x window opened by me
with xopenwindow \?

there is a widget already defined for gl. it is the glxmdraw (motif) or
glxdraw (athena) widget. it is similar to a xmdrawingarea , except that it
allows you to use gl calls to render into the window. look at glxlink ,
glxunlink , glxgetconfig , and glxwinset in the man pages.

i have never used gl before , but the doc on gl winopen() says that the first
time winopen() is called it opens a connection to the server. also , most of
the gl calls do not require a display or gc , unlike most x calls. from this
initial information it appears that x and gl cannot be mixed easily. is this
true \?

the glxmdraw widget works pretty well. opengl will be an improvement.

does pex (graphigs \? ) have the same functionality of gl \?

i think gl is a little easier to use and a little more powerful , but
that 's just an opinion. mileage may vary.

there 's a bug in sunos 4.1.3 , which is alluded to in the faq (although
there it 's talking about x11r4 as being affected). you need to force
libxmu to be linked statically , rather than dynamically , which works
around the linker error. the simplest thing to do is edit each of
the makefiles where there 's a failure and change the line which reads
xmulib l (xmusrc) lxmu
to
xmulib l (xmusrc) bstatic lxmu bdynamic

no. this is only relevant for openwindows 3.x as shipped with sunos.
it is not relevant for mit r5. mit r5 should compile without problems.

sug cd 1992.1 is x11r5 and gnu on a cdrom , priced at 50 to sug
members , including a caddy !

sug 's emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible
service and value added to our members. last year , the sug 1991 disk
contained plug and play x11r4 , 20mb of additional essential binaries ,
almost 200mb of sun patches , fully indexed archives of sun related net
postings , priced at only 250.

our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be
produced inexpensively , but to continue to supply as much value added
as possible. to accomplish this , we will be putting out a two disk
set , the first containing what 's ready and needed now , the second
available later in '92 , containing more sparc binaries and other
useful material not found on previous disks.

the sug 1992.1 disk , which was assembled by robert a. bruce , contains
a lot of essential source code , and we decided it would be a great
service to make it available right away to our members (and this
pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member ! ) for 50 per
disk (including one of those hard to find caddies ! ). if you are not a
sug member , you can become one for an additional 40 if you live
within the us or 55 outside.

the sug 1992.1 cdrom is an iso 9660 disk (which means it can be used
by pc , macintosh , and other workstations as well) , and contains a
total of 543mb of material , including

x11r5 sources and core binaries (for sparc) as of several weeks after
the initial distribution , thus , four fixes and the the mit contrib 0

hi , i'm new to this group so please bear with me !

two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation
of raster files. with sunview becoming rapidly obselete , i 've
finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview.
i put together a quick test , and i 've found that xputimage()
is considerably slower (factor of 2 on average \? ) than the
sunview command pw rop() which moves image data from memory
pixrects to a canvas. this was on a sparc ipx. it seems that
(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down or
(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both ! my question is , what
is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window \? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server \? or am i stuck with
xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...) \?

all help appreciated...thanks !

animation is most frequently done by copying the the client resident ximages into
server resident pixmap(s) using xputimage. once this is done , the original ximages
can be deleted and the animation loop can be performed using xcopyarea from the pixmaps to the windows drawable.

hope this is helpfull.

this tutorial will discuss the steps necessary to convert a site from c
(extended with classc) to c . conversion of the source code requires
only a couple of steps
run the converter
fill in missing type information
describing this will not take long. the remainder of the day will be

1993 andrew technical conference and consortium annual meeting
june 24 25 , 1993
carnegie mellon university
pittsburgh , pa

the conference will be held on the last thursday and friday in june. a
tutorial will be on thursday the 24th and the conference proper on the
25th with the annual meeting at the dinner on the evening between the
two days. all conference attendees are welcome at the annual meeting ,
though only consortium members will be able to vote.

this year 's theme is

application construction by non programmers

much of the effort on x toolkits has been aimed at programmer
construction of applications. there have , however , been some excellent
uims systems built on top of x. papers addressing the theme will
consider questions such as
what is needed for application construction by non programmers \?
can we avoid programming altogether , or is a simple language needed \?
is it sufficient to create applications , or must users be able to
create new widgets \?
should widgets and applications be able to print themselves \?

your participation in the conference is welcome. papers are appropriate
on the theme or any aspect of the andrew user interface system , including

applications
experience with users
new objects
reviews of and proposals for revision of
internal andrew protocols

we expect to have an rs 6000 with video projector available if you would
like to do a demonstration.

paper proposals should be submitted by 15 may 1993.
acceptance will be 1 june with final papers due by 15 june.

send papers via electronic mail to wjh @andrew.cmu.edu.

subject drawing lines (inverse xor)
organization mit media laboratory
lines 40

i'm trying to write some code that lets me draw lines and do rubber band
boxes in motif x. i'm running on an 8 bit display for which i 've created a
colormap and am using almost all of the colors. i want to draw the lines
in a drawing area widget a widget in which i'm displaying a bitmap using
xputimage(). if does n't matter if the lines i draw interactively stay
around when the window is refreshed.

currently , to draw interactively , i begin with

drawindex is an colortable index i reserve for the foreground
my default bg color is the color index for the background of my image
palette colors drawindex .red palette colors my default bg color .red
palette colors drawindex .green palette colors my default bg color .green
palette colors drawindex .blue palette colors my default bg color .blue
xstorecolors( mydisplay , my cmap , palette colors drawindex , 1)
xflush( mydisplay)

xsetfunction( mydisplay , gc , gxxor)
xsetforeground( mydisplay , gc , drawindex)

then to draw i do

xdrawline( mydisplay , xtwindow( drawingarea1) , gc , x1 , y1 , x2 , y2)
xflush( mydisplay)

and when i'm all done , to return things to normal i do

xsetfunction( mydisplay , gc , gxcopy)


what i 'd like to happen is for the lines i draw to be the inverse of
whatever i'm drawing over. instead what happens is i get white lines. if
the lines are over a white background nothing shows up. if the lines are
over a black area nothing shows up ! it 's very strange. but the gxxor
function seems right since if i do a rubber banding box , it erases and
redraws itself correctly (ie. not disturbing the underlying image).

any suggestions what i'm doing wrong \?

i was wondering if it 's possible to change the window icons olwm
uses for things like xterm. most of the defaults are pretty lame.

any answer (or where i can find one) would be most appreciated.

window placement on screen


i would like to configure my system (a hp unix) to avoid that any corner
of a given window is displayed outside of the visible screen. the whole
window should be visible and it should be impossible to move any window
outside the visible aerea.

1. can this be done by configuring the window manager 's resources

2. can this be done on applikation level

3. a hardcoded solution is possible , but is it possible to have a
upper limit of a given window size


thank you for information and help

subject 92) topic building the x distribution topic needs updating to r5

subject 93) what 's a good source of information on configuring the x build \?

this faq includes information on a number of gotchas that can bite
you on particular system. however , the best source of general information on
building the x11 release is found in the release notes. the file is bundled
separately from the rest of the release , so if it 's become separated from your
sources you can ftp another copy separately the file relnotes. ms , ps , txt at
the top of the distribution. the file relnotes is also available from the
xstuff mail server.
in addition , o'reilly associates 's volume 8 on x administration
includes information on configuring and building x.


subject 94) why does n't my sun with a cg6 work with r5 \?

apparently gcc is the problem it seems to produce fine code for all
sun displays except for the cgsix. the new sungx.o distributed with fix 07
may fix the problem (note not known to work on solaris).


subject 95) why does n't my sun with sunos 4.1 know about dlsym , etc. \?

if you get errors with dlsym dlopen dlclose undefined , link with
libdl.a. add ldl to your and eventually your site.def. you may want to
surround it with bstatic ldl bdynamic if you add it to the extra libraries
variable , since syslibs get added after extra libraries on the eventual
compilation command otherwise you may not have a shared libdl. (or compile
the stubs shared.)

subject 96) what is this strange problem building x clients on sunos 4.1.2 \?

in sunos 4.1.2 sun fixed a shared library bug in ld which conflicts
with the way x11r4 builds the shared xmu library , causing these symbols to be
undefined when building some x11 clients
get wmshellwidgetclass
get applicationshellwidgetclass
compiling bstatic lxmu bdynamic appears to work.

to solve the problem if you are using openwindows 3.0 (x11r4 based xt) , please
contact your local sun office and request the following patches

greg earle , earle@sun.com 7 92

a source patch for use with the mit x11r4 libraries was developed by conrad
kimball (cek@sdc.boeing.com) it retrofits into r4 some fixes made in r5 to
get around this problem. the patch is on export in 1 93
contrib x11r4 sunos4.1.2 patch version3.z


subject 97) why ca n't gcc compile x11r4 on my sparc \?
i used gcc to compile the whole distribution , but i get several segmentation
faults when running x.

note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in
any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the
680x0 or vax platforms.

here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing
structures as arguments and returning them as function values , so when
gcc compiled parts of x are linked with sun supplied functions that pass or
return structs , run time errors occur. affected programs include rgb and
the server.

this is from the gcc manual

on the sparc , gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for
structures. it passes them by including their contents in the argument
list , whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by
reference.

this really ought to be fixed , but such calling conventions are not yet
supported in gnu cc , so it is n't straightforward to fix it.

the convention for structure returning is also incompatible , and
` fpcc struct return' does not help.

you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just
the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with
compilation flags.

files which need to be compiled using cc include
server os 4.2bsd oscolor.c
rgb rgb.c

in addition , several of the inet functions use structs as args or
return values
clients xhost xhost.c
clients xauth gethost.c.
calls to inet addr in lib clx socket.c and lib x xconndis.c are possibly
harmless as they do n't involve structs.

subject 98) what are these i o errors running x built with gcc \?
when i try to run xinit or the xsun server i get the error
getting interface configuration operation not supported on socket.
fatal server bug ! no screens found.

running the gcc fixincludes script apparently did n't work. you can do
this simple test

include sys ioctl.h
siocgifconf

run that through cc e and gcc e. the last line of output is the piece of
interest it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like
whitespace). if the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i' , your
fixincludes run did n't work for some reason or other go back to your gcc
sources and run `fixincludes` then rebuild the x distribution. if they are
identical , try running a make clean in mit server and rebuilding , just to make
sure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.

subject 99) what are these problems compiling x11r4 on the older sun3 \?
in mit server ddx sun suncg3c.c , we have found missing defines for
cg3ac monolen , cg3bc monolen , cg3ac enblen , cg3bc enblen. what should these be \?

the r4 errata list distributed after x11r4 mentions that you can add
these lines to the file on older sunos versions (e.g. 3.5) to compile
define cg3ac monolen (128 1024)
define cg3ac enblen cg3ac monolen
define cg3bc monolen cg3ac monolen
define cg3bc enblen cg3ac monolen

however , the sun3 should not actually ever have the cg3 device , and so
references to it can be removed from mit server ddx sun suninit.c and the
imakefile. 11 90


subject 100) what are these problems compiling the x server on sunos 4.1.1 \?
the file sundev cg6reg.h is n't being found.

sun omitted sundev cg6reg.h from sunos 4.1.1. remove the include
from suncg6c.c and replace it with the line
define cg6 vaddr color 0x70016000
the file has changed from earlier versions of sunos and should not be copied
from another distribution.


subject 101) what are these problems using r4 shared libraries on sunos 4 \?
all of the executables that i try to run have the following results
ld.so libxmu.so.4 not found
or even
ld.so call to undefined procedure gethostname from 0xf776a96c

if you are building with shared libraries on a sun , remember that you
need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries (if you 've
installed x on a file server , run it on the server 's clients , too). while
building and installing the distribution , you need to be careful to avoid
linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have (e.g. those
distributed with openwindows). you should make sure you do not have
ld library path set in your environment during the build or the installation.
if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs , please note that
the shared libraries must be installed in usr lib , usr local lib , or
usr 5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked
statically). courtesy mit x consortium
note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it
attempts , however , to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.
you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass bstatic to
most c compilers).


subject 102) can olit programs run with r5 xt \? ( xtqstring undefined)

this is a bug in the olit. xtqstring was an external symbol that existed in
x11r4 (upon which ow 3.0 's libxt is based). it was n't documented and was
removed in x11r5 (mit 's guarantee of upward compatibility between the r4 and r5
libraries only applied to the documented interface).

a workaround is to temporarily set your ld library path to point to the x11r4
or openwindows xt library that you linked the program against.

subject 103) how do i get around the sunos 4.1 security hole \?

there is a security problem with certain r4 clients (xterm and xload)
running under sunos 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using
shared libraries to avoid the problem , do one of these
1) make the program non setuid. you should consult your system
administrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and dev kmem) used
by these programs , to make sure that you do not create additional security
problems at your site.
2) relink the programs statically (using bstatic).
3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths
to the libraries.

from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (bob scheifler) , 12 90

the r5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the
newly installed libraries when xterm is being installed this prevents an suid
program from being built with libraries specified relatively. note that this
may cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from nfs mounted disks.
xload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.


subject 104) how do i get around the frame buffer security hole \?

on many systems the frame buffer is unsecured by default this permits
anyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by
accessing the frame buffer directly , or , as less of a privacy issue but perhaps
more annoying , to accidentally start up a second x session on your console
display. check the man page for fbtab(5).

subject 105) topic building x programs

subject 106) what is imake \?

imake is not a replacement for the make program instead , it is a
makefile generator that takes advantages of the include file and macro
processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles
suitable for building software on a particular system. although it is not
specific to x , the x release uses it to help solve a number of the
configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.
imake has a fairly steep learning curve , in part because the process by
which the system specific configuration files , system independent configuration
files , and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not
obvious.
there have been several different versions of imake the r3 , r4 , and
r5 versions are different.

you can obtain information on imake from these sources
the r4 and r5 release notes and imake man page include information on
using imake to build x
the r4 and r5 file mit config readme also contains useful information
on the r4 tapes , contrib doc imake imake.tex is mark moraes' r3 r4
guide to imake.
the r5 mit doc config usenixws paper.ms contains a paper by jim
fulton on an early version of imake
paul dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful
explanation of how imake works and how to use it in configuring x for non
supported systems the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu
in the directory ftp pub imake stuff look for config x11r4.ms (troff) and
config x11r4.ps (postscript). some supplemental appendices are nearby.

german readers should expect in june 1992 an article das meta make
i make , you make schwerelos by rainer klute in ix
multiuser multitasking magazin , directed at application programmers needing to
write imakefiles. an english language derivative of this article is in the
x journal , issue 2 1.

1 91 12 91 5 92 8 92


subject 107) where can i get imake \?

versions are distributed with the r4 and r5 releases. an earlier
version is distributed with the x11r3 release some third party toolkits
redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the
template and configuration files. there are no real standards for such
configuration files , although most current contributed software expects the
templates distributed with x11r5.
export contains the r5 distribution unpacked , so you can pick up imake
without picking up the entire distribution.
a stand alone version of imake , but one stemming from x11r5 , is in
ftp.germany.eu.net pub x11 misc imake imake pure.tar.z (192.76.144.75).


subject 108) i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile. what to do \?

if you have r4 or r5 installed on your system , run xmkmf . this is a
script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. the output is a
makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile. then run make ,
which will use that new makefile to compile the program.


subject 109) why ca n't i link to the xlib shape routines \?
when i try to compile certain programs , i get the following link error
undefined
xshapequeryextension
xshapecombinemask

these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x (shape)
which was introduced in the mit x11r4 distribution and allows non rectangular
windows. like the other sample server extensions , the shape extension will
only run on a server which supports it. pre x11r4 servers , as well as many
vendor supplied servers , do not support the shape extension , in which case
they will display rectangular windows anyway.

in order to use the shape extension , you must link to the library
libxext.a. in the x11r4 distribution , this library and the associated includes
will be in the mit extensions directory. if you do not have these files , do
not despair many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be
compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can
probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor supplied x
libraries.

subject 110) what are these problems with xtinherit not found on the sun \?
when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine i get the
error ld.so symbol not found xtinherit .

what you are seeing is a side effect of a kludge in the r4 libxt.a to
get sun shared libraries working. apparently , you ca n't share a function that
is both called and compared , as xtinherit is. this was handled by putting
xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used , thereby
guaranteeing that it would be loaded that is , in initialize.c , where
xttoolkitinitialize() and xtinitialize() reside. these routines would normally
be called.

you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal
xt based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize() anywhere.
1) it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a
connection to the x server. osf motif 's 1.1.0 uil had this problem it called
xtmalloc() and other xt functions. the solution is to add the call to your
program the function does not have to be executed , just linked in.
2) alternatively , your program does n't need any xt functions and is
correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize() it may be an xlib or xview
program. in this case , you can remove lxt from your link command.

it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically ,
although this will certainly solve the problem.

subject 111) why ca n't i compile my r3 xaw contrib programs under the new x \?
i have a program that worked well under x11r3. when i try to link it under
the current version of x , i get this message
undefined
xtscrollbarsetthumb
xttextsetinsertionpoint
xttextreplace

there were several name changes in the athena widget set (in addition
to the header files moving into x11 xaw ) these are mentioned in the r4
release notes. in this case , these functions are not really xt functions but
are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt to xaw .
10 90


subject 112) topic programming problems and puzzles

subject 113) why does n't my program get the keystrokes i select for (sic) \?

the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one
window to another. in order to get keystrokes , your program must ask the
window manager for the input focus. to do this , you must set up what are
called hints for the window manager. if your applications is xlib based , you
can use something like the following

xwmhints wmhints
...
wmhints.flags inputhint
wmhints.input true
xsetwmhints(dpy , window , wmhints)

if your application is based on the xt intrinsics , you can set the xtninput
resource to be true (as you probably want to in any case) if you do n't have
source , you can start up the application with the resource ' input true'.

certain window managers , notably dxwm and olwm , are very picky about having
this done.

if you are using sun 's openwindows olwm , you can also add this resource
to your defaults file to use clients that are n't icccm compliant.
openwindows.focuslenience true

mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun


subject 114) how do i figure out what window manager is running \?

you ca n't reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be
spoofed in any case.
for most cases , you should n't care which window manager is running , so
long as you do things in an icccm conformant manner. there are some cases in
which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for
particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can
sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. alternatively , it may
be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take
advantage of specific added features (such as olwm 's push pin menus) in order
to give your program added functionality. beware of usurping the window
manager 's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing
this surely leads to future compatibility problems.


subject 115) is there a skeleton x program available \?

there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the
macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development
under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional
development. in x , the problem is typically solved by using an interactive
application builder tool or by using cut paste on existing x applications. good
applications which you might look to manipulate when you want to test just
this one little thing include contrib clients xskel , a simple r4 program that
puts up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for
quick hacks , the xaw examples in the examples directory in the r3 and r4
distributions , and the xlib hello world example in the r3 doc helloworld and
r4 doc tutorials helloworld an updated version of this program which uses r4
xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in 2 90 to comp.windows.x
by glenn widener of tektronix. 3 90

in addition , a sample xt program (for xaw or xm) by rainer klute
showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display
connection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib mdisp.tar.z. 4 92


subject 116) why does xtgetvalues not work for me (sic) \?

the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is
sensitive to the type of variable. your code may be doing something like this

arg args 3
int i
int sensitive oops wrong data type
i 0
xtsetarg (args i , xtnsensitive , sensitive) i
xtgetvalues(widget , args , i )
...


but xtnsensitive is a boolean , which on most machines is a single byte
declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly. this problem
comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types
dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar
problems if those types are actually short. in general you are safe if you
use the actual type of the resource , as it appears in the widget 's man page.
11 90


subject 117) why do n't xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work \?

you 're probably trying to use these functions from application code.
they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a
parent widget to change the geometry of its children. other promising
functions , xtmakegeometryrequest() and xtmakeresizerequest() , are also for use
only by widgets , in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.
the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a
widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources.
although this will result in the widget internal functions' being called , your
application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the
widgets' data becoming corrupted.
the xlib calls xmovewindow() and xresizewindow() should similarly be
avoided they should n't be used to change xtnx , xtny , xtnwidth , or xtnheight.


subject 118) why is n't there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow \?

although there are various details of the current implementation of
the xt internals which make reparenting difficult , the major reason that no
such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for
the new widget should be. resources are typically set based on the location
in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves \?
what should happen to the widget 's children \? and by the time such semantics are
defined , there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old
widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired
resources , as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in
creating a new widget.

note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit.

the event mask for main win is
pposition psize structurenotifymask exposuremask keypressmask

i then create detail win.win with the following calls (hints has new values)

if anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail win.win

subject standard colormaps
organization mit microsystems technology laboratories

nntp posting host mtl.mit.edu

i'm working on an x11r5 application and have concerns regarding
standard colormaps.

the x11r5 documentation says usually , a window manager creates
these colormaps. i wonder what window manager the writer had
in mind. neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.

of course , one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.
however , xstdcmap does n't seem to try very hard to avoid
conflicts with the default colormap. when i use standard
colormaps created by xstdcmap , the rest of my display goes black.
so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very
problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid. perhaps
if every application used standard colormaps , things would
be wonderful. but not many applications seem to use
standard colormaps.

finally , the operation of the functions xmugetcolormapallocation ,
xmustandardcolormap , and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent
with the section 14.3 of the x11r5 xlib documentation.

according to the section 14.3 of the x11r5 xlib documentation (p. 436)

for grayscale colormaps , only the colormap , red max , red mult , and
base pixel members are defined. the other members are ignored.
to compute a grayscale pixel value , use the following expression

(gray red mult base pixel) 0xffffffff

xmugetcolormapallocation , defined in mit lib xmu cmapalloc.c , is
used by xmulookupstandardcolormap , defined in mit lib xmu lookupcmap.c
to select red max , green max , and blue max values for the
call to xmustandardcolormap. when the rgb gray map property is
specified , xmugetcolormapallocation sets red max to 30 of the
total number of cells in the gray scale , sets green max to 59
of the total number , and sets blue max ot 11 of the total number.
referring to section 14.3 , one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation
to set red max to the total number of cells in the gray scale.

when the rgb gray map property is specified , xmustandardcolormap ,
defined in mit lib xmu stdcmap.c , sets red mult , green mult ,
and blue mult all equal to 1. referring to section 14.3 ,
one would expect green mult and blue mult to be ignored.

when red mult , green mult , and blue mult all equal 1 ,
xmucreatecolormap , defined in mit lib xmu crcmap.c , constructs
a gray map. the sum of red max , green max , and blue max gives
the maximum gray value. referring to section 14.3 , on would
expect red max to give the maximum gray value.

do anyone know about any shading program based on xlib in the public domain \?
i need an example about how to allocate correct colormaps for the program.

appreciate the help.


i do n't know if this might help , but i 've just started playing with a program
called povray (persistance of vision raytracer) that also displays its output
via x windows. it does a fairly good job of allocating the colormap on my
psuedo color 8 plane display. i got the source from from a site in canda.
the person i retrieved them from was david buck (dbuck@ccs.carleton.ca).


i think the original post was searching for existing implementations of
f.i. gouroud shading of triangles. this is fairly complex to do with plain
x. simpler shading models are implemented already , f.i. in x3d (ask archie
where to get the latest version).
for gouroud , a fast implementation will be possible utilizing some extension
only , either mit shm to do the shade in an image and fast update the window
with it , or pex opengl which should be able to shade themselves. the portable
'vanilla x' way would be to shade in a normal ximage and use xputimage() ,
what would be good enough to do static things as f.i. fractal landscapes
or such stuff.

to speak about povray , the x previewer that comes with the original source
package is not that good , especially in speed , protocol friendlyness and
icccm compliance. have a look on x256q , my own preview code. it is on

141.76.1.11 pub gfx ray misc x256q

the readme states the points where it is better than xwindow.c from
povray 1.0

however i seem to get destroynotify events whenever i move windows. is

you seem to be a little confused. the socialistic hackers who yell
about proprietary software are hardly enamored of motif , which is just
as objectionable to that mindset as news is.

if i might wear my socialistic hacker hat for a moment , i tar news and
motif with the same brush , and that brush is not technical.

begging everyone 's pardon , i was not slamming motif , nor was i necessarily
plugging flaming the two. i was responding to the sweet blithe statement in
rick.734610425@digibd from rick@digibd.digibd.com (rick richardson)

rick this is one area where microsoft nt has a big advantage. since
rick they control the whole show , there are no issues like this where
rick licensees create incompatible defacto standards.

this happy statement shows a mindset that inventors and companies have when
they are pleased with something that works , and they believe that others will
also be happy to use it. i remember when sunview was hot stuff (and am not ,
by that statement , endorsing sun and its products , this is just my experience) ,
and when openwindows became hot stuff , that was when i started hearing , as
mentioned before , the socialistic masses that were bent on destroying
anything that was deemed proprietary , including openwindows. i mentioned
motif in the same breath , because that is what sun has decided to turn its
attention to , not because i hate it. mr. richardson 's position , i believe , is
a healthy one , and i am sure that the seething hackers will soon try to
flame and destroy nt , if it ever shows up , wanting instead everything to be
free , and then complaining when there is no organized structure and there are
no de facto standards.

it was just a vent for frustration brought on by prevailing winds.

these hints tell the window manager that the position and size of the window

manager that the values are prefered values of the program , not the user.

i am trying to use xcopyplane to copy a single plane
from a depth 8 pixmap to a depth 1 pixmap. everytime i
try this , i see absolutely nothing displayed. i know there
is data in the depth 8 pixmap becuase i have checked by doing
an xcopyarea to the screen.

i have been successful getting xcopyplane to work if i use
two pixmaps of depth 8. is there a problem with what i am
trying to do \? \?

could someone please scan my code segment and let me know
where i am going wrong...

i have created a xmdrawingarea widget called canvas.

w id xtwindow(canvas)
display xtdisplay(canvas)
screen defaultscreen (display)
pixmap8 xcreatepixmap (display , rootwindow (display , screen) ,
w width , w height , defaultdepth (display , screen))
pixmap1 xcreatepixmap (display , rootwindow (display , screen) ,
w width , w height , 1)

w gc8 xcreategc (display , w id , 0 , null)
w gc1 xcreategc (display , pixmap1 , 0 , null)

code to read xwd image into pixmap8 is omitted


have you set the foreground and background colors in w gc1 to
something other than 0 and 1 \? the whitepixel and blackpixel macros
on your server may not return values suitable for depth 1 drawables.


copy one plane into the depth 1 pixmap
xcopyplane (display , pixmap8 , pixmap1 ,
w gc1 , 0 , 0 , w width , w height , 0 , 0 , 16)


are you sure that the fifth plane of the data is n't all the same \? you could
have different pixel values in the image , but the fifth plane (0x10 16)
might all be the same value \?


using the depth 1 pixmap as the clipmask , copy it to the screen
values.foreground fg color
values.clip x origin 0
values.clip y origin 0
values.clip mask pixmap1
mask gcforeground gcclipmask
xchangegc (display , w gc8 , mask , values)

xfillrectangle (display , w id , w gc8 , 0 , 0 , w width , w height)



if you just want to see the plane of data and want better performance ,
do n't use clipmasks , just use pixmap1 as the stipple in a stippled
rectangle fill. many servers are very stupid about handling complex
clip lists , and turn a bitmap clip region into hundreds and hundreds of
little clipping rectangles , and clips every drawing primitive against every
one of these little triangles.


actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why graphics
do n't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle \?

for some reason the following code causes my x application to beep whenever i
intercept a keystroke and change it 's meaning. the intent of this code it to
allow date fields the following special keys

tt insert today 's date
bump day up by one
bump day down by one

i hardcoded some dates for this example. perhaps i should n't be using an
xmtext field for this.



for some reason the following code beeps whenever any of the special keys
of tt are hit. why \? the idea of this code is to interpret these
keys having the special meaning implied by the code. i would like to get
rid of the beeping but , as far as i can tell , i'm not doing the beep and
am at a lose as to understanding who and why the beeping is occuring.




code deleted...

from the xmtextfield man page (during discussion of resources)

xmnverifybell

specifies whether a bell will sound when an action is reversed
during a verification callback.

you are setting doit to false in the callback , and text field is beeping

while i cannot answer questions about running xdm over a decnet , i can
say that the following defines must be added to the site.def before
building r5 before any x clients will work over a decnet.

hi xperts !
i have a sparc 1 with very limited disk space on usr partition.
previously , i was able to run all x windows applications and then
i upgraded my system to sun o.s. 4.1.3 and realized that , the hard
disk did not have enough space to load openwindows. my immediate alternative
was to load only the neccessary files to boot the system. this resulted in
not loading openwindows. as a result of which none of the x libraries got loaded.

i am trying to load just the libraries and include files and bin x11 files
required for running x windows and compiling my programs written for xlib and xaw.
in a desperate effort to regain x windows , i retrieved usr lib libx . files from
the tape . usr bin x11 and usr include x11 . is this enough for running x windows

but i did not get usr lib x11 fonts sub directories . these are mainly 100dpi , 75dpi
and misc.

when i run xinit , the error message says usr lib x11 fonts 100dpi etc are not in the
default path. but the problem is i cannot load any of those directories as there is no
disk space.
are there any temporary suggestions before i get a 1.5 gb disk and load openwindows , to
just have my x windows running.

thanks

make sure you 're using ssetroot , which comes with tvtwm. when tvtwm
starts up , it nukes the existing root window. use an ssetroot after
tvtwm starts up. (you could spawn off a (sleep 10 ssetroot ...) )
you can also use virtualdesktopbackgroundpixmap filename or just
virtualdesktopbackground if you just want another color besides grey.

ii) when i open an xterm on the sparc 10 , not all of the keys are recognised
and some keys on the keyboard are not sending the correct characters.

did you install the sunkbd patch \? it 's in the contrib directory on export.
all the keys on my keyboard send events properly , except the following
the end , pageup , pagedown on the 6 key cluster are n't recognized.
even the compose key works. (though i ca n't seem to get the composed

actually , i must also ask the faq 's 1 most popular reason why graphics
do n't show up do you wait for an expose event before drawing your
rectangle \?

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
xlib graphics. a button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()
(or equiv) directly instead , it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the expose event handler take care
of rendering the image because at that time it is guaranteed that the
window is mapped.

the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window
is visible and mapped. do you know the best way to tickle a window so
that the expose event handler will be invoked to draw this new item \?


what does this have to do with my original question \? \? \? i previously
stated that i did an xcopyarea of the depth 8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data , and it did. this is not
a problem with expose events , it has to do with xcopyplane not
working ! ! !

does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
xcopyplane works \? \? \? this would be very helpful !

sunview command pw rop() which moves image data from memory

(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down or
(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both !

using xputimage , your source is maintained by the client and the
destination is maintained by the server , thus you incur the overhead
of transporting through whatever client server communications
mechanism you are using.

is it possible for you to maintain your source images in pixmaps \?
these are maintained by the server , so copying them into a window is
much cheaper.

also make sure you are not sending any unnecessary xsyncs , or running

subject vanishing font problem....
organization department of mathematics , queen 's university at kingston
lines 25

a colleague has a bizarre font problem on his new mips workstation.
when he first logs on (via xdm) , he has a single xterm window appear
with the mwm window manager running. in this configuration , x windows
applications (particularly xdvi) work fine. however , if he opens up a
second xterm application , suddenly xdvi cannot start in either window ,
giving the error unable to load iso 8859 1 font.

the only difference between the two xterm windows is that the initial
one references a different name in the xsession file , with prettier
colours and other slight changes. further investigation shows that only
opening a default xterm causes this behaviour , and more significant , all
x applications can no longer load any fonts if they are invoked from the
command line in either window. if i start the xterm with a different
font (using the fn option) , no problems. it would seem that the
default xterm is loading a font which somehow causes the server to lose
all of its fonts. note xlsfonts in either window shows all of the
fonts available , so there does n't appear to be a problem in the font
directories hash tables.

other than rewriting the xterm app defaults file to use a different
font and hope for the best , does anyone have any ideas \?

more info this is the most recent mips workstation (r4000 i believe) ,
with the most current operating system and running x11r5.
it is not mwm 's fault , as the same problems occur under twm , etc.

you are right in supposing that the problem is with the xmncolormap
(xtncolormap for truly literate beings) not being set. what you want
to do is start your application with your new colormap. this can be a

you can get more info by sending email to (appropriately) info@qdeck.com.

actually , info@qdeck.com is our customer service department. if you have
technical questions , you can write to support@qdeck.com.

in my opinion , if you want to have other people logging in and running
applications at your pc , you 'll want to have a 486 33 with 16 megs of ram.
also , the xwindows software in desqviewx really seems to like an et 4000
(tseng labs chipset) based graphics card. personally , i found that things
ran better with a scsi drive in the pc than with esdi drives , but that is
my experience only

what sort of traffic is generated with the x calls \? i am curious to find
out the required bandwidth that a link must have if one machine running
dv x is supporting multiple users (clients) and we require adequate response
time. anyone have any ideas \? \?

i expect the limiting factor will be your server machine , not the network
itself. to give you a real world example , here at quarterdeck we have
roughly 100 people using dvx to talk to a bunch of unix boxes , novell
file servers , and each other. it 's not too much of a load on our
ethernet (with maybe 4 concentrators , so you have 20 30 people on each
segment). if you had a badly loaded net , or the apps you wanted to run
were very network intensive , you could run into some slowdowns.

but the biggest problem would be the machine itself. say you have a 486
33 with plenty of ram and a fast hard disk and network card. if you have
10 people running programs off it , you 're going to see some slowdowns
because you 're now on (effectively) a 3.3 mhz 486. of course , dvx will
attempt to see if tasks are idle and make sure they give up their time
slice , but if you have 10 working programs running , you 'll know it.

having said that , if you can tweak the programs being run (by adding
in calls to give up time slices when idle and that sort of
thing) , you could probably run 15 20 people on a given machine before
you started seeing slowdowns again (this time from network bandwidth).
it all really depends on what the programs are doing (ie. you 're going
to see a slowdown from x bandwidth a lot sooner if your apps are all
doing network things also...)

i posted this a while ago and did n't receive one reply , and now we
have another bug report on the same subject. can anybody help me out \?

the problem is that motif uses xgrabkey to implement menu accelerators ,
and these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply. unfortunately ,
the specification for xgrabkey does n't allow anymodifier to be combined
with other modifiers , which is exactly what would be desired in this case
ctrl any key q .

in ora vol. 6 , in the section on accelerators it says for information
on how to specify translation tables see vol. 4... , this is so you
know what to put for the xmnaccelerator resource. if you go to
vol. 4 it says , likewise , if a modifier is specified , there is
nothing to prohibit other modifiers from being present as well. for
example , the translation
shift key q quit()
will take effect even if the ctrl key is held down at the same time as
the shift key (and the q key).

this is true for accelerators and mnemonics , which are implemented using
event handlers instead of grabs it 's not true for menu accelerators. if
you 're a motif implementor , i 'd suggest lobbying to get the xlib semantics
changed to support the feature i described above. otherwise , change the
documentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user 's
expectations , because menu accelerators are not the same thing as
translations.

is it possible to supply 1 accelerator for a menu entry \?

if you mean menu accelerator , no it 's not possible. that 's according to
the definition of the xmnaccelerator resource in the xmlabel manual page.

keep in mind when answering this question that when using motif you
ca n't use xtinstallaccelerators().

i ca n't think of a reason why not.

how can you ensure that accelerators work the same independent of
case \? what i want is ctrl o and ctrl o to both be accelerators on one
menu entry.

i find this thread on motif accelerators absoultly amazing. if i were
writing an interface to keyboard accelerators , i would have one
resource called accelerators that took a translation table , period.
i would also implement it so that programmer never has to do any work
to get the accelerators installed. as soon as the end user specified
one , it would be active and automatically installed.

to get multiple accelerators on a single menu item i 'd do something like

menuitem.accelerators override n
ctrl key m fire() n
shift key l fire() n

the accelerators would work exactly like translations and you would
automatically see a ctrl m show up in your menuitem object.

why in the world is the motif stuff so complicated with so many different
special cases depending on what type of widget you 're dealing with \? there
has to be some reason.

sorry for the political tone of this message...

i am using an x server that provides 3 visuals pseudocolor 8 bit ,
truecolor 24 bit and directcolor 24 bit.

lucky dog... )

a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is
different from the visual of the parent (which uses the default
visual which is tc24).

in the xlib reference guide from 'o reilly one can read in the
section about xcteatewindow , something like
in the current implementation of x11 when using a visual other
than the parent 's , be sure to create or find a suitable colourmap
which is to be used in the window attributes when creating , or
else a badmatch occurs.

this warning , strangely enough , is only mentioned in the newer
editions of the x11r5 guides.

it applies with equal force to earlier versions. presumably only
recently did the author(s) decide it was important enough to mention.
the necessity it refers to has always been there , but it 's been
implicit in the way createwindow requests default some attributes of
the new window.

however , even if i pass along a suitable colourmap , i still get a
badmatch when i create a window with a non default visual.

attr.colormap cmap
win xcreatewindow(
...
copyfromparent , border width
8 , depth
inputoutput , class
vinfo.visual , visual
cwcolormap ,
attr
)

this is because the warning you read is incomplete. you have to
provide not only a colormap but also a border. the default border is
copyfromparent , which is not valid when the window 's depth does n't
match its parent 's. specify a border pixmap of the correct depth , or a
border pixel , and the problem should go away.

there is another problem i ca n't find anything to indicate that
copyfromparent makes any sense as the border width parameter to
xcreatewindow. your xlib implementation probably defines
copyfromparent as zero , to simplify the conversion to wire format , so
you are unwittingly asking for a border width of zero , due to the xlib
implementation not providing stricter type checking. (to be fair , i'm
not entirely certain it 's possible for xlib to catch this.)

of format to the other hds uses different font format from sgi worksation.
so , i have the following questions

1. how do you resolve different font formats from different machines \?

2. is there a program to convert one type of font format to another \?

if you have similar problems experiences and have found a solution , please
let me know. your help will be greatly appreciated !

thank you in advance for your help and information.

in my opinion , a programming degree is still worth having.

yes , but a cs degree is not a programming degree. does anybody know of
a computing course where programming is taught \? computer science is
a branch of maths (or the course i did was).
i 've also done a software engineering course much more practical and likely
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants , rather than what they think
they want , but also did not teach programming. the ability to program was
an entry requirement.

at robert gordon university , programming was the main (most time consuming)
start of the course. the first two years consisted of five subjects
software engineering (pascal c unix) , computer engineering (6502 6809 68000
assembler) , computer theory (lisp prolog) , mathematics statistics and
communication skills (how to pass interviews intelligence tests and group
discussions e.g. how to survive a helicopter crash in the north sea).
the third year (industrial placement) was spent working for a computer company
for a year. the company could be anywhere in europe (there was a special
travel allowance scheme to cover the visiting costs of professors).
the fourth year included operating systems(c modula 2) , software engineering
(c 8086 assembler) , real time laboratory (c 68000 assembler) and computing
theory (lisp). there were also group projects in 2nd and 4th years , where
students worked in teams to select their own project or decide to work for an
outside company (the only disadvantage being that specifications would change
suddenly).

in the first four years , there was a 50 50 weighting between courseworks and
exams for most subjects. however in the honours year , this was reduced to a
30 70 split between an individual project and final exams (no coursework
assessment) are all computer science courses like this \?

btw we started off with 22 students in our first year and were left with 8 by
honours year. also , every course is tutored separately. not easy trying
to sleep when you are in 8 student class ).

i do n't know a great deal about the support for c in uim x , but i can tell
you that there is good support for it in teleuse. in teleuse you can call any
c method from a d module. what you can do then is to use the d language
for most of your interface code and then use c for you application code.

i should tell you that there is some real neat stuff coming out of teleuse soon
in regard to c , but i ca n't give you many details. you should talk to your local sales rep and get the lowdown on what they will be doing in the near furture.

if you want example code of how c integrates with teleuse you should look at

how can i do it \?

almost all window managers (twm , mwm , olwm and their derivates) support
escape sequences for it. for your purpose put following into your
.login (if you 're using csh or tcsh) , for sh you have to modify it.

if ( term xterm ) then
echo 2 logname @ host g 1 host g
endif


1) this is not a feature of the window manager but of xterm.
2) this sequences are not ansi compatible , are they \?
does anyone know if there are compatible sequences for this and what they
are \? i would think they are dcs (device control sequence) introduced ,
but may be a csi sequence exists , too \?
this must work on a dxterm (vt and ansi compatible) , it may not work
on xterms.

it works on xterms. at least i have no problem with it. back to the original
question

i usually start new xterms by selecting the proper menu entry in my desktop
menu. here is a sample command

xterm sl 999 n ls12i title ls12i e rlogin ls12i

the n and title options give the text for window and icon. as i use the
tcsh (a wonderful extension of the csh) , i can do the following

i have an

alias precmd echo n ' 2 host cwd g'

in my .tcshrc. this is a special alias for tvtwm. it is executed each time
before printing the prompt. so , i have the current host name and the current
directory path in the title bar of my xterms.

how can i do it \?

apologies if i'm answering something already answered in the faq.
our news feed has been losing a lot of articles lately so i have n't
seen the faq lately to check.


two ways

1) when you start the xterm , you can use command line options
n icon name to set the icon label
t window title to set the window title
title window title equivalent to t window title

2) you can use escape sequences to change things on the fly

the basic escape sequence is
esc p some arbitary text bel

where esc and bel are the ascii escape and bell characters ,
p is an ascii decimal digit '2' , '1' , or '0' , depending
on whether you are trying to set the window or icon title ,
or both , and some arbitary text is your desired label string.

hence , this command will set the window icon title
echo 033 0 your title goes here 007 c

to set just the icon title
echo 033 1 your title goes here 007 c

to set just the window title
echo 033 2 your title goes here 007 c

of course , you may have to fiddle with exact syntax ,
depending on how the echo command works on your system
and what shell you are using (i 've shown system v semantics
under bourne or korn shells).

hint for sun os users use usr 5bin echo instead of
bin echo or csh 's built in echo. otherwise you 'll have
to embed literal esc and bel characters in the string
instead of using convenient octal sequences.

if you want your titlebar updated continously , say to show
your current directory , hostname , or somesuch , then you 'll
have to see if you can coerce your shell into spitting out
the appropriate escape sequences when it prompts for commands.
sometimes you can just put the appropriate escape sequence
in the prompt string itself , sometimes not ...

xdm does xgrabserver when it 's running in secure mode (so do some
screen locks). there 's really no simple way to tell this is the case.

you can take xdm out of secure mode probably not too cool.

you can wrap your call to xopendisplay in some code which solicts
a future sigalrm and longjmps past the xopendisplay from the signal
handler. an example of this can be seen in the xdm sources.

note that longjmping out of xopendisplay probably causes a memory
leak any program functioning this way probably needs to exit()

...let me point out that both gui based word processors and text based
formatters both have a language one happens to be mouse and
action based , and the other symbol based.

true , but that 's beside the point. this is a fact about an abstract model
of what the gui users are doing , not about what they actually are doing.
this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer
of the system. (nb some users may see it , too , but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer.)

i'm not saying that the programmer 's perspective is evil or stunted. after
all , that 's what i do , too ! i am saying that ui designers must carefully
distinguish between the user programmer conceptual models , and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system , not the builder of the system.


i do n't recall the actual stats , but something like 1 in 5 people can be
categorized as a symbol manipulator .

it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim. at any rate , i do n't think this is evidence that 20 of users think
like programmers. bankers , financial analysts , structural engineers
these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation. but what they do is not programming , and programming is not
required to do what they do.

to restate my previous point yes , users want to build their own solutions
no , they do not want to do programming to accomplish this.

is some predefined function that will do this for me \?


if you are using the intrinsics , it is parsed for you. if you are working
at the xlib level , you can parse it yourself or you can use the following
bit of code.

static xrmoptiondescrec options
geometry , .geometry , xrmoptionseparg , (xpointer)null


define number(x) (sizeof(x) sizeof(x 0 ))
xrmparsecommand(db , options , number(options) , myapplication , argc , argv)

then use xrmgetresource() to retrieve the value and parse it using
xparsegeometry().

it is probably quicker to parse it yourself from argv , however , i much prefer
using the x resource management routines to do this.

how many people 'out there' would be interested to join a mailing list , where
people can ask questions about motif , swap stories , and give new ideas about
new directions and improvements for the bindings. this would benefit the
user community , as well as give me more insight in what people would like to
see added to motif . motif is still very much a voluntary project , and this
way i can make a list of priorities , in what order things should be added , or
changed.

if you 're interested in joining such a mailing list , please take the time to
reply to this message , and tell me so. when there is sufficient interest , say
about 20 people or more , a mailing list will be set up at my site , and i will
post the announcement of the newly created list to this and other newsgroups.

(2nd posting of the question that just does n't seem to get answered)

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains
xlib graphics. a button widget , when pressed , will cause a new item
to be drawn in the window. this action clearly should not call xcopyarea()
(or equiv) directly instead , it should register the existence of the new
item in a memory structure and let the same expose event handler that handles
regular expose events (e.g. window manager driven exposures) take care
of rendering the new image. using an expose event handler is a proper way
to do this because at the time the handler is called , the xlib window is
guaranteed to be mapped.

the problem , of course , is that no expose event is generated if the window
is already visible and mapped. what we need to do is somehow tickle the
window so that the expose handler is hit with arguments that will enable
it to render just the part of the window that contains the new item.

what is the best way to tickle a window to produce this behavior \?

if i understand your problem correctly , you want to have a way to send
exposures to your manager widget when your app specific code draws xlib
graphics on the window.

it sounds like you might want to send an exposure using
xsendevent and specifying a region. if you know the region you need to
send the exposure , generally you have the bounding rectangle of the objects ,
you can use xcreateregion to create a region , xunionrectwithregion to add the
new object polygons to the region , and then either use the region
to clip your gc for the redraw or use xrectinregion to test which of your
other objects need to be redrawn. keeping in mind that the stacking order
of overlapping objects affects how they look.

hope it helps

to motif@alfalfa.com , xpert@expo.lcs.mit.edu

according to the osf motif style guide , one should use cursor shapes to give
the user a visual clue of what is happening or what is expected of him. so
a hourglass cursor should be shown when the application is busy , or a
caution cursor should be shown over an area when input is expected in
another. defining cursors for widgets has to be done at rather low level.
so defining a cursor for all widgets in an application but not for a certain
subpart of it , is a rather complicated matter. when cursors have been defined
for some windows , e.g. a crosswire cursor for a drawingarea , things get even
more complicated. my intuition says that things should be easier , but is this
so \? if anyone has a solid and complete solution to my problem , please let me
know. the topics on busy cursors in the several faq 's are not helpful , since
they only work for applications where all windows have the cursor window
attribute set to 'none'.

i posted about this a while ago but without code excerpts noone was
able to help me.

the problem is that main win.win is doing fine , but when i create
detail win.win , it does not receive it 's initial expose events until
main win.win receives an event. here are the relevent calls

main win.win xcreatesimplewindow (mydisplay , defaultrootwindow(mydisplay) ,
myhint.x , myhint.y , myhint.width , myhint.height ,
main win.line thick , fg , bg)
xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay , main win.win , main win.text ,
main win.text , none , argv , argc , myhint)
main win.gc xcreategc (mydisplay , main win.win , 0 , 0)
xmapraised (mydisplay , detail win.win)
xmapsubwindows (mydisplay , main win.win)
the event mask for main win is
pposition psize structurenotifymask exposuremask keypressmask
enterwindowmask leavewindowmask
the flags are
pposition psize

i then create detail win.win with the following calls (hints has new values)
detail win.win xcreatesimplewindow (mydisplay , defaultrootwindow(mydisplay) ,
myhint.x , myhint.y , myhint.width , myhint.height ,
detail win.line thick , fg , bg)
xsetstandardproperties(mydisplay , main win.win , detail win.text ,
detail win.text , none , argv , argc , myhint)
detail win.gc xcreategc (mydisplay , detail win.win , 0 , 0)
xmapraised (mydisplay , detail win.win)
event mask and flags are identical to main win 's flags and event mask.


if anybody has any idea why the initial expose events of detail win.win
are not received until main win.win receives an event i 'd love to hear
from them. other that that everything works great so there must be some
detail i'm overseeing.

again , poseted for a friend

okay , i got such great response from my last question (thanks , everyone) ,
lets try again

how can i tell if a colorcell is read only \?

i want to use any read only cells that are already in my colormap
once i start running out of allocatable cells , using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color.

once i determine if a cell is read only , i assume i can then just request
an xalloccolor() with the exact same color specifications and it will
then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it does n't later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as read write to another
application.

so far , the only way i 've figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors , once my
colormap is all full up. it should error out if the cell is non shareable.
but life would be much easier if i could just detect the
read only shareable stuff directly...

any ideas \?

keywords imake
organization prc , inc.
lines 29


i am trying to build and use imake (x11r4) on an ibm rs 6000 running aix v3.2.
i am having the following 2 problems.

(1) many of my imakefile 's have contructs like
this is a makefile
at the start of lines to pass makefile comments thru the c
preprocessor and into the makefile. most of the c preprocessors that
i have used will not treat such a as appearing at the start of the
line. thus the c preprocessor does not treat the hash symbol as the
start of a directive.

however the ibm cpp strips the comment and treats the hash symbol
as the start of a directive. the cpp fails when it determines
that this is not a known directive. i have temporarily hacked my
imake to handle this situation but would like to come up with a better
fix.

(2) several imakefiles use as a parameter to a macro when a particular
use of the macro does not need a value for the parameter. the aix cpp
gives warnings about these situations but continues to work ok.

if you are familiar with these problems and have solutions , i would appreciate
information about on your solutions. (perhaps , this is solved in a later
version of imake that i have not reviewed.) also , do you know of other cpp 's
that behave similarly \?

since i do not have easy access to news , a response to
'white billy@po.gis.prc.com' would be appreciated.

suppose you have an idle app with a realized and mapped window that contains

what does this have to do with my original question \? \? \? i previously
stated that i did an xcopyarea of the depth 8 pixmap to the screen
just to make sure that my image had data , and it did. this is not
a problem with expose events , it has to do with xcopyplane not
working ! ! !

does anyone have a code fragment they could send demonstrating that
xcopyplane works \? \? \? this would be very helpful !

thanks !

what it has to do with your original question is this many times
beginning x users (heck , experienced x users too ! ) write small test
programs. many times they forget to draw only in response to expose
events , and thus see unpreditable results whereby sometimes the application 's
graphics show up , and sometimes they do n't. we 're just trying to
eliminate all the easy explanations for why you 're not seeing your
graphics.

that being said , why do n't you try copying different planes to your
window other than 16 ( 1 4). try 1 , 1 1 , 1 2 , ... , 1 7
to see it you get any output. since you 're dipslaying only a single
plane of your data , it 's possible that all the pixel values in your
pixmap have the same value for that color plane.

evidenced by the large number of cs people who are employed via contracts

a generalization which obviously does n't always hold true , but there are

stolk@fwi.uva.nl writes


a problem occurs when i try to create a window with a visual that is different
from the visual of the parent (which uses the default visual which is tc24).


you 've got to set border pixel in your window attributes. the default
is copyfromparent which gives the badmatch. do this

...
unsigned long valuemask
...

if border width is non zero you 'd better alloc a colour from cmap
rather than use any old pixel value. also , use valuemask , it makes
the code more obvious.

attr.colormap cmap
attr.border pixel 0
valuemask cwcolormap cwborderpixel
win xcreatewindow(
dpy ,
defaultrootwindow(dpy) ,
10 , 10 ,
width , height ,
0 , border width. see comment below
8 , depth
inputoutput , class
vinfo.visual , visual
valuemask ,
attr
)

a note on border width your code looked like this

win xcreatewindow(
dpy ,
defaultrootwindow(dpy) ,
10 , 10 ,
width , height ,
copyfromparent , border width
8 , depth
inputoutput , class
vinfo.visual , visual
cwcolormap ,
attr
)

border width set to copyfromparent works but does n't make sense.
border width should be an unsigned int. you get away with it because
copyfromparent is define'ed to be zero in x.h. if it happened to be
defined as 1 you 'd get a very interesting looking window !

motif managers take a very simplistic approach to the way they handle events
for gadgets they track for all events(such as motion notify) wether or not
the gadget expresses interest in the events. as a result , gadgets typically
generate a great deal more network traffic. those with x terminals might find
a noticable network performance drop as a result.

really \? what 's the point using gadgets then \?

it is a case of memory vs. network performance tradeoff. gadgets
save both client and server memory. but memory is easily expandable while
network performance is not , so if i were designing motif i would
at least make it possible to avoid using gadgets. at present you
really do n't have a choice because motif forces you to use gadgets
in menus and in various other places.

i 've been using the xmgraph widget that 's been floating around and i
noticed the performance is significantly better using gadgets , perhaps
even 100 faster. i had heard in an old programming course that gadgets
were no longer any benefit to performance , and that it 's just as well
to use widgets everywhere. so why would 50 pushbutton gadgets be a lot
quicker than 50 pushbuttons in the graph \? should i start putting gadgets
back into my long pulldown menus \?

xmgraph manages children connected by xmarc widgets in a directed network
type graph with automatic layout capability.

i am reposting this because i am not sure my first post ever made it out.
i have built and installed x11r5 on my sparcstation 2. my aim is to run
the mit x server but retain the openlook window manager. i am sure this
is not uncommon , but i just want to make sure that i change and or delete
everything that i need to. for instance , i can start xdm in rc.local , but
how do i get rid of xnews \?


the openlook window manager source is available on the mit contrib tapes
or from export.lcs.mit.edu .i would suggest building this too , rather than
using the version from openwindows. it is olwm v3.


i would suggest skipping olwm and getting olvwm instead. this version of the
olwm window manager implements a virtual desktop that i find really handy even
on large monitors.

this version is also available at export.lcs.mit.edu contrib olvwm3.tar.z.
the readme file also suggest getting the files in contrib xview3.

in my case , i built the x server first , xview second , then olvwm. all of these
were installed into usr x5. once i verified the server worked correctly ,
i happily issued rm rf usr openwin .

using gcc 2.3.3 to build all of the above resulted in a windowing system that
is , for all intents and purposes , identical to openwindows 3.0 and that is
incredibly faster. there is a bit of tweaking you will have to do if you want
things to work exactly like openwindows , but not much.

can anyone recomend a good book or article on inter client communications

i 've looked everywhere i can and it seems everyone tells you how to do it
but nobody shows you how. o'reilly has no examples , iccm has no examples ,
asente swick give no examples in fact most of the books i 've looked at ,
if they discuss icc at all , simply give a condensed version of the iccm and
then refer you to the iccm. i did find one example of how to use atoms and
properties in young 's book and five hours after i bought young 's book i had
my applications talking to each other.

i am not sure , however , if thats the best way. i 'd like to stay independent
of unix so pipes and or sockets probably are n't the way to go. but within x
one can also use messages , the clipboard , and perhaps window groups.

i need a text that discusses the various methods , discusses which method is best
for which purpose , and gives examples. without examples it 's all just words.

hello...

i wonder if some one can suggest an answer to the following question
i am a total x novice and would appreciate any suggestions you may have.

i am trying to create a simple drawing tool....








let 's say i have two rectangles on the canvas(see above)
one intersecting the other...
now , i would like to delete one of the rectangles.
the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the
gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection the pixel
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white , which is
something that should be avoided.

is there any way i can avoid this problem without having to redraw the other
rectangle too \?
i also would not like to generate an expose event for the affected area
as this degrades performance very badly...


thank you...

question
what is the exact entry (parameter and syntax please) , in the x terminal
configuration file (loaded when the x terminal boots) , to add another system
to the tcp ip access control list \?

background
i have two unix systems , 1. an at t 3b2 running x11r3 and mit 's x11r4 and
2. a sun ss10 without any x.
i want to have a window to the sun and the 3b2 on the ncd x terminal at the
same time. i can do this if i manually set the network parameter tcp ip
access control list to off , then login to my telnet session. not great !
i 've tried to get xhost to work and failed. either my syntax is wrong
or the x11r3 implementation is bogus.
i am trying to edit the ncd configuration file that is loaded when the
ncd boots. no matter what entry i add or edit , the ncd still boots with
the tcp ip access control list containing only the 3b2.
my manuals are worthless so any help would be most appreciated ! ! thanks !

hi folks.

as part of my self introduction to x i 've been trying to do some simple
icon animation (sort of like icondoit from mswindows). changing your
own applications icon is fairly simple if you have a widget id you can
just xtsetvalues on xtniconifypixmap (or whatever) and you 're done. alternately
you can set window manager hints. these methods do n't seem to work with
icons which your application does n't specifically own.

in my situation i have to change the icon of random windows sitting there in
my icon box so my question is given a window id , how do you change the
icon pixure \? a working example would be very much appreciated. if it makes
any difference , i'm using motif 1.1 on vms t6.0 5ke.

thanks

the ability to have several applications screens visible

being able to do a standard set of functions easily and
quickly on an unfamiliar operating system. i am familiar with

what i hate about gui 's

having to switch between the mouse and the keyboard. i guess
i have a strong one handed preference. i like to use a

need to use both hands for is entering text.

i guess i need to get one of those mice with , like , 20 buttons
or something and then i will have the best of both worlds.

one advanage of mit shm is that if your images are large , you do n't end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them.

correct. most x servers use a version of malloc(3) which will not return
memory to the os (ie. the x server might free(3) a pixmap , but the heap does
not shrink).

one disadvantage of the mit shm is that , in its sample implementation ,
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden , violent death (e.g. , kill ). you have to
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

well , part of the routines i mentioned do a dirty little trick to get around
that problem. first , i create the shared memory segment , attach the client ,
attach the x server , and then remove ( ! ) the segment. if you read the man
pages on removing of shared memory segments , you will see that the segment
only dies after all attachments are gone.
now , if the client dies , that 's one attachment gone (the os cleans up for you)
and since the x server notices the client has dies , frees up it 's resources ,
including detaching from the segment there goes the last attachment. no more
shared memory segment.
terrible , but it works.

jan all i can do with vue is display xbm 's through their
jan backdrop style manager.

jan xv does not seem to be able to override whatever vue
jan puts there.

i suspect this is because vue creates a window (probably overrideredirect)
that is the size of (or larger than) the root window. because the window
manager does not know about this , you cannot move , resize etc. it. xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because vue 's window is overlaid on top of the root
window.

contact hp support and see whether vue can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm , if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code.

you wanna do masking. build a bitmap (pixmap of depth one) where all pixels
you name opaque are 1 (that get copied) and the others are 0. use this
bitmap as the clip mask in the gc used for xcopyarea() , and remember to
adjust the clip origin coordinates to the xcopyarea() blit origin.

the mouse pointer (besides from that it is driven using ramdac analog
mapping on most hardwares) uses a mask , too.

but be warned blitting through a mask and especially moving around this mask
is annoying slow on most xservers... it flickers even at 40 mips...

why does n't postscript work on an x terminal

because xterminals do not have a news server. xterminals have
speed by nature of their limited functionality once you add news and
everything else , you have a workstation. there are workarounds , i 've
heard , one involving a perl script. what we are trying to do is
replace programs that need news (like pageview) with programs that

maybe someone else can elaborate on the perl workaround i

hi !

i am using xview 3.0 on a sparc ipx under openwindows along with a xvideo board
from parallax which enables me to use 24 bit color. i am having some problems
utilizing the 24 bit color and would greatly appreciate any help in this matter.

i use xview to create a frame and then create a canvas pane inside which i use
to display live video. my video input is 24 bit color.

the problem is that my top level frame created as
frame (frame) xv create(null , frame , null)
seems to have a depth of 8 which is propagated to my canvas.

i would like to know how i can set the depth of the frame to be 24 bits.
i tried using the following xlib code

xvisualinfo visual info
int depth 24
colormap colormap
xsetwindowattributes attribs
unsigned long valuemask 0
window win
xv opaque frame

win xv get(frame , xv xid)
xmatchvisualinfo(display , screen , depth , truecolor , visual info)

so far so good

colormap xcreatecolormap(display , win , visual info , allocnone)

it dies here with a badmatch error (

attribs.colormap colormap
valuemask cwcolormap
xchangewindowattributes(display , w , valuemask , attribs)
xsetwindowcolormap(display , win , colormap)


am i using a completely wrong approach here \? is it possible to set the depth
and colormap for a window created by xview \? what am i doing wrong \?

thanks in advance for any help that i can get. i would prefer a response via
email although a post on the newsgroup is also okay.

hi.

i use emacs and i want to customize my keyboard better.
when i set up stuff in my .emacs with a keymap and define keys ,
i can only access certain of the keys on my x terminal 's
keyboard. i ca n't get e.g. f10 , home , end , pgup , pgdn they all
seem to have either the same or no keycode. i have a feeling
this ca n't be fixed in emacs itself , but that i need to do some
xmodmap stuff. can someone help me \?

unfortunately , the key event handling is pretty much hardwired into
emacs. i ran into this problem a while back my solution was to
change the source code so that all of these special keys generated
character sequences which basically encoded the keysym and modifier
state as escape sequences for example , the sequence esc 1 b 7
would indicate that the home key was pressed , with the shift key
down. you could also detect standard keys with odd modifiers , such
as shift return .

if anybody wants these changes , they 're welcome to them , but you 'll
have to have the source available and be comfortable munging with
it a bit. basically you have to replace the keypress handling code
in the source file x11term.c . maybe if someone at osf is
interested , i can send them the tweaks , but i imagine they 've got
bigger fish to fry (hopefully including the much talked about
emacs v19 ! ). if there 's sufficient interest , i 'll post the mods
somewhere , although this probably is n't the appropriate group for it.

notes

this special code will only apply if you let emacs create
its own (x11) window. if you run it in plain old tty mode (which
includes xterm windows) then it 's business as usual.

the patches i made were to version 18.58 , under sun os 4.1.2
i also did this a while back under hp ux . the patches are
in a chunk of code between ' if sun ... endif' but could
easily be adapted for anything else.

in my opinion , a programming degree is still worth having.

yes , but a cs degree is not a programming degree. does anybody know of
a computing course where programming is taught \? computer science is
a branch of maths (or the course i did was).
i 've also done a software engineering course much more practical and likely
to be the sort of thing an employer really wants , rather than what they think
they want , but also did not teach programming. the ability to program was
an entry requirement.

try the 'm.sc. computing science' course at the real newcastle university.
it 's a conversion course , but at least they teach real programming.

in the space of 9 months we were taught pascal , simula , prolog , miranda.
also , some basic low level stuff (68000) was covered as well.

they also did concurrent programming and operating systems , some software
engineering , plus quite a few optional units , including database theory ,
and some stuff about comms.

the pascal is to be replaced by c c i think next year i lear n't this (and
x windows programming as well)
anyway via a good selection of project over the final three months depending
on your tastes , the selection of skills lear n't can be quite wide reaching.

the one critiscism i would level at the course , which i would have thought
invaluable , is the lack of an option to do the project period in industry
this would probably need a slightly longer project period (say six months) , but
would enhance the prestige and usefulness of an already excellent and thorough
course.

yes , i know this sounds like a plug for the course , why not !

i do n't know a window manager that does n't place the window like you prefer
if you specify the position and size like above.

sorry , but olwm and tvtwm do n't do it. they place the title at that position
and the window at a position below it.

the reason they place their outside corner at the location you requested
is because that 's what the icccm says they should do.

this becomes a problem when you want a program to be able to save its current
configuration and restore is later.

currently , my solution is

xcreatewindow(...)
xsetwmproperties(..)
xmapwindow(...)
xflush(...)
xmovewindow(...)

this code will almost certainly break. calling xmapwindow and then
xflush does not guarantee that the window is visible and managed by the
window manager. even if this did work , there is n't a reliable way to
find out how much decoration the window manager placed around your
window , so you do n't know how far to move it. and what if the window
manager refuses to move your window \?

we have an old sun3 60 here which gets occasional use. when x11r5 is started
on it any console messages during startup are undeletable. after x is fully
started we run an xterm as the console the problem is that any messages
that arrive before this starts go to the plain console. refresh window fails
to remove them. the messages are a real pain since they sit in the middle of
the screen obscuring anything else below them.

at boot time the 3 60 lists two framebuffers dev cgfour0 and dev bwtwo1.
we 're running x in color , and i suspect that maybe the offending messages are
on the b w framebuffer , and thereby not getting deleted.

my question is has anyone else seen this , and is there an easy way to get rid

i had tested it with some simple windows like the openwindows file manager ,

the xwd part blew up with a segmentation fault. i tried it without the pipe ,
by redirecting xwd 's output to a file and then used the file as input to xwud
and got the same error from xwud. if i had to guess , it seems like it 's
running out of memory , but this happened on a sparc 10 with 64 megs , 128 meg

this verion of xwd xwud was supplied with the sun openwindows 3.0 distribution

shared memory putimage (also mentioned by nkissebe@delphi.beckman.uiuc.edu ,
nick kisseberth) looks interesting , but i need someone to point me to some
documentation. is this method likely to give better results than server
resident pixmaps \? i 'd also be interested in looking at the xview code
mentioned above...

there is no easy answer to this question it depends on whether the display
device can hold pixmaps in off screen memory , and if so , how efficiently
the server manages these resources (having to deal with limited off screen
memory is the bane of the server implementor 's existence ! ).

i have worked with graphics devices where the off screen memory to
main display copy rate eclipses that of the main memory to display copy
rate , and with those where the main memory to display is faster than
off screen to display (requires only a write to the framebuffer rather
than a read of the f.b. followed by a write)

if your server uses the cfb code or something like it to render into
pixmaps in cpu main memory , the rates you can get through mit shm are
likely to be equal (maybe a tad slower , depending on your os 's implementation
of shared memory) to copyarea from pixmap to window , which is also then
just a copy from cpu main memory to graphics device.

one advanage of mit shm is that if your images are large , you do n't end up
growing the size of the server process to hold them.

one disadvantage of the mit shm is that , in its sample implementation ,
there is no provision for elegantly cleaning up the shared memory segments
if the client dies a sudden , violent death (e.g. , kill ). you have to
be mindful of cluttering up the system with zombie shared memory segments.

hello ,

when starting bx if you recieve an error message saying
cannot load app defaults file... check your xapplresdir
environment variable and then put the file builderxcessory
( this is the app defaults file for bx ) in the directory
specified by the xuserfilesearchpath environment variable.

if you do n't have an xuserfilesearchpath environment variable
then set xuserfilesearchpath to be the directory where the
builderxcessory file is. you can do this using the setenv
command under csh. note that the name ends in .ad so you will
have to set xuserfilesearchpath to bx n.ad to get the
app defaults to load correctly.

to make sure the the app defaults file can be read by all
the users , make sure that a copy of or a link to the app defaults
file exists in usr lib x11 app defaults or
usr openwin lib app defaults , depending on how your system is
set up.

once you have taken care of this set the systemdirectory
resource to be the directory in which you have installed bx.
for example let 's say i 've installed bx in t then my system
directory resource should be set like this

systemdirectory t builderxcessory

(1) the x protocol communication is slowing things down or
(2) xputimage is inefficient...or both ! my question is , what

the protocol has to move the whole image from process memory to server
memory , this is the hog. the conversions in the xputimage() are
fast.

is the fastest way in x11r5 to dump 8 plane image data to
a window \? can i take advantage of the fact that the client is
running on the same machine as the server \? or am i stuck with

yes , by utilizing the mit shm extension , that provides an xputimage
derivate that uses shared memory. fine fast.

xputimage() (in which case i might as well give up now...) \?


no. you can still xputimage all of the frames onto pixmaps (thus moving
them to server memory) and then replay them fastest using xcopyarea()
but be aware , this is a major server memory bummer !

there 's documentation on how to use the shared memory extension in the
x11r5 distribution.

actually , i just finished writing a motif animation program...
(take lots of image data and display it pretty darn fast). when using
on server pixmaps or shared memory , i had to insert a delay loop to keep
it from going too quickly ). testing both methods side by side , they
were just about equal.

the advantage of shm is that your x server does n't grow to ridiculous
sizes but pixmaps can work over a network and are removed if your
application dies (one tends to use ipcrm manually quite a bit when
debugging shm apps).

shared memory also has the problem that some operating systems (e.g.
ultrix) seem to allow only a small number of segments ( 6) to be
attached to a process at once consequently , a redraw becomes
xshmattach() xshmputimage() xshmdetach() on dec systems. and dec 's 24
bit displays (like the ones i tend to use most often) do n't seem to
support the extension (maybe someone compiled them wrong \? ) , and using
pixmaps causes the x server to crash (failed mallocs) , so one has to
use the local unix domain socket (which really is n't that bad one
copies the info three times per redraw instead of one).

in short allowing all three forms of display , within the program is a
good thing (minus shm if running over a network) , and let the user pick
whatever feels fastest.

(i just use an ximagehandler class and forget about it )

does anyone know what is available in terms of automated testing

projects and for a separate project which will be using openvms.

a question like this is answered in the faq , about sharing x windows.
one of the answers is xtrap , a record and playback extenstion to x. you
can find it at export.lcs.mit.edu contrib xtrapv33 x11r5.tar.z.

does anyone know of a program which does n't require an x extension \? most
the the x servers we have at work have vendor extensions which we ca n't
modify , so xtrap does n't help up. there is x conferencing software at
mit , but i do n't know how easy it would be to modify it to do record and
playback.

any help would be appreciated.

let 's say i have two rectangles on the canvas(see above)
one intersecting the other...
now , i would like to delete one of the rectangles.
the way i do it is to create another gc wherein i use the
gxxor logical function and simply redraw the rectangle using the
newly
created graphics context thus deleting it for all apparent purposes.
a problem with this approach is that at the points of intersection
the pixel
locations belonging to the other rectangle also become white , which
is
something that should be avoided.

you could set up a bitmap with a mask in it. clear the
bitmap , draw the rectangle to be deleted with gxor. draw the one
that is to stay with gxclear. then gxxor the entire pixmap with
the screen.

note that this is a pretty effective way of animation , if you ever
need to do that (replace the gxclear with a gxxor).

contents problems with table widgets in r5

the following part of a program (an user interface for a simulation
system) did work in r4 , but refused to in r5. of cause , the r4 version
did not know about the xptablewidgetclass (we used tablewidgetclass instead caught from the net in times of r3) and xptablechildposition (formerly xttblposition).
since compiling with r5 , the program causes a zero width or height error
(on sparc stations). the trouble shooter is the (re)computation of the
model init table table widget though its childs (label and asciitext
widgets) exist , xtquerygeometry returns a prefered width and height of zero.
thus the following asignment cannot perform anything else but set the width and height of the newly created widget to zero. no wonder xtpopup or xtmanage child create zero width or height errors (dependent on whether width and height of the shell widget are set in the resource file or not).

question does anyone know , why xtquerygeometry returns so low prefered
values when working on table widgets or perhaps what
to do about \?

i 'll be happy , if someone is able to help me.
germans are requested to answer in german.

the crucial function call
intended to return the maximum height possible if
there is n't sufficient space to show the whole table
widget , then the viewport shall grow as large as
possible , but not beyond the border of screen.
if there is enough space , the window is intended to
shrienk to the smallest possible height.


xtquerygeometry(model init table , null , pref)

according to the algorithms idea , the new value of
viewport widget 's height is selected. unfortunately
pref.height 0 leads to new height 0.

i'm working on an x11r5 application and have concerns regarding
standard colormaps.

the x11r5 documentation says usually , a window manager creates
these colormaps. i wonder what window manager the writer had
in mind. neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps.

standard colormaps were spec 'd with the intention that window managers
would make them available. this does n't mean that every window manager
author in the world immediately dropped everything they were doing and
implemented this at top priority.

the esge server we ship makes the xa rgb best map available at
startup. it does n't wait for window managers to do it.

of course , one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps.
however , xstdcmap does n't seem to try very hard to avoid
conflicts with the default colormap. when i use standard
colormaps created by xstdcmap , the rest of my display goes black.
so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very
problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid. perhaps
if every application used standard colormaps , things would
be wonderful. but not many applications seem to use
standard colormaps.

does your hardware have only one clut \? since standard colormaps
typically devour all 256 entries , there is no way it can avoid
displacing the entire default colormap if your hardware has only one
clut.

i do n't believe standard colormaps are intended to aboid possible
colormap flashing between clients using the default coilormap. rather ,
colormap flashing will be avoided between two clients that use the
same standard colormap. an example would be two clients that need a
full color range would both use xa rgb best map (or whatever it 's
called under x11r5).

if you are trying to avoid colormap flashing with the default
colormap , your best bet is to try to load all the colors you use into
that colormap. if you ca n't do that , then you 'll get flashing on a one
hw clut framebuffer.

now if your window manager used the same standard colormap as your
client , this flashing could also be avoided. perhaps some window
managers have command line options for selecting standard colormaps \?

i am also concerned by this prevalence of motif , particularly from the
point of view of writing and obtaining free software. as the linux and
386bsd communities grow , however , i think that motif will lose some of
its grip , at least in the non commercial marketplace.

ports of motif to both 386bsd and linux are available for a fee of about
100. this is cost recovery for the person who bought the rights to
redistribute. the activity in both the bsd and linux news groups
pertaining to motif has been high.

i just wonder if this will also cause a divergence between commercial
and non commercial software (ie. you will only get free software using
athena or openlook widget sets , and only get commercial software using
the motif widget sets).

i ca n't see why. if just about every workstation will come with motif
by default and you can buy it for under 100 for the free unix
platforms , i ca n't see this causing major problems.


i think you will find that the active linux and 386bsd communities are
populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying any money for software.
otherwise , they would probably have gone for a commercial unix.
an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always
available (this is probably similar in the 386bsd community , however , i'm not
really involved there). many people using linux like to stay at the cutting
(bleeding) edge ie. when kernel patches , c library or compiler patches come
out , people like to rebuild their entire systems. the prime requirement for
all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license.
hence , linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview.
individuals may write software requiring motif , but i doubt it is widely
adopted.

subject how to see characterset from wchar t
nntp posting host emu

organization yokogawa electric corporation , tokyo , japan

we developed a toolkit running on the x window system.
the toolkit copes with any languages based on x11r5 's i18n
facility. as you know , there are 2 kinds of i18n implementation from mit 's
x11r5 release xsi and ximp. our original implementation of the toolkit
uses xsi.

our toolkit manages each character 's size based on our own font management system.
in order to do that , the 'wchar t' typed character strings must be decomposed
to character sets. this means that if one wchar t type compound string with
ascii and kanji mixed , for example , is given , each element of the wchar t
array must be checked its corresponding character set based on a bit layout
and application environment 's locale. in this case if the locale is 'japanese' ,
each wchar t character will be classified either to iso8859 1 , jisx0208 or so.

we need a function to do this. the function must check how many characters
from the top are the same character set and what the character set is.

we could not find any public x11r5 function to do that and inevitably , used
xsi 's internal functions to construct that function. the following is the
source code of that function 'decomposecharacterset()'.

an included file above , xlocaleint.h , is also xsi internal and we copied
the file to the toolkit directory and compiled.

a serious issue occured when we tried to compile a toolkit application on
our hp machine with its os version of hp ux9.01.

when we tried to link an application based on our toolkit ,
link errors occured saying that the following functions are missing
xmbctidtocsid (code)
xmbfscs (code)
xwcdecomposeglyphcharset (code)
xfallbackconvert (code)

we had used mit release version of x11r5 and its xsi implementation until
hp up9.0 and ran applications successfully. one of the reasons to use xsi was that
because hp did not release hp 's x11r5 until the os 9.0 and we had no way to
know how hp 's r5 would be implemented. we had hoped xsi 's popularity and used
its internal functions.

the hp 's linker complains that there are no xsi internal functions implemented.
we observe from hp 's libx11.a , they used some ximp implementation but we are
not sure if they used mit 's vanilla ximp version or their own version of ximp and
therefore , finding just counter part functions in mit 's ximp for xsi does not
seem to lead us a solution.

my question and goal is to know how we can construct a function like
'decomposecharacterset()' listed above. is there any function to check
character set of each element of wchar t type strings depending on locales \?
if it is a public function , that is perfect but even if it is not , we
want to use any internal functions in hp 's x11r5 as we did for mit 's r5.

in order to render a 'wchar t' type string , there must be some machinery
to judge character sets and that is how the proper fonts are selected for
the string. we have no way to find out that without any hp 's x11r5 source
files. we want to know how we can use that for our goal.
any help or comments would be highly appreciated.

i also appreciate if anyone tell me about ximp treating around this area
even if it is not hp 's implementation.

thank you.

how to maximize the performance of x monthly posting

compiled by art mulder (art@cs.ualberta.ca)

more ram , faster cpu 's , more disk space , faster ethernet... these
are the standard responses you hear when you ask how to improve the
performance of your workstation.

well , more hardware is n't always an option , and i wonder if more
hardware is always even a necessity.

this faq list is a collection of suggestions and ideas from different
people on the net on how you can the best possible performance from x
windows on your workstation , without purchasing more hardware.

performance is a highly subjective issue. the individual user must
balance `speed' versus `features' in order to come to a personal
decision. therefore this document can be be expected to contain many
subjective opinions in and amongst the objective facts.

this document is specifically concerned with x. there are of course
many other factors that can affect the performance of a workstation.
however , they are outside the scope of this document.

people seriously interested in the whole area of system
performance , might want to look at the o'reilly nutshell handbook
system performance tuning by mike loukides. i'm about 25 of the
way through reading it , and it looks like a well written
comprehensive treatment of system performance. i'm unaware of any
other similar books. ed.

introduction administrivia


this document is posted each month , on or around the 15th , to the
usenet news groups comp.windows.x , news.answers , and comp.answers.
if you are reading a copy of this faq which is more than a few
months old (see the last modified date above) you should probably
locate the latest edition , since the information may be outdated.

if you do not know how to get those newsgroups and or your site does
not receive them and or this article has already expired , you can
retrieve this faq from an archive site.

there exist several usenet faq archive sites. to find out more about
them and how to access them , please see the introduction to the
news.answers newsgroup posting in news.answers.

the main faq archive is at rtfm.mit.edu 18.172.1.27 . this document

what about the other x faq \?


david b. lewis (faq craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and
well written comp.windows.x frequently asked questions document.
its focus is on general x information , while this faq concentrates
on performance.

the comp.windows.x faq does address the issue of speed , but only with
regards to the x server. the gist of that topic seems to be
use x11r5 , it is faster than r4 .
(please see the x faq for complete details).


window managers


there are a lot of window managers out there , with lots of different
features and abilities. the choice of which to use is by necessity a
balancing act between performance and useful features. at this
point , most respondents have agreed upon twm as the best candidate
for a speedy window manager.

a couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger ,
is turning off unnecessary things like zooming and opaque move .
also , if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner , you reduce the
amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping
windows. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)

i 've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka
misc fixed medium r normal 13 100 100 100 c 70 iso8859 1 ). it is
the biggest font i know of that i can use on my sun (1152x900 screen)
and still get two 80 column terminal windows side by side on the
display with no overlap. other font suggestions will be accepted.


the x server


which server \?

make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.
if you have a monochrome monitor , use a monochrome x11 server.

on my monochrome sun , i have n't noticed much difference between
the xsun (colour) server and xsunmono , however it was pointed out to
me that xsunmono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute
to less paging.
thanks to jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk) ,
michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se)

how your server was compiled can also make a difference. jeff law
(law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a sun system , x should be
compiled with gcc (version 2. ) or with the unbundled sun compiler.
you can expect to get very large speedups in the server by not
using the bundled sunos compiler. i assume that similar results
would occur if you used one of the other high quality commercial
compilers on the market.

locking the server into ram \?

has anyone tried hacking the x server so that it is locked into ram and
does not get paged \? eg via a call to plock(). does this help
performance at all \? i 've had one inquiry on this topic , and a few
pointers to the plock() function call , but no hard evidence from someone
who 's tried it. i am not in a position to give it a try.

starting your server

joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)
if you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever , sleep
for a second or two after launching each one. after i changed my
.xclients script to do this , logging in actually took less time...
we have a heavily loaded system without much core , though.

this sounds crazy , but i have confirmed that it works !

warner losh (imp@solbourne.com) provided me with a good explanation of
why this works , which i have summarized here

when you start up an x server it takes a huge amount of time to
start accepting connections. a lot of initialization is done by
the server when it starts. this process touches a large number of
pages. any other process running at the same time would fight the
server for use of the cpu , and more importantly , memory. if you
put a sleep in there , you give the server a chance to get itself
sorted out before the clients start up.

similarly , there is also a lot of initialization whenever an x
client program starts toolkits registering widgets , resources
being fetched , programs initializing state and databases and so
forth. all this activity is typically memory intensive. once this
initialization is done ( the process has reached a steady state ) ,
the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.
by using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your
.xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your
workstation 's limited resources

this is most definitely a your mileage may vary situation , as there
are so many variables to be considered available ram , local swap
space , load average , number of users on your system , which clients
you are starting , etc.

currently in my .xinitrc i have a situation like
(sleep 1 exec xclock )
(sleep 1 exec xbiff )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )

i 've experimented with
(sleep 1 exec xclock )
(sleep 2 exec xbiff )
(sleep 3 exec xterm )
(sleep 4 exec xterm )

i 've even tried
(sleep 2 exec start x clients script )
and then in start x clients script i had
(sleep 1 exec xclock )
(sleep 1 exec xbiff )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )
(sleep 1 exec xterm )

the idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had
completely finished processing my .xinitrc , and had settled down
into a steady state before the sleep expired and all my clients
were launched.

all of these yielded fairly comparable results , and so i just stuck with
my current setup , for its simplicity. you will probably have to
experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.

fonts

loading fonts takes time and ram. if you minimize the number of fonts
your applications use , you 'll get speed increases in load up time.

one simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small , one
large , one roman , whatever suits you) and configure all your clients or
at least all your heavily used clients to use only those few fonts.
client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded
into the server. this will also conserve server resources , since fewer
fonts will be loaded by the server.
farrell mckay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au) ,
joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)

eg my main xterm font is 7x13 , so i also have twm set up to use 7x13
in all it 's menus and icons etc. twm 's default font is 8x13. since
i do n't normally use 8x13 , i 've eliminated one font from my server.

oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com)
keep fonts local to the workstation , rather than loading them over nfs.
if you will make extensive use of r5 scalable fonts , use a font server.

about the resources file


keep your .xresources .xdefaults file small. saves ram and saves
on server startup time. joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)

one suggestion

in your .xdefaults (.xresources) file , try putting only the minimum
number of resources that you want to have available to all of your
applications. for example reversevideo true

then , separate your resources into individual client specific
resource files. for example home lib app defaults. in your
.login file set the environment variable xuserfilesearchpath

setenv xuserfilesearchpath home lib app defaults n

the comp.windows.x frequently asked questions faq contains
an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.
ed.

so , when xterm launches , it loads its resources from
... app defaults xterm. xdvi finds them in ... app defaults xdvi ,
and so on and so forth. note that not all clients follow the same
xxxxx resource file naming pattern. you can check in your system
app defaults directory (often usr x11r5 lib x11 app defaults ) to
find the proper name , and then name your personal resource files
with the same name.

this is all documented in the xt specification (pg 125 666).
thanks to kevin samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com) ,
michael urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov) ,
and mike long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).
kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.

this method of organizing your personal resources has the following
benefits

easier to maintain more usable.

fewer resources are stored in the x server in the resource manager
property. as a side benefit your server may start fractionally
quicker , since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.

applications only process their own resources , never have to sort
through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.

it also has drawbacks

the application that you are interested in has to load an
additional file every time it starts up. this does n't seem to
make that much of a performance difference , and you might
consider this a huge boon to usability. if you are modifying an
application 's resource database , you just need to re run the
application without having to xrdb again.

xrdb will by default run your .xdefaults file through cpp. when
your resources are split out into multiple resource files and
then loaded by the individual client programs , they will not.
watch out for this ! !

i had c style comments in my .xdefaults file , which cpp stripped
out. when i switched to this method of distributed resource
files i spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why
my clients were not finding their resources. xt did not
provide any error message when it encountered the c style
comments in the resource files , it simply , silently , aborted
processing the resource file.

the loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy , e.g. `` ifdef
color'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this
method of resource management.

you may also run into some clients which break the rules. for
example , neither emacs (18.58.3) nor xvt (1.0) will find their
resources if they are anywhere other than in .xdefaults.

when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files
with the machine where your resources are stored , your client
will not find its resources. loading all your resources into the
server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find
their resources. casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)

a possible compromise suggestion that i have (and am planning on trying)
is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg xterm) into my
.xdefaults file , and to use the separate resources files method for
clients that i seldom use.

define your display properly


client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server. in
that situation , rather than setting your display environment variable to
hostname 0.0 , where hostname is the name of your workstation , you
should set your display variable to unix 0.0 or 0.0 . by doing this
you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same
machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.
thanks to patrick j horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)

see the display names section of the x(1) man page for further
explanation of how to properly set your display name.

i do n't think it 's stock mit , but (at least) data general and hp have
libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when
the display is n't set specially.
rob sartin (88opensi ! sartin@uunet.uu.net)

jody goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an xlib patch to change
stock r5 to use local communication even if display is not properly set.
i do n't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle
non mit patches and so have elected not to include it here. hopefully mit
will apply this minor ( 8 lines) patch themselves. in the meantime , if
you want to try it yourself , email jody. ed.


clients


if you only have a few megabytes of ram then you should think
carefully about the number of programs you are running. think also
about the kind of programs you are running. for example is there
a smaller clock program than xclock \?

unfortunately , i have n't really noticed that programs advertise how large
they are , so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.

suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients
(eg xclock , xterm , xbiff) are welcome. ed.

i 've received some contradictory advice from people , on the subject
of x client programs. some advocate the use of programs that are
strictly xlib based , since xt , xaw and other toolkits are rather
large. others warn us that other applications which you are using
may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries. in
this case , using a non xt (for example) client program may actually
increase the amount of ram consumed.

the upshot of all this seems to be do n't mix toolkits. that is , try
and use just athena clients , or just xview clients (or just motif
clients , etc). if you use more than one , then you 're dragging in
more than one toolkit library.

know your environment , and think carefully about which client
programs would work best together in that environment.

a better clock for x


1) xcuckoo
suggested by duncan sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)
available on export.lcs.mit.edu

xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of another program.
saves screen real estate.

2) mclock
suggested by der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)
available larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in x mclock.shar

non xt based. extensively configurable. it can be made to look
very much like mit oclock , or mostly like xclock purely by changing
resources.

of course , the ultimate clock one that consumes no resources , and
takes up no screen real estate is the one that hangs on your wall.

a better terminal emulator for x


from the readme file distributed with xterm


abandon all hope , ye who enter here

this is undoubtedly the most ugly program in the distribution.
...


ugly maybe , but at my site it 's still the most used. i suspect that
xterm is one of the most used clients at many , if not most sites.
laziness \? is n't there a better terminal emulator available \? see below.

if you must use xterm , you can try reducing the number of savelines
to reduce memory usage. oliver jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com) ,
jonny farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk)

1) xvt
suggested by richard hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk)
available export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib xvt 1.0.tar.z

...if you do n't need all the esoteric features of xterm , then get
hold of xvt ... it was written here just to save swap space as
xterm is rather a hog !

this was written as a partial 'clone' of xterm. you do n't have to
rename your resources , as xvt pretends to be xterm. in it 's current
version , you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm. i 've heard that
there are versions of xvt with this feature , but i 've not found any
yet.

update (march 1993) i recently had a few email conversations with
brian warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt. he
questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm. for
instance , xvt may initialize slightly faster , but compare scrolling
speed (try this quickie benchmark bin time dd if etc termcap
bs 40) and see which program can scroll faster. also , while xterm
may be slightly larger in ram requirements (we do n't have any hard
numbers here , does anyone else \? ) shared libraries and shared text
segments mean that xterm 's paging requirements are not that major.

as an experiment , he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm , but it
made little difference , since if you never use it , it never gets
brought into memory.

so here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of
xvt over xterm. in summary \? caveat emptor , your mileage may vary.
if you can provide some hard data , i 'd like to see it.
specifically how much ram each occupies , how much swap each needs ,
relative speed of each

2) mterm
suggested by der mouse (mouse@lightning.mcrcim.mcgill.edu)
available larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in
x mterm.src mterm.ball o wax.

i also have my own terminal emulator. its major lack is
scrollback , but some people like it anyway.


tuning your client


suggestions on how you can tune your client programs to work faster.

from scott barman (scott@asd.com) comes a suggestion regarding motif
text field widgets

i noticed that during data entry into motif text field widgets , i
was getting a slight lag in response to some keystrokes ,
particularly the initial one in the field. examining the what was
going on with xscope i found it. it seems that when the resource
xmnblinkrate is non zero and the focus is on a text field widget
(or even just a text widget) the i beam cursor will blink.
every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets , the
widget code is making a request to the server (copyarea). the user
can stop this by setting the resource xmnblinkrate to 0. it is not
noticeable on a 40mhz sparc , but it does make a little difference
on a slower system .

this specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots
of areas. consider your heavily used clients , are there any minor
embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on server
requests \?


miscellaneous suggestions


pretty pictures

do n't use large bitmaps (gif 's , etc) as root window backgrounds.

the more complicated your root window bitmap , the slower the server
is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw , etc)

these take up ram , and cpu power. i work on a sun sparc and i'm
conscious of performance issues , i ca n't comprehend it when i see
people with a 4mb sun 3 60 running xphoon as their root window.

i 'll let someone else figure out how much ram would be occupied by
having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.

if you 're anything like me , you need all the screen real estate
that you can get for clients , and so rarely see the root window anyway.

thanks to qiang alex zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu)
for reminding me of this one. ed.

a quicker mouse

using xset , you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen
when you move your mouse. i use xset m 3 10 in my .xinitrc file ,
which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of
the wrist. see the xset man page for further ideas and information.

hint sometimes you may want to slow down your mouse tracking for
fine work. to cover my options , i have placed a number of different
mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.

e.g. (for twm)
menu mouse settings
mouse settings f.title
very fast ! xset m 7 10
normal (fast) ! xset m 3 10
system default (un accelerated) ! xset m default
glacial ! xset m 0 10


programming thoughts

joe english (joe@trystero.art.com)
to speed up applications that you 're developing , there are tons of
things you can do. some that stick out

for motif programs , do n't set xmfontlist resources for individual
buttons , labels , lists , et. al. use the defaultfontlist or
labelfontlist or whatever resource of the highest level manager
widget. again , stick to as few fonts as possible.

better yet , do n't use motif at all. it 's an absolute pig.

do n't create and destroy widgets on the fly. try to reuse them.
(this will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits , too.)

use a line width of 0 in gcs. on some servers this makes a huge
difference.

compress and collapse multiple expose events. this can make the
difference between a fast application and a completely unusable
one.

francois staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be)
just a small remark i once heard that using a better malloc
function would greatly increase performance of xt based
applications since they use malloc heavily. they suggested trying
out the gnuy malloc , but i did n't find the time yet. i did some
tests on small programs just doing malloc and free , and the
differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)

any confirmation on this from anyone \? ed.

andre' beck (andre beck@irs.inf.tu dresden.de)

unnecessary noexpose events.

most people use xcopyarea xcopyplane as fastest blit routines , but
they forget to reset graphics exposures in the gc used for the
blits. this will cause a noexpose event every blit , that , in most
cases , only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to
run through it 's event loop again and again.

thousands of xchangegc requests.

this gfx context switching is also seen in most handcoded x apps ,
where only one or few gcs are created and then heavily changed
again and again. xt uses a definitely better mechanism , by caching
and sharing a lot of gcs with all needed parameters. this will
remove the load of subsequent xchangegc requests from the
connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).

say what ! \?

some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first

david b. lewis (by day dbl@osf.org , by night david craft@uunet.uu.net)
how about this swap displays with someone else. run all your programs
on the other machine and display locally the other user runs off your
machine onto the other display. goal reduce context switches in the
same operation between client and server.

i'm not in a situation where i can easily try this , but i have received
the following confirmation...

michael salmon (michael.salmon@eos.ericsson.se)
i regularly run programs on other machines and i notice a big
difference. i try to run on a machine where i will reduce net usage
and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion. this
helps a lot on my poor little ss1 with only 16 mb , it was
essential when i only had 8 mb.

casey leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)
the x11 server and the client are competing for the same cpu as
your server when you run it on the same machine. not really a
major problem , except that the x11 client and the server are in
absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.

timothy h panton (thp@westhawk.uucp)
firstly it relies on the fact that most cpu 's are mostly idle , x 's
cpu usage is bursty. so the chances of you and your teammate
doing something cpu intensive at the same time is small. if they
are not then you get twice the cpu memory available for your
action.

the second factor is that context switches are expensive , using 2
cpu 's halves them , you pay a price due to the overhead of going
over the network , but this is offset in most cases by the improved
buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe) , allowing
even fewer context switches.

a lot more tips on performance are in the paper improving x
application performance by chris d. peterson and sharon chang , in
issue 3 of the x resource.

an earlier version of this paper appeared in the xhibition 1992
conference proceedings.

this paper is absolutely essential reading for x programmers.

i have a problem with icon pixmap. my application has to run
under openwindow and motif. i wrote my program in motif with pixmap and
icons. it runs fine under motif motif window manager and x11r5 mwm. but
the icon pixmap does not show up under openwin olwm and x11r5 olwm.

has anybody got into this kind of problem \? need a clue. an
example which works in both x11r5 motif and openwindow will be great.

yet again ,

the escape sequences you are speaking about here are non standard and
dangerous. in fact , an ansi compliant sequence parser hangs on them.

why are there such strange esc sequences instead of compatible dsc \?

we are looking for a x client which can convert a xwd or a bitmap
file into a gif file for use on a macintosh.

just look at the pbmplus package it does everything you could ever ask
for in converting pbm to almost any format (gif , tga , pcx etc...)
