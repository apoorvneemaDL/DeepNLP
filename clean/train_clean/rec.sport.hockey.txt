ed olczyk new york rangers
derek plante univ of minnesota duluth
shion podein edmonton oilers
david sacco boston university
darren turcotte new york rangers
doug weight edmonton oilers


it looks like the edmonton oilers just decided to take a european
vacation this spring...

ranford , tugnutt , benning , manson , smith , buchberger , and corson
are playing for canada.

podein and weight are playing for the us.

is kravchuk playing for the russians...i know he had nagging
injuries late in the season.

podein is an interesting case...because he was eligible to
play in cape breton in the ahl playoffs like kovalev , zubov ,
and andersson...obviously sather and pocklington are not
the total scrooges everyone makes them out to be...certainly
in this case they 've massively outclassed paramount and the
new york rangers.

what makes you think so \? i 'd like to understand your reasoning.
from my seat , the caps do n't really appear to believe that they can
defeat pittsburgh. therefore , they do n't. i think their spirit was
broken in last year 's playoffs and has n't really recovered. i do n't know
what the season series numbers were , but i believe that the pens won it.
i think that either the devils or the islanders will cause more problems for


what is this spirit crap \? i'm a caps fan and hope they win
if they end up facing pittsburgh ,
but i do n't think the caps lose to pitt because of lack
of spirit. yes , the penguins won the season series against the
caps. they 've won eighteen games in a row for god 's sake.
did you ever think the penguins might be good , and that 's
why they win \?

i re read what i wrote and it did n't say exactly what i thought.

sure the pens are a better team. they 've got size and the best skill players
in the league. they 've also got the best clutch goaltending. they 're the
best team in the league.

but , my point was the caps have not played to their ability level vs the
pens since last year 's choke. and that 's the mental problem (the one they 've
had for a number of years) i tried to point out. spirit , mental preparedness ,
will to win , whatever you want to call it , it 's missing when the caps play the
pens. actually , you 're right it wo n't make any difference.

each team is owned by the league , with local intrests controlling day to
day operations. working agreements and nhl affiliations are up to each
team.

each team has a 100 , 000 salary cap for 17 total players
(16 dress up).

each team is limited to 11 visas , meaning at least 6 players must be
americans (ignore this rule if you are tulsa , they only had 2 americans
on the roster during the playoffs).

teams play in wichita , tulsa , oklahoma city , memphis , fort worth , and dallas.

future expansion plans include houston , san antonio , baton rouge , little rock ,
el paso , albuquerque , tuscon , and amarillo. austin is a possibility if dallas
has to move. houston and san antonio are in for this fall , with baton rouge
and little rock likely for 94 95.

farewell , minnesota fans. get stuffed , dallas stars.

as the north stars fade to black , i hope that minneapolis st. paul are
not long without an nhl team. it just seems right that the hotbed of
amateur hockey in the usa should have an nhl team as well. the loss of
the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the
1989 90 season made it look real bad for a while).

i wish now that i kept the north stars cap i bought at maple leaf
gardens the morning after they eliminated montreal in 1980. (i got it
to spite the montreal fans in the small town where i grew up.) what a
glorious season that was for the north stars !

the pens wo n't be playing montreal , because boston will win adams
divisional play. buffalo and quebec will make decent showings.
boston , out of sheer determination , will win a game against the pens ,
but no more. they have heart , but the pens have too many big guns and
too many ways to win.

if boston does indeed win the adams (nothing is certain) , and
indeed gets to play the pens , then i think you 'll find a very
different boston team this year. boston will use every trick in the
book to shut down the pens offense something they did n't even try
last year. the pens' weak spot is defense and goaltending if boston

first , i enjoyed reading your post. second , i disagree with the pen 's weak
spot being defense and goaltending for a couple of reasons. barrasso has
had a spectacular year no slow start , consistently sharp , gaa 3.0 , and
leads the league in wins. tommy deserves the vezina. given the lack of
respect he commands , though , i doubt he will win it. the other reason
concerns the pens' team defense. they are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the
fewest goals allowed. that is a big improvement for them , and it indicates
that they are playing better team defense.

can shut down the pens' offense and get an early goal , then you have a
real game. if the pens score first , then it 's practically over. i
do n't think the pens have the discipline to stick to the team game if
they 're held scoreless 5 minutes into the second.

boston does n't have the guns of the pens , but the pens does n't have
the defense , goaltending , and discipline of boston. still , boston can
put the puck in the net. remember that boston is not a run and gun
patrick style team , although they played run and gun hockey for the
better part of the regular season (who does n't). even neely backchecks
all the way in behind his own net if necessary.

penalty killing will be a big factor. boston are , i believe 2 over
the last 40 something short handed situations , meaning they have
scored 4 shg while giving up 2 ppg (one in a lackluster game against
ottawa).

i 'd say the series will go to 5 or 6. but i'm much less certain
whether it will be in favor of the pens or the b 's. their styles going
into the playoffs are too different to make it predictable. still , i 'd
place my bets on the pens i think. my prediction is that if the b 's
can get the first goal in four of the games , they 'll take the series.
otherwise the pens will.

but i 'd rather wait and see whether the b 's will actually get out
of the adams to begin with... buffalo , quebec , and montreal are n't
exactly planning to call it a game and go home !

al micheals out of this. he annoys me.
i'm hoping this leads to a regular season contract. my guess would
be is that it will be roughly a weekly game from feb. april and then the

the subject line says it all. is it terribly difficult to get tickets
to penguins games , especially now that they are in the playoffs \? would
it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets \?

there are always scalpers with tickets outside the arena. you might have
to pay a few bucks extra , but you can always find them. look on the
street under the message board , or out on the street in front of the hyatt ,
or even around gate 1. the later you buy them , the less money you 'll pay ,
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time. might be better to pick them
up earlier now , though.

true , coach matikainen is ready to keep a spot for teemu all the way

a fine 26 year history came to a close tonight , as the minnesota north stars ,
or norm 's stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the red wings by a score of
5 3. the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen , who netted
two including the final one in franchise history , with less than a minute to
play.

this is very sad indeed. my condolences to the minnesota fans who are
losing their team.

i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team

about 25 is correct for numminen and lumme.

compared to kurri , selanne 's points are too high , lets make it 25 or 26.

no , kurri 's points are too low. 27 for kurri and 28 for sel nne.

well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of
markus ketterer (the goalie) , 3 4 or the players listed above and luck. there 's
presumably a lot of decent players in finland that would n't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players , however. my guess would be
that the finnish canada cup team would be a .500 team in the nhl.

wow , now , it looks like you do n't like our players \? what about guys like
nieminen , jutila , riihijarvi , varvio , laukkanen , makela , keskinen and (even
if he is aging) ruotsalainen \? the main difference between finnish and north
american players is , that our players tend to be better in the larger rink.
the canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in europe.
and i think that there was more in our success than ketterer and luck (though
they helped). i think that the main reason was , that the team worked well
together.


that 's true. game is so different here in europe compared to nhl. north ame
ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. an average
european player from sweden , finland , russian or tsech slovakia is a better
skater and puckhandler than his nhl colleague. especially defenders in nhl
are mainly slow and clumsy. sel nne has also said that in the finnish sm league
game is more based on skill than in nhl. in finland he could n't get so many
breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
nhl. also alpo suhonen said that in nhl sel nne 's speed accentuates because
of clumsy defensemen.

i have to admit that the best players come from canada , but those regulars
are n't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. also top europeans
are in the same level as the best north americans.(except lemieux is in the
class of his own).

i have one complaint for the cameramen doing the jersey pitt series show
the shots , not the hits. on more than one occassion the camera zoomed in

as i promised , i would give you the name of the panther 's president.
after huizenga announced the team name , he announced that bill
torrey is named the first president of the panthers.

a little bio from sun sentinel
torrey , the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as
persident and general manager of the new york islanders.
throughout his 27 years in the nhl , bill torrey 's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as andre agassi 's hair.

the panthers will introduce a uniform , insignia , and ticket price
information in early next month. in the meantime , huizenga leaves the
day to day operation in the hands of torrey and bob clarke , the vp and
gm.

the florida panthers was chosen as the name of south florida 's nhl team
to focus attention on an endangered species. there are 30 to 50 florida
panthers in the everglades national park , the big cypress national
preserve and other parts of southwestern florida.

the panther is the quickest striking of all cats , torrey said.
hopefully that 's the way we 'll play on ice.

more bio
in torrey , huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion islanders
in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the islanders to four
consecutive stanley cup championships (their first after only eight
seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons. as executive vice president
of the california golden seals , torrey watched the seals go to the play
offs in 1968 , only their second nhl season.

i guess this completes my own personal hat trick , said torrey , 58 , a
native of montreal but a resident of bear lakes country club in palm
beach.

after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that
milwaukee should have an nhl team , i thought i 'd pass along a story i heard
recently. this is second hand , so i do n't know how true it is , but i have
no reason to doubt it either.

bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge
hockey team. the owner of the admirals (sorry , i ca n't remember his name)
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
bradley center.

supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise , but
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 50 million was too
high.

like i said , i do n't know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if
it 's true , do n't look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon. the admirals
are n't going to be forced out of the building and you wo n't see an nhl club
and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the nba 's
milwaukee bucks play there as well.

you 're wrong again. the selke is awarded to the forward that does the
best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger. if
gilmour does the best defensive job in the league i do n't see why he
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen

organization computer science department , stanford university.

as the sharks' season came to a close tonight , i will start a series of posts ,
trying to revisit the players , the trades , the moves , etc. , that went through
for the sharks for the past season. if you are uninterested , since i will
have the words sharks review in the subject heading in these postings , you can
kill them.

i will first try to evaluate how the players did. these ratings , of course ,
are subject to my own biases , but i hope that i can try to be as objective as
possible. i will evalute players who finished the season with the sharks
and or did not play for another nhl team this season.

thus , then , let 's go to the goaltenders...

1 brian hayward season 11th
acquired '91 92 from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade p (d)

it is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end , a career that
featured sharing three jennings trophies (with patrick roy , in '87 , '88 , and
'89). it would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing
grade (and skip the letter grading) , but he had simply been awful on ice this
year , save for a bright spot or two , and even if he had been healthy , he would
not be any more than the 3rd string goalie.

but hayward was a classy individual , who also figured in on the sharks' first
ever victory , the 3rd game of the season last year against the calgary flames.
as he retires , the fans will remember what a good guy he was.

30 jeff hackett season 3rd
acquired '91 92 , from n. y. islanders in expansion draft
grade c

hackett , after (deservedly) winning the team mvp honors last season , simply
wasted the year. other than a few good spots (57 saves against los angeles ,
almost shutout against tampa bay , etc.) , hackett , finishing with 85.6 save
percentage and a 5.28 gaa , watched his status go from the team 's 1 goalie to
bench decoration at the end of the season. he was expected , early , to carry
the team along instead , he apparently became frustrated , but the an early
injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor ,
but upon return , he simply was n't up to the task. he may not return next
year.

31 wade flaherty season 1st (still eligible as rookie)
acquired '91 92 , signed as undrafted free agent
grade i (a )

it is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone , thus the
incomplete grade , but yet in the one start that he did get (against the calgary
flames) , flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods. he started
the season poorly in kansas city , but finished strong , prompting the blades'
owner ron parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the ihl mvp
honors. the upcoming ihl playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he
tries to make it into the nhl last year , he was a capable backup for arturs
irbe in the throughout the season and in the turner cup playoffs , picking up
all star honors along with irbe now it 's time for him to show that he can
share the job with irbe next year , because with prospects dan ryder , trevor
robins , and scott cashman coming along , if he does n't make it next year , he
may not ever.

32 arturs irbe season 1st
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade b

i may yet be overly critical of irbe in a year that he clearly established that
he 's a bona fide nhl goaltender , perhaps a bona fide 1 goaltender. he has
provided most of the little highlight footage that the sharks team had , getting
the team 's first ever shut out against the los angeles kings on december 26.
he has been fearless in and out of the net , aggressively playing the puck and
making passes , reminding people of a young ron hextall (except , of course , the
goonism). yet he still needs to develop more consistency , which is hard to do
with such a bad defense in front of him , but if the sharks are to challenge for
a playoff spot next season , irbe 's the key , as he demonstrated in being named
as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.

tuesday , and the isles caps game is going into overtime.
what does espn do.....

tom mees says , we are obligated to bring you baseball

we 're probably stuck , as mike burger pointed out that the baseball
deal was made far in advance of the nhl contract. wabc did the same
thing they were thankful that the devils were wiped out by 9 30 ,
because they had to switch over to yankees baseball. the proof of
the reasons for this is left to the reader ...

it 's too bad , but i wonder if espn is stuck with other us local team
coverage for their alternate games \? we got nesn 's coverage of the
bruins sabres with the boston homers ... they were awful ! ! ! i 've read
that derek sanderson is the colour analyst ... i wonder if he spent
his early years after hockey as an intern at pravda before landing
this job \? everything had to be twisted into something good to say
about the bruin(s) involved ... not even bill wirtz 's shills on sc
chicago (pat foley , dale tallon) were this bad. and just to be fair ,
sc used to take their feed from esn (empire sports network) , the sabre
homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.

from the cnn highlights , i hear chris cuthbert 's voice from the cbc
coverage of the habs nords series. too bad that we could n't get it
on espn , with all due respect to the sabres and the bruins.

mike emrick is substituting on the devils scny team for gary thorne.
mike was the original devils tv play by play announcer , by the way.

well put , jason. i am not from wisconsin , but i have close relatives who
live in port washington (about 30 minutes north of milwaukee) , i visit the
city regularly , and i have been in the bradley four times to see the admirals
play and the ncaa hockey championships. it is a beautiful building. the
pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in
north america.
as to what will happen with the admirals if milwaukee does acquire a
franchise , word is the team will move to green bay and play in the brown
county arena.
once again , the admirals are an independent franchise , and the people of
milwaukee have been supporting them well. the games i have been to have seen
crowds anywhere from 10 , 000 to 13 , 000 , which are numbers some nhl teams (i.e.
the islanders , hartford , new jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.
plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without
the glamour of having an nhl club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount
of hockey interest exists in the city.

sincerely ,

but i think the reason is lemieux
had a 168 point season and was the first non gretzky to win the hart and
ross since 1980. people turned out to watch him play.

i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans , even if the team sucks.
but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase
will last , unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt kicking
one. pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support
them. if they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you 'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.

i disagree. mcnall has demonstrated with gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well. very few fans real
istically expect the kings to do well this year (although i do) and yet they
still go out to see gretzky. this is the marketing strategy selling the
game by selling the stars that is employed by baseball and , notably , the
nba and this is the attitude that the new bettman mcnall leadership is
bringing to the league. they have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars. timo salami and brett hull are perfect
examples of players that real fans know are n't worth a damn and yet , being
benificiaries of marketing oriented coaching strategies , have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer , the very fans the nhl wants to
attract , that these players are indeed superstars.

they made the transaction to try and build a winner around mario , that is
true. but the improvement in attendance came before they started doing
this (coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team.
a doubling of attendance occured in 1984 85 from the previous year. an
increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that. the arrival
of mario lemieux is what did it.

it might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly
found an interest in mario and the pens. was it gee , mario lemieux is
amazing , i 'll go watch him play , or was it gee , now we 've got a kick
ass guy on our side , i 'll go watch him play . i think it was the latter.

it ai n't nearly so simple as this. the casual fan does n't think about much
at all. can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit iq who believes that
mcdonalds makes good hamburgers \?

i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the
cfl...did you leave it out because you do n't know much about the cfl \? if
that 's the case then fair enough , but if it is n't the case then i'm curious
to hear your explanation.

yes but apparently the rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi
bilities has he \? he was hyped , initially , as a superstar , but outside of
one grey cup game he has done very little to maintain enhance that assess
ment of his talents. most argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him.

the adams division race is certainly interesting this year. here are
important data to keep in mind in the eventuality of a tie for a given
standing position.

in head to head games
quebec wins over montreal , 4 3 0
boston leads against quebec , 3 1 1 with two games remaining
montreal and boston are tied , 4 4 0 with one game remaining.

(..) pierre breton (aka fluide glacial)

pierre ,
for purposes of the tie breaker , you only count the first three games in
each city. therefore , quebec cannot possibly be ahead of montreal 4 3 ,
and there 's probably only one game that counts remaining between boston
and quebec , which means boston has probably already won.

in a development that shocked most knowledgable observers , the detroit redwings
scored no less than six goals against the best goaltender in the world en
route to a 6 3 win over the best team in the nhl , the toronto maple leafs.

the leafs could not be faulted , as they completely dominated the inferior
detroit squad and clearly deserved to win. only the biased officiating of
andy van hellemond and the idiots that insisted upon throwing an octopus on
the ice at every stoppage in an obvious attempt to distract the superior
visiting side prevented an all out massacre of the wings by the league 's best
team.

what 's going on \? the russians and the czechs are unable to beat easy
opponents , and the swedes beat austria only 1 0 \? ! \?

it 's the opening game effect maybe. pros arrive late , nervousness for
rookie wc players , and problems to get the lines clicking may make things
hard to get it going against these worse nations.
i 'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game , the better
it is , since the chances of an upset are greater then.

some other reasons why the worse teams are so tough to beat was presented
by hans virus lindberg (former coach in switzerland).

1) the worse teams (referring to france , switzerland , austria , italy etc)
have now usually world class goalies.

2) their defensive play have become much more disciplined , they take much
less unnecessary penalties.

3) they use four lines which makes it harder to make them run out of gas.

4) the ice quality in the german wc rinks is poor.

the only convincing winner was... germany. wierd.

another weird thing was that the czechs played entertaining hockey..

as the subject suggests the flames were not impressive this afternoon ,
dropping a 6 3 decision to the la kings. most of the flames neglected
to show up , especially in their own zone , as the kings hit at least
five posts ! the flames best line was probably
skrudland paslawski berube (which tells how bad the flames were). gary
suter scored a great goal (in fact all three flame goals were scored
by d men yawney and dahlquist getting the others) , but also made
some bonehead plays. for the kings , pat conacher was especially
impressive.

the games was very chippy , as dan mirouelli lost control early and
never recovered it there were high sticks , cross checks , punches ,
hits from behind. fleury got a game misconduct for rubbing out warren
rychel from behind. flames dominated the game physically , but failed
to take advantage due to horrendous defensive lapses (i do n't think
vernon can be blamed for any of the goals). calgary went with 7 d men ,
as roger johansson played lw he looked lost imho i hope king
inserts chris lindbergh , paul kruse , or sergei makarov for wednesday 's
game. gretzky left the game in the 2nd period with a charley horse no
idea how serious he did n't return.

i still think the flames should win this series , but they better

here is a review of some of the off ice things that have
affected the ahl this year.


st john's maple leafs problems
the st john 's maple leafs sophomore season has been plagued by
problems. on ice , the leafs won the atlantic division title but
off ice was less happy. a strike by public workers has forced the
leafs out of the newfoundland city for much of the last half of
the seaosn (since mid jan). they have played home games in places
like montreal , cornwall and charlottetown. their playoff home
games will be played in the metro center in halifax , ns. one
demostration got violent. workers attacked a leafs' bus and
rocked it and broke windows in the st john 's memorial stadium.
despite the problems , toronto officials insist that the leafs
will return to st john 's once the strike ends.

senators sold
the new haven senators have been sold by peter shipman to
the ottawa senators nhl organization. they are the only canadian
nhl team with an american ahl affiliate , and have made it clear
they intend to move the team to somewhere in the canadian atlantic
provinces. this sale and move has yet to be approved by the ahl
head office , but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting
in may. the quote in the story from jack butterfield made it
clear the league was more interested in the stability of the
ahl franchise accompanied by nhl ownership , rather than maintaining
the 56 year history of the ahl in new haven.

the senators are currently in serious negotiations with charlottetown
new brunswick and are expected to move there.

dallas helps hawks stay in moncton

by , i believe , pyman productions , was televised across the canadian
maritimes and northeastern us. the first few weeks saw two games of
the week , one in canada and another in the us but since then , there
has been only one. sunday afternoon and night games were covered and
shown on sportschannel ny and ne in the us and , i believe , atlantic
sports network in canada (but i'm not sure about that). i am not
sure if playoff games will be covered.

utica gone \? syracuse added \?
there were heavy rumors that the utica devils will not be around next
season. there were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern
city and that the city of syracuse is trying to lure them.

what it comes down to is that jagr , despite being an arrogant asshole , is a
very good hockey player who has had a better season this year than ron francis.
jagr has more points and a better .

jagr has a higher , but francis has had more points. and take it from
an informed observer , ronnie francis has had a much better season than
jaromir jagr. this is not to take anything away from jaro , who had a
decent year (although it did n't live up to the expectations of some).

is a good stat because it is the only stat that i am aware of that
takes into account defensive play. it is n't a measure of defensive
play it takes into account offense and defence all aspects of play.

if we are interested of real all round players , the power play stats
should be considered , too. because the power play is also one aspect
of play ! there is still something to be done with these player evaluation
tools ! !

imo any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage. very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points.
tends to expose these overrated players such as brett hull ,
john cullen and dave andreychuck.

given the opportunity to play power play consistently , any player can
inflate his totals.

chelios the norris ,

if you asked me 30 days ago , i 'd agree with you. i now give the nod to
raymond bourque his play took off the same time the b 's did. chelios
gets a close second...

how about kevin hatcher \? scored roughly 35 goals , plays 30 minutes a game.

dunno who wins the vezina , but i suspect not potvin.

barrasso finally gets his due , in a close one over eddie the eagle...

that 's really sad when two second rate goalies (barasso and belfour)
are the main contenders for the vezina. call me crazy , but how about
tommy soderstrom five shutouts for a 6th place team that does n't
really play defense. it 's really unfortunate that the better goalies
in the league (mclean , essensa , vernon) had unspectacular years. btw ,
if you are going to award the norris on the basis of the last 30 days ,
why not give the vezina to moog \? he has been the best goalie over the
past month.

coach of the year is tricky burns did the most with the least raw talent ,
king did a good job but the flames clearly underachieved last year , brian
sutter has done exceptionally well in his first year with a new team , ditto
demers , page has been blessed by the ripening and acquisition of young
talent , darryl sutter is having a good year for a rookie coach , berry made
the best of a bad situation , terry crisp worked minor miracles , and bowman
was bowman. i 'd pick burns , but i'm mildly biased.

in your case , that bias is acceptable )... mine shows with the norris pick ,
so we 're even...

i'm impressed with what all the coaches you mentioned did , but my pick would be
al arbour. not too many folks thought the isles would be in the playoffs , let
alone contend for 3rd in their division... granted that they did have a little
help from their cousins on broadway... )

and i like the islanders about as much as i like mowing my lawn...

arbour or king. burns will probably win , since playoffs are n't taken
into consideration he 's ok in the regular season , but i'm not sure
if he 's beaten anyone other than hartford in the playoffs.

if there 's anyone who can help me on these items , please
let me know.

markus naslund i saw that modo lost early in the national
tournament and that he was playing for the national
team at the world championships. any stats
available \? any word on how he 's playing \? when
is he expected to join the club \?


markus had a good season in modo in the swedish elite league , scoring
22 goals , 17 assists , 39 points and 67 pim in 39 games.

as daryl points out , markus wo n't be joining the pens for this year 's
playoffs , since the world championships starts april 18th.

but there is a good chance that markus will join the pens before next
season. modo , though , naturally wants to keep their superstars forsberg
and naslund , so the latest news on this is that modo is looking for
personal sponsors for forsberg and naslund in order to match the kind
of money they would receive in nhl.

daryl turner writes
by 'the club' , i would assume you mean the pens. do n't hold your breath ,
you are n't going to see naslund this year. the world championship
tournament does n't start until 18 april. so nhl teams wo n't see any
influx of europeans , and no team playing in the wc will see a sudden
influx of 'eliminated' nhlers. the earliest a player on a playoff bound
team could join a wc team is the last game of the round robin , and i
doubt any coach is going to want to play short one player for that long.

actually , swedish coach curt lundmark is thinking about leaving two
spots open for additions from eliminated nhlers. it is mats sundin and
calle johansson that curt hopes can join the team , although in a late
stage of the tournament. technically , i seem to recall that you can leave
spots open until 24 hrs before the wc final.

well , if things were different and i had my way , the headline would be nhl ,
european division regular season game stockholm storm vs. helsinki tornado
4 3... two games against every north american based team (46 in all) , and this
might have been the ninth and final regular season encounter between helsinki
and stockholm. the remaining 27 games would involve paris , dortmund , milan...
a nice dream.

the bottom line is the bruins are the better team this year.
montreal fans have been screaming for years that their beloved canadiens deserve
another cup. since the removal of the french canadien rule , they have been screaming
foul. welcome to league parity , something the rest of the league has had for years.
even if the habs do beat boston in the playoffs , they wo n't get by the pens.
i do agree with you , boston is the more taleneted team.


the french canadian rule was an extremely short term feature when the
universal draft was instituted in the sixties and only lasted for a
few years...and really did n't have any substantial effect during that
period. the canadiens stanley cup achievements were earned on a
level playing field.

before i begin lambasting don cherry , let me first say that i 've been sort of
a cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly ,
but he 's more or less harmless. on saturday , however , he crossed the lines of
good taste

according to don , the entire article was n't perfect , and there
were some 'shots' by frank musil and alpo suhonen.
don noted that musil was n't much of a player (did n't
score many goals last year). he also made fun of their names...
one guy has a name like dog food , the other like a laxitive
(meta musil).

this is the best he can do \? ! ! gee don , tremendous amounts of professionalism
here. the cbc looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with
this nonsense...making fun of names \? \? it 's bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about european players , but he 's now resorted to making fun
of their names too \? he sounded like an idiot , much like he did last week
when he said that teemu would never make it to his 'rock 'em , sock 'em' video
until he dropped the gloves...

on the subject of realignment , don said that he liked the
new division names.

well , what he said was that even though he 's been around the league for quite
some time , he still does n't know who 's where w.r.t. conference and division
names. hello \? \? ! ! mcfly \? \? the names have been around for a couple of decades
or so....he also invited the audience to name the teams in the wales...quick ,
quick ! followed by ah , you do n't know , i do n't know....

sorry don. wrong on this one.

ron (to don) i do n't know wy i like you on your show
for 30 minutes... i can hardly stand you on this show for 5.

this was absolutely hilarious.

don 's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
good...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the nba case. serious money...oh well , he 's never been one for objectivity ,
has he \?

don 's question to gretzky

would n't it be better
for you to change your friends so that they like the game , than for
us to change the game for your friends \?

now this i liked.

subject european expansion and our f cked system
organization dalhousie university , halifax , nova scotia , canada
lines 36

everyone keeps talking about european expansion by 2010 thinking
wishful thoughts , but being totally off the ball.

the league format we use here is incompatible with that in europe.
(for those that do n't know , the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted).

would european fans put up with our if you 've paid , you can play
attitude \? \?

how long would they support teams that are run on ranger based
corporate thinking (i use the term lightly). (we do n't need a good
product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa 's
record every year......1940 ! ! haha (sorry , had ta say it)).

if hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to europe , maybe
teams like the rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth
division). we 'd have many more teams...centres that are n't as big (like
halifax or adirondack....ok , so halifax is n't a good example) would
eventually get promoted , and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division (unlike ottawa , sj , edmonton , etc.). fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect) , and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams (and the halifax citadels win the stanley cup...i can
dream , ca n't i \? \? )

look at british (or any european) soccer as an example (they never have fan
problems).

just someone who thinks our system really sucks

and now , i interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you
another message sponsored by the department of really mundane statistics

i passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through
a filter to average out games , goals , assists , points , and penalty minutes
for the mythical average nhl pro who played in the league this season. (why \?
because it 's monday and i did n't feel like writing any real code...)

anyway , after i wiped out the 60 odd goalies in the list , i came up with

nhl average 55 gp 11 g 19 a 30 pts 69 pim

then i passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who
had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.

marty mcinnis (nyi) 56 gp (1 ) 10 g (9 ) 20 a (5 ) 30 pts (0 ) 24 pim (65 )
igor kravchuk (edm) 55 gp (0 ) 10 g (9 ) 17 a (10 ) 27 pts (9 ) 27 pim (53 )

these two are close in games , goals , assists , and points , but are too far off
in pim. this leaves , as the most average player in the nhl

bobby carpenter (was) 65 gp (18 ) 11 g (0 ) 17 a (10 ) 28 pts (6 ) 63 pim (8 )

what an honor.

i also passed the list through with the goalies still included. kravchuk and
carpenter were still in the top three , but rob dimaio came flying up from
behind to take the title

nhl average 53 gp 10 g 17 a 27 pts 64 pim
igor kravchuk (edm) 55 gp (3 ) 10 g (0 ) 17 a (0 ) 27 pts (0 ) 27 pim (50 )
bobby carpenter (was) 65 gp (22 ) 11 g (10 ) 17 a (0 ) 28 pts (3 ) 63 pim (1 )
rob dimaio (tb) 54 gp (1 ) 9 g (9 ) 15 a (11 ) 24 pts (11 ) 62 pim (3 )


it 's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.

sorry roger but mr basketbal should what he really means here. ie he should
have said that he hopes fans in the american southeast can follow the
names of the divisions. the odds that these people other than those who
are displaced notherners (who are probably already fans) is on the order
of the proverbial snowball 's in hell.

i am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here. if you
asked somone , who had never heard of hockey before , if la played in
the smythe division what do you think that the response would be \?
what if you asked this person if la played in the west division \? the
naming of divisions after long dead entrepreneurs is unnecessary
obfuscation.

i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason. the names
patrick , smythe , norris , adams and campbell are all the names of so called
builders of the game. this is the same type of thinking that put stein
in the hall of fame. this is absolute nonsense. the real builders of the
game are richard , morenz , howe , conacher , orr , etc. if you are going to
name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people
who deserve it.

yes these people deserve recognigtion as hockey greats but the old division
names took into account messers patrick , norris , smythe and the prince who
had alot more to do with the origins of the league than people who came into
an already established situation. it is much easier to be an element of change

hardly. the established situation existed prior to smythe , et al.
the stanley cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
could successfully mount the challenge. what our dear founders did
was formalize the challenge. they created a closed league , an oligop
olistic professional system , in the interests of making money. wheth
er or not that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
debatable. we are , however , stuck with their invention and that de
bate is academic. the point to be made , however , is that people
played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey long before smythe
and his pals showed up.

or a standout in an existing situation than it is to be someone who creates
a new situation. if you want to honor players like bobby orr than i'm sure
you can find a reason to name a torphy after him such as best offensive
defenseman.

what 's wrong with best defenceman , period \? was there ever a better
defenceman \? was there ever a better player \? and if you think that
bruce norris' contribution was somehow more significant than bobby
orr 's then , in the interests of education , why do n't you take a poll
and find out how many people know who norris was \? but you do n't have
to , do you \?

no i ca n't for the reasons i gave above. i'm in the same boat as jason and i
grew up with the current divisonal names and learned them when i was about
10 years old and who played in what division. if a 10 year old american
can learn this why would it be hard for an occasional fan to pick up
on who plays in what division \?

so you do n't feel that you should have to make the effort to remember
that vancouver plays in the west division \? (or pacific , or whatever
other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen.)

oh. now i see your point. your intention has been to alert us to the erosion
of purity. i 'll bet you like hockey because it 's , for the most part , played
by whites of european extraction.

probably not. in my case i'm sure of this. what you said would be like me
saying that all maple leafs fans are as biased , closed minded , ignorant ,

and of course you neatly deleted jason 's jingoistic rant about the
game losing its canadianization . quoting me out of context does
more to erode your credibility than it does mine. my position is
clearly progressive and is anything but biased , closed minded , ig
norant . arrogant , i will grant you.

arrogant , and moronic as you. just because someone a) does n't like what
mr basketball is doing , b) voices their opinion. and c) likes the senerio of
you going to antartica does not mean that you have the right to insult them.

nice try john. but for a flame to be truly effective you have to
display at least enough intelligence to earn your target 's
respect.

jagr has a higher , but francis has had more points. and take it from
an informed observer , ronnie francis has had a much better season than
jaromir jagr. this is not to take anything away from jaro , who had a
decent year (although it did n't live up to the expectations of some).

bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman style
player. he plays hard at all times , does n't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader. bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time.

jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude.
this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.

throughout the year , francis consistently recieved more ice time than
jagr. althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject , i am pretty
sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis. when
you add to that jagr 's better rating , i think it becomes evident
that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one.


actually , what i think has become more evident , is that you are determined to
flaunt your ignorance at all cost. jagr did not have a better season than
francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
hockey knowledge. save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
plus minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
time per game and some measure of its quality (i.e. , is the player put out
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc) , i would
much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

thank you for posting this. as the person who first brought up the
fact that jagr has a much higher than francis , i can assure you
that i brought it up as an example of the absurdity of
comparisons , even on the same team. i never , ever thought that anyone
would argue that jagr 's higher actually reflected better two way
play.

in my opinion , francis 's low is purely a result of him being asked
to play against opponents top scorers at all times the fact that he
can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team 's top center
is a testament to how valuable he is , even if his suffers. on the
other hand , jagr , for how big , fast and skilled he is , ca n't even get
90 points , no matter how inflated his is.

(by the way , do n't get me wrong i like jagr. he may be a lazy
floater , but he turns it on at exactly the right times like
overtime of playoff games).

after watching the pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as

goaltenders).

have a look at ed belfour.

he also kicked john mclean. of
course he was n't called for that.

belfour kicked gerrard gallant when the wings played the 'hawks
a couple of weeks ago. no penalty. no review. no suspension.
this was after he attacked bob probert in the previous period.
he was penalized for that.

there 's no doubt in
my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall.
he 's also very good.

doug gilmour and the leafs are an old tampa bay.

right gerald. and take away bob probert and the wings are dead octopuses.

the leafs deserve a lot of credit for their diligent effort
during the regular season...but if detroit puts in a reasonable
effort , this is not a contest.

let 's wait for the body to get cold before we start in with the eulogies
hm \? they have only lost one game. the game was in detroit after all and
potvin did not have his best evening. nobody that i saw thought that the
leafs would sweep the wings. it looks like it might go six. the leafs
will take the wings home advantage away in the next game.

please. have a care with phil. we liked him a lot in pittsburgh. he
did n't score a lot if you look at his stats last year but he worked his
butt off. it was his speed that created opportunities in the offensive
zone that allowed the pens to utilize his potential. i have n't been
paying attention to him this year so i ca n't say i know what you 're
objecting to. he has been out with injuries though , has n't he \? and
if the offense is n't there , there 's not much his speed will do for you.
like i said , he created opportunities but he did n't score much. i thought
the money offered from the rangers was a little high , and so did the pens ,
i guess.

deg has many german born forwards in the team. in fact the majority of players
are german born. 1992 93 deg had 11150 average in 11800 spectator arena.

interesting ! one of our german friends here (robert \? ) told me their forwards
were all canadian germans. perhaps somebody can sort this out for us \?

as far as i know dusseldorf has only one canadian german forward (i.e. a player
who was born in canada but now has a german passport).
benoit doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play
for germany in the wc.

the other canada born forwards are
peter john lee (has british passport)
chris valentine
dale dercatch
steve gootas
earl spry ( \? )

at the moment there are only three german born forwards coming into my mind
bernd trunschka , andreas brockmann , ernst koepf

hm , do you think dusseldorf fans would like it if their team joined the nhl \?
or do we have to include koln as well (cologne to you anglophiles) to make
them happy \? )

the hawks won the norris div , and sealed their fate. it 's bad luck
to win the norris. the hawks will sweep the blues in their dreams but will
lose in 6 in reality. i predict that in the 6 game with the blues belfour
will go down on his knees 7000 time s and will spend the rest of the time
looking behind him self. butcher will pound roenick and the warthawks have
no one tough enough to prevent it

so what 's the deal with bill wirtz \? apparently , the blackhawks st.
louis game was a standing room only sell out as usual , but the hawks
reported the attendace as 16 , 199. gee , i wonder if wirtz is planning to
use this as justification for continuing to keep home games off of tv \?
what a schmuck.

in other tv news , the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3
fewer broadcast tv games , and will have 22( ! ) games on some sort of

torrey , the architect of four consecutive stanley cup champions as

throughout his 27 years in the nhl , bill torrey 's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as andre agassi 's hair.

the panthers will introduce a uniform , insignia , and ticket price

all of this is fine. i never said that murray was a bad gm. i merely said
that he is n't the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor.
if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup
by now probably more than once. if he was as great a gm as you claim

i think you missed one of my points there. it takes more than a great
gm to win a stanley cup , even once. some of the guys on the list you
gave earlier never won one. i agree that you and i could probably argue
back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best gm in hockey
that is a matter of opinion , and who is to say my opinion is any better
than yours or yours than mine \? but the point of my original original
post (if not well stated) was that murray has the gm abilities but not
the coaching abilities. which leads to below

and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.

i think at this point there 's a personal , emotional element involved here
which transcends murray 's logical thought. as outsiders , it 's fine for
us to say , he should hire a different coach. in fact , he has talked about
doing so in the past. but , the press (here in detroit , at least) has so
built up this business about murray never getting past the second round of
the playoffs as a coach , that i think he has taken it upon himself to
prove to the world that he is capable of coaching a team past the second
round. he needs to , as the papers say , get that monkey off his back.
so it becomes a matter not of intelligence , but of pride. is it foolish
to let pride stand in the way of sound logic \? perhaps , but we 're all
a little that way from time to time. i think eventually he 'll step down
from behind the bench and concentrate on his gm duties , and the team will
improve as a result.

i think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent
on gm work. in that sense , once he steps down as coach , we 'll see how
good of a gm he really is.

but murray is an average (unspectacular) nhl coach and a pretty good gm
so none of this is true anyway.

i may not agree with everything you 've said , but it 's been fun discussing
it with you.

in response to a debate about who has has a better season jagr of francis

i think jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time stats
do n't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better .


actually , what i think has become more evident , is that you are determined to
flaunt your ignorance at all cost. jagr did not have a better season than
francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
hockey knowledge. save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
plus minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
time per game and some measure of its quality (i.e. , is the player put out
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc) , i would
much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

is a useful statistic. if a player is on the ice when his team scores a
lot of goals and only allows a few goals , he must be doing something right.
it is especially useful to compare between teammates as they play for the
same team and should have roughly similar ratings if they are equally
good players. it can be adjusted with varying degrees of success to compare
between players on different teams.

i agree it would be nice for the nhl to keep more statistics but how useful
are the ones that you suggest \? \? total ice time would be very useful it is
a missing stat in jagr vs francis arguments from before. somehow measuring
the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless. it would be a
better stat for evaluating coaching ie are the players given quality ice
time actually their talented ones \? a very good player could be given low
amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who
does n't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of
quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that
thinks he is an effective player. this stat would be much more flawed than
and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.

is a useful stat. it is quite useful in evaluating player talent.
you are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see
that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed
is a very positive thing and should be evaluated as such.

after watching the pengiuns all year (and as many other teams as
possible) , i 've really noticed an increase in tom barasso 's cheap shots
this year (and not noticed a corrsponding increase with other
goaltenders). i 've also noticed that he usually gets away with it. just
as examples last night , i noticed him elbowing scott stevens in the
head , which basically started the whole shoving match that got stevens
(scott) and tocchet 2 minute minors. he also kicked john mclean. of
course he was n't called for that. is n't kicking an automatic match
penalty and 10 game suspension \? i think glenn anderson got one a few
years ago for kicking gaetan duchesne in the chest. there 's no doubt in
my mind that barasso is the dirtiest golatender since hextall. he 's also
very good.

how about that tocchet head butt \? is there an automatic susppension that
goes along with a (non kicking) match penalty \? i ca n't remember anymore.

i was under the impression that the objective is to find conclusive

in this case they 've massively outclassed paramount and the

what is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus wc \?
i know that the rangers are holding back kovalev , zubov , and andersson for
binghamton , but i also know that the whalers wanted michael nylander to play
for springfield , while nylander wanted to play for sweden. the whalers allowed
the nhl to decide , and the nhl chose the wcs. how does this differ from the
rangers and oilers \? did the whalers have to go through the league , or could
they have forced nylander to play in springfield \?


obviously , it is ultimately the teams choice...the nhl would obviously
prefer not to annoy the european hockey federations , but the nhl right
now cannot force nhl teams to free their players...the whalers probably
did it this way so as to not annoy their farm team affiliate.

to those who are wondering what is happening in minnesota

from what i have seen in the local news (tv and newspaper) , various people
in the area are trying to get a new hockey team. a columnist for the st.
paul pioneer press wrote an article giving the inside scoop on the
issue. there are three local sites competing for a team and three possible
candiates to move to the twin cities. first the sites target center , civic
center (st. paul) , and yes , even the met center. the columnist was pretty
confident that minnesota will get a team , and that the target center will
ultimately win out. he argued , however , that the competition from the other
two sites will delay the process considerably. without the
inter site competition , the columnist (sorry , i ca n't remember his name)
believes that minnesota would have a team by the 1994 95 season. also ,
because of the situation with the timberwolves , things will be delayed
until (unless) the city of minneapolis takes over the target center.
however , they are unlikely to do so until the met center is destroyed ,
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the met for
conventions and short term events (even with hockey at target). to add to
this mess , a study (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future
viability of the met center , which obviously delays the process even
further. i hope that the study is cancelled , which will have the effect of
knocking the met center out of the running and perhaps encouraging
minneapolis to take over the target center sooner. the city would be
be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the met ,
which may happen.
regarding possible candidates , the three teams are
hartford , tampa bay , and new jersey. i would prefer the devils (minnesota
ice demons \? ) although the lightning may have potential. although it has n't
been announced yet , it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the
target center next year. apparently the devils are interested in playing in
as many of those six games as possible , and i would n't be surprised to see
hartford and tampa show up there either. so , minnesota may end up
getting another team , but it may take a few years.

so in other words , if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out
the penguins , that 's immaterial because it was the coaches decision \? come on ,
joe , think about what you 're saying ! who they played is very significant.
why they played them is what 's irrelevent. a low gaa against good teams
is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders. a low gaa is better then a higher gaa. a low gaa against good
teams is much , much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders.

let 's start over. i'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender. i 'd
take soderstrom right now. what i am saying is that roussel can be a 1
netminder. the gaa difference is less than half a goal per game (less than
that after last night) , their save percentages are close , and their records
are similar. and with that , i just do n't see how you can label roussel as
the most disappointing player on the flyers this season.

you say soderstrom played against better competition. that may very well
be , but there is no way of knowing how roussel would have performed in
those games. besides , against the better scoring teams like pittsburgh ,
the defense is more keyed up than they are against san jose.

the same
for roussel in the ranger game. two real scoring chances , one he made a
great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. if
you were judging roussel on that game alone , you have very little to go by.

but i'm not just judging roussel on that game alone. i 've seen him play
for the past two seasons in philly and before that in hershey. it 's just
my opinion , but i think he 's got what it takes. of course , i thought that
about mark laforest , too. but i never did about wendell young. so i'm
batting .500 in judging hershey talent since the hextall era.

as for the rangers game , you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
offensive player if you like. but rou had his leg in position to make the
save. if he did n't , it would n't have mattered if the rangers player did n't
get the puck up or not. it would have been a goal. on a breakaway that 's
what the goalie wants to do , take away as much as possible and force the
shooter to beat him.

but if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the habs , you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout. that was a 1 goalie in action. roussel
does n't have a game like that in him.

i seem to remember roussel doing an excellent job against pittsurgh on
opening night to give the flyers a tie against the two time defending
champs. and not to take anything away from soderstrom because he was
senational in that game agains the habs. but you ca n't tell me that a
montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
and just flat out missed it. mistakes , both on offense and defense are
part of the game. or there 'd never be shutouts.

anyway , i'm happy the flyers have both soderstrom and roussel and
i'm not going to argue about it anymore. besides , with the current
7 game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year , i
do n't want to piss you off to the point that you do n't sell me any
tickets next season ).

the san jose sharks and ottawa senators are each on their second gm
already...i 'd be willing to wager that both the sharks and senators
will probably see their 3rd gm 's and perhaps their 4th , before we
see the panthers second.

actually , fired coach george kingston was a third of the gm
triumvirate. now that the trio is now duo (dean lombardi and chuck
grillo) , the sharks are already on their 3rd office of the gm . and a
4th is likely to happen before september they 'll either add the new
coach to the oofgm , or name a single gm. so your wager should be
amended to read that sharks are likely to have their 5th gm before the
panther 's get their 2nd. ca n't wait to see how the next season 's nhl
guide and record book lists the gm history of the sharks.

given the depth of next year 's draft , the expansion draft rules , and
the reputation of their gms , anaheim and miami look pretty good as the
first 90s expansion teams to win a cup. san jose and ottawa have
instability at the gm position , something that philly , nyi , edmonton ,
and calgary did not have when they won their first cups. pittsburgh
did , but they needed a quarter century.

april 19 q a following

contact white house office of the press secretary , 202 456 2100

washington , april 19 following is a transcript
of remarks by president clinton to the university of maine black
bears ncaa division i hockey champions

the rose garden

9 58 a.m. edt

the president good morning ladies and gentlemen. it 's
an honor for me to welcome the university of maine black bears , the
winner of the ncaa division i hockey national championship to the
rose garden and the white house. i understand from senator mitchell
that this is the first team from the university of maine every to win
a national championship. and we 're glad to have them here.

i'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to
win the championship , but how the entire state pulled together to
cheer them onto victory.

coming from a state that is also relatively small in
size , but also filled with pride and tradition and community , i can
understand how the people of maine must feel about the black bears.
in our state people are still talking about the time we won the
orange bowl over the number one ranked football team , and that was
back in 1978. i'm sure that 15 years from now , the people of maine
will as proud of this team as they are today.

you know , in my state football is a slightly more
popular sport than hockey. we do n't have a lot of ice. (laughter.)
but after spending three months getting banged around in this town , i
can understand a little more about hockey than i did before i came
here. hockey is a tough game. it 's a hard hitting sport. it does
have one virtue though , there 's a penalty for delay of game. i wish
we had that rule in the senate. (laughter.)

in government as in hockey , leadership is important. in
the united states senate , our team has a great captain , the majority
leader and the senior senator from maine , george mitchell junior
senator cohen looks so young , i ca n't imagine. (laughter.) i'm
actually bitter about senator cohen because he looks so much younger
than me.

on your hockey team , the captain jim montgomery has done
a great job. he scored the winning goal late in the championship
game , leading you to a come from behind victory something else i
know a little bit about.

sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams
and in communities. i share the pride that senator mitchell and
senator cohen and congressman andrews and all the people of maine
must feel for the black bears who have shown us all how to play as a
team , how to bring out the best in one another , and how to come from
behind.

i think it 's important , as i ask young people from
around america who have achieved outstanding things in working
together , to come here to the white house to be recognized and
appreciated by their country , to remember that those kinds of values
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all
of our lives.

we now have another role model , and i'm glad to have
them here today. (applause.)

(the president is presented with team jersey.)
(applause.)

the president that 's great. i love it. it 's beautiful.
(applause.)

(the president is presented with an autographed stick.)

the president thank you. that 's great. (applause.)



q mr. president , did you authorize the move on waco
this morning , sir \?

the president i was aware of it. i think the attorney
general made the decision. and i think i should refer all questions
to her and to the fbi.

q did you have any instructions for her as to how it
should be executed \?

the president no , they made the tactical decisions.
that was their judgment , the fbi.

q is this a raid \?

the president and i will i want to refer you to
talk to the attorney general and the fbi. i knew it was going to be
done , but the decisions were entirely theirs , all the tactical
decisions.

q what did you and senator mitchell talk about this
morning \?

q any chance for that stimulus package \?

the president senator mitchell ought to pay my
quarter. (laughter.) i was in there (laughter).

senator mitchell you have to pay that quarter.

the president i was ready. (laughter.) senator
mitchell , he 's worth a quarter any day.

q any chance for your bill , sir \?

the president we talked about what was going to happen
this week in the senate and about what other meetings we 're going to
have for the rest of the week. we only had about five minutes to
talk. and we agreed we 'd get back together later , around noon , and
talk some more.

q senator dole said over the weekend that your
compromise is no compromise.

the president well , i know he did , but , look , senator
dole and a lot of the other republicans now in the senate voted for
the same kind of thing for ronald reagan in 1983 and our research
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28
emergency spending measures totalling over 100 billion when reagan
and bush were president , in those administrations. and many of those
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the american people
back to work. i do n't want to go back and revisit every one , but you


can do it. you can look at the research there. so this position
they 're taking is not credible. we have a very tough five year
deficit reduction plan. all these costs are covered during that time
and then some. and the very people that are saying this has all got
to be paid for do n't have much of a history on which to base their
position. they 've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this
kind that had very little to with putting the american people back to
work. so i think we 've got a chance to work it out , and i'm hopeful.
we 'll see what happens today and tomorrow. i'm feeling pretty good
about it.

the press thank you

ruotsaleinen was a more than competent nhl'er...his choice of where
to play when did not bear on his hockey playing ability.

he was crucial to the oilers stanley cup victory in 1990 , the one
without gretzky , because he made an oiler power play which was
lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive. the
oilers missed him more the following year than kurri , and i think
the oilers would have make the finals if ruotsaleinen has stayed
around the following season , and would have beaten pittsburgh
with ruotsaleinen and a healthy messier...and delayed pittsburgh 's
dynasty by a season.

wales conference , adams division , semifinal
boston vs. buffalo
the bruins are playing some excellent hockey , and with cam neely back
and moog his old self again this should be a cake walk. bruins in 5.

i'm hoping for a fuhr miracle , but i agree that boston will likely win the
series. goaltending is about equal , top offensive players are about equal
(mogilny lafontaine vs. oates juneau) , but buffalo has no answer to neely
(not to imply that neely is not a top offensive player btw , in fact he 's one
of my favourites even though he 's a damn bruin ) ). and the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway. but i think it will go six.

quebec vs. montreal
this one is very tough to call. montreal certainly has the experience
factor , but quebec is more talented imho. it 'll come down to the
goalies. i 'll go with experience and roy. canadiens in 7.

agreed here...but montreal will be pushed to the limit. is it just me , or
does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy \? go habs ! !

final
boston vs. montreal
will bruin domination continue in this rivalry \? yes. moog has
consistently outperformed roy in the playoffs (after 1986).. other stuff
bruins in five.

i ca n't predict a montreal victory because i 've been watching them play for
6 weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players , especially to play
in the garden. last time they beat the b 's 5 2 but boston had a clear
territorial advantage the victory was roy 's. at the same time , i ca n't
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss , so i 'll just say i will
not be putting money on this series. )

patrick division , semifinal

pittsburgh vs. ny islanders
what can i say \? the pens are flying high and have the most talent in
the league.

agreed. ny does n't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught , independent
of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year. pens in five , which is
credit to ny.

washington vs. new jersey
capitals in 5.

agreed here too , but i think it will go at least six. jersey has a decent
team , and washington has done poorly against the division this year.

pittsburgh vs. washington
if the caps had bill ranford i might see an upset , but don beaupre
just does n't inspire my hopes. penguins in 6.

i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled. i do n't
think it will go six either... maybe five.

conference final
pittsburgh vs. boston
a replay of last year. the penguins are just as good as 12 months ago ,
and the bruins are much improved. but... penguins in 6.

if pittsburgh plays boston , imo they win in likely five , possibly six. they
own the bruins. if they play montreal , i think it will go to seven , and once
again i wo n't be putting money on the seventh game. i say seven because the
habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season.

campbell conference , norris division , semifinal

chicago vs. st. louis (or minnesota)
blackhawks in 5.

chicago will win , but i think in at least six. chicago is not that good ,
imo. and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.

detroit vs. toronto
the leafs have had an excellent season , but they 've been playing
playoff hockey all year the habs under burns were the same way and
always wilted in the playoffs. red wings in 5.

very true. the leafs have much to be proud of , but they will soon find out
why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs. toronto might win two or three
at mlg though. wings in six , maybe even seven.

final
chicago vs. detroit
this will be a war. fedorov will win it in ot. red wings in 7.

it will be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all.
and yes , i think detroit will win. probert will have to come up big though.

smythe division semi finals

vancouver vs. winnipeg
canucks in 7.

our first disagreement. canucks are playing like shit. they do n't use their
size at all , which may explain why they get hammered 8 1 by a team
chasing them (calgary)....winnipeg in six.

calgary vs. los angeles
this would have been tough to call , except for three things. 1 the
kings do n't have a goalie 2 gary roberts will be back 3 the kings
shot themselves in the foot by trading a proven winner (paul coffey)
for a proven loser (jimmy carson). gretzky is just too weary to carry
this group. flames in 5.

this is also tough for me to call , because i have n't seen the smythe enough.
i do n't think roberts will be well enough to figure in , coffey is a
non issue , who cares what carson has done before , and never underestimate
gretzky. la in six.

final
vancouver vs. calgary
flames in 6.

if it is these two , calgary will not need six games. but i think it will be
la winnipeg anyway , and la in seven , because of home ice.

coference final
detroit vs. calgary
red wings in 7.

wow , must 've been tough to go against your team. but let 's see , i picked
la detroit. detroit will win , probably in six.

stanley cup final

three in a row and official 'dynasty' status for the pens \? or can the
wings complete a dream season \? well , the wings are better in goal (not
sufficiently so though imho) and have better d men. however , mario and
the boys can sure score. look for jagr to shine in the playoffs ,
though i sure would love to see probert beat some sense into him. the
pens are just too much , especially since detroit will have a tougher
battle to get here. penguins in 5.

if pittsburgh plays detroit , it will go longer than five , and i would n't bet
against the wings. they are very strong , imo , and nobody knows how strong
because they 've been underachieving most of the year. if forced to choose ,
though , i 'd have to take the penguins.

a side note. vlad , last week you said that selanne was a better player than
gilmour. no way. he is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from
the age difference , there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team.
i'm not asking for flames , either , btw....i 've spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he 's a great player. but while
he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give teemu an edge) ,
gilmour does it all . i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on , esp.
from flame fans. but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill. he is easily one of the best
all round players in the nhl.

kings 6 @ calgary flames 3 04 18 93

the third place kings opened the 1993 stanley cup playoffs in calgary , against
the second place flames and came out with an impressive 6 3 victory in front of
a non sellout crowd of 18 , 605 at the saddledome in calgary.

symthe division playoff hockey this was. both teams seemed a bit tense in the
opening period though the kings scored off the opening face off. the kings got
into the flow of the game much earlier than the flames as they played out
standing team defense. it took the flames 9 45 of the first period to record
their first shot on goal. the kings , ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on
penalty killing , shut down the flames. the flames went 0 8 on the power play
and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities. the kings had
their problems on the power play , yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10
tries.

the kings forwards back checked while the defense stood the flames up at the
blue line , allowing the kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the
flames. rob blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex
pected to be in the lineup on wednesday. wayne gretzky suffered a charlie horse
in his right leg. he took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to
the dressing room for the rest of the game. interviewed on the radio this
morning , he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on wednesday.

1st period
1 0. the kings got things started right off the opening face off. gretzky won
the draw with the puck going to sydor. he crossed center ice and slapped the
puck into the flames zone and behind the net. the puck carried around to the
far side where robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to sandstrom. he
put the puck behind the flames net where gretzky picked it up. gretzky set up
in 'his office' , moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where
sydor had moved in. sydor , who got the puck between the face off dot and the
hash mark , shot off the pass , beating vernon low and between the legs.

millen and fleury went off at 4 57. skrudland went off at 12 25 but the kings
failed to convert. carson went off at 14 53 and the flames failed to convert.
dahlquist went off at 18 34 and dahl went off at 19 30 , giving the kings a 30
second 5on3 which they failed to convert. the kings recorded 2 goal posts in
the period.

2nd period
the kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed
to convert on. with 6 seconds left in the 5on4 , vernon put a bouncing puck into
the stands and received a delay of game.

1 1. calgary evened the score on the ensuing kings power play. kurri , with the
puck in the neutral zone , tried to put the puck into the flames zone but it hit
the stick of fleury and bounced to suter at the flames blue line. suter skated
down the near wing and into the kings zone. he faked a shot at the circle and
skated around kurri. as he cut thorugh the crease , he got hrudey to go with him
and he put the puck behind hrudey , on his stick side for a short hander.

2 1. the kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.
shuchuk , in the far circle passed to sydor at the top of the slot and headed
for the net. sydors shot hit shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot
where 2 kings (shuchuk and granato) were being checked by 3 flames. carson
came from the far corner , picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot
between the legs of vernon from 5 feet above the crease.

3 1. the kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later. rychel was checked off
the puck at the flames blue line. taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass
cross the slot to huddy. huddy shot off the pass , from the near face off dot ,
beating a diving vernon on the glove side.

4 1. 2 59 later , the kings had a 3 goal lead. mcsorley took a shot form the
near point that hit a flame and deflected towards the boards. marty got his
own rebound , skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low
slot that hit dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of vernon.

skrudland went off at 10 53 but the kings could not convert. sydor went off at
12 35 and watters went off at 14 40 , giving the flames a 5 second 5 3 but they
failed to convert. mcsorley went off at 17 19 and the flames had 3 consecutive
power plays but the flames killed it themselves when suter went off for high
sticking at 17 31. sandstrom went off at 18 03 to close out the period. the
kings hit 3 goal post in the period.

3rd period
the kings used the phrase initiate , not retaliate and it was very evident here
in the 3rd period as the kings continued to pound the body and the flames
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.

5 1. the kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1 06 mark. the kings shot
the puck into the near corner of the flames zone. vernon went behind the net to
cut off the puck but he could not control it. donnelly , who was behind him ,
wacked at the puck , sending it into the low slot. as vernon slid back in to the
crease , granato got a shot that hit a flame and bounced to the left of the net
where millen fired the rebound behind vernon.

sydor went off at 1 24 nieuwendyk went off at 3 22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.

5 2. otto , skating down the far side , stepped around mcsorley , cut to the net
and passed to dahlquist in the low slot. dahlquist cut through the top of the
crease and put the puck in under a diving hrudey.

carson and rychel came in on a 2 1. when carson passed across to rychel , fleury
tripped rychel with no call. the puck got shoveled into the far corner where
fleury knocked rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards , drawing
a 5 minute major and a game misconduct at the 6 08 mark. unfortunately , the
kings squandered the 5 minute power play when granato (at 6 44) and watters (at
8 19) took penalties.

5 3. the flames closed to within 2 at the 8 47 mark. macinnis , at the near
point , passed to yawney at the far point. he took a few strides towards the
net , wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of
hrudey. the play started on another faceoff that the kings lost. timeout la.

6 3. macinnis took a penalty at 9 56 and the kings converted on the power play
to seal the victory. sandstrom , skating down the far wing in the flames zone
cut towards the back of the net. just as he crossed the goal line , he passed
the puck into the low slot , on the far side , to carson who shot off the pass ,
beating vernon on the ice , stick side.

at the 16 17 mark , skrudland went off for slashing and stern went crazy as he
went after shuchuk. stern wound up with a double minor for roughing , a single
minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct , and he took the flames
right out of the game.

on the plus side the kings , for the most part , played very disciplined hockey
as they let calgary retaliate. the kings played good team defense and excellent
penalty killing.

on the minus side the kings lost almost every face off. this must improve or
the flames will surely get that power play back on track.

notes

the kings recalled guy leveque , brandy semchuk and jim thomson from phoenix.

wayne gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.

the kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against , giving
the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.

flames goaltender mike vernon entered the game with a 3 9 1 record in afternoon
games. the flames entered the game with a 34 success rate on the power play
over their last 9 games.

the teams were 3 3 1 against each other in the regular season.

according to this morning 's post gazette

the pens will be carried by kdka radio(1020 am) , unless the pirates
are playing. when the pirates play , the games will be carried by
wdve(102.5 fm). wdve will carry 12 games , starting with tonight 's
game.

in fact , after this season , kdka will no longer be the flagship
station for the pens. the penguins and kbl have struck a new
deal regarding the tv and radio rights to the games. it seems
more than likely that wdve will be the flagship radio station next
season. kbl will carry 62 games on tv , with 17 of the games to be
simulcast on kdka tv. the remaining 22 games , as well as some of the
early round playoff games , will be available by subscription tv only.
to receive the games , you 'll have to pay a one time hook up fee , and
then a monthly fee of 11 12 dollars.

also , under the new deal , there will no longer be radio tv
simulcasts. there will be a tv broadcast team , and a radio
broadcast team.

no word on who the announcers will be. mike lange and paul steigerwald
are both under contract with kdka , but their contracts expire at the
end of this season. kbl president bill craig said he 'd like to hire
lange and steigerwald.

bryan murray has done very little as gm...yzerman , fedorov , cheveldae ,
chaisson , the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous
gm...murray has made a couple of decent trades...that 's about it...
that would hardly rank him as the best gm.

there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players.
the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano ,
who was gm before murray. what the previous gm also did was to trade
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams , most
notably (in my memory) murray craven , who had a few very good years with
philly after leaving here. also , it 's not the volume of trades that will
necessarily improve a team , but the quality of them. trading adam oates
for bernie federko was just plain stupid , even if federko used to be a
great player at one time. most of murray 's trades have worked significantly
to the wings' advantage , with those that did n't being soured mainly by
injury to the players involved (such as troy crowder , who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered).


devallano went earlier and more extensively to the russian strategy
than anyone else...and was the first gm to waste high draft choices
on young russians...devallano would still be gm but he succombed to
demers pleading to make the oates federko et al trade...which is the
deal that sealed his fate.

murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...washington was too cheap to pay ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and carson was really a big anchor to
the team , and he was able to sucker a rookie gm to give him paul
coffey for deadweight.

if detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because manson was available ,
and he was unable to pull the trigger. it is his judgement that he
has enough with what he 's got...yzerman does n't have that many more
years in his prime.

interestingly , keenan 's co coach (or is it his number one \? ) on team
canada at the world championships is roger neilsen.


but ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...
keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the
initiative (within the limits of his system)...while roger
has a reactive hockey philosophy...which is why messier will
be able to and has played for keenan , but thought roger 's way
was a sure loser.

it 'd be interesting if the rangers call in the balance of neilsen 's
contract to be keenan 's assistant ... roger did do a very good job
with the mediocre players , just as he handled the cinderella canucks
of 10 years ago ... but his mistake was playing the rangers like those
canucks last may ...


roger is a great assistant coach...but considering what must be bad
blood between nielson and messier , it would be a mistake to bring
him back even in that role.

messier is a joke this year bad back not withstanding. his play is
the reason the rangers will be on the golf course in a couple of weeks.
gartner is my choice the guy works his butt off every game.

kovalev no surprise. he 's played adequately but as bad defensively

kovalev is too talented a player to play for roger nielson...roger needs
players who ca n't think for themselves and can only skate in straight
lines up and down the ice. dudley and nielson are the only two coaches
bad enough in the league to take talents like mogilny and kovalev and
not know how to turn them into bure and selanne.

as was predicted in preseason. perhaps he 'll pull an alex mogilny in
a couple of years and surprise us then. zubov was n't expected to make
it out of the minors this season and owing to the number of injuries ,
has proved to be a very pleasant surprise.


get muckler as coach , and kovalev will look like mogilny.

the trouble with the rangers is that neil smith went out and got
players like messier , kovalev , and graves who have been schooled in
taking the game to their opponent and attacking , while hiring coaches
who are interested in rope a dope strategies. if you want the
roger nielsons of the world to be your coach you do n't go out and
get a mark messier , who is an old dog who ca n't learn new tricks
from a known loser , and you do n't waste your draft picks on players
like kovalev.

anyways , crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the nba does n't
care where they get basketball players from , major league baseball
does n't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except cuba ,
that is).

mlb is perfectly willing to take players from cuba. they just have to
defect first.

sort of like the situation used to be with russian czech etc hockey
players , until the political situation in those countries changed.


major league baseball has told the blue jays and the expos not to
sign oscar linares (i think that is his name)
...canada does not have the restrictions against
cubans that the us has and other major league teams have told the
canadian teams that they would be very unhappy if the expos or the
blue jays would do this. cubans players would not have to defect
to play in canada and could play the 81 home games for the expos
and blue jays without any trouble.

aargh !

paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the nhl.
he called a total of 4 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques.
the nords' penalty came in o.t. stewart , being an ex nordique himself ,
was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords
get away with murder...we was robbed ! ! ! !

no. patrick roy is the reason the game was lost , and ron hextall is the
reason quebec won. everybody said it would come down to goaltending , that
goaltending was the key , etc etc. well , the key does n't quite fit if you 're
montreal. the dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call , but let 's face it
he literally left his feet to throw an elbow. blaming stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow. he even saw the whole shot , dammit. besides ,
stewart evened things up a bit by calling a quebec penalty in ot.

montreal played a solid game (although they still do n't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more).
normally i would say that any team that blows a 2 goal lead with less than
five , let alone two , minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game
especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads. but i do n't
think this was a team loss (although keane should have been able to clear
the zone just prior to the first quebec goal). roy is paid big money to
play. he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic 's shot.

demers should start racicot in the next game. if not that , he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this
article , if possible.

patrick roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. he was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night. the winning goal should n't have
gone in.

i did n't think the wrap around was as bad as the second goal. i also did n't
think scott young should have gotten around the defender (ca n't remember who)
in the first place. but you are correct , it should n't have gone in
regardless.

oh well , at least the bruins lost in o.t. also ha , ha ! ! )

yep. moog looked bad on mogilny 's goal with five seconds left in the second ,
imo. how about neely though \? holy shit , what a player.

speaking of great players , man oh man can quebec skate. i have n't seen a
team so potent on the rush in a long time. watching them break out of their
zone , especially sundin , is a treat to watch. they remind me of the red
army.

but i still hate the team.

on the rest of the games did n't st. louis' winning goal come on a
powerplay \? penalties will cost chicago dearly , especially against detroit.
same goes for calgary very , very undisciplined. when marty mcsorely is
waving guys to the bench to avoid fights , you know something 's up. new
jersey was overmatched , terreri 's heroics notwithstanding. mario is
unbelievable , and jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs. but i
hate that team anyway.

looking at the way the divisions were re aligned , there are six teams each
in the central (norris) and pacific (smyth) divisions , while there are seven
teams each in the northeast (adams) and atlantic (patrick) divisions. the
thought occurs to me that inherent in the realignment is expansion of one team
in the central division and one team in the pacific division , although i 've
seen nothing published that indicates that.

actually , when the nhl expansion committee was formed a couple of years back
(before the ottawa and tampa bay expansion) , john zeigler stated at the time
that it was the nhl 's expansion plan to grow to 28 teams (7 per division) by
the turn of the century.


andrew scott andrew@idacom.hp.com
hp idacom telecom division (403) 462 0666 ext. 253

during the roman era , 28 was considered old...

last night during a sharks' broadcast , commissioner bettman was
interviewed during the first intermission. he made no bones about it ,
the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
the current allotment of 26 are fully stable. this means that cities
looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.

this is good , imo. there 's no sense in expanding if it only means
more failing franchises are in the mold.

so i do n't know what you mean by parity boston never was , is not now ,
and never will be as good an organization as the montreal canadiens.


never was \? probably. is not now \? debatable. what other valid test can
you think of besides the final standings or divisional playoff winner \? what
do you propose , a worthless vote like they do in college football \? what a
joke !

you boston fans make me laugh you 're going crazy based on a very
recent boston domination over montreal in the playoffs. i mean how
many cups has boston won compared to montreal 's 23 \? and who do you
think is going to win the next cup between the 2 teams \? montreal
or boston \? you know sinden 's going to find some way of screwing up
even this good boston team. he 'll fire suter or trade away a vital
star. (admittedly , his last few trades have been good ones but how
long before his luck runs out and he starts making esposito for
ratelle type trades again \? )


if i remember right , brad park was also involved in that trade. he was n't
all that bad a hockey player.

but let 's look at some of sinden 's trades over the years

\? \? \? for rick middleton (rangers). i do n't know who sinden gave up for middle
ton , so i 'll call this one a .

barry pederson for cam neely (canucks). . any questions \?

greg hawgood for vladimir ruzicka (oilers). . didja see that one rosie
roofed against roy in last year 's playoffs \?

courtnall ranford for andy moog (oilers). a wash. moog is a good goaltender ,
ranford burned boston in the finals in his first year , and courtnall always
seems to get his points. anyone in vancouver care to comment on courtnall
as a defensive liability \?

ken linseman for dave poulin (flyers) . any more questions \?

janney quintal for adam oates (blues). . janney is an enormous talent and
a personable guy , the the bruins play in adam 's division. enough said \?

so , even if you count the esposito vadnais ratelle park i do n't remember who
else (joe zanussi \? ) trade as a double minus , harry the horse trader comes
out on top. i submit that the bruins are always good because of harry , not
in spite of him.

btw , do you really think the habs will bounce back next season. i 'll bet
they finish fourth or fifth in the conference , behind any of the following
pittsburgh , quebec , boston , washington , islanders. someone correct me if
these five teams will not be in montreal 's conference.

in summary , things look bleak for the habs , at least in the near future. i
suspect that the next team from la belle province to win the cup will be
that team that lindros did n't want to play for.

i admit that i 've been suffering lately with the boston gets hot while
montreal swans in the playoffs type years. but i do have the sure
knowledge that the montreal braintrust will keep plugging away until
they hit the right formula for yet another cup. whereas if i were a
boston fan , i 'd have this kind of despair that as long as harry sinden
is running the show , the bruins will always be good but never
good enough.

the new name is florida panthers.
the panther is an endangered species , mostly located in the everglades.
a couple of years ago , there were license plates made with panthers on
them (part of the revenue were to go to some protection fund).

the name of the new president of the panthers should be announced today.

as of yesterday 's paper , huizenga 's new hockey team will take the ice at
the miami arena this fall. the team has a guaranteed two year lease with
the arena , with four one year options that could run through 1999.

it 's not our choice , james blosser , a lawyer and huizenga aid said
about ruling out the arena as a long term option. the nhl told us we
ca n't stay there. it 's not economically feasible.

one reason is because the miami heat basketball team controls skybox
and advertising revenue at the arena , reducing the hockey team 's profit
potential.

the hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from broward , dade ,
and palm beach counties.

a leading site is vacant land near joe robbie stadium , where residents
10 days ago agreed to drop their opposition to a hockey arena , ending
an eight year battle of wills.

8 larry depalma season 3rd
acquired '91 92 , free agent from minnesota
grade i (c d )

no netter fan watching the sharks , including me , knows where depalma was at
the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights , but he
was n't in san jose , he was n't in kansas city , and his name has n't appeared on
the waiver wire.

sorry , nelson , but you forgot to ask me. if you check the thn stats for
kansas city , you 'll find that larry has been playing for the games , having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3 26 and the
4 16 issue (1 3 4 with 13 pim). not exactly invisible.

he then was sent down to
kansas city , walked out from there , and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of shark bytes (as the mailing list is now known to sharks
officials) faithful , and neither the sharks nor we miss him.

well , having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times , this is n't quite
accurate. he injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing ,
which was to hide it from the sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble. the sharks then sent him to k.c. , at which
point he disclosed the injury. since he did n't disclose it , the sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting. that was eventually worked out , the sharks re instated him as
injured and put him into therapy , and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to k.c. he fully expects to play in the nhl again , although clearly
not with the sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no no , beyond just a
no no).

very nice guy. always hustled his butt off. he disappeared because he was
hurt. i expect he 'll surface with another team at some point (probably
another expansion team) , but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career. has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated. unfortunately , he played himself out of the sharks future with a
bad judgement call.


20 john carter season 4th
acquired '91 92 , free agent from boston
grade i (b b)

he
is very unlikely to be back next season.

always gave 110 , best work ethic on the club (except maybe kisio) , but
hustle is n't always enough. his future with the sharks was made clear to me
one night against the flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold joel otto against the board. he literally had one arm around otto 's
neck and another wrapped around otto 's stick arm. otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal , as though carter
was n't there. hustle can only cover size so far.

the sharks have told me , point blank , that he 's gone for good (ditto hubie
mcdonough). he was one of the favorites of the staff , but as one said to me
you have to make room for the kids . carter , in fact , refused to report to
k.c. and has been suspended by the sharks. that might be a defacto
retirement , but i have n't heard anything official. his only hope in hockey
now is the gulls.

28 jean francois quintin season 1st
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade i (b b)

i do n't understand why the sharks did n't let quintin play any more than the
14 games he played this season.

because , at least from the games i saw him in , he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice. i think he shows potential , but i did n't think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the nhl.

he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.

agreed (btw , i still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they 'd performed than how they actually performed. i wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television , nelson \? i know i have
trouble , since you do n't see the off puck action. your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)

41 mark beaufait season 1st
acquired 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft
grade i ( \? )

after a all star season at kansas city , beaufait got a cup of coffey with the

coffee. coffey is with the red wings.

45 dody wood season 1st
acquired 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
grade i (d d , although perhaps i should n't give a grade at all)

i have been accused of knocking on wood too much.

you \? nah...

he was seriously unimpressive , even as a tough guy (his rep). however , as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless , i hate
to judge the talent too quickly. butn in dody 's case , i m tempted to make an
exception.

but i wo n't.

you obviously do n't understand how tv scheduling works. espn had
prior contracts to baseball to show monday night games and had
contracted all the other bs shows well in advance. the nhl tv deal
was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this
one plus year out. the nhl package was finished two weeks before the
season started). espn has shown tremendous commitment to the nhl by
squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last minnesota
game) and putting stanley cup games as backup to their baseball
telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last
night).

but the bottom line is that espn cannot break contracts at will. they
must honor the previous deals they made. does have something
to do with it , especially if you risk a lawsuit for breach of
contract with baseball.

so relax. i'm happy. (i do n't get sportschannel anyway).

it was nice to see espn show game 1 between the wings and leafs since
the cubs and astros got rained out. instead of showing another baseball
game , they decided on the stanley cup playoffs. a classy move by espn.

what , did you leave the room each of the 100 or so times they said that
there were no other night baseball games \? every break they took back at
the studio mentioned it , followed by 'so...we 're gonna show you hockey
instead.' my wife and i are hoping for rain at every baseball game they
have a feed for tommorrow night...

point is , be glad they showed hockey , but if baseball was available
anywhere else you can bet you would 've watched baseball last night.

upi clarinet has just relayed a scoop from the toronto sun
(or was that star \? i like the star myself ...) that iron mike
keenan has come to an agreement with the new york rangers for
next season. interestingly , this comes the day after the times
sports had an editorial about how the rangers need their own
pat riley ... who cares about what happens after next season \?


the rumour was basically everywhere in toronto based on reports
that keenan has told both san jose and philadelphia that he
was no longer interested in pursuing further negotiations with
either team.

the ranger announcement is supposed to happen tomorrow supposedly.

the rangers have so many veterans that they had to get a coach
with weight and a proven record...and whom they know messier respects.

certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team. and that is
simply because there are not enough solid two way players to go
around. who would you rather have as your checking centre \? doug
gilmour or doug jarvis \? for that matter i would take either gretzky
or mario as my checking centres. do you think gretzky could cover
bob gainey \?

gretzky , lemieux , gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.
they play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one. if they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities.

when you compare gretzky et al to jarvis , gainey etc you are comparing
apples and oranges. it is like me telling you that felix potvin is n't
very good because a team would be better if the had lemieux instead of
him. sure lemieux is a better player , but he is a different type of
player. for a team to be successful , they need to have all types of
players this includes defensive forwards.

when compared with other defensive forwards , bob gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever. he is the player who 's talents best suited being
a defensive forward who completely dominated the game when he played.

maybe if a more talented player such as gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively , he could have been a better
defensive forward , but he was n't.

bob gainey is the best defensive forward that has ever played hockey.

gerald

there are many teams in the nhl who have taken a liking to russian players.
the whole russian strategy is not specific to detroit or to devellano ,
who was gm before murray. what the previous gm also did was to trade
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams , most
notably (in my memory) murray craven , who had a few very good years with
philly after leaving here. also , it 's not the volume of trades that will
necessarily improve a team , but the quality of them. trading adam oates
for bernie federko was just plain stupid , even if federko used to be a
great player at one time. most of murray 's trades have worked significantly
to the wings' advantage , with those that did n't being soured mainly by
injury to the players involved (such as troy crowder , who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered).

put scotty bowman , pat burns , or any of the other better coaches in the
league behind the bench of this detroit team , and they could beat anybody.

yes , a point well taken ... however , even in areas that finally got
some games , there 's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its

and we 'll try to get you an update through the show ... when you
know that it 's on a satellite 's feedhorn somewhere up there ...

if people want hockey on tv , they should watch hockey on tv. i bet
the ratings for hockey on sunday on abc went into the toilet.

from today 's times , abc got great ratings in chicago and st. louis (a
4.2) , and the kings flames got a 2.9 on the west coast , but only a 2.2
in metro new york (i.e. , the devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the rangers ) ). in comparison ,
seniors golf did better ...

next week , there will be far fewer abc affiliates with hockey.

i fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...
i ca n't tell if abc did any advance marketing or not , 'cos i do n't
watch much tv ... the nhl should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air. even espn could 've sold second
rights to third party systems (i.e. , non sportschannel) since they
are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey

it looks like a safe bet. nyi has been bagging it of late.
nyi and njd have a showdown friday night for the honour
of pittsburg anyway. pigsburg in 4.

wash vs njd wash in 6.
i think that njd have a solid team and will compete with
wash. i agree though with wash in 6.

bos vs buf bos in 5.
the b 's have been playing awesome hockey in the last
two weeks. the only question is how long will it last \?

it seems to me that mon is much like the van no chemistry.

i am a diehard leaf fan but ... it seems that the leafs
offense is shutting down in the last week. can they
turn it around against detroit. as i recall , the last
couple of time these two teams met , the leafs were pummelled.
i do n't know if bobbie is allowed in canada yet. if he is ,
det in 5. if not , det in 6.

van vs win win in 6.

win in 6.

cal vs la cal in 5.
anybody that says that la could possibly beet cal does
not watch the smythe a whole lot. la is a bunch of geritols.
cal in 4.


2nd round


pitt vs wash pitt in 4.
it seems to me that pigsburg has some egos on their team. their
saving grace though is bowman. he can put anybody in their place.
however , if pigs have a quick first round , they may be a little
too high. wash could be there for a surprise. having said that ,
i will say pitt in 6.

bos vs mon bos in 6.
mon will not be there. bos is surprising me of late. cam is great.
the couple of wins against que last week have sold me with the
b 's. b 's in 6.


chi vs det chi in 7.
yikes. this will not be pretty. but det is running like a machine
of late. they 've had a non busy end of the season in which they played
like killers. det in 6.

win vs cal cal in 5.
cal has a solid team , a little weak in the nets. cal will out
muscle win. cal in 5.

3rd round


pitt vs bos pitt in 5.

i hate pitt. my logic eludes me. the dark side will take over
and give bos the extra push it needs to dump pitt. there may
be something to this if you think of the rivalry. bos in 7.
chi vs cal chi in 5.

finals


pitt vs chi pitt in 5.

no , no , no. we have bos vs det. i do n't know what to say
here. both teams will be flying and overdue. i will go
with goaltending and muscle and say det in 7.

ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that alexander daigle will
go 1. he 'll either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec. imo i would
take kariya. he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in
the world championships. daigle did n't show this for his junior team.

san jose will then get kariya.

tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov (i think that 's it) or a
defenseman rob niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

the last name is niedermayer , as in new jersey 's scott 's last name , because
(you guessed it) they are brothers. but rob niedermayer is a center , not
a defenseman.

i am not sure that the sharks will take kariya. they are n't saying much , but
they apparently like niedermayer and victor kozlov , along with kariya. chris
pronger 's name has also been mentioned. my guess is that they 'll take
niedermayer. they may take pronger , except that they already have too many
defensive prospects.

when was the last time a president 's trophy winner fell to last place
the following year \? a long time , i 'd bet.


well i think it in 1969 the montreal canadians finished 1st (although
there was no president 's cup in those days) and missed the playoffs
in 1970. i do recall that the 1970 playoff picture was n't decided until
the final day , when the ny rangers defeated the redwings. the tie breaker was
the number of goals for (if i remember correctly) , so the rangers played
with an empty net for the entire game. some hab loyalists accused
the wings of 'throwing' the game to keep them out , but as i recall ,
gordie and delvecchio had the flu , so coach sid abel sat them out ,
and the rangers swarmed the redwings most of the night.

gainey is the best defensive forward ever. i stand by that assessment.
he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame. did you
ever watch him play \? he never made a technical error.

i watched him over his entire career. i have never seen a player , and that
includes russell courtnall and davie keon , screw up as many breakaways as
bob gainey. and i will never forget the time denis potvin caught gainey
with his head down. you have been sold a bill of goods on bob gainey.

gainey was a plugger. and when the press runs out of things to say about
the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers. grant fuhr , essa
tikkannen , butch goring , bob nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek
sanderson , wayne cashman , bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri
richard , dick duff...and so on...

these players all are pretty good players. they are the depth that the
dynasties had to win stanley cups. they tend to be the very good second
line guys who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the nhl.
they were all important to their clubs. probably , several of these
stanley cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it
were not for the depth provided by these players.

they compare to rick tocchet and ron francis of the penguins. very good
players who can lead lesser teams (francis hartford , tocchet philly) who
provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the nhl.

as a defensive forward , there have been none better than bob gainey. that
does n't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the canadians
had at that time , but he was excellent at what he did. gainey could
dominate games with his defence. he did n't need to get goals to dominate.
he shut down the opposition and was thus valuable. there has never been
anyone any better at doing this. not ever.

st john's maple leafs vs moncton hawks
moncton hawks
see cd islanders. moncton is a very similar team to cdi. low scoring ,
defensive , good goaltending. john leblanc and stu barnes are the only
noticable guns on the team. but the defense is top notch and
mike o'neill is the most underrated goalie in the league.


bri , as i have tried to tell you since 2 february , michael o'neill
might be the most underrated goalie in the ahl , but he isn't in the
ahl. he 's on the winnipeg jets' injury list , as he has been since
his first nhl start against the ottawa senators. he 's out until
next year after surgery to repair a shoulder separation.

stu barnes might be an ahl gun for the hawks , but he 's now the third
line center with the jets , and has been since mid january or so.

sorry , my memory is gone. i thought that o'neill got sent back
down in february but i must have been given incorrect info. i guess
this says it all about moncton because barnes is still one of
their top 3 or so scorers even though he 's been out since january.

in the smythe
this one is the toughest for me to call , because i have to put
personal bias aside (go calgary). i think a lot depends on who
wins the division. winnipeg will move into third by the end of
the season , and the first place winner will have a clear advantage.
it will be a lot easier to build momentum against a team like the
kings. whoever plays the kings in the first round will take the
division. much as it hurts , i have to pick ,
division winner vancouver canucks

i 'll have to disagree with you on this one. i think vancouver will go as
bure goes , and if he continues on his goal scoring slump , then they
wo n't even make it out of the first round. i think the kings will make
it out of the first round , regardless of who they play. they seem to be
doing pretty well , even with that bad game against minnesota on
saturday. i think it 'll be either calgary or los angeles to win the
smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals).

wales conference trophy
islanders and bruins will fight to the end , but i think the
islanders have enough steam to overtake the bruins in seven.

campbell conference trophy
a walk for vancouver , maybe in 5 or 6 but definately not 7.

stanley cup final
islanders and vancouver. islanders will have nothing left by
this point and will succumb fairly easily to the canucks.

stanley cup champion vancouver canucks

still have to disagree with you here. i think it 'll be pittsburg to
get the hat trick in stanley cups. they just look
toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good.

i hope you have enjoyed my predictions. i hope they are not
all correct (go calgary).

neither do i. well , may the best team win it all (pittsburg). that 's
just my .02 worth.

a little supplement basic mike 's info

for sundday 's opener on abc , these are the announcing crews

devils isles at pittsburgh gary thorne(play by play) , bill clement(color)
and al morganti roaming the halls outside the dressing rooms.
this telecast will primarily seen on the east coast.

st.louis at chicago mike emrick(play by play) , jim schoendfeld(color)
and tom mees roaming the halls.
this telecast will primarily be seen in the midwest and parts of the south.

la at calgary al do you believe in mircales \? michaels(play by play) ,
john davidson(color) and mark jones as a roaming reporter.
this telecast will be seen in the western usa.

montreal 's naitive , jon saunders will be hosting in the studio.

abc will do up and close and personal with mario during saturday 's
wide world of sports(4 30edt).

sunday will be the first nhl playoff or regular network telecast in 13 years...
not counting those silly all star games on nbc for the last few years...

for sunday 's games , abc will use 8 mikes(2 behind on the goal) , super super slo mo ,
close ups of player 's faces at face offs. espn abc will not be able to
use its new favorite toy , the ice level shot , in pittsburgh where too many
seats would have to removed to employ it...


in case of a blowout in progress in pittsburgh , abc will switch to chicago
game but will come back to the pittsburgh game for updates or if the game
gets closer(ha ! )..

abc expects huge ratings(by hockey standards) since all 3 top us tv markets
are involved ny metro area(ny islanders nj devils) , chicago(blackhawks) ,
and la(kings).

stay tuned ,

this is wrong. among lemieux 's 157 points , we do not know how many
are power play points. we may be able to find out how many pp goal he
scored , but not how many pp assist he accumulated. we also do n't know
the times he was on the ice but not credited on the goals the pens
scored.

that is what my point really was. there is not straight dependency between

my observations and are admittedly lacking because i have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount. anyway....

mvp most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and
in terms of leadership ( ca n't win without him )

biggest surprise the player who rose above expectation the player
that may have raised the level of his game to a new height , even
if that new level does n't necessarily warrant an allstar berth
(includes those players who at the outset of the season , may not
even have been in the team 's plans).

biggest disappointment the player from whom we expected more (e.g. , i
picked denis savard in montreal because with the new emphasis on
offence brought by demers , should n't savard have done better \? )

the next finnish hockey superstar( \? \? ) jere lehtinen from kiekko espoo !

there are also some rumours about erik kakko (reipas) and marko jantunen
(kalpa) being traded to tps. both of this players are currently on the
finnish olympic team. i think that jantunen is drafted to the nhl , too.

did anyone else see this game last night \? just like a playoff game ! !
lots of hitting...but i was disappointed by the video goal judge...
on all replays , joe murphy 's goal should n't have counted ! it did n't go in net
! ! and according to the tsn broadcasters , the video goal judge said that he
saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assumed the puck went in !
this is terrible...hope crap like this does n't occur in the playoffs !
the game would have ended in 2 2 tie !

i thought the red light went on...thus , in the review , the presumption
would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the
net...from the replays i say , even from the rear , the evidence was n't
conclusive that the puck was in or out...in my opinion...

it seemed pretty conclusive to me. the puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line. and the announcers , admittedly homers ,
kept harping about how they must have had a different view upstairs
because it was obvious to them , and , i would have thought , to anyone who
saw the replay , that the puck did n't go in. the referee originally
signalled no goal but the video replay judges initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored. this , to me , is
unheard of. seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the leaf chances this year.

it was bryan trottier , not denis potvin. it was a vicious
'boarding' from behind...trottier was given a major.

perhaps it was trottier. it happened behind the habs goal if
i recall. gainey simply did n't have his head up as he was
picking up the puck.

but roger , what the hell does this have to do with gainey 's
skill as a hockey player \? if probert smashes gilmour 's head
into the boards next week , will that diminish your assessment
of gilmour 's skills \?

if gilmour was taken completely by surprise , as gainey was , then
yeah , i would have to say that doug was n't playing
technically smart hockey. in any case , to claim as greg did ,
that gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely
ludicrous.

later on , in your posting , you make reference to putting words
into other people 's mouths ...i would suggest that your last
paragraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely , that i ,
along with greg , claim that gainey never made a technical
mistake. if you actually read what i 've written , you will find
that i make no such claim...soooo , if logic serves me well ,
you 're contradicting yourself.

gainey was a plugger. and when the press runs out of things
to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the
pluggers. grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring , bob
nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne
cashman , bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri
richard , dick duff...and so on...

i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter.

good for you. you 'd only be displaying your ignorance of
course , but to each his own...

roger , i'm not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a
function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an
opinion ...but hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by all
means go ahead...that 's if it makes you feel better.

i think gainey would be honoured to know that you 've included
him

i think gainey should feel honoured to know that he is
remembered at all.


my word , such vehemence against poor ol' bob gainey. why does
he bother you so much...he was an effective player for his style
of play.

on this list. i also think you have a relatively naive view
about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part
of

certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team. and that
is simply because there are not enough solid two way players to
go around. who would you rather have as your checking
centre \? doug gilmour or doug jarvis \? for that matter i would
take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres. do you
think gretzky could cover bob gainey \?

i'm really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here.
why do n't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ ,
himself , in nets \?

now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob gainey with guy
carbonneau , you would have a balanced comparison.

any team. the selke is designed to acknowledge their
contribution...i think that most people understand that it 's
not the nobel prize...so settle down.

you 're wrong again. the selke is awarded to the forward that
does the best job defensively and this may or may not be the
best plugger. if gilmour does the best defensive job in the
league i do n't see why he should be out of the running simply
because he also contributes offen sively.

i'm wrong again...hmmm , let 's see...where was i wrong in the
first place \? i'm only guessing here , rog , but i have a feeling
that you 've setup a you 're wrong again macro key on your
machine.

i agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic...but i
think you know what i'm getting at. i would also like to point
out that gilmour 's potential as a selke winner was never part of
the debate...are you asking me for an opinion \? if so , i think
there are far too many other deserving players to include gilmour
among the candidates.

settle down \? if you think that i have likened the selke to the
nobel prize then i suggest that you had best settle down .
and if you are going to try to put words in my mouth , let me
suggest that you settle down before you bother following up
on my postings.

i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out
of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype
the pluggers. grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring , bob
nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne cashman ,
bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri richard , dick
duff...and so on... demonstrates a blanket disregard for these
individuals as contributors to the game...so yes , settle
down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.

the best one of all was one he never talked about , he just held it up.
it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking
black panther on the forehead it has to be a new mask for felix
potvin , but he never said whose it was.

are you sure this program was current \? i know that grant fuhr
had a black panther on the forehead of his mask when he played with
the leafs.

it would seem logical that the mask is potvins. his nickname is the cat ,
which would go a long ways towards explaining the panther.

of course , it could be an old story and the mask is fuhrs , too.....

rauser@fraser.sfu.ca (richard john rauser) writes



ten years ago , the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 season , the numbers of euros on
nhl teams have escalated to the following stats

canadians 400
americans 100
europeans 100

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun.

here 's the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let 's say , the
red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like bure konstantinov and
borshevshky . is this north america or is n't it \? toronto , detriot , quebec ,
and edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of euros on other
teams is getting worse as well.

is the answer as simple as that you dislike russians \? \? \?

i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure , the
russian rocket i will completely throw up. as it is now , every time i see
the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross check bure into the
plexiglass so hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way ,
i'm not a canucks fan to begin with ).

okay , the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that
i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and
some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their
north american league and instead gives it to europeans , who are n't even
better hockey players. it 's all hype. this european mystique is sickening ,
but until nhl owners get over it , canadian and american players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating , the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

and where would canadian hockey be today without the europeans \? \? dont say
that the european influence on the league has been all bad for the game.
i mean , look at the way you play these days. less fights and more hockey.
imho , canadian hockey has had a positive curve of development since the
70 's when the game was more brute than beauty......

i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league , and let the bures
and selannes of the world play on their own continent.

oh , look ! ! you do n't like finns either....

i just do n't want them on mine.
too bad almost all of you northamericans originates from europe.....

hmmm... and what kind of a name is rauser. does n't sound very canadian to
me. )

ps. when analyzing teams like italy , france and great britain you find that
a lot of their players are canadians with double citizenship... ds

interestingly , keenan 's co coach (or is it his number one \? ) on team
canada at the world championships is roger neilsen.

it 'd be interesting if the rangers call in the balance of neilsen 's

the san francisco bay area media is reporting tonight that the detroit
red wings beat the toronto maple leafs 6 3. can someone who is not
part of the media conspiracy against the leafs tell me how the game
really went (i am expecting a 4 0 win for the leafs , shutout for
potvin , hat trick for andreychuk and a goal and 3 assists for
gilmour). if the leafs really lost , how many penalties did whichever
biased ref was at the game have to call against the leafs to let the
red wings win \?

ah yes. california. did the san francisco bay area media report that
joe montana is rumoured to be the leading candidate to replace fired
san jose sharks coach george kingston \? apparently montana is not only
coveted for his winning attitude , but as a playing coach he will be
expected to quarterback the powerplay.

good thing those walls are so soft , eh rollie \?

well , here it is , nhl in the year 2000.
i got these from a very reliable source in a dream some years ago and
although i initially thought i had just been taking too many too strong
drugs now it seems the realization has really begun... you can see the
league has already started to move to this direction.

the walt disney conference
anaheim mighty chipmunks franchise name to be changed after each new
la kings hockey movie
la flames we 've seen some of that
san jose sharks
san diego bruins
tijuana red wings detroit 's hockey team will follow its car industry...
dallas stars
houston oilers
texas rangers
seattle canucks

the norm green conference
alabama white hawks
biloxi blues
tampa bay lightning
miami blades
helsinki jets you 've heard them starting getting used to the anthem
montreal quebecois (sp \? ) there will be no 'canada'
atlanta devils
orlando penquins
key west islanders
hartford whalers the whalers will never move , huh \?
palm beach capitals

now that the anahaim team is becomming real i'm really beginning to believe
the rest of the 'message'. i'm sure the future will turn you into believers
too. after 2000 the nhl will abandond ice rinks. it 's so expensive to cool
down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is
anyway. nhl will become a roller skating hockey league. that way it can
create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the
game in their back yards !

i hope i'm just out of my mind.
there wo n't really be a disney team in anaheim , will there \?
the stars are n't really moving...

clement , although he has a pleasant personality (aggravatingly pleasant
in my opinion) , is a terrible
analyst , because he is almost alway wrong...the prototypical example
being new jersey 's first goal last sunday.

i grew up with dick irvin doing color beside danny gallivan...i knew
did irvin , dick irvin was a friend of mine...bill clement you are n't
any dick irvin.

as long as the teams involved do not include the us national team or
the new york rangers , i 'd take john davidson over bill clement any
day.

personality means something to me. that is exactly why i like clement
(and emrick). on the other hand , jd is a pompous , bull headed , arrogant
know it all. he 's a real turn off (which is exactly what i do when he 's
on). one complaint i do have about clement is that he sometimes talks
too much. if i wanted that i 'd listen to tim mcgarver doing a baseball
game.

i wrote

when the pens got mario , granted there was big publicity , etc , etc ,
and interest was immediately generated. gretzky did the same thing for la.
however , imnsho , neither team would have seen a marked improvement in
attendance if the team record did not improve. in the year before lemieux
came , pittsburgh finished with 38 points. following his arrival , the pens
finished with 53 , 76 , 72 , 81 , 87 , 72 , 88 , and 87 points , with a couple of

stanley cups thrown in.

it was at this point the pens attendance was near capacity (34 out of 40
sellouts) yet they had n't made the playoffs since 1982. how do you explain
a 6th place team breaking attendance records when they have n't been to the
playoffs in 7 years \? mario lemieux is the explanation , imho.

you could make a case that the expectation of an improving team that
would make the playoffs is the reason.

funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case i was going to make.

but i think the reason is lemieux
had a 168 point season and was the first non gretzky to win the hart and
ross since 1980. people turned out to watch him play.

i will grant that a star like mario will draw fans , even if the team sucks.
but this is short term only i still do not think the attendance increase
will last , unless the team is a winning competitive improving butt kicking
one. pittsburgh was still getting better , so people continued to support
them. if they suddenly dropped to , say , 50 points , you 'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.

also , the following year (88 89) the pens had 89 points not 87.

ok. my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book.

they made the transaction to try and build a winner around mario , that is
true. but the improvement in attendance came before they started doing
this (coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team.
a doubling of attendance occured in 1984 85 from the previous year. an
increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that. the arrival
of mario lemieux is what did it.

you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it. but my point is that
it was n't mario himself , but it was the expectation of things to come (i.e.
a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. and
before anybody jumps in and says i'm nit picking and mincing words , go back
and read from where this thread started...

it might help to think about what would go through a fan 's mind who suddenly
found an interest in mario and the pens. was it gee , mario lemieux is
amazing , i 'll go watch him play , or was it gee , now we 've got a kick
ass guy on our side , i 'll go watch him play . i think it was the latter.

similar thing happened in l.a. before
gretzky 's arrival , about 12000 per game. after , constant sellouts. they
are still selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement
since gretzky 's first year there. how do you explain it \? people are going
to see gretzky. they certainly are n't going to see a winner , they have n't
got a winner. they 've had much better teams in their past history than
they currently have , yet they did n't draw as well then.

i do n't think this is accurate. the tickets sell , but people do n't go to
the games. i think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket
holders in la do n't always use their tickets. so in effect , after the kings
initial success following gretzky 's arrival (68 to 91 points , same source)
and corresponding attendance jump , there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.

whether or not the kings are a 'winner' is debatable. i claim that since
gretzky 's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...i also claim
that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler
dynasty...but that 's another story and included only because i do n't like
mcnall ). anyway , mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky , and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales , etc. but as i said , when the kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
forum even if the tickets were sold.

i think in the case of a lemieux or gretzky , the player can transcend
winning as the major drawing power.

for the short term , imo. although i think that it 's inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky , simply because they
make people around them better.

but winning sure as hell helps. )

well , at least we are in full agreement here !

this does not make roger 's point any more valid , but the jets are n't

so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point \? could n't resist...

getting a huge jump in productivity , yet they are getting a huge
jump in attendance. this is due to the emergence of teemu selanne.
they have the 17th best record in hockey , it sure as hell is n't because
they are winning.

yes , but they are doing no worse than last year. i think the same type of
reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at winnipeg games. it 's difficult to predict , but do you think
that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels \? i seriously doubt it , because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone , with or without
selanne.

i did provide the example of rocket ismail and the toronto argonauts of the
cfl...did you leave it out because you do n't know much about the cfl \? if
that 's the case then fair enough , but if it is n't the case then i'm curious
to hear your explanation.

i think that jack ferreira 's firing eventually led to kingston 's
firing. you mention consistency of vision. i think the
sharks lost that with the loss of ferreira. there has never
been a 3 headed g.m. that has ever worked. you need one
person making the personnel decisions at the top , not
management by committee. the conventional wisdom
from around the league is that ferreira would have
made the moves that would have fielded a better product
on the ice.

how exactly would ferreira accomplished this \? the three headed gm ship has
taken a lot of heat , but nobody 's explained how things would have been any
different had ferreira still been there. would ferreira have made more
trades \? who would have he had traded \? would he have made fewer trades \?
who should not have been traded \?

what are the leafs to do \? i am a leaf supporter and
i say the leafs are going down in four unless there
is nothing short of a miracle or a stroke of genenius hits
pat burns.

if you were pat burns what would you do \?

living in the bay area , i do not get enough leaf coverage
to pull something out of the bag , (i would appreciate comments
on the leaf detroit 3rd line match ups) but here is the basic
idea...

andreychuck and borchevsky have no business playing against
the wings. they are too small. the key to any leafs success
will have to be clark. he is the only centre who can have
any presence within 3 stick lengths of the slot. where the
hell is anderson \? anderson can (in days past) get under peoples
skin. put a little more bluntly , anderson has to be an asshole.
he used to be good at it. we need him now.

perhaps , perhaps the leafs can shut down detroit 's second line.
i was dissappointed to see shepard and yserbeart flying last night.
these guys are the swing players for the wings. last year they
did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick
exit of the wings. this has to happen again . clark anderson gilmour
should be able to out hustle this line. anderson should do a
nasty on yserbeart. clark should bang the hell out of sheppard.
score gilmour score !

suggestions clarke anderson gilmour vs. sheppard yserbeart \? \?
andreychuck borchevsy \? \? vs. detroit checking line
toronto 's checking line vs. yzerman fedorov probert (pray lots)

as suggested i would bench andreychuck and borchevsky to stir things up
and through a monkey wrench into detroits game plan. however ,
if the detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their
checking line against these finesse players well then
let them play.

potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals keep him in.
van hellamond can not be faulted for the leafs demise either.
the wings defense shut down the leafs (especially in the slot).

i hope pat burns realizes that his team was out hit , out skated , and
out coached on monday night. this was not a loss because of poor goaltending
or officiating. this calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next monday.

nntp posting host st lina.cs.ualberta.ca
organization university of alberta , edmonton , canada
lines 68



here is a summary of don cherry 's coach 's corner from april 18 , 1993.
it took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the montreal quebec
series.

pre game comments

don 's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... the goalie
who gets back his all star form (roy or hextall) can win the series
for his team.

eposode summary

this episode took place rinkside. don was holding a hot dog that
he bought from the concession stand.

ron maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the
toronto sun. it featured a picture of don , who just saw his shadow
and proclaimed will you look at dat , eh \? means another 6 weeks
of me. beauty.

next , don talked about the hot dog he was holding. according to
him , the hot dogs at the quebec stadium are the best food in all
the arenas in the nhl.

from there , don commented on the quebec montreal game. the game
had great flow , because referee paul stewart calls the best game
in the nhl. in contrast , the calgary la game was terrible... all
stop and go , over 50 minutes of penalties called against calgary
by dan marouelli. its getting so that the ref who calls the most
penalties gets to ref in the finals.

next , ron showed an old picture of don , when he was playing for
the rochester americans of the ahl. don recalled some of the
wins that he had in the quebec arena... during the memorial cup
and the ahl championships.

finally , don and ron discussed keenan becoming coach of the
rangers. the rangers were a talented team who underachieved.
don feels sorry for temporary coach ron smith , who had
several key injuries (to leetch and patrick) and goalies who
went cold.

don had some criticism for the rangers team... the party 's over ,
adolf (keenan) is there. the rangers organization will no longer
be a 'country club'.... ny should be achamed of themselves... if
they go in the tank with adolf there , they 'll be hanging from the
yardarm by their thumbs.


rating

nothing too special in this episode.

i 'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.

i think that you are incorrect , roger. patrick ,
smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types. hence , they did help build the league , although
they were not great players themselves.

punch imlach 's contributions as a coach and gm were far greater than
those of the above combined. should we name a division or trophy after
him \? smythe and norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they
were powerful owners. as owners they certainly did help to build the
league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.
are we going to honour those who contributed to the league 's evolution
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the
sport itself \?

i agree that a name is a name is a name , and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans ,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea. if we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated , then let 's do so. once we have them , they will realize
what a great game hockey is , and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.

i ca n't disagree with you here.

the history of the names can be put rather succinctly. all of the aforemen
tioned used the game of hockey to make money. can you imagine a pocklington
division \? a ballard division \? or how about a green division \?

no , i would not want to see a ballard division. but to say
that these owners are assholes , hence all nhl management people are
assholes would be fallacious. conn smythe , for example , was a classy
individual (from what i have heard).

what have you heard \? the major was the definitive little asshole ! he
originated the phrase if you ca n't beat 'em in the alley you ca n't beat
'em on the ice. that was his idea of hockey. do you think , by chance ,
that don cherry is a classy individual \?

also , is n't the point of professional hockey to make money
for all those involved , which would include the players. what i think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due , and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice , so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).

the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and
that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice

exactly true. naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame. i have
always thought that this was nonsense.

coaching news
vasili tichonov (ex assat) to san jose sharks
wow. so that 's probably the reason why current assistant coach drew ramenda
hinted that he wo n't be back. thanks for the news , mikko can you (or any
of our finnish netters) comment on tichonov \?

the first time i heard this piece of news was on the post game radio
interview here in jyvaskyla. that was the bronze medal game in the
sm liiga which tichonov 's team porin assat (the aces of town pori )
lost. vasili , the son of victor tichonov (the famous soviet coach) ,
said that for a long time the sharks have been persuading him to
take the assistant coach post. but he wants to be the head coach where
ever he goes. he definitely wo n't be coaching assat anymore (after
three \? seasons). i do n't know why.

vasili is a good coach i believe. assat was a good team , produced many
players to our national team. assat was n't a skilled team (imho) but
they had the fighting spirit. after all , they butchered jokerit in the
playoffs and gave hard time to tps , the champs. but assat was n't
consistent , only when they were in the right mood they could beat any
team in the sm liiga.

i am not 100 sure about the deal with the sharks. as i said , he wants
to be the head coach. but he and the sharks are going to negotiate and
decide during the wc. i doubt that he will be the head coach but
maybe they 'll do some compromise.

could somebody post more information about vasili \? i know he was coaching
in the former soviet league teams , results \? his character as a coach \?

let me give my two cents worth in this whole thing

i am very sick of pittsburg fans(and they are my second favorite team)
talk about how why ca n't bruins forget about ulf samuelsson when we have
forgotten all about adam graves beside the obvious fact that lemeuix 's career
was never endangered by graves' slash while neely is still bother by his injury ,
i think the most important reason is

adam graves has played clean hockey ever since ! while ulf samulesson
continues to play dirty(yes , trying to hit a player where he's injured
is dirty). fans have can forget about one dirty play but how can you
forget about ulf samulesson when everynight , when i watch hockey high
lights , i get reminded of how dirty he is.

hitting a player when he 's injured is dirty \? can you explain this statement \?
do you mean a player who was just injured on the ice( \? ) or do you mean a player
who is playing hurt. if a player is hurt he should not bother playing because
i do n't belive any player should be let up on just because they are playing
hurt.

i'm not an ulf fan but at least i can spot the fact he is like calgary 's
theoren fleury in the respect that part of his game is to really piss other
players off as that 's part of his job (but he lacks ulf 's size ! ).

i am an ulf (and pgh) fan , and what pisses me off about the whole adam graves
ulf samuesson debate is that ulf plays hard hitting hockey (nothing wrong with
that) while graves does what he does when the only way to win a game is to
intentionally hurt someone (which bites ! ).

players that really piss me off are the ones who insist on hitting from behind
or try to go for the knees to injure the players. this kind of garbage has
got to go (i would really like to see muni get pasted as he is one of the
worst offenders).

i thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap
like that \? ! \? is it just me , or does the officiating just still stink to high
heaven \? imho , if they could get rid of the existing refs , and institute a new
system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble makers
then a lot of these things would stop , and then the game would be ruled by the
finnesse players mario , selanne , bure , messier , et.al...

did anyone else see this game last night \? just like a playoff game ! !
lots of hitting...but i was disappointed by the video goal judge...
on all replays , joe murphy 's goal should n't have counted ! it did n't go in net
! ! and according to the tsn broadcasters , the video goal judge said that he
saw the water bottle on top of the cage move so he assumed the puck went in !
this is terrible...hope crap like this does n't occur in the playoffs !
the game would have ended in 2 2 tie !

i thought the red light went on...thus , in the review , the presumption
would be to find conclusive evidence that the puck did not go in the
net...from the replays i say , even from the rear , the evidence was n't
conclusive that the puck was in or out...in my opinion...

when is the draft this year \? and will there be any coverage \?
i know the upcomming nfl draft is on espn.

anyone got the details \?

paul kariya 1993 1 pick ! (no. 2 perhaps \? he wo n't last long ! ) )

i do n't know the exact coverage in the states. in canada it is covered
by tsn , so maybe espn will grab their coverage ! i do n't know !

as for the picks
ottawa picks 1 which means it is almost 100 that alexander daigle will
go 1. he 'll either stay or be traded in montreal or quebec. imo i would
take kariya. he should alot of leadership in the ncaa and so far in
the world championships. daigle did n't show this for his junior team.

san jose will then get kariya.

tampa bay will either go for a russian kozlov (i think that 's it) or a
defenseman rob niedemeyer (probably spelt the last name wrong)

because of expansion i wo n't go further but i will name other of the
blue chip prospects

chris gratton
chris pridham
a swedish player who i ca n't remember his name

draft order

1) ottawa
2) san jose
3) tampa bay
4) south florida or anahiem
5) south florida or anahiem
6) hartford
7) edmonton
8) dallas
9) ny rangers
10) philadelphia

the 8th thru 10th picks could be wrong i do n't have the standings here
and am guessing

(in my mind there are 8 top notch prospects in the draft , with kariya
leading the way but not going 1)

shawn go caps (two first round picks for the next three years thanks

mom.

chris chelios was montreal 's co captain with guy carbonneau when he
was traded to chicago for denis savard , and peter stastny was captain
of the quebec nordiques when he was traded to new jersey. also mark
messier was captain of the edmonton oilers when he was traded to new
york. how about dale hawerchuk with winnipeg when he was traded to
buffalo , was he captain too \? i think so. i should not forget wayne
(you know who) when he was traded to l.a. he was captain. did n't they
strip wendel clark of his captaincy in toronto \?


buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.

pat lafontaine was awarded the captaincy when mike ramsey was forced
to give it up (ramsey 's now a penguin). ramsey inherited it from mike
foligno (who 's now a leaf). he in turn had inherited it from lindy
ruff , who went i forget where. ruff had it from perreault , who
retired , so i guess that 's where the streak started. or did it \?
after all , danny gare was captain before him , and he went to detroit.
jim scoenfeld , gerry meehan , and floyd smith are the others , in
reverse order , last to first. i was a bit young at the time , so i'm
not sure of the fate of schoenfeld , but he ultimately went to detroit
and boston. meehan went to vancouver , atlanta and washington. smith
seems to have hung up his skates after buffalo , but i do n't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that , or how many games he
played for buffalo. this is actually getting fascinating. )

captaincy in buffalo is a sure sign you 're to be traded , almost ,
unless you 're a franchise player.

2 red wings vs. 3 maple leafs maple leafs in 6

comment it 's kind of tough to rely on yzerman as the team 's main weapon.
he 's a great palyer , but dino knows all about choking , which
puts the burden on steve even more. potvin 's had a hell of a
season and goaltending is what you need in the playoffs.

for a great prognosticator ) , you seem to remember very little playoff
history. dino always shows up in the playoffs , which is why he is a
great sleeper pick in pools. do n't forget about fedorov , one of the
top players in the nhl , imho , and coffey who has the most stanley cup
rings of any active players (correct me if i'm wrong). wings in a
cakewalk.

oh yeah , how come dino could never take the caps out of the patrick
division \? he choked up 3 games to 1 last year and got swept away in
the second round two years ago. he rarely , if ever , makes it out of the
division.

1 canucks vs. 4 jets canucks in 5

comment it 's more like vancouver vs. selanne. king and domi (for
enforcing) help winnipeg out a little , maybe a game. canucks
have their number.

except that the canuck are playing like shit. winnipeg can win this
one , though i think vancouver will manage to slip by.

so are the islanders , but they can still pull it out. vancouver has winnipeg 's
number , so it really does n't matter.

2 flames vs. 3 kings flames in 7

comment 7 games looks good as the kings always seem to battle it out.
flames are back in running and wo n't know memories of last year 's
season. gretzky is on a tear , but there are too many \? \? \? \? \?
surrounding the kings.

kings always seem to battle it out \? when \? where \?

kings always seem to go at least 6 or 7 , they never play a four or five
game serious. there 's a difference between battling it out and pulling it
out , as i take calgary to pull it out in 7.

charlie betz (cbetz@romulus.cray.com) writes
after reading some of the reports of possible nhl moves to milwaukee or that
milwaukee should have an nhl team , i thought i 'd pass along a story i heard
recently. this is second hand , so i do n't know how true it is , but i have
no reason to doubt it either.

bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge
hockey team. the owner of the admirals (sorry , i ca n't remember his name)
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
bradley center.

lloyd pettit.


supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise , but
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 50 million was too
high.

like i said , i do n't know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if
it 's true , do n't look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon. the admirals
are n't going to be forced out of the building and you wo n't see an nhl club
and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the nba 's
milwaukee bucks play there as well.

yes , it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the nhl for 50m but
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much
less than that. he felt that no one would pay 50m for an expansion team , and
that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. but
the market fooled him , and 5 teams have been created for 50m apiece in the
last three years , and even the existing teams ca n't be moved for less than
50m and i doubt that he could get one for that little.

pettit gambled and lost. now he 'll have to pay more.

i was reading a newspaper tidbit that mentioned that there is a
grammatical error on the stanley cup. this newspaper , the
union leader (manchester , new hampshire) , stated that one of the
years that the new york islanders won the cup , the printing on the
actual cup stated new york ilanders . can anyone verify this \? \? i
forgot the exact year that this supposedly occured. any die hard
islander fans know about this \? \? the reason why i am asking is
because the paper is not very reliable , we call it the union
mis leader .

speaking of spelling errors on the cup , i wonder if the h in

be about spelling pittsburgh.

how long would they support teams that are run on ranger based
corporate thinking (i use the term lightly). (we do n't need a good
product because these duffuses in nyc would fill the arena for ottawa 's
record every year......1940 ! ! haha (sorry , had ta say it)).

look how long the maple leafs and nordiques used similar logic.... not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams , but the maple leafs (and a
certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport. guess what they were immensely popular at the
gate. the nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row.

look at british (or any european) soccer as an example (they never have fan
problems).

ha ! such humor ! they have major fan problems , namely that on occasion some of
them do n't make it home from the match ! the soccer fans tend to be fanatical ,
much like the montreal fans who firebomb the players and coaches houses when
they play pathetically.

so roussel was giving up almost another goal a game while facing a proportional
number of shots for the number of minutes he played , and while i have't
actually checked i believe that he faced a lower quality of opponent.

make that less than half a goal a game. the lower quality of opponet
argument is immaterial as neither roussel nor soderstrom had any say in
the matter. that was dineen 's decision.

so in other words , if roussel shuts out the sharks and soderstrom shuts out
the penguins , that 's immaterial because it was the coaches decision \? come on ,
joe , think about what you 're saying ! who they played is very significant.
why they played them is what 's irrelevent. a low gaa against good teams
is better than a low gaa against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders. a low gaa is better then a higher gaa. a low gaa against good
teams is much , much better than a higher gaa against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders.

the fact of the matter is that , despite last nights shutout , he does n't
have what it takes. last night was due to an inept ranger team much more
than roussel 's skill. a 3 on 1 and they do n't get a shot away \? a 2 on none
and one guy just passes and stops , the other guy shoots into roussel 's pad \?

c'mon , pete \? so the rangers were inept. a shutout is a shutout. during
both of soderstrom 's masterpieces against toronto , mike emerich was quoted
as saying he did n't think the leafs had much offensive firepower past their
first line. does that make soderstrom 's shutouts less impressive because of
toronto 's lack of offense \?

yes it does ! absolutely. in the context of comparing two goaltenders .
of course , at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you
get them. and on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. but if you 're a
coach deciding between two goalies , or a gm looking to make a trade , you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. i did n't see the second toronto
game , but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. there was nothing in
that game to judge tommy soderstrom on because he was n't tested. the same
for roussel in the ranger game. two real scoring chances , one he made a
great play , the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. if
you were judging roussel on that game alone , you have very little to go by.

but if you were to look at the 0 0 tie against the habs , you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout. that was a 1 goalie in action. roussel
does n't have a game like that in him.

well if you look back to november when roussel was the 1 goalie (soderstrom
was being treated for his heart ailment). the flyers finished november at
6 3 1 and were 9 10 4 overall. and there 's no way of knowing where the flyers
would have finished if soderstom was n't wearing the oragne 'n black. i'm glad
we do n't have to find out anytime soon either because he is one hell of a
player. i would take him over roussel right now , but i still think dom has
what it takes to be the 1 guy. he outperformed hextall enough during the
'91 92 season to make flyers management think that way too.

do n't be so sure of that. flyers management never says bad thing about
roussel , but they do n't say too much on the good side either. i 've seen
at least two interviews where every time farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders , it was tommy this , tommy that , and oh , yeah ,
dom has played well too.

by the way , what was the final card on monday night \? team picture by any
chance \?

flyers in the nhl hall of fame. kinda dull , really. they handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from pizza hut , but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in mid season. had names like benning ,
kasper...

and how did the flyers choose the fans who received the shirts off our
backs \? winning recchi 's jersey after breaking the club 's single season
point record would have been nice. but knowing your luck you would have
won roussel 's ) !

mostly random seat locations , some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos. i do n't like that method since i 've seen
guards help out people get things like lindros pictures , surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture they 'd hold 'em for their buddies.

not too low perhaps , but surely not as high as that of an european nhl
division. the finnish team , for example , would contain all players currently on
the national team plus a top class foreigner or two. they would be in an
entirely different league than tps or jokerit , both of whom have perhaps a
dozen players of international class if even that. why settle for a minor
league when you could have the best \?

it is no matter what you call the teams , jokerit and tps , or helsinki tornado
and turku typhoon , the best palyers in finland would eventually end up in
those teams anyway , if they were in the big league.


i 'd rather spend 150 marks to watch the helsinki tornado play montreal , the ny
rangers or los angeles than 50 marks( \? ) for the privilege to see jokerit vs.
jypht or even djurgardens if. there 's nothing like the nhl , period.

unrealistic for now. maybe we should first just expand finnish league to
allow teams from baltic countries to entry ! then others will get interested
in the idea , that maybe one should settle something bigger. the ultimate
goal , as you want it , would be european division in nhl. btw. does that
make a final with an europan team against norht american \?

summary umass hires head coach for first season since 1979
keywords umass minutemen mallen
x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl9



the mission to revive hockey at umass is now underway. at the 4 pm saturday
afternoon press conference held at the new mullins center arena former
boston college asst. coach joe mallen was awarded the 4 year , 85 , 000 year
contract as head coach for the umass minutemen.

mallen was the third viable pick for the position , right behind jeff jackson
(lake superior) and second behind shawn walsh (umaine). previous offers for
the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of
brown , rpi and the head coach of the ahl springfield indians.

umass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had
undermined the team 's position over a period of years. in late november
of last year , the 52 million mullins sports center was opened following
its one year construction deadline.

the minutemen are slated to play an independent div ii div iii schedule this
upcoming winter before officially entering hockey east for the winter 1994
season. mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or
potential team candidates for the minutemen it is expected that he will
leverage off his inside contacts within new england , the bay state and
europe to draw on competitive , top ice players for the university.

umass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming fall semester
expect to hear more from me as i hear more from my sources.

with the kind of team montreal has now , they can take the
cup easily. the only problem they have right now is that everyone is
trying to steal the show and play alone. they need some massive teamwork.

this is known as the savard syndrome and we are talking denis , not serge.
no team will ever win squat with the likes of denis savard in their lineup.

they are also in a little of a slump because long time hockey
montreal canadiens announcer claude mouton died last tuesday and it was
rough on everybody because he has worked with the organization for 21
years. but i know that is no excuse. but if the habs manage to get some
good teamwork and get into the spirit , they should have no problem
winning in may.

they could tell savard to stay home and watch the games on tv.

i agree. i also think roy needs a good kick sometimes...that horrible
4 0 loss to the capitals last week...yeeeech !

here 's to cup 23...this year !

sounds like 12 to me.

i have n't seen anyone post this so i will do the honors.

maine beat lssu 5 4 in milwaukee on saturday night. it was quite a game.
maine stormed to a 2 0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away
with it. maine 's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.
lssu came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2 1.

lssu came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.
the play went quickly with the refs running a no holds barred type of game.
lssu scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4 2 at the end of the second.
now it looked like lssu might just walk away with the game.

coach walsh , of maine , replaced the starting goalie dunham with snow , who won
the game against michigan. snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.
the third period , like the second , belonged to the team behind. maine scored
three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.
they were all scored by jim montgomery , the tournament mvp , and all assisted by
paul kariya.

the last minute of the game bears highlighting. the change to snow also
proved the difference in the end. with one minute to go and with the lssu
goalie pulled , snow dueled with a lssu forward in a amazing set of moves by
both. snow won. it was a great way to end the game.

this year 's three championships games were sold out last year in about one
month. the bradley center holds approximately 17 , 700.

the detroit red wings put a lot of doubter on ice tonight with a 6 3
washing of the toronto maple leafs. all you toronto fans have now seen the
power of the mighty red wing offense. toronto 's defense in no match for the
wing offense. as for the defense , probert , kennedey and primeau came out

did they move probert back to defense \? why did i see him parking his ass
in front of potvin all night \? somebody is going to have to discipline
probert if the leafs want to win the series. perhaps a fresh clark should
hit the ice at the end of a long probert shift and straigten him out for
a while...


during the regular season , when the intensity is down , not many teams
have forwards who will continually go and park themselves in front of
the opposing teams net...and the inadequacy of the leafs defense in
this regard thus did n't matter...however , the playoffs are a different
story...every good team is going to have players who are going to
become potted plants in front of potvin...and the leafs relatively
unphysical defensive core will finally be exposed as weak an inept.

hard work will go a long way during the regular season...almost
to 100 points...and the leafs deserve credit for that...but in the
playoffs talent matters , because everyone begins working hard.

to adjust

1. first calculate a teams . (goals scored pp goals scored)
(goals allowed pp goals allowed (when they were penalty killing)).

2. divide this number by 5 to take into account of the fact that there
are 5 players on the ice and each is 1 5 responsible for the team .

3. a players adjusted is (his raw ) (team adjustment).

btw if anyone could calculate and post adjusted ratings it would be
greatly appreciated. i might find the time to do so but do n't count on
it.

i have a database filter set up for the player stats. when it is posted for
the end of season i 'll repost the team averages. you do n't need to go through
the complicated team adjustment you are using all you need is the team
average by summing all the individual players' and divide by the total
number of players on the team. this will be a little distorted because the
players who have been traded recently will have come with scores based
on their original teams. this should n't distort it too bad though. if you
want to look at individual players from this perspective then go ahead
you 'll require the original player stats though.

question
if a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total
by 40 \? if so , a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.

another way of looking at the same thing is to compare the deviation from
the mean for the team of the player to the standard deviation for the team.
i 'll post both.

since the standard deviation for each team is different , i am unsure how
transferable between teams that these stats are. should n't the average
standard deviation in the league be used \?

i am interested in seeing each method.
but i still think that mine is the best. if for no other reason than familiarity.

suprise disappointment

los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey


i would have chosen alex zhitnik for biggest suprise. they
did expect that he would become a great defenseman , but i do n't
think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his
rookie year. his speed , skating ability , and puck control is
exceptional he is the one to watch on the kings.

bryan smale (smale@healthy.uwaterloo.ca) writes
i was thinking about who on each of the teams were the mvps , biggest
surprises , and biggest disappointments this year.


team biggest biggest
team mvp surprise disappointment

hartford whalers sanderson cassells corriveau

my votes (fwiw)

team mvp pat verbeek. he fans on 25 of goal mouth feeds , but he still has
36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp \? ) team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons. honorable mention nick kypreos and
mark janssens. probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
mvp , but kypreos (17 goals , 320 pim) has been the hardest working player on
the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. i guess
i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.

biggest surprise geoff sanderson. he had 13 goals and 31 points last season
as a center , then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80
points. he now has a new whaler record 21 power play goals , most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle , his garden spot. honorable mention andrew
cassels and terry yake. the kiddie quartet of sanderson , poulin , nylander , and
petrovicky have been attracting the most attention , but cassels is just 23
and will score close to 90 points this season. he has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson. yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put
up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. yake , like sanderson , started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing ,
although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the
right side.

biggest disappointment hands down , john cullen. cullen had a disasterous 77
point season last year , his first full season after the trade. cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery , and fell flat on his face (appropriate ,
since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass , and whining about it).
cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games , was a clubhouse malcontent , commanded
the powerplay to a 9 success percentage ( 21 with sanderson) , and sulked his
way out of town. worst of all , his 4 year , 4m contract had three years left
to run , so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the
maple leafs offered to hartford. honorable mention steve konroyd , also subpar
after signing a 3 year , 2.1m contract eric weinrich , who showed flashes of
competence , but overall has played poorly jim mckenzie , who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and frank pietrangelo , who only
seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got
to make a number of starts in a row.

just heard on the news that mike keenan formerly of the blackhawks , flyers ,
and general of a siberian prison has just signed to coach the rangers. the
rangers , who won the president 's cup last year have slipped just a bit at the
end of the season and are destined to finish last behind the lowly flyers.
the flyers' fans are going to be disappointed on keenans decision , because
they were very interested in him. oh well.

at least we got somebody the flyers wanted )

is this really true \? i have not been keeping up with any news. if it is ,
what 's the deal with neil smith \? is he gone , too \?

team biggest biggest
team mvp surprise disappointment

philadelphia flyers lindros recchi fedyk galley eklund

fence sitting...look at philly 's record with eric and without...
there is no doubt. soderstrom is probably the biggest surprise.

re eric true , but fortunately we did n't get to find out what they would be
like without recchi for 30 games.

soderstrom absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot
of defense in front of him. runnerups to galley and fedyk who are scoring
a ton over their career best. but galley thinks he 's paul coffey (puts scoring
ahead of defending) and fedyk has tailed off big time.

eklund was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42
points in 49 games is not bad at all , and recently he 's been a huge factor
in the wins they 've gotten. eklund has never had a point a game season in
his career , his production is very typical for him. how does he qualify as
a disappointment \? if anything he 's a surprise.

my choice would be roussel if i went strictly by what was expected of players ,
but i never thought that he had what it takes to be a 1 goalie. my biggest
disappointment is bill dineen. i thought that he was going to be the perfect
coach for this young team , instead he 's made too many bad moves and imho
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. any
coach that thinks putting eric lindros at the point on power plays is a
bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.

and of course , mike ramsey was (at one time) the captain in buffalo prior to
being traded to pittsburgh. currently , the penguins have 3 former captains
and 1 real captain (lemieux) playing for them. they rotate the a 's during the
season (and even the c while mario was out). even troy loney has worn the c
for the pens.


i think that mike foligno was the captain of the sabres when he
got traded to the leafs. also , was n't rick vaive the captain of
the leafs when he got traded to chicago (with steve thomas for
ed olcyzk and someone). speaking of the leafs , i believe that
darryl sittler was their captain (he 'd torn the c off his
jersey but i think he re claimed the captaincy later on) when he
was traded to the flyers.

oh yeah , of course , gretzky was the captain of the oilers before
he was traded was n't he \?

a fine 26 year history came to a close tonight , as the minnesota north stars ,
or norm 's stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the red wings by a score of
5 3. the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen , who netted
two including the final one in franchise history , with less than a minute to
play.

tonight , on the air on the stars tv telecast , announcer al shaver , the voice
of the north stars , stated basically that he will not follow the team to
dallas. shaver , when asked by his son (who was doing the broadcast with him) ,
what will you do now \? responded , first i'm going to get me a new pair of
slippers. then i'm going to sit in my easy chair and watch the world go by.

thank you north stars , and thank you al shaver , for 26 years of minnesota

to put it mildly. as i watched the flyers demolish toronto last night , 4 0 ,
i realized that no matter how good the leafs' 1 line may be , they 'll need

way back in the early years ( 50 's) it took 8 wins to garner the stanley cup.
soooooo , a couple of local fish mongers (local to the joe louis arena , that is)
started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win. after
each victory , one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the
ice. (they are dead by the way.) it was a brilliant marketing strategy to
shore up the demand for one of their least popular products.

hope this helps.

j. lange


local to the joe louis arena \? you mean local to olympia stadium , where
red wings games were played until fairly recently (early 80s comes to
mind). as far as i know , the rest of the post is basically correct. if
what you meant by local was simply detroit and i'm being incredibly
picky , okay , sorry about that.

the blues scored two power play goals in 17 seconds in the third period
and the beat the chicago blackhawks 4 3 sunday afternoon at chicago stadium.
brendan shanahan tied the game 3 3 and brett hull scored the game winner 17
seconds later. jeff brown and denny felsner scored the other blues goals.
brian noonan had the hat trick for the hawks , who also had some very good
goaltending from ed belfour. blues goalie curtis joseph was solid down the
stretch to preserve the blues lead.

the hawks came out strong in the first period , outshooting the blues 6 1 and
taking a 1 0 lead on noonan 's first goal. right after an interference penalty
on rick zombo had expired , keith brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the
blue line and passed the puck to steve larmer in the right circle. larmer fired
a long slap shot , and noonan deflected the puck between joseph 's pads. after
the goal , the blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the hawks
10 9 in the first period.

jeff brown tied the game 1 1 at 3 12 of the second. nelson emerson broke in on
the left side , got by craig muni and pushed the puck across the slot. belfour
came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards , where brown
collected it and slapped it in before belfour could get back to the goal.

two minutes later on a hawks power play , belfour stopped rich sutter on a
short handed break in. chris chelios picked up the puck and passed it to jeremy
roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open noonan with a nice pass
across the slot. noonan fired it past joseph at 5 30 for the 2 1 lead.

noonan completed his hat trick 3 11 later to increase the hawks' lead to 3 1.
stephane matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to noonan who beat
stephane quintal by driving to the net. joseph had no chance as noonan
deflected the puck in the net.

denny felsner reduced the blues deficit to 3 1 at 12 49 after picking up the
rebound of basil mcrae 's slap shot from the slot. janney set up mcrae for
the shot , and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to felsner. felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. the blues
outshot the hawks 10 5 in the second period.

with the blackhawks leading 3 2 at 9 56 of the third , stephane matteau picked
up a high sticking penalty. just 53 seconds into the power play , steve smith
was called for slashing , giving the blues a 5 on 3 advantage for 1 07.

the blues did n't waste time as brendan shanahan scored just 23 seconds into
the two man advantage to tie the game 3 3. janney found hull in the slot ,
and hull fired a rocket at belfour. jeff brown collected the rebound and
passed it to shanahan in the left circle. shanahan beat belfour from a sharp
angle.

just 17 seconds later , hull scored the game winner for the blues. nelson
emerson broke in on right wing , carried the puck behind the net along with
two hawks defensemen. emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked hull in the
slot , and hull beat belfour to put the blues up 4 3.

the hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes , but joseph
made some brilliant saves to prevent the hawks from scoring. he stopped troy
murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2 30 left in the game.
the blues killed off a late hawks power play , with rich sutter clearing the
puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. the blues held
on to win the game. the hawks oushot the blues 13 7 in the third period ,
totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. the blues special teams were excellent
in the game. the blues killed 6 of 7 hawks power plays , and scored twice on
on four power play chances. the blues ranked among the best special teams in
the league. they rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.

the game was carried live on abc , the first time an nhl game other than an
all star game has been shown on network television since may 24 , 1980 , when
cbs carried game 6 of the stanley cup finals.

the best of seven series continues wednesday in chicago and friday and sunday

the penguins 18 game unbeaten streak carries over to next season.
meaning , if they start the season with another 18 game unbeaten streak , they
will have eclipsed the flyers record. right now , the penguins are on an 11
game winning streak , as streaks carry over from one year to another.

hmmmm , i'm not sure this is true. according to mike lang and good old
stagie , along with the rest of the tv crews in pittsburgh , they
winning streak could have stopped because it is a regular season mark.
i would think this would also hold with an unbeaten streak for regular
season games.

however , you are right that the playoff streak does carry over from
last year. and with 1 more win , i believe they tie an edmonton record
(but do n't quote me on that one).

i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they
face them in the finals (which is what all the detroit sportswriters
are predicting). although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm
i have ever seen in hockey

how do you figure that \? \? when bryan murray took over the wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked
unlikely to win it. now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it. a truly great gm would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup. a good gm (like murray) can
maintain the team 's success but ca n't push them to the next level.

when jacques demers brought the wings to the conference finals twice a
few years back , he had everyone on the team giving 100 percent , but he
had very little talent. he had yzerman , bob probert (who had drinking
problems at the time) , and a couple of decent goaltenders in hanlon and
stefan who got hot. that 's about it. can you name one player on those
earlier teams who even deserved to be in the all star game , much less
actually got there , other than yzerman and probert \? like , petr klima \?
give me a break ! when they faced edmonton in both of those conference
finals , as hard as they played , it was clear they faced a team that simply
had superior talent to the wings. that 's why they could not get to the
finals. also , at that time the norris division was still the weakest
division in hockey , and getting past chicago , and toronto was not as
impressive as it is today.

murray has brought scoring talent to the wings that they did not have a
few years ago when devellano was gm and demers was coach. to name a few ,
ysebaert , kozlov , and paul coffey (who has made a definite positive impact on
the power play especially).

murray has built one of the most talented teams in hockey at the present , with
the possible exception of the pittsburgh penguins. the wings have at least
five 30 goal scorers that i can think of , and a couple of defenseman with over
100 games worth of playoff experience. murray 's one failing is that unlike
the other gm 's you mentioned (who are definitely also good , do n't get me
wrong) , he has not found for himself a strong coach to motivate the team to
go out and give 100 percent for the full 60 minutes every night like they
did the last time they made a cup run. when a team wins or loses , it 's a
reflection of the gm and the coach , which was the point of my original
post. if the team outmatches their opponent in terms of talent but loses
anyway (which has been the case this year when the wings have struggled) ,
that indicates that the gm has done his job in building up the team but the
coach has failed to motivate them. if , as in the case of the last run the
wings made in the playoffs before murray came , they gave opponents a hard
time who should have beaten them easily , that indicates good coaching making
up for a lack of talent.

all of this is fine. i never said that murray was a bad gm. i merely said
that he is n't the best gm in hockey or even a contender for that honor.
if murray is as great as you claim the wings would have won the stanley cup
by now probably more than once. if he was as great a gm as you claim
and he was as poor a coach as you claim he would have been intelligent
enough to hire the coach to push the team to the next level of success.
but murray is an average (unspectacular) nhl coach and a pretty good gm
so none of this is true anyway.

i 'd love to see a european nhl division but ca n't see it happen for some
time. there 's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several
crucial markets like germany , italy and france while sweden and finland
probably ca n't afford to shell out 20 30 for tickets the way
american canadian fans do. call it the minnesota north stars effect
scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local , inexpensive
hockey to the nhl. the national hockey league should love the idea , though.
pan european tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the
american networks likely never will pay.

this brings up a question i asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned
that the nhl could expand in europe.

would most of the north americans now playing in the nhl be willing
to play for a team in europe \?

i do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.
(i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player)

when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved. remember these

lindros did not want to play in quebec (for more than reasons)
nicholls ... in edmonton.
r. courtnall wanted to be traded to la only.
c. lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year.

i know there are many non cultural reasons behind these but there is more

some american players who played for the expos complained about the french
fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities. one
players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal.

anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved
to london , spain , etc .. for the one year of that new football league
(2 years ago \? )

i wonder what the players association thinks about going to europe.

myself i would like to see some european teams , but what would be
the best way to do it \?

depends on what you mean by classy. from what i 've heard about
him , he was about as classy as harold ballard. only difference was
that back then almost all the owners were like that , so he seemed okay
by comparison. read the book net worth for one view of what smythe
(and norris and adams and campbell) were like.

also , is n't the point of professional hockey to make money
for all those involved , which would include the players. what i think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due , and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice , so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).


even more specifically , i think what roger was saying (and i said
it previously too) is that these are not the people who made the
league great , so why should divisions , conferences etc. be named after
them instead of morenz , vezina , howe , orr etc. , the people who did
make it great. instead , the nhl has chosen to immortalize the men who
got rich off of the men who made the game great.

the second round with all the rest they will get and tor det getting
none. for the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division
but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the

while this is true , strictly speaking , it was the rocksteady replicant who
initially used his stick illegally to measure messier 's ribcage. there is no
question in my mind , from seeing the replay in slo mo , that ulf 2000 was
coming at messier with intent to hasta la vista in mind , and should have
been gone for that.

i agree with rick that ulf 's cross check was n't illegal. it was the kind
of check you see a dozen times during a game without being called. slo mos
sometimes have a tendency to make things look worse than they really are.
besides , if messier ca n't take the heat , he should stay out of the kitchen.

so staffan , how is mattias timmander doing this year \? and any impression
on markus czeriew \? \? \? (lost my roster list) on hammerby \? does it look like
they will make it to the eliteserien for next year \? and then get stomped
if markus goes to boston \?

well matt , mattias timmander has n't been playing with the modo elite league
team yet (just the modo junior team) , so i predict he needs a few more years
here before he can join the b 's. i saw him play in the swedish championship
game for junior players this year , and he played very well , a physical game ,
but not the kind of rough stuff that ulfie does (i suspect you would like to
have a ulf type of player on the b 's team too \? )
as for mariusz czerkawski , he has had a great season for hammarby in
division 1. he scored if i remember correctly 93 points this season ,
and then we have to keep in mind that a 50 point season in sweden is
considered very good due to the limited number of games. mariusz is
djurgarden property (he was just on loan to hammarby) , so he will play
in elitserien next season , unless the b 's can get him of course.
i would say that mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
watch in swedish hockey this season.

happened. the puck went straight off fuhr 's leg and into the net. fuhr never
had a chance. there was no play back to the goaltender , in fact perry berezan
of calgary had just dumped it in and smith was retrieving it.

it was unfortunate that it happened smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie
at the time , and on his birthday too. but all the blame lies with him. starting
in pee wee coaches tell players never to make a cross ice pass in front of
their own net. too much chance of having it intercepted , or hitting the
goaltender , or whatever.

and to the people who say that smith cost the oilers the series , i can only
say that he certainly did n't cause the team to lose the other three games.
there was no reason for a powerhouse team like edmonton to be tied late
in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. everybody on the team
has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.

you should be ashamed to call yourself an ulf samuelson fan. anybody who plays
the way he does , does not belong in the nhl. there have been cheap shot artists
through the history of the game , but a lot of them have been talanted players.
bobby clarke , kenny linsemen , pie mckenzie , chris chelios etc.. but nobody has been
out right as dirty a cheapshot coward as ulf. violence in hockey has got to be curbed
and players like (should have been a women) samuelson do n't belong. when players
like ulf , who 's main purpose is to injure the better players in the league is allowed
to continue , and the league wo n't stop it , the players should. a christian pro 1000
aluminum stick directed at his ugly head should do the trick nicely. if the bruins get
a chance to meet pittsburgh in the near future , you can bet neely will have his day.
the sight of watching ulf turtle up like the coward he is , is worth almost as much as a
stanely cup. this wimp of a player almost ruined the career of one the best right wingers
in the game. if you are to remove ulf samuelson from the lineup , the penguins would not
even notice he 's gone. he 's an eyesore on the game of hockey.

i was wtahcing right guard hockey week on tsn yesterday and they had
a feature on this guy that does a lot (most \? ) of the masks for nhl
goalies. they talked about how they are made , what they are made of ,
and the designs that are put on them , etc.

actually , this part was really interesting. it turns out that the mask is
custom fit to the goalie 's face. the goalie puts his her face through a
piece of wood (or was it plastic \? ) with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show. hair is covered by a cap , eyes are covered by a plastic
wrap type material , and vaseline is put on the goaltender 's face. then , a
plaster is spread on their cheeks , forehead , and chin which takes about 12
minutes to dry sufficiently. when it dries , it is effectively a mold of the
goalie 's face. this is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
padding the inside , hardening the exterior , fitting the cage , etc. etc.
john blue of the bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show.

he exhibited a couple masks he is currently working on , namely , a
new mask for andy moog which is a basic re working of his current
mask with the bear on it , and new mask for bob essensa which was
really cool the jets logo was on the chin , and there were two
fighter jets on either side on the forehead with an air brushed
back ground.

yeah , essensa 's mask looked really good.

the best one of all was one he never talked about , he just held it up.
it has the current leafs crest on the chin and an awesome looking
black panther on the forehead it has to be a new mask for felix
potvin , but he never said whose it was.

actually , i thought i heard him say that it was potvin 's for certain. i
would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome !

not too low perhaps , but surely not as high as that of an european nhl
division. the finnish team , for example , would contain all players currently
on
the national team plus a top class foreigner or two. they would be in an
entirely different league than tps or jokerit , both of whom have perhaps a
dozen players of international class if even that. why settle for a minor
league when you could have the best \?

how many players of international class an average nhl team has. 6 10 \?
top players just play more in smaller rinks. is the quality of european hockey
really poor , then recent years only few north american (usually good farm
players) players have got place in finnish league or elitserien , while most
have been shipped back.

the flyers team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the spectrum
sunday night , and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a 4 0
shutout. tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout , but he barely broke
a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from
mounting any serious attack.

injuries

pelle eklund is day to day with a bruised thigh.

roster moves

jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game. jason was the flyers
second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years
old , 6'4 , 210 lbs. in 62 games with the tri city americans he had 10 goals ,
12 assists and 219 pim. he plays left wing and defense , he played defense in
this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him
up front as well.

andre faust was returned to hershey. he actually left after the second period
of the kings game , flew to albany , got the game tying goal in a bears ot win ,
and played again for hershey sunday night.

game summary

if the flyers played like this every night , they 'd be in the playoffs this
year. the flyers hit everything that moved. they created scoring chance after
scoring chance. they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do.

jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal.
he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone , but instead
of taking the shot he found brind'amour crashing the net on the other side.
a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa 's body should have been a
goal , but puppa made a great save reading the play.

garry galley gave the maple leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked doug gilmour at 4 25. the flyers lowly 21st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game , and set the tone on this kill. the
maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots , and the defense swept
away every rebound.

after the power play , the flyers got a goal on an ugly play. rod brind'amour
gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point , and he sent a drive at the
net. puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef
beranek and bob rouse , who were wrestling in the slot. beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle , and he lifted a backhander over puppa for
a 1 0 flyers lead at 8 10.

the flyers kept the pressure on , and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers
from building on their lead for a while. eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed. each team got an occasional scoring chance , but the goalies
were strong. bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners.
then lindros , who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him , thought he had
a chance to even the score. he had foligno lined up at center ice , leaned into
him , and rode him into the center ice boards. the only problem was that foligno
was a little far from the boards , and mike mister mcgeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 15 38

the leafs could n't get anything going on the power play as the flyers were
very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.

with time running out in the period , recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf 's blue line. they were in
a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun , lindros tried a backhand pass
to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi , but then clark
checked recchi off the puck. macoun then tried to clear , but it was weak and
went right to mcgill who had manned the point. he drove it from just inside
the blue line. macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at 19 55.1. shots were 13 8 flyers in the period.

the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk
tripped up rod brind'amour in his offensive zone. during the power play , the
flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric
gloved it down , but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head. we
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed , but the faceoff went to the other end. as time was
running out in the advantage , lindros found galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but puppa made the save. the rebound kicked back to the right corner where
recchi picked it up , passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle ,
and eric one timed past puppa at 7 55. with the assist , recchi moves past
bobby clarke 's 74 75 season , the second best one season total for a flyer at
117. eric moves up to 4th all time in flyers rookie scoring with 67 points.

mike eastwood took down al conroy at 8 30 to give the flyers another chance on
the power play. not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with
a slash at 9 19. not much happened on the 4 on 4 , although the leafs had most
of the possession. the flyers smothered the leafs short power play. tempers
flared a little at 13 14. bowen and pearson got roughing minors , keith acton
got a bloody face. dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a
hooking minor at 13 46 to set up a 4 on 3. the replay showed that hawgood 's
stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell.
again the flyers smothered the leafs power play , led by dimitri yushkevich.
bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson. berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. he had the puck at the point ,
and just trickled a pass down the slot. he made all the flyers look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it , and it got to gilmour at the side of the net ,
but soderstrom stoned him.

the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over , but did n't
get anything home. shots were 13 10 flyers.

the flyers were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period , and they
decided that if tommy wanted a shutout , he was going to have to work for it a
little.

the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the
period , but could n't get past puppa. then the leafs got tired of lindros making
road kill out of them , and tempers flared. 2 each for doug gilmour and lindros
(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for glenn anderson and mcgill (roughing)
all at 7 02. terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7 51 on gilmour.

again the flyers smothered the leafs power play.

at about the 12 minute mark , dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through soderstrom. the puck was rolling on it 's side , and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other). seconds later rod brind'amour tripped up gilmour at 12 24 to give the
leafs another chance on the power play. on the advantage , after soderstrom
stoned andreychuk while lying down , andreychuk got the rebound through
soderstrom , but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen. they kept the pressure on , but soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout.

recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at 16 01. no punches thrown , recchi got the initial minor , krushelnyski
baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors. at 17 02 rouse and beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to
set up another 4 on 4. mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers
zone as they were battling for the puck , and while mcgill was down he ran
his stick across mcgill 's face. the flyers were not happy with that at all.
5 8 al conroy paired up with 6 1 berehowski , and started throwing punches.
upward. well , al held his own , much to the delight of the crowd. each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head , and al got a standing o !
penalties eastwood 5 (cross check) game , clark , carkner 10 each. berehowski
and conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17 49.

so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers. the had no interest
in stting on the lead. hawgood , galley and brind'amour played catch until
hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle , he controlled the puck and
blasted it past puppa at 18 39.

that was all the fireworks , tommy soderstrom would not face another shot. puppa
did , but kept the flyers off the board. 4 0 flyers , shots were 9 8 flyers in the
3rd. probably the strongest game i 've seen from the flyers since the all star
break. shutout number 4 for soderstrom , all since 1 10. tied for 2nd most in
the nhl , but he 's played fewer games than belfour (6) or the goalie i ca n't
remember that he 's tied with.

next up it 's the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg. the flyers cannot
be eliminated if they win , but a loss coupled with an islander win that night
in washington would be the official end.

flyers up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. last year they had 75 points
in 80 games (5 under .500) , so they need at least 8 points in their last 6
games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better
than 5 under in 80).

tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. the tragic number for 5th
is 5 points , i watched the rangers blow a 4 2 third period lead at home to
lose 5 4 before i finished this up. why 5 points instead of 4 \? well , the flyers
will win the tie breaker if they catch them , whereas the islanders win tie
breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie. the rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the devils , the pens twice , the flyers , and
finish up with 2 games against the caps. so i guess 5th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on.

you could feel it coming on.

due to contractual agreements , espn will be unable to carry
the rest of this game live , so that we may show you a worthless
early season battle between those two pennant contenders , the
cleveland indians and the california angels. when the winning

he was already offered 65 million for them from northlands coliseum
but refused the offer.... i do n't think he is going to sale. i think he
may decide to move the team to the states though where he can draw
more revenue from the team.


pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office , in northlands , and in the business community that the oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on normal hockey
revenues and expenses. that he did this was a good thing...it is better
he complain early , and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.

pocklington 's first option is not to sell or to move , but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal , either in northlands , or
via a new building. pocklington probably is n't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough , or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

there are a lot of risks in moving a team also...

spend other people 's money than one 's own if at all possible.

of letting them represent their countries in the world championships.

anderrson and zubov are waiting for the nhl to make a decision to this ,

jagr has a higher , but francis has had more points. and take it from
an informed observer , ronnie francis has had a much better season than
jaromir jagr. this is not to take anything away from jaro , who had a
decent year (although it did n't live up to the expectations of some).

bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman style
player. he plays hard at all times , does n't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader. bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time.

jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude.
this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.

throughout the year , francis consistently recieved more ice time than
jagr. althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject , i am pretty
sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis. when
you add to that jagr 's better rating , i think it becomes evident
that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one.


actually , what i think has become more evident , is that you are determined to
flaunt your ignorance at all cost. jagr did not have a better season than
francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
hockey knowledge. save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
plus minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
time per game and some measure of its quality (i.e. , is the player put out
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc) , i would
much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

allowing the minnesota defenseman to play in the north stars' last two
regular season games. hatcher was given the penalty during a fight at
the end of a loss at st. louis on sunday , april 11. but the league
did n't rescind the game misconduct penalty shane churla received. the
stars recalled center cal mcgowan from their top minor league club in
kalamazoo , mich. , to replace churla.

deg has many german born forwards in the team. in fact the majority of players

interesting ! one of our german friends here (robert \? ) told me their forwards
were all canadian germans. perhaps somebody can sort this out for us \?

my possible nhl(european league) site list
switzerland berne , zurich (lugano and 1 2 others)

ok , this ai n't north america and so on , but i still doubt that any city
having a pop. of 500 , 000 and below could support an nhl team. of course ,
switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small
distances between cities but still.

germany dusseldorf , cologne , berlin , munich (mannheim , rosenheim)

dusseldorf \? yes , although the arena is an anachronism (an open wall behind one
of the goals essentially an outdoor arena ! ). cologne 's arena only seats about
7 , 000 8 , 000 , berlin is about 6 , 000 and no new facility will be built
unless their olympic bid is successful. munich does have an arena.

sweden stockholm , gothenburg (malmo , gavle)

malmo is big enough , but they also need a new arena...the current one has
5 , 000 seats i think.

finland helsinki (turku , tampere)

if we 're talking about the nhl , even helsinki would struggle to make it work.
turku (despite an excellent arena) and tampere are nowhere near big enough for
major league hockey.

italy milan

...rome and the south are out of the question this could as well be africa
to hockey fans. romans were given the chance to host some wc'94 games but
showed no interest whatsoever. all teams in the italian league come from milan
and the smaller cities in the north.

france paris (chamonix , ruoen \? )

paris had their own volans francais (sp) pro team a couple of years ago.
i believe they even made it to the european club championship finals
tournament one year , but eventually folded due to lower than hoped for
attendances. the remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor
sport like hockey.

norway (oslo)
austria (vienna , villach)
chech (prag)
slovakia (bratislava)
russia (moscow , st. petersburg)

the easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.

great britain \?

perhaps . . . most european teams will have to be like the tampa bay lightning
anyway playing in a small 10 , 000 seat arena , backed by japanese money , run by
enthusiasts (phil esposito) , heavy
marketing , fans that have difficulty telling what icing means... london has
been mentioned , sheffield and birmingham also have large arenas and a new
mega facility (16 , 000 seats ! ) might be built in bristol in a couple of years.

netherlands \?

no facilities to speak of their biggest arena (in eindhoven) seats 2 , 500
fans for hockey.

get the opponent 's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them. there is no yzerman fedorov probert line , except for maybe on a
powerplay. these three players usually play on three different lines.
which would mean that toronto 's checking line would have to pull a triple

what 's so bad about the new playoff format \? do you really believe teams
that finish fourth in their div. deserve to be in the playoffs \?
with the new format , you have more of a chance to see more teams. do you
really want to see the bruins against the sabres umpteen times or would
you rather see the bruins and the capitals in the secound round of playoffs \?

there is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just
a little over a decade ago , and noone showed up for the early rounds in
the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set up
arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.

the empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will
show up to see the bruins play the sabre umpteen times than see the
bruins play the captials in the first round.

maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will
no longer be the case. the experiment is worthwhile with the uneven
distribution of the expansion teams , but i prefer the divisional
playoff.

and , while we are on the subject , has a captain ever been traded ,
resigned , or been striped of his title during the season \? any other
team captain trivia would be appreciated.
cyt
cyt was n't ron francis captain of the whalers when he was traded to
cyt pittsburgh \?

cyt and rick tochett was the captain of the flyers when traded to the pens
cyt recently...

cyt caleb

cyt and let us not forget that the new jersey devils traded
cyt captain kirk muller for stephen richer and chorske

cyt man i hated that trade !


well as for team captains being traded
in there first year in the nhl the
edmonton oilers traded their captain
ron chiperfield to the quebec nordique
right at the trading deadline for
goaltender ron lowe
in their second year of existence
the edmonton oilers again right at the trade
deadline traded their captain , this time
b.j. mcdonald to the vancouver canucks
along with the rights to winger ken
berry for garry lariviere and the rights
to lars gunner petterson

as for more captain trivia , the next edmonton
captain was lee fogilin who was later traded to
the buffalo sabres , after him was wayne gretzky
who was traded to l a , then came kevin low who
only this year was traded to the n y rangers
so that every captain the edmonton oilers have had
has been traded.

the present captain is craig mctavish and we 'll
just have to wait and see.


well talk to you later

are people here stupid or what \? \? \? it is a tie breaker , of cause they

different record \? \? \? \? man , i thought people in this net are good with hockey.
i might not be great in math , but tell me how can two teams ahve the same points
with different record \? \? \? man...retard ! ! ! ! ! ! ca n't believe people actually put
win as first in a tie breaker......

golly , i love stupid people. )
listen , rex , this is hockey. the nhl , to be precise. and in the nhl ,
there exist these things called ties . a tie occurs when a game ends
with the score for each team equal. each team gets one point for a tie.
there also exits these things called wins . a win is when one team has a
higher score than the opponent. (oh yeah , only two teams play each other
at a time , so i can say the opponent .) a team gets two points for a
win. so , let 's say that a team has a record of 38 wins , 36 losses , and 10
ties. another team has a record of 40 wins , 38 losses and 6 ties. the
first team has (38 2) 10 86 points. the second team has (40 2) 6 86
points. wow ! they both have the same number of points , but the number
of wins is different ! how did they do that \? \? ! \? ! \? ! \? ! that 's amazing. so ,
rex , when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker , well , then
that 's what it means. in our example , the second team would win the
tiebreaker and therefore have the better record , even though both teams
had the same number of points. if you did n't understand this post , rex ,
maybe you should go back and read it again , very slowly.

the cubs and astros got rained out. instead of showing another baseball

the only reason espn showed that hockey came was because there was no

aargh !

paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the nhl.
he called a total of 4 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques.
the nords' penalty came in o.t. stewart , being an ex nordique himself ,
was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords
get away with murder...we was robbed ! ! ! !

no. patrick roy is the reason the game was lost , and ron hextall is the
reason quebec won. everybody said it would come down to goaltending , that
goaltending was the key , etc etc. well , the key does n't quite fit if you 're
montreal.

i do n't buy this at all. roy was the reason the game was tied... and that
would not have been the case had dionne kept his cool.
hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...
both dionne 's and bellows' shots were misplayed by hextall , but just because
his gaffes were early in the game , no one seems to care. roy stood on his head
for the first 15 minutes of the game when the nords were rushing from
end to end. kamensky 's mini break after the tying goal and the first shot by
young in ot were both excellent chances stopped by roy. roy outplayed hextall
for most of the game , but roy becomes the villain and hextall the hero
because roy 's team did n't make full use of their opportunities.

hextall , on the other hand , had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very
well , but the haller shot off the post in ot , the rebound bouncing over
bellows' stick , the brunet breakaway , the 3 chances for leclair ... all
those opportunities were not finished off by montreal , and it cost them.
hextall was n't particularly brilliant on those plays ...

blaming stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow. he even saw the whole shot , dammit.

sure , no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. the timing stank , but against
an explosive team like quebec , they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.

montreal played a solid game (although they still do n't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net the loss of schneider will hurt even more).

i disagree. roy played well because he was n't screened the whole night.
the defense , for the 1st time this season , played remarkably , keeping sakic ,
nolan , and sundin out of the slot most of the night.

normally i would say that any team that blows a 2 goal lead with less than
five , let alone two , minutes to go in regulation time in a playoff game
especially needs to be smacked upside their collective heads. but i do n't
think this was a team loss (although keane should have been able to clear
the zone just prior to the first quebec goal).

this most certainly was a team loss... leclair missed his opportunities ,
as did bellows and brunet. dionne took a bad penalty. damphousse and lebeau
were silent . carbonneau and savard were a step behind all night. roy gave
up the bad goal. roy , by no means , can be singled out for this loss.

roy is paid big money to
play. he looked like a player in an industrial league on sakic 's shot.

and hextall did n't on dionne 's goal \? please. roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5 ,
when you consider the defense , or lack of one , that played in front of him
for most of the season.

demers should start racicot in the next game. if not that , he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this
article , if possible.

the montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the habs. they are no better than uninformed fans. why should
they read the papers \? they played 58 minutes of burnsian hockey to shut
down quebec. all they need tonight , and for the rest of the series is the
extra 2.

red light to face quebec...rubbish. that 's a guaranteed way to end the
series 4 0. who would be taught a lesson by this \?
the fans , the media , and racicot , perhaps. certainly not the rest of the team.

i did n't think the wrap around was as bad as the second goal. i also did n't
think scott young should have gotten around the defender (ca n't remember who)
in the first place. but you are correct , it should n't have gone in
regardless.

if you mean the goal should never have gone in , because there should never
have been an ot , then i agree. but the goal itself was a great piece of work
by young. roy had both the near and far posts covered , but young flipped the
puck up under roy 's arm as he wrapped around the net ... not a bad goal at all.

tsn sportsdesk just reported that the ottawa sun has reported that
montreal will send 4 players 15 million including vin damphousse
and brian bellows to phillidelphia , phillie will send eric lindros
to ottawa , and ottawa will give it 's first round pick to montreal.


obviously some reporter for the ottawa sun got taken by an april
fools joke...probably started by someone with the nordiques or the
bruins.

like for example...who is going to reimburse the flyers for the
15 million they paid to the nordiques...like the senators are
going to get lindros and 15 million. the flyers sent the
equivalent of 6 or 7 players (when you include the draft choices)
to quebec , and they are going to get only four back.

some reporter was had real badly and someone must be having a
real good laugh seeing as how the so much of the sports media
has chosen to publicize this utter nonsense.

if this is true , it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa
gets to choose 1st overall. can ottawa afford lindros' salary \?


can you think...it cannot possibly be true...no need for the if !

personally , i ca n't see philli giving up lindros for anything.
they did n't give away that much to quebec just to trade him away
again. not to mention that lindros seems to be a huge draw in
phillie and that he represents a successful future for the
franchise.

ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players 15 from montreal
for the pick.


i ca n't believe that anyone would consider giving such crap even
the remotest consideration.

that hockey is n't quite as popular in south carolina
when you chose a school \?

why did you all (excuse me y'all) choose schools in
the south if hockey was this important to you \?

not everyone has the luxury of deciding on a college by making sure the
hockey coveraage is what you want it to be. i am a pittsburgh transplan
to s. c. when at home and the coveraage sucks. sports south did n't
even show
the final game of the stanley cup laast year while it was happening. they
put it on ktape delay and cut the intermissions then went off the air.
when you move you take the good with the bad and deal with it it does n't
mean thaat you ca n't complain about it.

i was transplanted by my parents from the greater hartford area to the
greater cleveland , ohio area. this was not an action of my choice. the
only hockey coverage i could get there regularly was red wings and penguins
(explaining , in part , why i follow these teams today). in cleveland you
could n't even find hockey scores on the 11 o'clock news because they
figured that if they did n't have it , it was n't a sport.



at least your parents did n't move you idaho. the only things that get
any coverage there are football , basketball and baseball !

how can you assume it was a sarcastic remark \?
for someone whose first language is not english , i would interpret
that comment to mean that he believes pat is the mvp on the team and that
he is just one of the other normal players. quite modest i might say.

well , i do n't recall assuming anything , except perhaps that the columnist
who reported the incident was telling the truth i.e. the sarcastic impression
came from him (steve simmons \? ). besides , to my knowledge alex has a pretty
fair grasp of the english language...and his recent comment after the detroit

tom barrasso wore a great mask , one time , last season. he unveiled it
at a game in boston.

it was all black , with pgh city scenes on it. the golden triangle
(pgh 's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top , along
with a steel mill on one side and the civic arena (i think) on the
other. on the back of the helmet was the old pens' logo (the really
fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) pens
logo , and a space for the new (now current) logo.

tommy had designed the mask , and his mother (an artist) painted it
for him.

but while wearing the mask , the pens got thumped by the bruins. the
very next game , tommy was back to the old paint job. a great mask
done in by a goalie 's superstition.

a fine 26 year history came to a close tonight , as the minnesota north stars ,
or norm 's stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the red wings by a score of
5 3. the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen , who netted
two including the final one in franchise history , with less than a minute to
play.


yes , it 's a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best
hockey markets in the country. being a north stars fan , it is sad to
see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion
at the hands of a truly crappy owner.

hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities
within the next five years. even if this is the case , a lot has been
lost in the north stars move...

game summary

say , if anybody from buffalo is reading this , where did you people get that
woman who sang the anthems \? we had to turn down the volume !

the flyers defense started out the game showing everybody why the flyers have
been shutting teams out lately by holding the sabres to only 8 shots in the
first period. they then showed everybody why they will be playing golf sunday
when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. maybe tommy told them that
he was getting bored back there...

mark recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. after
buffalo won the faceoff and dumped , tommy wrapped the puck around the boards
to eric 1 2 way up on his left. eric dropped it to galley , and he sent it ahead
to recchi steaming out of the zone. mark skated into the center circle , passed
the puck to himself through the legs of richard smehlik , skated around him and
in on fuhr. smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his
stick , recchi drifted right , drifted back left , and slid the puck back to the
right past fuhr for a 1 0 flyers lead at 0 18. it was so beautiful eric and
garry should turn down their assists ).

the flyers kept the pressure on fuhr for a while after that , but he was strong
and kept the flyers from doing further damage. the game then became a defensive
struggle for a while. the sabres got the first chance on the power play when
terry carkner took a boarding minor at 10 26 for crunching dale hawerchuk into
the boards in the flyers zone. lafontaine got the only scoring chance , and not
a terribly good one , as the flyers smothered the sabres power play. mogilny got
a post after it was over. the 25th consecutive penalty kill for the flyers.

keith carney took a holding penalty at 13 31 for taking down mark recchi to
give the flyers a power play. the best penalty killing team in the league
did n't allow the flyers a shot on goal , although the flyers did create a
good scoring chance for lindros who partially fanned on his shot. towards
the end of the period the play started going end to end , but everybody kept
missing the net. greg hawgood took an interference penalty at 18 19 to give
the sabres another power play , but they could n't get anything going and the
fans expressed their displeasure , particularly when they iced the puck. shots
were 8 6 buffalo after the flyers had led 6 2 at one point.

mike emrick interviewed flyers president jay snider between periods. jay was
disappointed to not make the playoffs , but not discouraged. this was considered
a rebuilding year after the trade and he seemed very happy with the way the
season went. when asked if he agonized over the trade he said that it was
russ farwell 's trade and not his , that it only was an issue for him and ed
snider as far as the money. but yes , there was some agonizing , and they 'd do
it all over again. when asked how the coaching situation would be handled for
next year he said that it 's russ' call , and russ will evaluate things at the
end of the season. he feels that they 're 3 years away from a shot at the cup.
he expects to get into the playoffs next year , have a shot at a division title
the following year , and a shot at the finals the year after that. this based
on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.

he 's very happy with the re alignment (he called it outstanding ). happy with
the current expansion , feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux
of europeans , but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.
seemed to like the idea of playing in the olympics (booo) but said that there
was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in
four years if there was a consensus.

the sabres gave the flyers their second power play of the game when brad may
took a tripping penalty at 0 51 of the second. the flyers had a little trouble
getting started , but eventually did. hawgood took a pass as he was moving
throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to eklund just outside the sabres
blue line along the right boards. eklund carried into the zone nad passed
across to dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the
top of the left circle. he half fanned on it , and sent the puck trickling
through the slot. fuhr did n't know where it was , though , and hawgood won the
race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2 15.

then mogilny on a breakaway. he slipped through two flyers at the blue line
and went in on soderstrom. he went with the backhander , but soderstrom was
all over it.

the flyers then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.
viacheslav butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when
barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor , then according to gary dornhoefer
took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4 22. the sabres coudl n't
get started. ryan mcgill poked at the puck just after a sabre carried into the
flyers zone , and after a bunch of people poked at it dineen emerged with it and
headed the other way. it started out a 1 on 1 , but brind'amour hustled ahead to
make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. dineen let it rip from the top
of the right circle to make it 3 0 flyers at 5 40. that was all for fuhr , john
muckler sent in dominik hasek to take over.

but the sabres still had lots of power play time. again they took some time to
just get into the flyers zone , and when they finally did the flyers were all
over them. boos began to ring through the building. but they finally got through
soderstrom on an ugly goal. smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that
missed and kicked out to hawerchuk in the slot. hawerchuk tried a backhander as
he skated towards the goal line to the right as galley dove down to block it.
mistake 1 , he should have let soderstrom handle the backhander and worried
about a) the rebound or b) barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right
next to the net. well , the rebound dropped right next to soderstrom , and
mistake 2 , galley just laid there and watched barnaby get three hacks at the
puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. he did n't even swing his
stick out to try and knock the puck away. with the goal , at 7 48 , two streaks
end for the flyers. 150 28 of shutout hockey , and 27 straight penalty kills.

lindros put them right back on the power play at 8 36 with a high sticking
minor , i think it was barnaby again. this time the sabres were able to get
set up quickly , but could n't get too much quality on goal. the sabres continued
to keep the puck in the flyers end for a while after the power play ended.
things evetually settled down , but then the other very bad penalty. mcgill
allowed barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a
faceoff. the gloves were dropped , and mcgill started pounding the crap out of
him. but during the fight , he gave barnaby a head butt with his helmet , and
that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing , 5 fighting and 5 for the major ,
7 minutes of power play time for the sabres at 14 15 , barnaby only got 5.

the flyers were keeping them at bay for a while , but there was only so long
they could do that. after a couple of good sabre chances , audette handed to
ledyard at the point , and ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by
soderstrom. lafontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of
the net , and knocked it over to randy wood at the right. soderstrom had
moved over to play lafontaine , and since yushkevich and carkner were waving
at the puck instead of picking up men , wood just slid it into the empty net
at 17 34 to close the flyers lead to 3 2. lafontaine was actually trying to
put it on net , but half fanned on it and got a break.

the flyers then got some shorthanded pressure in the sabres zone , but hasek
was strong. finally it was keith carney passing ahead to hawerchuk into the
neutral zone , and hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to mogilny at the flyers
blue line. another mini breakaway for mogilny , he elected to shoot from the
left circle , and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at
18 56 for his 75th of the season. ironically , the youth hockey tip between
the 1st and second period was tommy soderstrom talking about cutting off
angles...

that was all in the 2nd , shots were 19 7 sabres.

into the 3rd period , and pelle eklund blew a golden opportunity to get the
flyers the lead back. a 2 on 1 , acton with the puck , he dropped to eklund in
the slot , and eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until
he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. when he finally did shoot , he
hit the far post. that was still during the carryover power play time.

than an incredible almost goal. randy wood skated around recchi and hawgood
untouched into soderstrom. soderstrom goes down , wood pokes the puck under
soderstrom , and a black object hits the back of the net. red light comes on ,
horn sounds , crowd cheers. but up to the video replay booth , for some strange
reason , and in the meantime emrick and dornhoefer try to figure out what they
could be reviewing. well , it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade
that went into the net , not the puck. emrick mentions that one of the criteria
for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...

dave hannan then took out recchi and got a holding minor at 2 35. the flyers
could not get anything going at all. they finally got set up 1 2 way through ,
but were kept on the perimeter. as time ran out , beranek stripped the puck
from a sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across
to eklund at the top of the left circle. eklund saw dineen heading at the net
just inside the right circle and passed through to him. dineen fumbled the pass ,
but twice directed it at hasek , and eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing
puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4 42. 4 3 flyers.

but the sabres came right back. lafontaine picked up the puck in his offensive
left corner and slid it to bob erry behind the flyers net. erry started to skate
out , but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. mogilny flew
in , skated around , and stuffed it through soderstrom 's 5 hole for his 76th at
5 24 to tie the game at 4.

then hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5 55. the flyers set up
in the sabres zone , and stayed there. off a faceoff high in the sabres zone in
the middle. while brind'amour wrestled for the puck , dineen snuck through the
line and wristed a perfect shot low to hasek 's glove side at 6 44.

play started to go back and forth until hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8 19.
the flyers dumped the puck into the sabres zone. brind'amour and ledyard went
after it , and rod got the puck. he backed away from the right boards , skated
to the right faceoff dot , and passed between his legs to dineen crashing
through the slot all by himself. dineen waited patiently and lifted it over
the blocker of hasek for a 6 4 flyers lead at 8 39. 3rd hat trick of the season
for dineen , 7th of his career , 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th
of the season.

then carney took a tripping penalty at 9 02 to kill the rest of the sabres
power play. not much action on the 4 on 4 , and the sabres got most of the
chances on the flyers resulting power play.

play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to
make some big saves. the sabres were n't able to pull hasek as time was running
out as the flyers would n't allow any consistant possession for the sabres.
finally as time was running out ken sutton misplayed the puck in his own left
corner and brind'amour stripped it away from him. he pulled away and found
dineen on the other side of the left circle , and dineen found acton at the
right of hasek. he slid the puck between two sabres defenders , and acton
chipped it back to the far side of hasek for his 8th of the season at 19 48
on his 35th birthday. that was all the scoring , shots were 18 13 buffalo ,
and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the
game.

so another strong game from tommy soderstrom who had n't been tested much
in his last couple of starts. kevin dineen has a career high 6 point night
(unless he had a better night earlier in the season , but i do n't think so).
the flyers longest winning streak in 3 years , 30 goals for only 11 against
with three shutouts. eric lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals
despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th , clinched 5th place
since the rangers lose the tie breaker.

a couple misc notes

forget the mike keenan rumors , there will be a press conference tommorrow to
announce that he will be head coach of the new york rangers next year.

in the last notes i mentioned that garry galley won the barry ashbee award ,
but i failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.

the times of trenton has reported that a preeminent specialist from oklahoma
has looked over tommy soderstrom 's medical record and determined that no
further tests are necessary in the near future.

same paper had a blurb about bill dineen being asked about whether or not he
expected to be back next year. his response was that he wants to come back ,
he feels he did a good job this year , but that he would cheerfully accept a
role scouting if farwell did n't want him back.

subject sharks review part 2 defensemen (2 19)
organization computer science department , stanford university.
lines 92

i finally got it back , with great thanks to mark spiegel for saving and sending
it.



2 rob zettler season 4th
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade c c

zettler gave the sharks every bit he 's got this year unfortunately , this still
was n't enough to make him any more than a marginal nhler , if that. he works
hard , for sure , but is no better than average on defense , and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times , while being basically an
offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games). he would be hardpressed
to make the team next year.

3 david williams season 2nd
acquired '91 92 , free agent from new jersey
grade c c

imo , williams was the most valuable defenseman for the sharks in '91 92 ,
playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and
good defense. but he , playing the first part of this season in kansas city ,
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year it , then , appears that
'91 92 was a fluke. although he improved towards the end of the season , he
was prone to being out of position defensively , and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the team 's leading scorer among defensemen last
year. he would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.

4 jayson more season 2nd
acquired '91 92 , from montreal in expansion draft
grade b

after being touted as the team 's top defensive prospects in training camp
before '91 92 , more had a rather disappointing '91 92 , as he was not
particularly good defensively , and had just 17 points in 46 games. he , then ,
proceeded to improve his game massively this season , becoming the team 's most
reliable defenseman , whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.
offensively , he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73
games) , but his defense improved tremendously. he is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.

5 neil wilkinson season 4th
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade b

wilkinson was probably the team 's top defensive defenseman in '91 92. however ,
partially because of injuries , he was not the same this year , as he missed 25
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries , and seemed to be slowed
even when playing. he , then , had often to be saved by his defensive partners
that is , if they are there at all. but he also had some solid games , and if
he can be complete healthy , he can still be a force.

6 sandis ozolinsh season 1st
acquired '91 92 , 2nd round pick in entry draft
grade i (a)

at the time of his injury (december 30 , against the philadelphia flyers) ,
ozolinsh was well on track to be , imo , the team 's mvp. a serious knee injury
in that game , though , forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games) ,
but he still finished as the team 's top scorer among defensemen (23 points) ,
which , of course , tells more about the lack of offense the sharks had from
their defensemen , but it also tells of ozolinsh 's abilities. at the time , he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense he was still
susceptible to so called rookie mistakes , but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team , rookie or veteran. if he can come back
from his injuries , he is ready to be a star.

19 doug zmolek season 1st
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade b

zmolek had basically a solid and durable year , being one of the only two sharks
to play in all 84 games of the season. he was solid on defense , but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman , he did n't show it (15 points).
he was also prone to penalties , and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the
team however , that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents , and he was at his best when playing physically. but to
become a fixture in this league , he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively , and cut down on the number of power plays he gives to opponents.

political woes , mike keenan repeated that to messier personally during
the msg press conference. it makes sense ... messier would probably
have not declined the invitation if it were made for publicity ...


actually , messier was invited , but declined due to nagging injuries...
keenan and messier have always gotten along...keenan dumped steve
yzerman from the last canada cup team , even though yzerman had
endured the training camp , when messier who had missed essentially the
entire camp recovering from injuries became available at the

subject isles hockey ramblings
lines 43


well , the patrick division got a little more interesting last night.
the islanders lost in ot and the devils tied the pens. that means if the isles
beat the devils on friday , the will meet the caps in the playoffs.

however , i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in
general that i need to get off my chest ). first of all , with the islanders
back to back lackluster performances against the whalers , one may think that
the islanders are out of shape. these guys always suck wind in the 2nd period ,
come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon. it is unbelieveable
how many one goal games these guys have lost. anyway , the games was pretty
wide open. the isles still have tons of trouble scoring. the whalers played
a golie in is 1st nhl start , i think his name was lenarduzzi (sp \? ). (his nhl
debut was the tuesday tie against the isles). like i mentioned before , this
guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a
mahlakov slap shot to go to ot). i say it 's because the isles do n't shoot
correctly. has anyone else noticed this \?

also , i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick
vukota gets as much ice time as he does. this guy has about as much hockey
talent as jiggs macdonald (who did play hockey , i think). anytime he gets the
puck it gets stolen , and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties.
richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap. and he 's a
defenseman. he 's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus minus.
this guy gets beaten all the time. why the need for such enforcers \? not
only do fights slow the game down alot , but it takes away from the guys who are
really trying to play the game. i 'll be one of the few to admit , i do enjoy a
good fight once in a while , but only when it 's called for . you know , when a
guy checks the goalie too hard. in other words , a violation of hockey ethics
might cause you to get puched. but there is no need to start crap when you are
losing or becuase you can get away with it ! ! does anyone agree that referees
need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and ot \? i mean come on already.
i'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down , holding guys etc. just becuase the
referee does n't call it. ot and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy ,
not physical prowess. trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost.
if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to
pull a guy down to prevent it , you do n't deserve to win in the first place.

just my honest opinion ,

us easterners who have newspapers with editors
unsympathetic to playoff pools , often do n't get
summaries from west coast games since they
finish too late at night for the morning edition.

i (and i'm sure others too) would greatly appreciate
it if scoring summaries of west coast playoff games
could be posted to this group right away.
basically , all we need are goal scorers and assists ,
do n't bother with times , penalties , shots etc...

this would make a lot of pool obsessed people very
happy.

i guess with the senators out golfing now , the
local papers have lost interest. )

i think that you are incorrect , roger. patrick ,
smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types. hence , they did help build the league , although
they were not great players themselves.

punch imlach 's contributions as a coach and gm were far greater than
those of the above combined. should we name a division or trophy after
him \? owner vs. player contributions deleted...
are we going to honour those who contributed to the league 's evolution
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the
sport itself \?

stuff deleted...

the money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on , and
that is it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice

as i recall , the author of the original article that started the thread
claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons.
roger , on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his
was a jingoistic rant , but you also supported the name changing on the
grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals
they represent. fwiw , i do not think the flaming was warranted , nor do i
think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all. just an
observation...

however , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of
changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for
the 'casual fan') , or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
based on individuals who do deserve the honour. imo , the latter is a nice
and unique touch that differs from other sports. in addition , i do not
think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
people that are interested in hockey , so it 's a pointless exercise anyway.

if the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not
central to the original article. something to consider additionally is
whether or not players like orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to
play in. in this case , honouring builders of the league as opposed to
builders of the sport becomes a chicken and egg type question. (although
it was the chicken.....)

exactly true. naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame. i have
always thought that this was nonsense.

dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable , since it does n't look as though
his 'unanimous acceptance' to the hall will hold up.

sweden opened the scoring as markus naslund made a drop pass at the finnish
blue line , popovic picked it up and advanced towards the finnish goal and
shot a nice hard wrist shot in ketterer 's top corner. ville siren 's slap
shot from the blue line on power play made it 1 1 , and juha riihijarvi
scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal
put the puck high over aslin , 1 2 after the first period.
the finns started the second period with really good pressure. korpisalo
made it 1 3 with another goal from close range high over aslin. then ,
during the finnish pressure , sweden turned the game around in 1 47.
mikael renberg worked hard behind the finnish goal , and passed the puck to
jan larsson in front , who backhanded the puck low , 2 3. rundqvist entered
the finnish zone and passed to ahlund , and the finnish defense let ahlund
skate in and take a shot that ketterer dropped into the goal , 3 3.
next , roger hansson behind the goal sent the puck back to the blue line
where roger akerstrom took a slap shot and ketterer did n't see the puck since
there was traffic in front , 4 3.
third period started with a nice goal by stefan the shadow nilsson. stefan
and patrik juhlin entered the finnish zone , patrik passed the puck back to
stefan who alone with ketterer made no mistake , 5 3.
then , keijo sailynoja show started. he reduce and equalized the lead in only
21 seconds ! first he scored the 5 4 goal , and after that he came in alone
with aslin but was tripped by aslin to get a penalty shot. sailynoja
made a nice penalty shot , showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.
the swedes seemed to head for a win when mikael renberg scored the 6 5 goal
late in the game on a nice power play combination. renberg waited in the slot ,
showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side , ahlund passed the puck
and renberg took a turnaround shot low in ketterer 's goal 's far side.
but jari korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the
game 's final goal to make it 6 6. korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow
angle that maybe aslin should have saved.

all in all , a decent game where the defense was n't the best.
both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period
to try no combinations.

renberg and rundqvist plays well together in the swedish team. larsson
nilsson juhlin best line overall again , it seems to be a working wc line.
stillman good on defense.
some players are n't good enough for the wc though. hakan ahlund (faell ner
hjaelmen och jobba ! ) , roger hansson , challe berglund , kenny jonsson
will likely have to leave for nhl pros.

two goal scorers jari korpisalo and keijo sailynoja played well in the
finnish team. markus ketterer did n't have a very good game , we 've seen him
a lot better , so lindfors is probably finland 's starting goalie in the wc.
i heard that esa tikkanen will join the finnish team. it would be inter
resting to know which other pros coach matikainen counts on for the wc.

you 'll have a hard time selling any sport to a community that

playoffs

stauber disturbed by third man theme
by rick sadowski , daily news

barry melrose 's decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the
crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender.

i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year , the most
fun time of the year , and i'm not , stauber said with some emotion monday. i
think i have worked hard enough for that.

stauber said he accepts melrose 's choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the calgary flames. hrudey made 21 saves in sundays
6 3 opening victory.

but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no. 3 man behind rick
knickle. stauber had a 4 1 2 record and 2.98 goals against average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no. 1 job from hrudey.

knickle \? he won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average , twice was
yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and has n't played since march 29.

yet , when the series resumes wednesday , knickle will serve as hrudey 's backup
again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic
saddledome popcorn.

if i'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...i
dropped too. 3. what happened to no. 2 \? stauber wondered. not that i 'd be
happy with no. 2 , but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs.

perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance , but melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25 year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.

while insisting he is the kings' goalie of the future , melrose said stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season. they were ,
according to melrose a 7 2 loss to san jose on dec. 26 an 8 3 loss to the new
york rangers on jan. 23 a 6 6 tie with detroit on feb. 11 an 8 6 loss to
vancouver on thursday.

four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie , he could
have taken it away from kelly hrudey , and he did n't do it , melrose said. an
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him. the mark of a
great goalie is that he is n't satisfied to be a backup.

i'm not blaming robb for the losses , but if you 're going to be no. 1 , you 've
got to be able to walk your talk. you 've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line. robb stauber has a great deal of ability , but maybe i expect
more from him than he does.

ouch. that remark stung stauber. he began the season 9 0 1 , struggled when the
team hit a mid season slump , did n't play for a month after knickle was signed
off the san diego gulls roster , then came on at the end.

i expect more from myself than anybody , including barry melrose , said stauber ,
a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in 1989 , only
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.

what i 've been through the last four years two knee operations , a herniated
disk in my back , shoulder surgery what more can i go through \? i obviously do
expect a lot from myself , otherwise i would n't be here.

anybody who would disagree with that does n't know me. i'm not saying barry
does n't know me , but do n't say i 've been without expectations. if anything , i'm
a perfectionist.

the presence of the new team in miami(i ca n't say south florida
it 's too long) makes me think of an interesting question. can you sell
the hispanic community on hockey \? miami is 60 70 hispanic. this community
has no experience and no previous exposure to hockey that i know of. the
teams in ny and la which also have big hispanic groups do not seem to try
to woo this group. what will miami do \? could they get spanish language
tv and radio coverage \?
i think , as do the owners , that hockey will do well in miami since there
is a lot of people from the northeast that spend their winters in
florida every year. as for the coverage , someone will have to come up
with some money for that since broadcast rights can be expensive !

in case anyone missed it , i'm reposting this and i'm also selling some other
stuff.

i would like to sell a few of my hockey cards sets

1990 91 upperdeck hockey low 's sets 45

this is the first upperdeck hockey set made. important rookie cards in it are
mogilny , roenick , belfour , recchi , stevens , jagr , nolan , nedved , ricci ,
sundin , modano , richter and others ! the beckett price is 42 , but i'm
charging 45 to cover the shipping and packaging.

i 've sold one , but i still have 2 left for sale. i also realize that 45 is
alot of money , especially if you do n't normally collect cards. so if enough
people are interested , i 'll break up the set into team sets. i'm not sure
how much for each. it would be nice to just sell them for 3 each , but then
the people who get the whalers and devils (note , i'm not bagging on these teams
its just that they do n't have alot of good rookie cards in this set) would
be subsidizing the people who want chicago or pittsburgh. so i 'll have to make
it varialble pricing. but most of them should be about 2 or 3 dollars.


1991 92 score pinnacle (candian) sets 45

this is a very nice set , premium quality cards. has second year cards of the
players above , plus bure , potvin , falloon , and lindros ( 15 value) second year
cards , and the following rookie cards lidstrom kamensky , zelepukin , roussel ,
konstantinov. beckett price is 50 , but i have alot of these.

1991 92 upperdeck czechoslovakian set 60

this is a 100 card set of the 92 world junior tournament. meant for sale in
czechoslovakia , but did n't sell well there , and some of it filtere back in
to the us. the cards are bilingual. has lachance , kovalev , and straka rookies.
if your interested , please e mail me. thanks

ok someone asked for this one , but he 's from canada , if he can get me the
money in us funds then its his , if not , the first person who writes in will
be the alternate.

also i would like to sell 2 upperdeck pavel bure rookie cards (note these
are not in the ud low 's set mentioned above). 16 each. they are 15 in
the book , but the 1 goes for postage , packaging and insurance.

and if there is something you want that you do n't see , e mail me , i may have
it or may be able to get it for you.

here 's the deal you email (preferably) or post your predictions , and the
number of games you think each series will go. each round will be
weighted , so that the stanley cup finals will be very important , but the
early rounds will still be important. here is the scoring

pick 1st round winner , within one game 3 points
pick 1st round winner , pick of games 5 points

pick 2nd round winner , way off on games 3 points
pick 2nd round winner , within one game 4 points
pick 2nd round winner , pick of games 6 points

pick conference champ , way off on games 5 points
pick conference champ , within one game 6 points
pick conference champ , pick of games 9 points

pick stanley cup champ , way off on games 8 points
pick stanley cup champ , within one game 10 points

pick loser in 7 , series goes 7 2 points
pick loser in 7 , series decided in game 7 , ot 4 points
(these last two are sympathy points , probably wo n't happen anyway)

obviously , picking the stanley cup champion is important. i will do some
tests to see if the format is fair , but probably i will be too lazy to

organization computer science department , stanford university.

21 peter ahola season 2nd
acquired '92 93 , trade with pittsburgh for future considerations
grade i (b)

it is way too early to tell about ahola , who was acquired probably because the
penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft. ahola had
only played 50 games this season (i think it 's actually less the san jose
mercury news may be in err here) , 20 of them with the sharks. in the games he
has played , he appeared quite solid defensively , although he has n't been
spectacular , and his offense is n't anything to write home about (8 points)
it 's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be ... peter ahola.

24 doug wilson season 16th
acquired '91 92 , trade with chicago for rw kerry toporowski and
2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
grade i (b)

i have often been accused of overly down on wilson i may have had too high
expectations for him , but his legs , knees , et al. , are giving out.
nevertheless , when he was playing , he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities , even if he has lost a step on defense , which ,
unfortunately , he demonstrated this year as well , as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards , and his offensive output was only good enough for
2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games). but next year , which may be
wilson 's last , if he can stay healthy , he can still be a contributor.

29 dean kolstad season 2nd
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade i (c d )

it 's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge kolstad on just a handful of
games (forgetting exact number , but no more than 15) , but at age 25 he 's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the nhl. in those games ,
he did not impress anyone after generating 7 shots in the first period of
the first game he played , he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
the sharks , and was even less impressive defensively , as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways. he needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.

38 pat macleod season 2nd
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade i ( \? )

macleod was on the roster a lot longer than kolstad , but it appears to my
memory that he played less than kolstad , because the sharks were reluctant to
use him , but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors , figuring that
he would n't clear waivers in fact , he has played the past 4 5 weeks with
kansas city , but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment ,
a rehab assignment that will include him playing in the turner cup playoffs.
since he has played so little , i ca n't even give a tentative grade on him , but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills.

41 tom pederson season 1st
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade i (b )

called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries , pederson impressed many sharks fan here on net , including yours
truly. he demonstrated very good offensive skills , scoring 20 points in
43 games. however , his size (5' 9 , 165 lbs.) is of concern , and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically ,
on both sides of the ice , although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
but to be successful , he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.

45 claudio scremin season 1st
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade i (d d)

he played all of 5 games in the league this year , but was thoroughly
umimpressive , just as he was at the end of last season again , it may be a
small sample , but just as in the case of kolstad , scremin , at age 25 , is
quickly running out of time. he was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the sharks. the only notable thing that
will go down in scremin 's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now capitals goaltender don beaupre.

pittsburgh \?

no.

in what still , imho , ranks as the all time greatest pr blunder (not to
mention on ice blunder) the whalers ever committed , gm eddie johnston and
coach rick ley 'decided' that francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the captain 's c in december of 1990. the whole organization (read
ej and ley , and by default owner richard gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind sided by ej) dumped on francis all
season , starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract , publicly
humiliating him , stripping him of the c , and then trading him that spring
to the penguins. classy guy , that ej.

the loss of francis (and too a lesser extent , ulf) , was one of a series of
decimating player moves by ej which stripped the personality and fan awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

gratuitous good ej note...he did preside over the organization when it
acquired verbeek , cassels , sanderson , poulin , nylander , etc. he stripped the
roster but he did lay a foundation.

and , while we are on the subject , has a captain ever been traded ,
resigned , or been striped of his title during the season \? any other

the leafs have always been kind of comical. during the second imlach
era , when darryl sittler was called a cancer on the team , he tore the
c off his sweater and for a while the leafs did n't have a captain.

sittler eventually ended up in philly and he was promised the philly
captaincy by new gm (and sittler 's friend) bobby clarke. instead ,
sittler got traded to detroit.

rick vaive was the leaf captain for awhile but he slept in one day and
they took the captaincy away from him. then he was traded to chicago.

during doug carpenter 's tenure as leaf coach , in an attempt to kiss
the ass of a sulking gary leeman , the leafs took the a away from brad
marsh to give to leeman. leeman would n't take it and when they tried
to give it back to marsh , he would n't take it neither.

the best story i remember about a captain concerned mel bridgman , late
of the senators. while he was in philadelphia , bobby clarke , arguably
one of the great captains of all time , was bumped up to the status of
playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy. bridgman be
came the new captain. a reporter asked a flyer what bridgman did as a
captain since clarke was still the undisputed leader amongst the
players. the reporter was told that bridgman was in charge of making
sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.

8 larry depalma season 3rd
acquired '91 92 , free agent from minnesota
grade i (c d )

no netter fan watching the sharks , including me , knows where depalma was at
the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights , but he
was n't in san jose , he was n't in kansas city , and his name has n't appeared on
the waiver wire. and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part
for depalma. after being called up october 30 against the tampa bay lightning ,
depalma had an excellent week , scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good
defense. unfortunately , the 27 year old depalma then disappeared the rest of
the way , getting just 3 more points in 15 more games , and generally looked
lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice. he then was sent down to
kansas city , walked out from there , and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of shark bytes (as the mailing list is now known to sharks
officials) faithful , and neither the sharks nor we miss him.

10 johan garpenlov season 3rd
acquired '91 92 , trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and 8th round
pick in '92 entry draft from vancouver
grade a a

after an early slump , garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest
of the way , finishing with 66 points in 79 games , second highest total on the
team , as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob
gaudreau. kisio got most of the credit , but garpenlov , finishing second in
the mvp voting , clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills , as he
was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him
by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders , getting a club high 14 power
play goals. contrary to his previous rep , garpenlov also showed that despite
his small size (5' 11 , 183 lbs.) , he was willing to throw himself around
when necessary , albeit not very successful yet. he also still needs to work
on his defense , although he improved tremendously throughout the season , and
was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season. he will
be a major key to the offense next year.

after a banner '91 92 , when he led the team in power play goals (10) and
was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games) , bruce was bothered
virtually all of this season with a groin injury , which kept him out of the
lineup for all by 17 games this season. of course , it is difficult to
speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by
the injury , but the 28 year old bruce was effective with a man up or a man
short in the sharks' first season , and was expected to be a strong offensive
leader this season as well. the injury appears serious , which is a shame ,
because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead , his
future with the sharks next season appears clouded.

18 mark pederson season 3rd
acquired '92 93 , trade with philadelphia for c lw dave snuggerud
grade i (b)

it is difficult for me to understand the flyers' decision to unload pederson ,
after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games) , but
after riding the pine early in the season , pederson was summarily sent to the
sharks in exchange of the defensive minded snuggerud , and he finished with
41 games combined with the flyers and the sharks. he was also limited by
injuries this season , and this limited his production (17 points). but when
healthy , pederson appears impressive , with a good scoring touch , good size
(and the willingness to throw it around , although he 's not considered a
physical forward) , and good speed. he also does not appear to be a liability
on defense , but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how
much , exactly , pederson can do.

20 john carter season 4th
acquired '91 92 , free agent from boston
grade i (b b)

carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team , and the hard
work worked wonders , as at times he looked great on ice. however , although he
did look great at times , the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55
games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can
do , and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about
20 games left in the season. carter , who will turn 30 on may 6 , always
hussled , but as a result , was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive
zone while forechecking , but he was generally a credit on the defensive end ,
but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity , and he did not impress
offensively , although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties. he
is very unlikely to be back next season.

28 jean francois quintin season 1st
acquired '91 92 , from minnesota in dispersal draft
grade i (b b)

i do n't understand why the sharks did n't let quintin play any more than the
14 games he played this season. he was generally hard working and creating
opportunities offensively , and appeared , at age 23 , ready for regular nhl
duty , at least for a team like the sharks , finishing with 7 points in those
14 games while not being a defensive liability. shoulder injury in training
camp before the '91 92 season limited quintin , the team 's leading scorer in
exhibition games despite sitting out the final two , to just 29 games with the
sharks and the blades that season , but he looked impressive. he should be a
solid contender for regular duty next season.

41 mark beaufait season 1st
acquired 2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft
grade i ( \? )

after a all star season at kansas city , beaufait got a cup of coffey with the
sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the
sharks decimated with injuries , playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only
nhl point thus far. despite small size (5' 9 , 165 lbs.) , beaufait was not shy
to throw himself around when necessary , and looked pretty good at times ,
although it 's too early to judge him based on 5 nhl games , in which he played
mostly left wing , away from his center position at northern michigan and
kansas city.

42 jaroslav otevrel season 1st
acquired 8th round pick in 1991 entry draft
grade i ( \? )

like beaufait , otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was
up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season. he was generally
very much of a defensive liability , and did not show much offensively either ,
although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those
7 games. he may need another season to work on his defense , but once his
defense is acceptable , he should be ready.

44 michel picard season 1st
acquired '92 93 , trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau
grade i (b c )

the 23 year old picard , although he perennially tore up the minors , seems to
be close to being out of chances , for some reason , after being acquired by the
sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games , scoring 4 goals for
his only points , and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city.
he was not particularly strong defensively , and despite his offensive
brilliance in the minors , he has failed thus far to score in the nhl , although
he has been given limited opportunities. he may be the sharks' bait in the
expansion draft.

45 dody wood season 1st
acquired 3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
grade i (d d , although perhaps i should n't give a grade at all)

i have been accused of knocking on wood too much. ) then , it is probably
no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far , although
13 games is a small example. he was generally a nonfactor on offense , was
not particularly good defensively , and took too many silly penalties , losing
many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games ,
projecting to to 446( ! ) in an 84 game season. he 's not ready , and needs at
least another season at kc , where he can work on his fighting skills , if
nothing else. his relatively small size (5' 11 , 181 lbs.) does not give much
possibility that he can survive , at this stage , as an enforcer.

in other tv news , the penguins announced yesterday that they will have 3

this is incorrect. this year the pens had 61 games on free tv and 6
games on ppv. next year they will have 62 games on free tv and 22 on
a subscription basis.

you actually get 1 more free game than last year , and there will be no

yeah , and also be second in the team in scoring and play about 35

if this is true , it will most likely depend on whether or not ottawa
gets to choose 1st overall. can ottawa afford lindros' salary \?

personally , i ca n't see philli giving up lindros for anything.
they did n't give away that much to quebec just to trade him away
again. not to mention that lindros seems to be a huge draw in
phillie and that he represents a successful future for the
franchise.

ottawa may be better off taking the 4 players 15 from montreal

implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne
on the ice can be blamed on him...roger , he is a forward. winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway. let 's put it another way. john cullen 's
is terrible. what 's your excuse for him \? that his powerplay points do n't
count \? neither do selanne 's...

are you comparing cullen to salami \? i would say that that is valid. if
winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does salami
stand around the other team 's blueline when the puck is in his own end \?

i thought that he was comparing cullen to teemu sel nne. i always thought
that salami is some sort of sausage , but if you , dear roger , are able to
see salami on the ice playing hockey... i do n't know what to do , but you
surely should do something and very quickly ! ! !

maybe you think that if you keep on talking some rubbish , after some time
everybody will consider it to be really true... you should take care of
your leafs , they surely need it more.


what he does best is score...so i refer you to my comment above.

some of our finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid two way game. i would have to say that this style
of contribution would be more conducive to winning. or do n't you
think so \?

at least we have seen him playing...

as it is now , selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck. did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal \? you would think the
messiah had returned...

during the latest philly game the leaf players did n't parade... philly

bonjour tout le monde !

well , in salt lake city this past sunday , the local abc station decided not
to televise the hockey games. la directrous de programme est la tete de merde !
anyway , i have a satellite dish , and a few of my friends from hockey have invited themselves over to watch the games this coming sunday (25 apr) , and i can
not find correct game times. for the calgary at la game i have times showing
everything from 11 00 am mdt , to 5 00 pm mdt.

i am not even sure what games are going to be played this coming sunday , now
that abc has mucked up the schedule. i think i should be able to
pull in
three games (11 00 am , 2 00 pm , and 5 30 pm mdt) off the dish , but i am
not sure.

if anybody has a schedule , pleas emial it to me. as you can see , i have to
telent to get rec.sport.hockey , and it is sometimes difficult to get a link.

thanks in advance

is there an award for best back up behind a hockey great \?
underneath all the hype about lemieux , stevens , jagr , ulf ,
etc. , ron francis has quietly put together a 100 point season
(24 goals and 76 assists in 84 games). that was probably the
best acquisition the penguins have made since getting lemieux
(apologies to rick tocchet , who has had a hell of a year
himself). the pens got just the right person at just the right
time when they got francis before the playoffs two years ago to
back up mario. who was the second line center before they got
francis \? i remember randy gilhen (who really plays tough , an
ace in the face off circle) , but nobody with all the skills
francis has scoring , passing , winning face offs , and putting
100 into every game , every night. just wanted to glow a
little.

i know what you mean ! i glow everytime ronnie 's out on the ice.
in fact , one of the neatest things about seeing the pens in person
is that i can key in on him instead of watching what i 'd probably
be seeing on tv. he does so many subtle things behind the play.

he said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad
stressed the importance of playing two way hockey that you have to
learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took
that advice to heart. he was a breath of fresh air when he arrived
in pittsburgh to the team whose forwards , for the most part , could n't
and would n't play a lick of defense.

it 's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought
all of this success to the pens. you mention rick tocchet and he has
certainly helped , and even ol' kjell has been steady. but looking at
this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line up
permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it
would n't matter.

if i had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would
be 1) tom barrasso 2) ron francis 3) larry murphy. (i 'd love to put
francis first but i do think the only thing that could really damage
the pens right now would be to lose barrasso.)

how was this trade bad \? i seem to recall ratelle and middleton making a pretty
good centre right wing combination , and the bruins also got brad park in the
deal (and they also lost vadnais and somebody else). after the trade , the
bruins were in two finals and one semi final , all of which , of course , they
lost to montreal (which should please you to no end). i doubt , however , keeping

detroit is a very disciplined team. there 's a lot of europeans

to slow the game down , which means drawing penalties , as a last

more good players. toronto is just an average team , detroit is n't

plus minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

not necessarily the most misleading , but you are right , it definitely
needs to be taken in the proper perspective. a shining example is
if you look at the penguins individual , you will find very few minuses.
that only makes common sense , since they did n't lose many games.

until the nhl publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
time per game and some measure of its quality (i.e. , is the player put out
in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game is he matched up
against the other team 's top one or two lines short handed , etc) , i would
much rather see the disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

unfortunately , you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to
really come up with a statistic which really shows a player 's value.
let 's just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it. (like i'm doing now ,

if fuhr had been in position the puck would have never crossed the line.

roger maynard shares his views , with the masses , on bob gainey
and life in general

(greg ballentine) writes

the selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to
prevent goals from being scored not to score them. when
lemieux or gilmour play their number one purpose is to score
defence is secondary especially considering the line that
plays against them is probably a defensive one. that is why
they are not selke candidates.
gainey is the best defensive forward ever. i stand by that
assessment. he was a very good player who belongs in the hall
of fame. did you ever watch him play \? he never made a
technical error.

i watched him over his entire career. i have never seen a
player , and that includes russell courtnall and davie keon ,
screw up as many breakaways as bob gainey. and i will never
forget the time denis potvin caught gainey with his head down.
you have been sold a bill of goods on bob gainey.

it was bryan trottier , not denis potvin. it was a vicious
'boarding' from behind...trottier was given a major.

but roger , what the hell does this have to do with gainey 's skill
as a hockey player \? if probert smashes gilmour 's head into the
boards next week , will that diminish your assessment of gilmour 's
skills \?

gainey was a plugger. and when the press runs out of things to
say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype the
pluggers. grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring , bob
nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne
cashman , bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri richard ,
dick duff...and so on...

i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter.

i think gainey would be honoured to know that you 've included him
on this list. i also think you have a relatively naive view
about what wins a hockey game...pluggers are an integral part of
any team. the selke is designed to acknowledge their
contribution...i think that most people understand that it 's not
the nobel prize...so settle down.

especially when the wings player hit the rut and went into the
boards injuring his shoulder and they blotted out the injury report.

the wings player was yves racine , and he returned later in that same period.

if gilmour was taken completely by surprise , as gainey was , then
yeah , i would have to say that doug was n't playing
technically smart hockey. in any case , to claim as greg did ,
that gainey never made a technical mistake is absolutely
ludicrous.

later on , in your posting , you make reference to putting words
into other people 's mouths ...i would suggest that your last
paragraph can only be interpreted in one way...namely , that i ,
along with greg , claim that gainey never made a technical
mistake. if you actually read what i 've written , you will find
that i make no such claim...soooo , if logic serves me well ,
you 're contradicting yourself.

nonsense. i quite clearly state that it was greg that made the claim
that gainey never made an error. and he made the claim. read below.

gainey is the best defensive forward ever. i stand by that assessment.
he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame. did you
ever watch him play \? he never made a technical error.

more nonsense deleted

good for you. you 'd only be displaying your ignorance of
course , but to each his own...

roger , i'm not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a
function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an
opinion ...but hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by all
means go ahead...that 's if it makes you feel better.

to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious. your
hockey education is not my responsibility.

my word , such vehemence against poor ol' bob gainey. why does
he bother you so much...he was an effective player for his style
of play.

he was just another player. to laud him as anything more i find
bothersome. i hated the habs. i hated lafleur until i realized
that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever
skate in my lifetime. why would anyone talk about gainey \?

go around. who would you rather have as your checking
centre \? doug gilmour or doug jarvis \? for that matter i would
take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres. do you
think gretzky could cover bob gainey \?

i'm really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here.
why do n't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ ,
himself , in nets \?

did he play hockey at a high level \? was he any good \? if not , why
would you bother to bring jc up \? i am talking about hockey players
here. if you ca n't follow the conversation do n't follow up. as i
said previously , it is not my responsibility to educate you.

now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob gainey with guy
carbonneau , you would have a balanced comparison.

sure. two journeymen. big deal. neither one of them is worth
discussing.

i'm wrong again...hmmm , let 's see...where was i wrong in the

i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter.

first place \? i'm only guessing here , rog , but i have a feeling
that you 've setup a you 're wrong again macro key on your
machine.

that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time
responding to any of your , or greg 's , postings then i will be sure
to implement that very macro.

i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out
of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to hype
the pluggers. grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring , bob
nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne cashman ,
bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri richard , dick
duff...and so on... demonstrates a blanket disregard for these
individuals as contributors to the game...so yes , settle
down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.

tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god. and greg ate it up.
and that is what this thread is all about. if you did n't know
that then why are you responding \?

and as for blanket disregard for these individuals , i can remember
leaf teams , purely populated by such individuals , winning four
stanley cups. teams. no one ran around telling us that george
armstrong was the best hockey player in the world.

you might consider developing your own style. after all ,
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite sure
that flattery is not your intention.

c'mon...it has a nice ring to it...and admit it , you had a good
laugh.

right. i had to get to the end of your posting before i realized you were
a complete joke.

in the future , if you are going to respond to my postings i would appreciate
it if you could present a cogent argument supported by facts gleaned from a
version of reality that most of the rest of us would recognize.

yeah but soderstrom 's mask has always appeared to be a lot bigger than the

no no no ! since all the penalties fall into three classes , there should
only be three penalties

1. foul (any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
body or stick). if you get 5 you are out for the game.

2. unsportsmanlike contact. (an intentional foul). this inlcludes all the
current flavours of roughing , fighting and boarding. if you get two you
are thrown out of the game , and fined.

3. technical foul. bad mouthing the ref , by player or coach. penalty shot
is awarded. two and you are thrown out of the game.

besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period , the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one ,
until the end of the period. the victim gets two shots if he she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.

this works well for several reasons. first , penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey , right \? so , it follows that the more the better.
next , when the player is setting up for a penalty shot , the network can
take a commercial. finally , with only three penalties , the network
announcers (don meredith , dick vitale , john madden , pat summerall , and
marv levy , among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the pa announcer says it.

oh , one other rule. when a goal is scored (10 20 times a period) , the play
cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it. this way , the network
can sneak in a few more commercials. then , once the pa announcer has told
them who scored , the tv announcer can tell you the viewer , and even have a
chance of pronouncing his name right.

seriously , though , i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week ,
for the first time in my life. i was amazed how boring it was. the play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free throw shooting
contests during the period ! . of course the 'laker girls' get to do their
routines at least 6 8 times during the game , and not just between periods
either. there is a whistle every 30 seconds on average , maybe less. the
game is 48 minutes , with 2 minutes between quarters 1 2 and 3 4 and a
10 minute halftime , and it still takes over 2 hours.

the reason for this has to be tv. there is plenty of room to throw in
commercials , and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.
on tv , basketball is fairly entertaining , imho. but , it is better to watch
it on tv than to be there. if this is the road the nhl is following , then
it truly is a sad day.

enough for now.

you do n't think he is performing under pressure now \? the major
differences between playoff hockey and normal hockey is 1. play

play the same team in a consecutive string of games. is this
what you mean by pressure \? have you even thought about what you
mean by pressure , or are your thoughts , like most of the rest of
this drivel , simply half baked \?

this was 1993mar21.223936.6192@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca , for anybody who
would like to check.

he went on (in another article) to say paraphrased

playoff hockey is just an expression used by announcers to convince
simple minded folks like yourself that what you are seeing is a better
product than a regular season game.

now , however , in article 1993apr12.013939.23016@ramsey.cs.laurentian.ca
(roger maynard) writes

with a 4 2 win over a tough whaler squad the leafs showed all doubters
what playoff hockey is all about.


so , roger , what exactly is playoff hockey all about \? or is it a convenient
phrase to use in certain circumstances only \?

you see , when you spout off with flame bait too many times , sooner or later
it catches up with you....

nice try deepak , but tough whaler squad should have clued you in to the
fact that my leaf woofing was tongue in cheek.

if playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is , some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season. but that is
only for some of the players. many of the rest , who have been playing with
injuries , who miss their families , or who , like grant fuhr , would really
rather be playing golf , do n't really give a damn. of course i ca n't say this
for sure , but i believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and i
do n't think that hockey players are above having what i consider typically
human attitudes.

with the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing
money by participating in the playoffs. the ones who regard the playoff
take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs. now i know some of you are
going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all. while they may love to play the
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose , which is , to make
a decent living.

of course , the coach is a professional as well , and part of what he is
being paid to do is motivate the players. so , if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.

the second season , is after all , merely an exhibition. the true champions
of the league are the division winners , the teams that come out on top
after the long struggle of the season. the stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot . the
emphasis on the playoffs , with their sudden death appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind. even if pittsburgh
loses the playoffs , we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year. they proved it.

cordially , as always ,

ok , here 's the solution to your problem. move to canada. yesterday i was able

buff bos at 7 00 (tsn and fox) , and mon que at 7 30 (cbc). i think that if
each series goes its max i could be watching hockey playoffs for 40 some odd
consecutive nights (i have n't counted so that 's a pure guess).

the worst thing is that this is exactly what i did last year. i had the rangers
on msg , and the two different games on scny and sca on at the same time. yes ,
i 'd rather have sc cover it , just for the amount of coverage.


btw , those abc commentaters were great ! i was quite impressed they seemed
to know that their audience was n't likely to be well schooled in hockey lore
and they did an excellent job. they were quite impartial also , imo.

i think thorne earns his money. the best part is that he is the same way when
he is earning his from sportschannel as the devils announcer (i.e. ,
unbiased). he goes orgasmic for goals , despite which team scores , and even more
excited (if possible) for great saves. he did a good job of explaining certain
things to non hockey types without offending those of us who follow the sport

bradley center in milwaukee is home to the milwaukee admirals minor leauge
hockey team. the owner of the admirals (sorry , i ca n't remember his name)
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
bradley center.

lloyd pettit married into allen bradley corp. (ab.com) family and owns the
admirals. he donated the bradley center and the new pettit national ice
center.

supposedly he was approached by the nhl about an expansion franchise , but
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of 50 million was too
high.

this is not the way i have heard it. see , lloyd (as he is affectionately
referred to by milwaukeeans and bob uecker) bought the bradley center to get
the nhl to come here.

like i said , i do n't know whether this story is true or just a rumor , but if
it 's true , do n't look for an nhl team in milwaukee anytime soon. the admirals
are n't going to be forced out of the building and you wo n't see an nhl club
and a minor league club in the same building , especially since the nba 's
milwaukee bucks play there as well.

no team will ever win squat with the likes of denis savard in their lineup.


they could tell savard to stay home and watch the games on tv.

if life were so simple ! savard has not played in three of the last
four games and they are still playing like crap. montreal 's problems
run deeper than savard (and mouton) unfortunately i hope they can
get their act together before the playoffs.

the line up in their game coming up against pittsburgh is said to be

thinking of changing to an aluminum shaft so when i break the blade all i
have to do is change it. the problem is that there is such a wide reange of
models and selections out there that i'm not certain which to consider. can
any of you post some of your suggestions and experiences with the aluminum
sticks \? what is the difference between models \? what do you like dislike about
them \? and , which brands are best \?



i 've had , and still have a few aluminum sticks. i got my first when i was 15
(a christian) , and broke the shaft halfway through the season , two years
later. i bought another (a canadian) at the beginning of the next season ,
and i still have it. i also have an easton , that a friend was getting rid
off , after giving up the game. i find that easton blades are easier to get ,
but all brands of blades are pretty well interchangeable. watch out for
dried up bits of firewood , that some stores pass off as blades. in my
experiences , the blades of an aluminum break more often than regular sticks ,
but i 've only ever broken one aluminum shaft.

i like aluminum sticks. the blades are quickly changed , even on the bench
if you have to. on the downside , the shaft wo n't break if you decide to
impale yourself on it )

we 're getting the sabres bruins as the replacement game (and probably
so are you) while the devils penguins game is played on scny and the
islanders caps are the overflow game on the sca (scny plus). if the
sabres bruins ends early then we 'll go to the devils penguins game
(assuming that espn follows their previous patterns we got the last

gerald , murray was n't responsible for primeau (although i'm not
ready to admit that 's a horrible pick). they hired him after the
draft (which has never made sense to me). his first pick was
lapointe.


i do n't think primeau is necessarily a bad pick...i'm was just trying
to locate the beginning of murray 's decisions...he slowness in trading
carson has delayed primeau 's development...and you have to wait longer
for big players often...and primeau can be a very good player without
being a point a game player , especially on a team that has yzerman and
fedorov...if primeau becomes joel otto , and gets 20 goals a season ,
and plays mean...it will have been an extremely good pick.

implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne
on the ice can be blamed on him...roger , he is a forward. winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway. let 's put it another way. john cullen 's
is terrible. what 's your excuse for him \? that his powerplay points do n't
count \? neither do selanne 's...

are you comparing cullen to salami \? i would say that that is valid. if
winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does salami
stand around the other team 's blueline when the puck is in his own end \?

the object of the game is not to feed selanne it is
to win. and feeding selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way
to winning.

knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.

excuse me \? are the jets playing .500 hockey \? let me check...yes but just
barely. they have allowed more goals than they have scored. sounds an
awful lot like salami 's to me. sounds like they would be just as well
off or better if he played the solid two way game that our friends in
finland claim he is capable of. but if he did that he would n't be chal
lenging for the league lead in goals would he \? the bi planes might be
challenging for first however...

you 're worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team \?

now let 's see...you have compared timo to anderson and cullen. who 's
next \? mike foligno \?

we don't know what selanne does best. we do know what jet 's management
wants. and again , the object of the exercise is not to allow selanne to
do what he does best , it is to win hockey games.

what he does best is score...so i refer you to my comment above.

some of our finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid two way game. i would have to say that this style
of contribution would be more conducive to winning. or do n't you
think so \?

as it is now , selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck. did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal \? you would think the
messiah had returned...

nope , did n't see it. i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after
his goal....

i do n't believe it ! you did compare him to foligno ! (and i honestly had n't
read this far).

it would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking. your
contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you were n't
trying to be merely argumentative.

by dave luecking of the post dispatch staff

at 9 11 thursday night , the scoreboard watchers at the arena began to cheer.
their cheer quickly turned into a roar , and finally , the sellout crowd of
17 , 816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 oakland avenue in a salute to
the playoff bound blues.

the scoreboard had just flashed the news from detroit red wings 5 , stars 3.
with the north stars' loss , the blues officially clinched fourth place and the
final playoff spot in the norris division. good thing , because the blues quit
playing.

they held a 5 1 lead over tampa bay when the detroit minnesota final appeared
with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. they promptly went to sleep
and barely held on for a 6 5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.
tampa 's bob beers tipped in a pass from shawn chambers , but officiating
supervisor john d'amico and video goal judge rich schweigler ruled that the
shot had gone into the net after time had expired.

``i'm glad i did n't see it go in at the end , blues coach bob berry said.

if the goal had counted , he 'd have been more upset than he was by the blues'
disappearance in the final 24 minutes. holding on for the victory and making
the playoffs tempered berry 's anger.

``it was n't pretty at the end , he said. ``we played 36 , 37 great minutes , as
good as we played all year. it slipped away at the end. it should n't have , but
it did.

still , the blues won , prompting another ovation from the crowd at game 's end.
despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this
season , the blues still made the playoffs. they 'll meet the chicago blackhawks
in a best of seven norris division semifinal , beginning at noon sunday at
chicago stadium.

the blues finished the regular season with a record of 37 36 11 for 85 points ,
their fourth consecutive plus .500 season. minnesota finished three points
behind in fifth place , with a record of 36 38 10 for 82 points. tampa bay ,
which played spoiler last week by tying the blues 2 2 at tampa , ended its
first season with a record of 23 54 7 for 53 points.

the poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous
blues locker room. instead , the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.

``it 's a shame we let down , said kevin miller , one of three blues to score
two goals. brendan shanahan and bob bassen were the others.
``there was no need for a letdown. if we 'd have kept working , it would have
ended 6 2 and everyone would be happy.

instead , a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.
``we won , and that 's all that matters , said brett hull , scoreless and minus 3
for the night. ``once we got up 4 0 , it was really tough to play.

some players did n't have a problem.

``just because the score was announced , our line did n't quit , said rich
sutter , who played with bassen and miller. ``we still had a game to play. you
ca n't allow five goals like we did , that 's not right.

``it was disappointing to see what was going on.

bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the blues' effort. somehow ,
he missed the announcement of minnesota 's loss.

``i did n't know it was final , he said. ``i was kind of looking around on the
bench. i did n't realize it was a final for some reason. we 're in the playoffs ,
and that 's great , but it 's a little disappointing to play like we did at the
end.

the letdown was precisely the reason that berry had instructed the scoreboard
operators to keep the minnesota detroit score off of the board. the score
showed 0 0 until it first popped up with detroit leading 4 2 in the third
period. the blues already led 4 0 at the time.

``i told them i did n't want to see the score , i did n't want to know the score ,
berry said. ``i felt we had to win the game , and that 's the approach we took.

if minnesota took a lead , berry feared , the pressure of having to win might
bother the blues. if detroit led , he worried , the blues might quit.

until the announcement , the blues played splendidly. shanahan got the crowd
going at 10 44 of the first period , scoring his 50th of the season. then ,
miller and bassen took charge late in the period.

with the teams playing four on four , miller broke in on left wing , deked
defenseman roman hamrlik and beat former blues goalie pat jablonski with the
rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.

then , just 10.5 seconds later , bassen rifled a long slap shot past jablonski
after defenseman rick zombo intercepted a tampa pass in the neutral zone.

bassen made it 4 0 just 14 seconds into the second period , scoring on the
rebound of bret hedican 's shot. the goal gave him his first two goal game of
the season and reminded him of a special friend.

last year , bassen befriended young oliver mulvihill , who died of a rare form
of cancer at age 6 on feb. 23.

``i was thinking of my buddy oliver , bassen said. ``he 's in heaven now , and
i know he was watching. i know he 's happy.

miller increased the blues lead to 5 0 on a break away goal set up by zombo
at 11 09. then , steve maltais broke curtis joseph 's shutout just 18 seconds
later , making it 5 1.

less than a minute after the north stars' final was announced , tim bergland
scored and cut the lead to 5 2. but shanahan scored his 51st , converting a pass
from nelson emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the second period.

then , it was all lightning. adam creighton scored 40 seconds into the third
period , prompting berry to rest the overworked joseph. guy hebert allowed goals
to shawn chambers and danton cole in a span of 1 21 midway through the third
period.

the goals by chambers and cole made shanahan 's second goal stand up as the
winner. ``we were in there , shanahan said. ``the game was over. we were in.

roland dreier dreier@math.berkeley.edu


sorry to disappoint you but the red wings earned the victory...easily.

i watched most of the game on espn (as soon as i realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).
the maple leafs were flat. very flat. meanwhile , the red wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game. i did n't
detect any bad penalty calls (van hellemond did his usual good job).
toronto looked like how i expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years nervous.

for the leafs sake , i hope they can rid themselves of the butterflies
for game 2. if game 1 is indicative of the series , it 's gonna go

i can only comment on the kings , but the most obvious candidate for pleasant
surprise is alex zhitnik. he came highly touted as a defensive defenseman , but
he 's clearly much more than that. great skater and hard shot (though wish he
were more accurate). in fact , he pretty much allowed the kings to trade away
that huge defensive liability paul coffey. kelly hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. but , at best , he 's
only a mediocre goaltender. a better choice would be tomas sandstrom , though
not through any fault of his own , but because some thugs in toronto decided
to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. other than that , the
award goes to robert lang , an uninspiring czech. robitaille could easily be
mvp , but i 'd prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league 's premier defensemen , and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the
rest of our young defense , it could one day mean that we 'll let in fewer
goals than hartford. honorable mentions to majestic marty and warren rychel.

this series is one of the best first round matchups , could go either way.

by baseball (and moved to another station) or not. you can try those
if the local baseball teams are n't playing at the same time , anyway.

the jets use the breakaway pass scheme to create a scoring sensation
in order to generate interest. if teams score as many or more goals
against winnipeg when selanne is on the ice as winnipeg scores when
he is on the ice then i ca n't see how his contribution can be described
as impressive.

implicitly you are assuming that goals scored against winnipeg with selanne
on the ice can be blamed on him...roger , he is a forward. winnipeg has a
lousy defensive record anyway. let 's put it another way. john cullen 's
is terrible. what 's your excuse for him \? that his powerplay points do n't
count \? neither do selanne 's...

the object of the game is not to feed selanne it is
to win. and feeding selanne does not contribute in any meaningful way
to winning.

knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to
winning.

pat burns would n't have a goal suck like this on his team.

you 're worried about teemu when you have glenn anderson on your team \?

we don't know what selanne does best. we do know what jet 's management
wants. and again , the object of the exercise is not to allow selanne to
do what he does best , it is to win hockey games.

what he does best is score...so i refer you to my comment above.

as it is now , selanne
is a grandstanding goal suck. did you see the way he parades around
with his arms outstretched after scoring a goal \? you would think the
messiah had returned...

nope , did n't see it. i was too busy watching foligno jump up and down after
his goal....

compared to kurri , selanne 's points are too high , lets make it 25 or 26.


well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of
markus ketterer (the goalie) , 3 4 or the players listed above and luck. there 's
presumably a lot of decent players in finland that would n't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players , however. my guess would be
that the finnish canada cup team would be a .500 team in the nhl.

wow , now , it looks like you do n't like our players \? what about guys like
nieminen , jutila , riihijarvi , varvio , laukkanen , makela , keskinen and (even
if he is aging) ruotsalainen \? the main difference between finnish and north
american players is , that our players tend to be better in the larger rink.
the canadian defenders are usually slower that defenders in europe.
and i think that there was more in our success than ketterer and luck (though
they helped). i think that the main reason was , that the team worked well
together.

it is a long standing good luck redwing 's tradition to throw an octopus

at the olympia when the wings became the 1st team (i think) to sweep
the cup in 8 games. a lot hardet to throw one from joe louis seats

funniest i ever saw was when some tiger fans threw one on the field

in article rauser.734062608@sfu.ca rauser@fraser.sfu.ca (richard john rauser) writes

here 's the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let 's say , the
red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like bure konstantinov and
borshevshky . is this north america or is n't it \? toronto , detriot , quebec ,
and edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of euros on other
teams is getting worse as well.

gee , you 'd think winnipeg would be tops on that list , what with 8 regulars
being european.



i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure , the
russian rocket i will completely throw up. as it is now , every time i see
the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way , i'm not a
canucks fan to begin with ).

well , being a jet fan , i sometimes wish that bure would get knocked silly
too. (nothing serious , just enough to keep him out of a game. )



okay , the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that
i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and
some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their
north american league and instead gives it to europeans , who are n't even
better hockey players. it 's all hype. this european mystique is sickening ,
but until nhl owners get over it , canadian and american players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

in most cases , the owners have very little to do with it. they give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best
players so that our team will win the stanley cup. whether that player is
in kindersley , saskatchewan or chelyabinsk , russia , if the gm believes him
to be the better player , the gm should be drafting him.

where do you get off calling the nhl their league , when referring to canadian
players. it does n't belong to them , it belongs to the owners. the owners
can do what they want. while a 'canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in canada , there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us
that the cfl (sorry for the football reference) did n't even try to push their
import ratio rule on the sacromento goldminers.

increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions , in most cases , would
make players better anyways. (oh yeah , and how many europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in north america \? while there are some
that play in the ahl , or the ihl where that 's an nhl team 's primary farm
club , you do n't hear of many europeans playing in the chl , the echl , or on
the secondary farm teams in the ihl. (ie. the jets do have a few russian
players in moncton , but i do n't believe there are any europeans in ft. wayne.))
so with all those teams , there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in north america.


with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating , the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league , and let the bures
and selannes of the world play on their own continent.

i just do n't want them on mine.

i'm in favour of the nhl being the league for the premier players in the
world. i 've grown up with europeans playing on 'my' team , and some of those
players were the among the best in the world. from hedberg , nilsson , and
sjoberg , to sel nne , zhamnov , and olausson , and all those in between and to
come , i would n't have it any other way.

i do n't understand why so many people are predicting an upset against
pittsburgh. the team has won 12 in a row coming into the playoffs.
they 've won practically every game that they 've really wanted to win
all year (including critical victories against the caps and one
against a hot bruins team at the gaahden ). the team is probably at
its peak (stronger than the previous 2 stanley cup winners). i mean , i
know they can lose but it would be a large upset. i personally
think teams are going to be hard pressed to win 1 or 2 games in any
series against the pens (and i'm not a pittsburgh fan).


i have to agree here. as i heard on tsn tonight , you want to pick
someone else , but you just do n't see how you can . and i'm a bruins
fan. maybe this year will be different , but it does n't look good.

bill ranford stopped 36 shots to lead canada to a 4 1 victory in a very well
played game.

the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and
rundqvist came in alone on ranford but could n't put the puck over a sliding
ranford. later on , kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom
played very well too. stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up
jan larsson but again ranford came up big. period ended scoreless but the edge
to sweden in creating more opportunities.
second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save. mark recchi
made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros , eric one timed the puck but
soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. at the 7 minute mark , canada
started applying pressure on the swedes. sanderson dineen brind'amour worked
hard and kept the puck in the swedes' zone. dineen gave the puck to sanderson
who skated around a screened swedish defenseman , came in on soderstrom and
made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom 's far post , 1 0 canada.
the swedes picked up their game after that , and peter forsberg had a shot
that hit ranford 's post (the inside) , went parallel to the goal line and out.
then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play. jan larsson took
a shot from the slot , ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by
the far post , passed the puck and ranford was beat , 1 1.
third period started as the other periods , swedes having most of the pressure
but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal.
at 5 54 , canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to
cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it.
that resulted in a penalty shot , since a defenseman ca n't cover the puck in
the goal crease. geoff sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever , he
explained afterwards) , and he put it low on soderstrom 's stick side , close
to the post. excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal.
canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside , gartner volleyed a
bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it 3 1. the swedes ran out of gas
then and could n't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2 , 5 periods.
the 4 1 goal came with only 1 second left , rod brind'amour scoring on a
rebound from soderstrom , where the swedish defense already had their minds
in the dressing room.

a very good game (the best in the wc so far \? ) , with both goalies playing
great. soderstrom best player in sweden , but ranford even played better
than soderstrom , that tells you something about ranford. probably the best
goalie in the world , were some comments after the game.
canada played a very disciplined defense , ranford pointed out that it is
easy to play well with a good defense. lindros played a lot and played well ,
sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.

the forsberg naslund bergqvist line sweden 's best along with larsson juhlin
nilsson. swedish defense played well , 197 cm 104 kg peter popovic had the
task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg eric lindros , and managed this very well.
ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc , and considering
that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game , he played very
well. swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game , partly because
of the swedes inability to score , and partly because of the linesman 's mistake
on the 1 3 goal.

surprises , and biggest disappointments this year. now , these are just
my observations and are admittedly lacking because i have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount. anyway....

team mvp surprise disappointment

edmonton oilers manson buchberger mellanby

well , since the oilers did n't win a heck of a lot of games , i'm not sure
they deserve and mvp ( ca n't win without him ). however , i 'd suggest kelly
buchberger instead of dave manson , who has had a brutal year , his pick for
the all star game notwithstanding.

as for biggest surprise , i 'd say that buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his breakthrough year (for him) last year , so he did n't
really raise his game. my suggestion would be shjon podein , one of the
callups from cape breton during the year. he was quite far down on the
depth chart in the oilers stable of prospects , but made a big impact on
the team. he has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only 1. those are decent
numbers for a third line player who was seemingly doomed to minor league
oblivion. the oilers coaching staff likens his style to john tonelli.
i think he 'll be on the full time roster next year.

as for biggest disappointment , you could name any of the players the oilers
dumped for lousy production this year (nicholls , gilchrist , tikkanen) or
even shayne corson , but mellanby is n't far off.

sheppard , ysebaert , howe , coffey , and riendeau (plus some depth players)
without giving up anything the wings needed or any of his top prospects.
all of this in three years. has anyone done better \?

the year before he took over , the wings did n't even make the playoffs.
there was about a year and a half during demers' stint that the wings
did ok , but that was due to demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style. they did n't have much talent.

gerald , murray was n't responsible for primeau (although i'm not
ready to admit that 's a horrible pick). they hired him after the
draft (which has never made sense to me). his first pick was
lapointe.

suprise disappointment

los angeles kings robitaille donnelly hrudey


i would have chosen alex zhitnik for biggest suprise. they
did expect that he would become a great defenseman , but i do n't
think anyone knew that he was going to be this impressive in his
rookie year. his speed , skating ability , and puck control is
exceptional he is the one to watch on the kings.


i agree , with marty mcsorely and warren rychel running a close second and
third. i am surprised more people have not noted knickle as the biggest
surprise , even though i personally do not really rate him well. the biggest
disappointment has to be carson. though this is really unfair , since too much
was expected of him. the second biggest disappointment is melrose , with his

when talking about hockey broadcasters , let 's give a moment of silence to
remember the st. louis blues' great , dan kelly. (many of you may have heard
him in the late 60s and early 70s on cbs.) he used to do hockey night in
canada intermissions , with another recently deceased great , danny gallivan
of the canadiens.


i loved dan kelly ! he was on usa when i first got hooked on hockey back
in 1980 or so. no , he was n't always spot on top of the play , and he
was n't overly cute , but those pipes ! that lusty , barrel chested , voice !
no pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know ! )

i rode into hockey mania on the coattails of gretzky and the boys on the
bus. my first finals saw the islanders sweep them. but i 'll never
forget the night , a year later , when the oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium , the smoke from a million sparklers , the long empty net
goal near the end , and dan kelly letting the crowd 's reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds , then that voice barking through the din
dave lumley ... sews it up for edmonton ! it sounds stupid , but that
early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill. since then
i 've grown a lot more jaded about the game , but i was really saddened
by dan kelly 's passing. he was one of the good guys.

the keenan hiring is precipitated by the loss of an anticipated 5m

paramount chief stan jaffe 's chip against the flyers over l'affaire
lindros last autumn. add to this that neilsen might return as an

conferred with jaffe on the hiring. this hiring by jaffe went over
the head of msg , inc. (par. subsidiary) head bob gutkowski and over
the head and the protests of pres. gm neil smith.

msg is making the announcement on saturday to get back at the
islanders for making the playoffs (i.e. , steal the press).

in 115873@bu.edu jason gibson writes

i can live with the other changes that have been made (e.g. the playoff format
change) , but the change to the division and conference names really annoys me.
batman was on tsn last night saying that changing the names would make the
game easier for the occasional fan to follow . he should have said what he
meant that changing the names will make the game easier for americans in
non hockey cities to follow. i do n't know of too many of my friends who had
a hard time following which teams were in each division. even a minimal amount
of exposure to the game allows a person to quickly pick up on this.

there is nothing wrong with making the game easier for americans to
follow. the more fans the merrier and even if you dislike the occasional
fan there is always the chance that these fans will become fanatics.

i am glad that the names are being changed for another reason. the names
patrick , smythe , norris , adams and campbell are all the names of so called
builders of the game. this is the same type of thinking that put stein
in the hall of fame. this is absolute nonsense. the real builders of the
game are richard , morenz , howe , conacher , orr , etc. if you are going to
name the divisions after people at least name the divisions after people
who deserve it.

i think that you are incorrect , roger. patrick ,
smythe and adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types. hence , they did help build the league , although
they were not great players themselves.

i agree that a name is a name is a name , and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans ,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea. if we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated , then let 's do so. once we have them , they will realize
what a great game hockey is , and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.

the history of the names can be put rather succinctly. all of the aforemen
tioned used the game of hockey to make money. can you imagine a pocklington
division \? a ballard division \? or how about a green division \?

no , i would not want to see a ballard division. but to say
that these owners are assholes , hence all nhl management people are
assholes would be fallacious. conn smythe , for example , was a classy
individual (from what i have heard).

also , is n't the point of professional hockey to make money
for all those involved , which would include the players. what i think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due , and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice , so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).

the detroit red wings put a lot of doubter on ice tonight with a 6 3

power of the mighty red wing offense. toronto 's defense in no match for the
wing offense. as for the defense , probert , kennedey and primeau came out
hitting hard. toronto players were being thrown left and right. not even
wendell clark was tough enough for the wings tough guys. the wings only gave
up three goals , a low total for what they say is a mediocre defense.
all you leaf fans better speak up now. you team will probable have its

there 's quite a few wings fans lurking about here , they just tend

however , that aside , the real question is whether you like the idea of
changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for
the 'casual fan') , or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
based on individuals who do deserve the honour. imo , the latter is a nice
and unique touch that differs from other sports. in addition , i do not
think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
people that are interested in hockey , so it 's a pointless exercise anyway.

there are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans. i feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages. and of course , they would not appear
nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.
another thing that bothers me is the points system. percentages , as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative. when i look at the
nhl standings the first thing i have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand (which is almost always the case). some will
object to percentages , claiming perhaps , that it is an americanization
of the sport but i feel that using percentages is more informative and
whether it is american or not is irrelevant.

if the current names are inappropriate , then that is a separate issue , not
central to the original article. something to consider additionally is
whether or not players like orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
would have been able to do so without an organized professional league to
play in. in this case , honouring builders of the league as opposed to
builders of the sport becomes a chicken and egg type question. (although
it was the chicken.....)

even if orr could n't have contributed without the likes of norris , you would
have to agree that norris could n't have contributed without the likes of orr.
and taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made
the more meaningful contribution.

exactly true. naming divisions and trophies after smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put stein in the hall of fame. i have
always thought that this was nonsense.

dunno if the stein comparison is justifiable , since it does n't look as though
his 'unanimous acceptance' to the hall will hold up.

it does n't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it \?

i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they
face them in the finals (which is what all the detroit sportswriters
are predicting). although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm
i have ever seen in hockey

how do you figure that \? \? when bryan murray took over the wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the stanley cup but looked
unlikely to win it. now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the stanley cup but looks unlikely to win it. a truly great gm would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the nhl and maybe win the stanley cup. a good gm (like murray) can
maintain the team 's success but ca n't push them to the next level.

in the history of hockey there have been several better gm 's than murray
way too many to name. murray is n't even the best gm in the league today.
he fails in comparison to sinden , sather , savard , caron , fletcher and
quinn in my estimation.

i ca n't imagine how bryan murray can be the best gm anyone has ever seen
in hockey unless they have seen very few gm 's.

ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second year pros.

game , an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.

q who was the first woman to play in an nhl game \?
a manon rheaume , a 20 year old goaltender , became the first woman ever

i fear that within the next decade or so the only professional sports team
left in pittsburgh will be the steelers.

perish the thought...but you know , you may be right , at least as far
as major league professional sports teams go. they all seem to be
becoming big money games , much more so than at any previous time. to
think that if i am ever able to move back home several years from now ,
all that may be there is an ahl team , at best...sigh.

the interesting thing is that the nhl is also expanding , at the same
time as it is dramatically increasing the amount of money needed to
operate a team. this would seem to indicate that there 's a big
shake out about to occur in the next few years , unless player salaries
can somehow be brought under control. frankly , i do n't see how the
nhl 's current drive for expansion is supportable under its current
operating conditions. if revenue sharing and a salary cap do n't come
into the nhl soon , look out.

jagr has a higher , but francis has had more points. and take it from
an informed observer , ronnie francis has had a much better season than
jaromir jagr. this is not to take anything away from jaro , who had a
decent year (although it did n't live up to the expectations of some).

bowman tended to overplay francis at times because he is a bowman style
player. he plays hard at all times , does n't disregard his defensive
responsibilities and is a good leader. bowman rewarded him be increasing his
ice time.

jagr can be very arrogant and juvenile and display a me first attitude.
this rubbed bowman the wrong way and caused him to lose some ice time.

throughout the year , francis consistently recieved more ice time than
jagr. althouhg i have never seen stats on this subject , i am pretty
sure that jagr had more points per minute played that francis. when
you add to that jagr 's better rating , i think it becomes evident
that jagr had a better season not that francis had a bad one.

i still am surprised that no one has tried giving away the goodies at the end
of the game. the two problems with that , of course , are that you would want
to make sure the first people in the building would be assured of getting
them (probably redeemable vouchers) , and that the building managers want to
avoid at all costs delaying people as they leave the building , if , for
instance , the goodies are given to people as they exit.

i went to the new jersey devils carvel ice cream puck night (tm) last year to
see the beloved bruins play. the pucks were given out at the end of the game.
i could just imagine what would have happened late in the third if the bruins
were winning....

it figures , after i posted the first article , i found out that the whalers are
going to be using coupons for the the giveaway on friday night. i believe that
is is the some big corporation (probably a bank) flying disk night. i think
that we could all see the potential for danger here...

all in all , i have seen a whole bunch of giveaways land on the ice , and it
never ceases to amuse me. i'm just thankful for the players that no one has
yet to sponsor 'lead pipe night' at any arenas...

that 's probably because they could n't find anyone to sponser it... maybe uss
could sponser the pittsburgh penguins us steel steel rod night close enough \?

naah , it 'd probably bounce off of jay caufield.

i was at a cincinnati cyclones game a year ago when the local country
station sponsored a kazoo giveaway. after a particularly bad call by the
underexperienced echl ref , it was kazoostorm time down on the ice. i
thought this was a pathetic display by the fans , but they were rightfully
unhappy.

good for you. you 'd only be displaying your ignorance of
course , but to each his own...

roger , i'm not sure here , but i think ignorance is really a
function of a lack of knowledge and not formulating an
opinion ...but hey , if you need to take a cheap shot , then by
all means go ahead...that 's if it makes you feel better.

to knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.
your hockey education is not my responsibility.

my hockey education \? what the f are you talking about \? i'm
not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement.

my word , such vehemence against poor ol' bob gainey. why does
he bother you so much...he was an effective player for his
style of play.

he was just another player. to laud him as anything more i find
bothersome. i hated the habs. i hated lafleur until i realized
that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to
ever skate in my lifetime. why would anyone talk about gainey \?

i hate the habs \? ...you sound like a 10 year old. this
statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to
argue objectively about hockey. do n't give me this crap about
cogent arguments ...i 've yet to read something of yours that is
cogent. you consistently argue with (1) emotion (2) huge ,
sweeping statements

frankly , you have a very unconvincing style.

i'm not defending bob gainey...frankly , i do n't care for him all
that much. but your dismissal of him as something less than an
effective hockey player is tiresome...it has no basis in
anything. how many calders did he win \? i think it was four (go
ahead and refresh my memory). what about the conn smythe \? was
that a fluke \? yeah , not the makings of a hockey superstar , i
know , but try to have a reason , any reason , to shoot him down.

go around. who would you rather have as your checking
centre \? doug gilmour or doug jarvis \? for that matter i would
take either gretzky or mario as my checking centres. do you
think gretzky could cover bob gainey \?

i'm really sorry roger , but you have lost me completely here.
why do n't you ask me if i would rather have jesus christ ,
himself , in nets \?

did he play hockey at a high level \? was he any good \? if not ,
why would you bother to bring jc up \? i am talking about hockey
players here. if you ca n't follow the conversation do n't follow
up. as i said previously , it is not my responsibility to
educate you.

hey cowboy ! you 're the expert who introduced the idiotic
comparison of gainey with gretzky and lemieux...you figure it
out.

now , if you were to compare , say for example , bob gainey with
guy carbonneau , you would have a balanced comparison.

sure. two journeymen. big deal. neither one of them is worth
discussing.

how many individual awards between them \? eight...i do n't remember
(once again , please feel free to refresh my memory...and try to
be as sarcastic as possible about my hockey education ).

i'm wrong again...hmmm , let 's see...where was i wrong in the

i would take fuhr and sanderson off of the latter.

oh my god ! ! ! did i say that \? roger...what 's your point \? fuhr
is a goaltender , goaltender 's do n't plug ...in his prime , he was
one of the best. sanderson was a scrapper...if you stick him on
you may as well include half the flyers team of the same era.

first place \? i'm only guessing here , rog , but i have a feeling
that you 've setup a you 're wrong again macro key on your
machine.

that is an excellent idea and if i decide to waste any more time
responding to any of your , or greg 's , postings then i will be
sure to implement that very macro.

oh roger , you should n't...really. i do n't deserve this...you are
far too accomodating already.

i would suggest that your comment and when the press runs out
of things to say about the stars on dynasties they start to
hype the pluggers. grant fuhr , essa tikkannen , butch goring ,
bob nystrom , bob gainey , doug jarvis , derek sanderson , wayne
cashman , bob baun , bob pulford , ralph backstrom , henri richard ,
dick duff...and so on... demonstrates a blanket disregard for
these individuals as contributors to the game...so yes , settle
down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.

tarasov claimed that gainey was a hockey god. and greg ate
it up. and that is what this thread is all about. if you did n't
know that then why are you responding \?

you seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into
your sweeping , vacuous statement...that 's why. if you want to
debate gainey , go ahead...but why bring up everybody else \? how
does it support your argument \? do you have an argument , or do
you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us \?


and as for blanket disregard for these individuals , i can
remember leaf teams , purely populated by such individuals ,
winning four stanley cups. teams. no one ran around telling
us that george armstrong was the best hockey player in the
world.

great. i could n't agree more. the flyers won two cups for the
same reasons...deservedly so. so what \? i do n't get it. are you
angry that the leafs did n't get more recognition \?

you seem to think these pluggers are hyped ...i do n't
agree...plain and simple. if you 're last statement is some sort
of compromise , fair enough.

you might consider developing your own style. after all ,
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and i am quite
sure that flattery is not your intention.

c'mon...it has a nice ring to it...and admit it , you had a good
laugh.

right. i had to get to the end of your posting before i
realized you were a complete joke.

not a pleasant bone in your body , eh rog \? why are you so
unhappy \? not getting invited to enough parties \? what \?

in the future , if you are going to respond to my postings i
would appreciate it if you could present a cogent argument
supported by facts gleaned from a version of reality that most
of the rest of us would recognize.

roger , why are you under the impression that responding to your
posts is some great honour \? you really should stop...it sounds
a little bit pathetic. frankly , it 's about as honourable as a
good fart.

congenially , as always ,

play by play for the local team , the trail smokeaters , who by the way , were
the last canadian team to win the world championship (back in 1961). i was
on skates almost as soon as i could walk , and have been playing recreational
hockey for about 35 years.

when was the last time you saw a hockey league in the inner city.
the insurance alone is a big enough barrier.

the inner city is n't the only place that is poor.
i think the biggest barrier to hockey in the inner city is... no ice to play on.


lack of ice is a big factor , but costs is a bigger factor. both my kids play for
the santa clara valley hockey association and this season , which just ended ,
cost me 75 per kid for membership in hockey usa , plus 750 per kid for club
dues. the hockey usa fees cover excess medical insurance , and the club dues
cover ice time , officials , trophies , etc. other areas have similar fees , unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs , as stockton does.

by the way most ice arenas are located in what could be called the inner city
areas. eastridge and vallco are exceptions ... redwood city 's rink is in an
industrial area on bay rd , near 101 , berkeley 's is near ashby and martin luther
king , stockton 's is in oak park , sacramento 's is in an older section of downtown
(i forget the name of the street) , fresno 's is out on the edge of town , just west
of 99. santa rosa 's is a nice rink , but it 's in an older section of town.
dublin 's is outside of town , off 580. most of the rinks are old , and expensive
to run , with huge electric bills and insurance premiums. if you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around 100 per hour at any of these rinks. some of them
give you a 60 minute hour for your money others give you a 50 minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee.

way back in the early years ( 50 's) it took 8 wins to garner the stanley cup.
soooooo , a couple of local fish mongers (local to the joe louis arena , that is)
started the tradition of throwing an octopi onto the ice with every win. after
each victory , one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the
ice. (they are dead by the way.) it was a brilliant marketing strategy to
shore up the demand for one of their least popular products.

i have been to all 3 isles caps tilts at the crap centre this year , all isles
wins and there is no justification for vukota and pilon to play for the isles.
vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world ! ! he could n't hit a
bull in the ass with a banjo ! ! al must remember a few years back when mick
scored 3 goals in one period against the caps in a 5 3 isles win. i was there
and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. wake up al ! ! ! years later he 's
gotten worse. he 's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting
stupid senseless penalties. i think he would make a good police officier ! ! !

as for pilon , he ca n't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. he either
makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover , or he attempts to bring the puck
towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. he ca n't
stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. he either falls down or
committs a penalty. call up somebody from capital district al ! ! ! ! !

as far as the playoffs , the isles are as difficult to figure out as the caps.
two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. they should meet in the first
round. the isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they
should play well against jersey tonite. it 'll probably be another tight 1 goal
game as the last 20 games hve been for the isles. i wish when the get a lead
they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive
shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. al must understand he
ca n't do with this team what he did with the 80 83 isles. maybe al should got
to. where is bobby nystrom \? \? clark gilles \? \? john tonelli \? \? these are the kind

new york (upi) mike keenan , whose nhl coaching history
has been to wear out his welcome despite an impressive penchant for
winning , has come to the city that embraces victors above all else.

well , i could become a fan ... (

seriously , this news coming since thursday has effectively robbed the
islanders and the devils of any airtime on sports talk shows almost
everywhere that i 've sampled ... in fact , the playoffs almost do n't
exist now. ) ranger fans calling in to wfan or to new york one 's
midnight sports talk were in a mix of fury over this season and near
orgasm over keenan 's hiring. (summarizing keenan is a winner and
will give the broadway bums 'da business' in pursuing the next cup
chase ...)

the chicago blackhawks cut their last tie with keenan when
he was forced out as general manager in november. he had given up
chicago 's coaching duties a year ago and his thirst for the power
of a gm now increases the pressure on beleaguered rangers gm neil
smith.

this will be an interesting combination to watch ... keenan has been
paid enough money to put up and shut up and just be a coach , but his
advice on any player moves will be listened to closely. a lot of big
player moves will happen remember that keenan got rid of denis
savard. the country club days are over ...

``when keenan left chicago i could n't help but think about
him as our coach , '' smith said. ``there was an indication he would
be taken off the market. i feared that and could n't let that happen.''

if paramount had given smith an earlier sign of support and offered
keenan the big money to put up and shut up back in january , the
rangers might not be heading for golf now ...

keenan , 43 , takes on a demoralized team that offers him a
chance to fashion yet another of his reclamation projects at the
highest salary ever commanded by an nhl coach. the rangers owned
by gulf western have bestowed upon keenan an unprecedented 3
million , four year deal ,

``i 've known mike a long time , '' messier said. ``we 've won two
canada cups together. he 's been to the finals three times. maybe we
miss just one more element to win the stanley cup. i do n't think he 's
the same person he was 10 years ago or even five years ago. i think he
has changed and bettered himself with experience.''

one of keenan 's first statements was a reaffirmation that mark messier
will be the team 's captain.

the timing of the move gives the rangers' new coach 2 1 2
months to prepare for the nhl draft (june 26) , and neil smith may
not back off the their trade happy pattern.

by then , smith might have some bargains on keenan 's advice ... like
maybe unloading phil bourque for tie domi ... (

subject too many europeans in nhl
organization simon fraser university , burnaby , b.c. , canada
lines 50



ten years ago , the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 season , the numbers of euros on
nhl teams have escalated to the following stats

canadians 400
americans 100
europeans 100

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun.

here 's the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let 's say , the
red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like bure konstantinov and
borshevshky . is this north america or is n't it \? toronto , detriot , quebec ,
and edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of euros on other
teams is getting worse as well.

i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure , the
russian rocket i will completely throw up. as it is now , every time i see
the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way , i'm not a
canucks fan to begin with ).

okay , the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that
i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and
some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their
north american league and instead gives it to europeans , who are n't even
better hockey players. it 's all hype. this european mystique is sickening ,
but until nhl owners get over it , canadian and american players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating , the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league , and let the bures
and selannes of the world play on their own continent.

i just do n't want them on mine.

washington , april 16 the u.s. court of appeals
for the first circuit in boston has upheld a u.s. district court

gymnastics and volleyball teams to full varsity status. the ruling in
cohen et al. v. brown university is the first appeals court decision
in the nation applying title ix to intercollegiate athletics. trial
lawyers for public justice (tlpj) , is the national public interest
law firm representing the women athletes.
this ruling makes clear what we have said all along if a
school wants to eliminate teams before women have their fair share of
opportunities to participate , they can only eliminiate men 's teams ,
said tlpj executive director arthur bryant , co counsel in the case.
the class action , filed april , 1992 , charged brown with violating
title ix of the education amendments of 1972 , the federal law that
prohibits sex discrimination by all educational institutions
receiving federal funds. brown terminated the two women 's teams as
university funded sports in may 1991 , allowing them to continue to
compete against varsity teams if they could raise their own funds for
uniforms , travel , coaches , and all other expenses. they had also
been denied admission preferences for use in recruiting new members.
this is a major victory for women and the cause of equal rights ,
said tlpj lead counsel lynette labinger of providence 's roney
labinger. universities across america need to reevaluate their
programs quickly. title ix is the law and it 's going to be enforced.
three similar title ix appeals await decision. colorado state
university , indiana university of pennsylvania (iup) , and colgate
university are asking federal appeals courts to overturn court orders
requiring them to reinstate or establish specific women 's varsity
teams. continuing its cutting edge title ix activities , tlpj is

the precedent was set by the wha in their first season. they used a red
puck for exhibition games and a blue one for the regular season.
thankfully , they abandoned it in favour of black before the next season
began.


one reason that the wha abandoned the blue puck was the fact that it
crumbled very quickly during play. the blue dye that was used somehow
affected the vulcanized rubber of the puck , decreasing its cohesiveness.

i think that jack ferreira 's firing eventually led to kingston 's
firing. you mention consistency of vision. i think the
sharks lost that with the loss of ferreira. there has never
been a 3 headed g.m. that has ever worked. you need one
person making the personnel decisions at the top , not
management by committee. the conventional wisdom
from around the league is that ferreira would have
made the moves that would have fielded a better product
on the ice.

how exactly would ferreira accomplished this \? the three headed gm ship has
taken a lot of heat , but nobody 's explained how things would have been any
different had ferreira still been there. would ferreira have made more
trades \? who would have he had traded \? would he have made fewer trades \?
who should not have been traded \?

i think the three headed gm 's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a significant advantage.
at the end of last season , the contracts of several veterans with somewhat
maginal contributions (fenton , bozek , anderson , and a couple others i
ca n't remember) were bought out. the idea was that youngsters could
play almost as well , and had the potential to improve where these
older guys did not.
and they traded mullen , because he wanted to go , not because he
was n't good enough , but i think they were a bit too optimistic
in thinking they could make up for his contributions.
an example from this season , skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept , because of his age. i thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around.

the youth movement has its advantages look at gaudreau who
might still be in kc if more veterans had been kept around. but
you have to find the right balance.

is drafted by jets. raitanen had very good year and he has played in the
finnish nationalteam. i believe that he 'll be one of the best finns in
this year 's wc , if matikainen(head coach) elects him to the team.

i think that nhlpa' 93 is the best video game available now.
of course many things could be done better , but i really appreciate that
the names of players are the real ones , no matter if it lacks some logos...
i am still playing it since november leading different teams to the finals
and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring
yesterday i won the title using toronto against hartford (4 games to two) ,
i played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and
the best scorer and shooter was gilmour (116 shots if i remember well)

picked to win it all

pittsburgh 34 (1 sweep , 14 in 5 , 15 in 6 , 4 in 7)
boston 6 (1 in 5 , 5 in 6)
detroit 4 (3 in 6 , 1 in 7)

(no , this was n't roger)
calgary 1 (in 6)
quebec 1 (in 6)
vancouver 1 (in 7)
washington 1 (in 6)

why the hell has n't anybody picked chicago \? \? \? nobody ! quebec got a pick ,

here are the losers

detroit 20
chicago 16 (so there they are ! )

los angeles \? \? \? \? \? \? \? are you out of your mind \? ! \? ! \? good luck to you ,

so pittsburgh is the consensus winner of the stanley cup. they 'll
statistically beat detroit in 6 games. haha that 's happening ! not ! as
i said , every one of my picks will come true , and i picked chicago to lose
to pittsburgh in the finals , so tough luck to all you who picket detroit.

now what if the two teams were merged (this has been proposed in tampere
with ilves ( lynx) and tappara ( axe). the fans would n't take it !
they rather see their teams out of the playoffs most of the time or even
relegated than merged. it 's not that difficult to understand , it 's just
like here in helsinki. you grow up being either a jokerit or hifk fan.
the other team is the last team in the world you would support. i'm not
talking about 'hate' but about extremely deeply rooted rivalry.

deeply rooted rivalry \? ahem , jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined
the top flight only in the early '70s. helsingfors ifk have been around since
1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so i think
you 're exagerating here.

however , it 's been proved that both fan groups can cheer the same team
that 's the finnish national team . maybe that 's how you could set up a
huge franchise in finland. no one has ever said that the team must be
called after one city or play all its games on one arena. just one team
finland and team sweden in the nhl just would n't make any sense we have
way more talent than 1 24th of the total of north american talent. after a
couple of seasons you would never see the cup going anywhere outside the
nordic (presuming that our teams would have the advantage in drafting
local talent , as prooposed).

that 's a rather bold claim , in the light of how successful the canadian
american olympic teams have been . . . and they 've had to play according to our
set of rules and on international ice. the 1992 olympic teams contained about
as much talent as your average expansion team. canada had eric lindros , sean
burke , joe juneau and chris kontos. another four or five have been deep subs in
the nhl. as for the yanks , keith tkachuk , scott lachance , bret hedican , shawn
mceachern , steve heintze , ted donato , joe sacco and bill guerin have been
3rd 4th line players in the nhl , while robb stauber has done well for the
kings in goal. nothing more. in fact , i'm sure that an all star team assembled
from the best finnish league teams would do no better in the nhl than hartford
or tampa bay currently are doing.

but what happens if all top class finnish swedish players gradually end up
with helsinki stockholm as the north american based ones gradually retire and
no canadian american team is allowed to draft new players from scandinavia \?
here is what the hockey news scouts think of our nhl based players

(28 30 superstar)
(23 27 star)
(18 22 nhl regular )
(13 17 nhl regular)
( 8 12 role player)

this would be interesting. clearly , finland 's top five players (winnipeg 's
selanne numminen , vancouver 's lumme , los angeles' jari kurri and new york 's
tikkanen) are right up there with any five man unit pittsburgh co. have. but
i have my doubts about the home based finnish players the national team did
well in the canada cup and world championships largely due to the efforts of
markus ketterer (the goalie) , 3 4 or the players listed above and luck. there 's
presumably a lot of decent players in finland that would n't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players , however. my guess would be
that the finnish canada cup team would be a .500 team in the nhl.

sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in north america.
their points total (16 players) is 274 seven more than ottawa 's 22 top
players combined ! if we estimate there are six more nhl regulars back home in
sweden , an all swedish team would assemble about 350 360 skill points.
deducting some points from pittsburgh , ny rangers and other teams that rely on
swedish players , the swedish team would finish in sixth place about as high
as boston , vancouver , calgary and montreal on paper ! so , the dynasty talk
is n't completely unfounded here. an all finnish all swedish team might have an
advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time ,
wo n't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language , and presumably
play the wide open european variant of hockey rather than have to learn the
north american checking game. however , if free agency becomes a factor the top
scandinavian players still might end up playing for large market teams after a
couple of years the same way edmonton 's dynasty crumbled in the late '80s.
some fringe players likely will be drafted by other nhl teams as having an
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. i 'd settle for a
compromise , prohibit all european teams from signing a north american during
the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. after this ,
the amateur draft should be open to anyone.

decent job. he followed the play pretty well , knew all the players'
names , and only made a couple of rookie mistakes that i noticed.
one thing that surprised me is that they never once attempted to explain

there were no fights in the game , but there were a couple of occasions

a fine 26 year history came to a close tonight , as the minnesota north stars ,
or norm 's stars (whichever you prefer) lost to the red wings by a score of
5 3. the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen , who netted
two including the final one in franchise history , with less than a minute to
play.

are there any further stories to report on the eve' of norm 's farewell
from the twin cities \? in an earlier post , it was announced that norm
green was given until midnight of the last home game of the north stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena.
did this happen \? was norm run out of town \?

rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board ,
the score board fell to the ice and flattened mr. greedy to a large
piece of green paper. arena management had to use the zamboni (which
they confiscated from norm 's truck) to clean up the useless remains.

no no no ! since all the penalties fall into three classes , there should
only be three penalties

1. foul (any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
body or stick). if you get 5 you are out for the game.

2. unsportsmanlike contact. (an intentional foul). this inlcludes all the
current flavours of roughing , fighting and boarding. if you get two you
are thrown out of the game , and fined.

3. technical foul. bad mouthing the ref , by player or coach. penalty shot
is awarded. two and you are thrown out of the game.

besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period , the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one ,
until the end of the period. the victim gets two shots if he she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.

these new rule changes are great ! however , i think that your rules are
much too complicated. how will the normal average fan be able to count
how many fouls a player has \? and then we would even have to remember the
names of the players , in order to determine who drew the foul ! and , of
course , there will have to be new sub positions , like the power center
who just sits in the slot until the (blue , of course) puck comes near him ,
and the shooting defenseman and the point defenseman . finally , we 'll
be able to keep stats on the best and the worst penalty shot takers.
since almost everyone on the ice will be getting fouled , we 'll be able to
see ulf samuellson (sp \? ) and tie domi miss penalty shots like crazy.

is a good stat because it is the only stat that i am aware of that
takes into account defensive play. it is n't a measure of defensive
play it takes into account offense and defence all aspects of play.

if we are interested of real all round players , the power play stats
should be considered , too. because the power play is also one aspect
of play ! there is still something to be done with these player evaluation
tools ! !

imo any good player should score on power plays because of the man
advantage. very good power play scorers tend to become overrated
because their point totals are inflated by power play points.
tends to expose these overrated players such as brett hull ,
john cullen and dave andreychuck.

given the opportunity to play power play consistently , any player can
inflate his totals.

well , it seems that the habs have been much talked about of late , so here 's my
0.02. these guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net ! ! ! watch them in the offensive zone , especially on the powerplay.
damphousse or lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone , maybe pass to the
point , get it back , skate some more , pass it around....but where's the shot \? \? !
answer the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la` neely , shanahan , tocchet , etc etc. too bad
demers wo n't put dipietro or leclair on the powerplay more often. dammit ,
even ewen would at least cause some disruptions. montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent , imo.

then watch them in their own zone. patrick roy is screened on everything. say
what you want about his performance imnsho he cannot stop what he cannot see.
and montreal 's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net.
last night against washington roy played a great game. the first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble i 've seen in a long time , and he
did n't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot. the second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway. pathetic defence. the
third goal was en.

no wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.

well , i gotta tell ya ,

last night 's leafs game vs the devils was a nail bitter let me tell you !
it was a well played game by both teams (i thought) but according to the
don and ron it was the an off night for the leafs and the devils
were outplaying toronto. well , i beg to differ....

imho , clark deserved to be a first star as much as gilmour did. his
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the clark of old. (but not to take any of the
credit away from gilmour).

i think the leafs are playing great hockey. why \?
well first look at their injury list which includes , cullen , ellet ,
zezel , macoun. of course my question is this....how will the leafs
fare when they are once again healthy if they are playing this well
so far \? \?

second , just look at their standings , still second in defence ,
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month , have n't lost
at home in last 12 games , 8 game undefeated streak..etc.
(btw , am i wrong or was this potvin 's first shut out \? i ca n't
remember him having any as of yet.)

well , as of april 3 we see that the race for first in the norris
has truly begun and it will be a very close race between chicago and
toronto. and the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to
see this one \? )

how long can the leafs play short handed and still be expected to
score \? they did some fine penely killing in the first (2 men down
for a couple of minutes at one point) but they just could n't keep it
up. they spent virtually the entire game either short handed or
just coming off a penelty as soon as they 'd get re grouped , they 're
penalized again !

sheesh like gilmour said after the 1st you ca n't go calling
every little push an shove in a game like that. and if you 're going
to , you have to do it for both teams.

pearson (one of my four favorite leafs) played like a bonehead i
saw him personally screw up at least 2 good scoring opportunities , and
then he got that bonehead 5 minute major high sticking penalty.

cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand full of
games ago and he played a good game. if the other players on his line
can smarten up , that line should do okay. clark 's got to get tough
he 's got to intimidate and go for the net. send clark up the left
wing over the blue line a couple times... his patented wrist shot will
put some numbers on the board... and pearson... heck , maybe he should
be benched.

i hate to repeat grapes , but where the heck was foligno \? zezel ca n't
do all the checking himself and get macllwain on the move... we
need some speed out there ! keep potvin in net , he did okay
considering... although (like i said a couple weeks ago) potvin
messed up in a couple games in the ahl playoffs last year he can
easily do it again.

my prediction last week was toronto in 7 that the games det wins
will be blow outs and the game tor wins will be close i still stand
by that.

do n't fret , leafs fans , in order to win in 7 , the other team has to
win 3 ! )

burns is going to make some magic he 'll mix up some lines. match
the wings line per line. he 'll have his team checking hard , and he 'll
never let them get out numbered in their own end. the leafs will win
wednesday night... and will take 1 or their home games (probably the
first one).

at the lester patrick awards lunch , bill torrey mentioned that one of his
options next season is to be president of the miami team , with bob clarke
working for him. at the same dinner , clarke said that his worst mistake
in philadelphia was letting mike keenan go in retrospect , almost all
players came realize that keenan knew what it took to win. rumours are
now circulating that keenan will be back with the flyers.

nick polano is sick of being a scapegoat for the schedule made for the
red wings after all , bryan murray approved it.

gerry meehan and john muckler are worried over the sabres' prospects
assistant don lever says that the sabres have to get their share now ,
because a quebec dynasty is emerging ...

the mighty ducks have declared that they will not throw money around
loosely to buy a team.

oilers coach ted green remarked that there some guys around who can
fill tie domi 's skates , but none who can fill his helmet.

senators' andrew mcbain told off a security guard at chicago stadium
who warned him of the stairs leading down to the locker room mcbain
mouthed off at him , after all being a seasoned professional ... and
tumbled down the entire steep flight.

not in indiana they showed a tape delay of chicago v boston , because

selanne 's 7 leads the jets teppo numminen is 4. who do you think

jagr really better on defense than francis \? and how exactly should we

the plus minus does not measure defense alone. it attempts to measure
a player 's total contribution to the team effort. and certainly , it
is far from perfect and my posting never implied otherwise. all that
my posting suggested was that the was a better indicator of a
player 's effectiveness , when examined in the context of that player 's
team 's performance , than mere scoring totals alone. and as for mario
getting the selke why not \? after doug gilmour , i would rather have
lemieux on the ice in any situation (other than as an enforcer , obvi
ously) than any player in the game. i used to call the selke the bob
gainey award . it came about as a result of the statement made by
anatoli tarasov bob gainey is the best hockey player in the world.
i am sure that tarasov was either misquoted , originally , or had a tiny
bit too much vodka and was toying with a reporter. in any event , the
nhl decided to honour one dimensional checkers along with one dimen
sional scorers. maybe the league should start awarding the doug gil
mour award anually to the league 's most effective , all round player.

i was playing this golf game and something interesting happened.
on the 7th hole , i drove the ball down the fairway , when the ball was
in mid flight , the game completely froze. a couple seconds later , the
screen went completely black , with an error message in large bubble
letters that said division by zero. i thought it was funny considering
i am a computer programmer , and i had never seen an error like this on
an actual video game system like sega or nintendo (or even atari or

what must have been an address , in hexadecimal. i forget the exact hex

1. you have completely missed the point with the selke trophy. it goes
to the best defensive forward. this is the forward who forgoes points
to help his team out defensively. it is an unsung hero of sorts. yes ,
lemieux and gilmour are good defensive players , but they play a more
offensively oriented style than a true defensive forward. this year ,

you mean guys that check but ca n't score \? the guys who can both check
and score should n't be candidates \? is that right \?

the selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals
from being scored not to score them. when lemieux or gilmour play their
number one purpose is to score defence is secondary especially considering
the line that plays against them is probably a defensive one. that is
why they are not selke candidates.

2. when tarasov called bob gainey the best player in the world , it was
assumed that he meaned the best technical player the one who knew
every intricacy about playing hockey and never made a technical error.

and who was it that made this assumption \? all of your friends maybe \?
sorry greg , but 2 people are n't enough...you can assume all that you
want to , but if you think tarasov was serious then you are an idiot.

someone posted something about this assumption being lost in translation
(it was a few months ago). whoever this was please repost it.

i agree with this assessment. bob gainey may have been the best technical
player ever.

right greg. did you see this in the sun or something \? what did you think
of claude provost \? gainey was nothing more than a journeyman player who 's
outstanding abilities were entirely political. he might have had a col
lection of defensive skills but he had absolutely no offensive skills at
all. none. but perhaps you think that the abilities to pass the puck , shoot
the puck and deke a goalie or defenseman are not technical skills \?

gainey is the best defensive forward ever. i stand by that assessment.
he was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame. did you
ever watch him play \? he never made a technical error.

babbling deleted

gee greg , the pundits were calling gilmour the best two way player in the
league way back when he was with st. louis. i would have expected you to
have picked up on that.

who are these pundits \? \? gilmour was good with st louis but he was not the
best two way player in the game when he was with them. you have overhyped
gilmour on this net for months. he is a very good forward but hardly the
best in the nhl.

ten years ago , the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 season , the numbers of euros on
nhl teams have escalated to the following stats

canadians 400
americans 100
europeans 100

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun.

here 's the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let 's say , the
red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like bure konstantinov and
borshevshky . is this north america or is n't it \? toronto , detriot , quebec ,
and edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of euros on other
teams is getting worse as well.


from where i come from in canada , borshevsky sounds more canadian than
smith ! )

anyways , crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the nba does n't
care where they get basketball players from , major league baseball
does n't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except cuba ,
that is).

canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary
supplier of players...sweden , finland , the czech republic , and slovakia
are all relatively small countries , and cannot really produce players
at a greater rate than they are already producing them , and the
potential influx from the former soviet union is severely blunted
because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
will take a decade or two , to recover and become a real threat , and
the us will just maintain its slow increase. canada should continue
to supply 60 plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
forseeable future.

besides we need the european hockey market if hockey is to take
its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
sports...and since soccer is essentially boring , unlike hockey.

i live in vancouver and if i hear one more word about pavel bure , the
russian rocket i will completely throw up. as it is now , every time i see
the canucks play i keep hoping someone will cross check bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (by the way , i'm not a
canucks fan to begin with ).

okay , the stretcher remark was a little carried away. but the point is that
i resent nhl owners drafting all these europeans instead of canadians (and
some americans). it denies young canadians the opportunity to play in their
north american league and instead gives it to europeans , who are n't even
better hockey players. it 's all hype. this european mystique is sickening ,
but until nhl owners get over it , canadian and american players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating , the problem is clearly
only getting worse.


canadians are under no threat...the european numbers will soon saturate ,
if they have n't already...and by the time russia comes online again ,
the nhl should be a world league , and there will be many more teams
to stock and many more jobs for canadian hockey players. in the near
team , the percentage of canadians will mostly decline because of
americans , not because of europeans.

i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league , and let the bures
and selannes of the world play on their own continent.

i just do n't want them on mine.

1. foul (any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
body or stick). if you get 5 you are out for the game.

i 've never seen a game where one player has committed 5
penalties. something like this would require more attention by
the referee.


2. unsportsmanlike contact. (an intentional foul). this inlcludes all the
current flavours of roughing , fighting and boarding. if you get two you
are thrown out of the game , and fined.

3. technical foul. bad mouthing the ref , by player or coach. penalty shot
is awarded. two and you are thrown out of the game.

besides the penalty shot for one technical , if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period , the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one ,
until the end of the period. the victim gets two shots if he she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.

this works well for several reasons. first , penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey , right \? so , it follows that the more the better.
next , when the player is setting up for a penalty shot , the network can
take a commercial. finally , with only three penalties , the network
announcers (don meredith , dick vitale , john madden , pat summerall , and
marv levy , among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the pa announcer says it.


but you 're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before. i can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls , but it 's
obviously easier to score in basketball , there are more
opportunities. if a basketball team scores 100 points , that 's
at least fifty chances made. the average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
probably around 40 , and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
5 of them. you have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties , but i think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with.

also , later in the post , you talked about how boring the nba
game you attended was , that play was stopped too often.
would n't your penalty shot rule take up more time during a
hockey game \?

goalies
philadelphia , roussel 14 11 5 (30 shots 26 saves)
hartford , lenarduzzi , 1 1 1 (38 33)

on the first hartford goal , gord hynes misplayed the puck at the flyers blue
line and nylander stripped him and took off.

the recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with lindros.

the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net , got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense. take the body , and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. do n't give them another chance. carkner ,
galley and mcgill are all terrible about this , i 'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest flyer to the play.

that 's all i have , my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it
was that scored , much less how.

from what i heard , roussel had a very strong game. after the game , gene hart
asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. it was garry galley 3 for his career high point total (i'm surprised
that a former goalie would n't look closer at his defensive play) , tommy
soderstrom 2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1 2 a season
and , mark recchi 1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
but here 's the odd part. he could n't decide between lindros and recchi for
number 1. if he picks recchi as 1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and lindros , does n't that make lindros 2 \? \? \? \?

what \? you wanna know my three stars of the season \? well , since you asked...

1 eric lindros. eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
the difference between the team 's record with him and without him is no
accident. i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
recchi. there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric
lindros on it , and i think that he will deservedly wear the 'c' on his jersey
next season.

2 tommy soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour ,
and tommy did n't have a chris chelios (booo) in front of him. he also did n't
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here , my family
has a history of heart problems). there 's no question in my mind that tommy
soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future , and if roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

3 mark recchi. again , you ca n't argue with an all time team high single season
scoring mark. there are an awful lot of teams that did n't have a single player
get as many points. plus , mark is the only flyer to play the entire season.
not a tough choice.

honorable mentions rod brind'amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. the difference was that he was n't on the top line
this year and did n't get as much playing time. then again , he did n't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. yes , he made rookie
mistakes , but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. i have a feeling
that with his shot he 'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone , and i suspect that he 'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

garry galley was the team 's point leader from defensemen. again , there are some
things you just ca n't argue with. and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome ,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game , and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. but his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. a little more caution , and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
but consistency became a problem for him.

the flyers end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place , their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988 89. 14 20 3 within the division (4th in
patrick) , 23 14 5 at home. they finished 17th overall , will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (quebec had the 1st rounder , though). they scored as
many goals as they allowed , 319.

the 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

i will be sending out final stats as soon as i get the issue of the hockey
news that contains them , since there are no more games for me to go to i have
no other way of getting them.

i hope you 've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as i have. knowing

almost bearable.

then allow me to enlighten you , rex. you see , there 's a thing called a tie.
a tie is worth one point (i know , i know. you 're not good at math. but bear

getting one win. if your team played two games , won one and lost one , you 'd
have two points. if my team played two games and tied them both , we 'd also
have two points. we 'd be tied in the standings even though our records are

quinn will resign as head coach (this is no secret) and hopefully they will
bring in someone who looks at the game spatially and institutes some team
disciplined play. how about keenan \? give him what he wants , gm and coach ,
and have quinn upstairs as president.

i was under the impression that rick ley was in line for the canucks job
should quinn step off the bench. ley coached in the canucks' organization

bring back harry ! (neale) at least he was witty...

aargh !

paul stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the nhl.
he called a total of 4 penalties on the habs and one on the nordiques.
the nords' penalty came in o.t. stewart , being an ex nordique himself ,
was looking to call penalties on the habs while letting the nords
get away with murder...we was robbed ! ! ! !

it was an excellent game with plenty of end to end rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping. the nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while lebeau
was serving a penalty. i do n't mind stewart calling a penalty in the
last 5 min. of the game , but at least be fair about it. the nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once. stewart turned
the other cheek...bastard !

patrick roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. he was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night. the winning goal should n't have
gone in.

do n't get me wrong , i'm not blaming the loss on stewart. the habs had
plenty of chances to capitalize , muller , leclair , haller , etc. but
failed to put the puck in the net. that 's what did them in. but
mr. stewart did n't help matters at all.

oh well , at least the bruins lost in o.t. also ha , ha ! ! )

the subject line says it all. is it terribly difficult to get tickets

it be easy to find scalpers outside of the igloo selling tickets \?

dean money
dmoney@magnus.acs.ohio state.edu

here is my traditional experience with tickets , playoffs and otherwise ,
at the civic arena.

scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the arena. best
strategy , given that you do n't mind missing the anthem (which is ok if b.e.
taylor decides to come back ever again ) ) is to wait until 7 40 or 7 45 ,
when the game is rolling the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.

playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on
what 's left at 7 45 may be nosebleed material (d , e sections).

others can add on their opinions as well.

in rauser.734062608@sfu.ca rauser@fraser.sfu.ca writes



ten years ago , the number of europeans in the nhl was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. going into the 1992 93 season , the numbers of euros on
nhl teams have escalated to the following stats

canadians 400
americans 100
europeans 100

please note that these numbers are rounded off , and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. my source is the vancouver sun.

here 's the point there are far too many europeans in the nhl. i am sick
of watching a game between an american and a canadian team (let 's say , the
red wings and the canucks) and seeing names like bure konstantinov and
borshevshky . is this north america or is n't it \? toronto , detriot , quebec ,
and edmonton are particularly annoying , but the numbers of euros on other
teams is getting worse as well.

that 's why we have expansion to create more jobs. nhl teams ca n't afford to
import role players from europe , they pick the stars but will continue to build
their teams around local players.

with the numbers of euros in the nhl escalating , the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

i'm all for the creation of a european hockey league , and let the bures
and selannes of the world play on their own continent.

i 'd love to see a european nhl division but ca n't see it happen for some
time. there 's simply not enough fan interest at the moment in several
crucial markets like germany , italy and france while sweden and finland
probably ca n't afford to shell out 20 30 for tickets the way
american canadian fans do. call it the minnesota north stars effect
scandinavians do love hockey but we prefer to watch local , inexpensive
hockey to the nhl. the national hockey league should love the idea , though.
pan european tv channels such as eurosport could bring in the millions the
american networks likely never will pay.

i just do n't want them on mine.

very surprised of saku koivu. i must admit that he surprised me
already in the finnish playoffs. and now on team finland !

saku koivu is a light weight player , if we consider his size according
to my stats he is only 172cm and 68kgs ! and he is only 18 ! (23.11.74).
but he is a real two way player ! skates well , can score , gives nice
passes , does even bodycheckings ! ! \? he is really something to watch
in the wc.

the size is n't always everything. maybe we remember harlamov...
and they say that saku is still growing up (3cm during last year)...

saku is n't that small any longer i guess i heard he is 177cm tall at the
moment and will still grow 6 8cm.

impossible not to watch a series on tv (ie the only two series i have not had

i also think that they will have a hard time with pittsburgh if they
face them in the finals (which is what all the detroit sportswriters
are predicting). although i think bryan murray is probably the best gm
i have ever seen in hockey , i'm not as impressed with his abilities as
a bench coach or in general as a motivator. with the amount of talent he
has on this team , he should have blown away everyone in the norris. there
is not another team in the norris , maybe even in the campbell conference ,
that can hold a candle to detroit on paper in terms of pure talent. but ,
some guys have not been pulling their weight at times this year. scotty
bowman , on the other hand , who has won (i think , correct me if i'm wrong)
nine (9) stanley cups , is an outstanding coach , and i think he could
outcoach murray if they faced each other.


bryan murray has done very little as gm...yzerman , fedorov , cheveldae ,
chaisson , the whole russian strategy was a product of the previous
gm...murray has made a couple of decent trades...that 's about it...
that would hardly rank him as the best gm.

was n't primeau , murray 's first decision as gm...

in detroit , the octopus is a symbol from the old days of the league. in
the era of the original 6 , four teams made the playoffs. to win the cup ,
a team had to win two seven game series in other words it took 8
playoff wins to win the cup. the octopus (8 legs) has become a common
detroit symbol. every year around playoff time people start sneaking
octopus (octopi \? ) into the joe louis arena and throwing them onto the ice.

this is what kills me
stanley cup finals

toronto maple leafs vs montreal canadiens
(the classic stanley cup final matchup ! ! ) also a dream come true !

montreal wins the stanley cup in the 7th game 1 0 in double overtime.
roy and potvin are spectacular throughout the series and share series mvp (if
that is possible) vincent damphouse nets game winner from a brilliant pass by
brian bellows ! canadiens star( \? ) denis savard watched his buddies play from the
owners box nursing that splinter on his thumb which has left him on the
disabled list since the first game of the playoffs (awww shucks).

die hard habs fan living with
3 die hard leafs fans !

speaking of die hard , that 's what i did when i read this , died hard
laughing !

toronto , to the cup finals \? \? \?

first of all , has anyone on the planet heard of the team from detroit \? al
morgani (or however you spell the idiot 's name) must be from chicago ,
because on espn , he said it 's not even close chicago will definatly win
the norris division in the playoffs , no other team is close. everyone is
picking chicago ! i do n't get it , he says it 's an easy choice \?
god , chicago was 1 4 1 against the wings , and they won the division by a
point or two , followed closely by toronto , who is also a good team !
as for the leafs beating detroit doubt it , but even if they do , they
are n't going to get by chicago. if (even more amazingly) they get past the
hawks , they would probably face vancouver , and lose.
as for the habs reaching the finals , forget it. even i , as a devoted wings
fan , will watch the penguins easily three peat as cup winners. lemieux ,
jagr , tocchet , stevens , and barrasso , its a done deal. sorry detroit , wait
til next year.
but hey , these were paul 's picks , and everyone has a right to their own
opinnions , but the leafs to the finals \? \? \? yeah. if they make it there , i 'll
walk to toronto to get some tickets , and that 's a 700 mile walk !

go out

on 20 apr 93 in don cherry coach 's corner..
user allan sullivan@cs.ualber writes
next , a clip was shown from an earlier episode , in which don was
proclaiming doug gilmour to be the best player , not only in
the nhl , but in the world. what about players like lemieux \?
don said that gilmour was the best player , not designated point getter .
its not like baseball , where you have a designatted hitter who
can score runs but ca n't play defense. gilmour is a good two way player.

this clip was shown on local news in pittsburgh last night (kdka) , complete
with animated sarcasm by the sportscaster. it 's the second time cherry
has been shown on local pittsburgh news in the last couple of weeks. both
times he was blasting lemieux.


his designated point getter remarks were not only meant for lemieux ,
but for gretzky , bure , etc. etc. .... and he made those particular
remarks last december before lemieux was diagnosed with hodgkin 's ,
and as the leafs started their second half roll , and before
gilmour 's great season was being recognized by many people.

i can give you a couple. in detroit , wjr (760) will be broadcasting
at least the first couple of games of the wings toronto series , and
since they broadcast at 50000 watts , you may be able to pick it up
after dark where you are at. the pittsburgh penguins games used to be
broadcast on kdka 1020 , but i do n't know whether they will be pre empted
by baseball (and moved to another station) or not. you can try those
if the local baseball teams are n't playing at the same time , anyway.

according to this morning 's post gazette

the pens will be carried by kdka radio(1020 am) , unless the pirates
are playing. when the pirates play , the games will be carried by
wdve(102.5 fm). wdve will carry 12 games , starting with tonight 's
game.

in fact , after this season , kdka will no longer be the flagship
station for the pens. the penguins and kbl have struck a new
deal regarding the tv and radio rights to the games. it seems
more than likely that wdve will be the flagship radio station next
season. kbl will carry 62 games on tv , with 17 of the games to be
simulcast on kdka tv. the remaining 22 games , as well as some of the
early round playoff games , will be available by subscription tv only.
to receive the games , you 'll have to pay a one time hook up fee , and
then a monthly fee of 11 12 dollars.

also , under the new deal , there will no longer be radio tv
simulcasts. there will be a tv broadcast team , and a radio
broadcast team.

no word on who the announcers will be. mike lange and paul steigerwald
are both under contract with kdka , but their contracts expire at the
end of this season. kbl president bill craig said he 'd like to hire
lange and steigerwald.
