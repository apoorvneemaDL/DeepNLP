i have lived in the boston area for 15 years now. they have been talking
about a new boston garden (hockey basketball) since i 've lived here. one
day the last hurdle has been overcome , and the next day there 's a new
hurdle. fans have been grumbling about foxboro stadium (or whatever it 's

summary stolen hits for all second basemen
keywords second defense
organization university of illinois , dept. of comp. sci. , urbana , il
lines 117

disclaimer this is for fun.

in my computerized baseball game , i keep track of a category called
stolen hits , defined as a play made that an average fielder would not
make with average effort. using the 1992 defensive averages posted
by sherri nichols (thanks sherri ! ) , i 've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. hits stolen have been redefined as plays kurt
stillwell would not have made.

ok , i realize that 's unfair. kurt 's probably the victim of pitching staff ,
fluke shots , and a monster park factor. but let 's put it this way if we
replaced every second baseman in the nl with someone with kurt 's 57.6 out
making ability , how many extra hits would go by \?

to try and correlate it to reality a little more , i 've calculated net
hits stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make. by the same method i 've calculated net double
plays , and net extra bases (doubles and triples let by).

finally , i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution , or
dcon . basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
i add this number to ops to get dops (defense onbase plus slug) , which
should represent the player 's total contribution to the team. so do n't
take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this
article.

the short version definition of terms
hs hits stolen extra outs compared to kurt stillwell
nhs net hits stolen extra outs compared to average fielder
ndp net double plays extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
neb net extra bases extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
dcon defensive contribution bases and hits prevented , as a rate.
dops dcon ops quick dirty measure of player 's total contribution.

dcon formula ((nhs ndp) pa) ((nhs ndp neb) ab)
why such a bizzare formula \? basically , it 's designed to be added into the
ops , with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored .
the extra outs are factored into obp , while the extra bases removed are
factored into slg. that 's why i used pa and ab as the divisors.

here 's my analysis of jose canseco , circa sep '92 , and jose canseco ,
circa june 1986.

1. he 's bulked up too much. period. he needs to lose about 20 pounds ,
not gain more bulk.

i 've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the a 's conditioning
guru told jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his back.although i do n't for one second believe jose used steroids , his
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see jeff
bregel ex 49er as a textbook example) , and imho jose is too big for his
frame.


2. his bat speed has absolutely vanished. conservatively , i 'd say he 's
lost 4 7 of his bat speed , and that 's a huge amount of speed.

i ca n't imagine how to estimate bat speed , but its pretty obvious that
jose is missing fastballs he used to hit , likely due to his back.


3. that open stance is killing him. note that he acts sort of like
brian downing way open to start , then closes up as ball is
released. downing could do this without significant head movement
canseco ca n't. also , note that canseco does n't always close his
stance the same way sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes ,
they 're fully closed. without a good starting point , it 's hard
to make adjustments in your swing.

i do n't know , he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the a 's , and had no problems with it then. it might be that pre back
problems , he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused , but now he 's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him. the old saying if you 're hot its a trigger mechanism , if you 're
cold , its a hitch.

first , minimize movement before the swing. close and widen the stance ,
and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing. hopefully , this
will cut down on the time i need to swing , and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

the biggest problem imho is he never has found a stance he 's comfortable
with for more than a few months. he changes his stance so much , he loses
track of where the strike zone is. in wednesday 's night game , he was
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me. i think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he 's changed his stance so much.

i'm also a bit concerned that because he 's got palmer and gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns , he 'll become competitive , swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse. larussa always said that canseco 's famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits.

yeah , the phillies played over their heads almost the whole year ,
but it all caught up to them in one 10 game streak. i am as old as
1964 (man ! ) and i was a big phillies fan at the time (age 13).
september '64 is still a painful thing to remember. but i can tell you
that the phillies never led the league by 15 that year. going by memory
alone , i believe their biggest lead was 7 1 2 games , and they were
6 1 2 ahead when the famous 10 game losing streak began , a streak
during which it seemed that they found just about every way to lose
known to man. anyway , i think they rebounded just before the end and
won their last couple games and were still in the thing until the
final day , but finished tied with the giants one game out. and did n't
the dodgers or somebody else finish two games back \? that has to be
one of the closest last minute scrambles ever.

ok , you guys stirred up my childhood memories , so i went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. it turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate , at least as

now it does n't appear to me that phillies pitchers bunning and short
were really overused , at least by the four man rotation standard of
the day , until well along into the 10 game losing streak , at which
time mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
phillies substantial lead had evaporated. the way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse , although bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10 0 shutout of
the reds that cost the reds a share of the pennant. bunning pitched
a complete game six hitter , striking out five and walking one. it
would be inetersting to see , though , how the total innings for the
year for bunning and short stacks up against the rest of the league.
also notice that the phillies played every day from at least september 1
through october 1 while they did n't play substantially more games than
the other teams , the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

gary 's list of the ten slowest bats in baseball

hey , no fair ! what about 'fettucine' alfredo griffin \? the guy practically
has to pivot the bat around along with his body.

gary 's list of how the hell can he hit like that \?

1. julio franco
2. phil plantier
9. darren daulton

daulton does n't strike me as all that strange. he 's a little bit quiet at
the plate but , like franco , gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. the first time i watched julio franco , i did n't think anyone could
hit like that. now i marvel at how easy he makes it look every time he makes
contact , it 's solid . he 's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch.

i wonder if phil plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne' \? ) sure looks like it )

how 'bout one to add to your list travis fryman \? the guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing across his body. he generates a lot of power , but
i keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips.

gary 's list of i 'd give dave kirsch 's kidneys to have a swing like that.

well , they 're already spoken for (by several people) , but ..

i 'd add robbie alomar 's name to the list , among others. i really like dean
palmer 's swing , for some twisted reason , as well as pedro munoz 's swing.

that 's all for now. i'm looking at derrick may 's tapes tonight , along
with troy neel 's. that guy is a serious ox.

a thought about may it looks like they 've taught him to turn on the ball.
imho , he 's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he 's going to see lots of sinkers sliders
low and away. unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left
and left center , imho you 're going to see a good number of weak grounders to
the right side of the infield in the next month.

so who will start this year 's all star game for the al \?

probably alomar.

not to put him down he 's a great player. but it helps to have
all the recognition he 's had , plus to play in a city which is
likely to pour in the votes...

i like alomar. but i 'd like to differ with your opinion about a city
which is likely to pour in the votes... .

i attended many games last year during the balloting. i know that a
great number of the attendees did not fill out their ballots , but left
them , beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands. toronto gets
no more and no less votes than any other city for the all star game.

unfortunately , this is not a one time thing. i 've attended games
during the last four seasons , and it has happened every time. the
apathetic attitude to all star ballots really offends me.

i do n't know if you could call him rushed , but big ben mcdonald did n't
much time at all in the minors. of course that was because the balls used
in aaa had seams too large and gave mcdonald blisters forcing him to go
on the dl several times. he 's done most of his learning here in the majors.
of course gregg wild thing olson and mike deserved a cy young mussina

are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that

james' historical abstract , the ballplayers (biography) , word of

feel free to comment , suggest , flame (whatever)...but i tried
to be as objective as possible , using statistical data not inlcuded
for time convience 's sake. (i judged on rel. ba , adj ops , total average ,
fielding range runs , total player rating (total baseball) , stolen bases

10) ray dandridge

how can brooks be 6 \? i think he would at least be ahead of ron santo.

because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting. their average
seasons , using their combined average 656 (ab bb) per 162 games

years ab h r 2b 3b hr rbi tb bb avg obp slg ops

years p a dp e pct
santo 13.15 149 348 30 24 .954
robinson 17.72 152 350 35 15 .971

even if robinson 's extra 3 putouts , 2 assists , and 5 dps are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field , that does n't make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate , not to mention the fewer
total bases. the difference of .104 in ops should be decreased by about
.025 to account for wrigley , but a .079 difference is still considerable.
the thorn palmer ratings are

adjusted adjusted stolen fielding total
production batting runs base runs runs rating
santo 123 284 14 137 41.7
robinson 105 52 5 151 19.8 (26.3)
usual disclaimers about t p 's fr apply , but they really should n't be
way off the mark in this comparison. at least it 's better than fielding
percentage carney lansford has a .966 , 10th best all time , but 225 fr ,
dead last of all time. also , since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level , robinson should be
awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games. he had a great
career , but i would prefer santo 's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3bman.

but i would knock traynor off the list and replace him by stan hack.
that 's a similar story , hack 's far better hitting outweighs traynor 's
superior fielding. graig nettles and buddy bell would also be better
choices (imho of course , though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view.)

i heard that eli is selling the team to a group in cinninati. this would
help so that the o 's could make some real free agent signings in the
offseason. training camp reports that everything is pretty positive right
now. the backup catcher postion will be a showdown between tackett and parent

up faster in the o 's hierarchy of the minors faster than expected. mike
flanagan is trying for another comeback. big ben is being defended by
coaches saying that while the homers given up were an awful lot , most came
in the beginning of the season and he really improved the second half. this
may be ben 's year.
i feel that while this may not be mussina 's cy young year , he will
be able to pitch the entire season without periods of fatigue like last year
around august. i really hope baines can provide the rf support the o 's need.
orsulak was decent but i had hoped that chito martinez could learn defense
better and play like he did in '91. the o 's right now do n't have many
left handed hitters. anderson proving last year was no fluke and cal 's return
to his averages would be big plusses in a drive for the pennant. the
rotation should be sutcliffe , mussina , mcdonald , rhodes , \? \? \? \? \? . olson is an
interesting case. will he strike out the side or load the bases and then get
three pop outs \? you never know.

baltimore

toronto
milwaukee
cleveland
boston

(the top 4 are the only true contenders in my mind. one of these 4 will

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

for anyone who did n't see sunday 's game ,

with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform , a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey , both right handers.

that 's because lankford had a minor injury from a couple of games
before that
and was day to day... only available as a pinchrunner.


later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the hell
is he thinking.

see above.

earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt , but torre said
he liked gilkey coming off the bench. gilkey hit over 300 last year ,
what does he have to do to start , the guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

at the beginning of the interview torre also said lankford is the
one outfield
guy who 's in there no matter what .
my guess is jordan will eventually end up being odd man out due to low
on base percentage. whiten was a great acquisition... decent offense
and great defense in rightfield. but do n't worry , gilkey will be
starting
as soon as jordan or whiten displays an extended period of low offensive
output.

reference to history because he certainly did n't have the best season for
second basemen in history. he probably did n't even have as good a season as
alomar last year.

what \? do you have some measure (like popularity in toronto does n't count)
that you are basing this statement on \?

uh , yes. baerga has a lot of flash , but alomar was the better hitter
last year.

batters ba slg obp g ab r h tb 2b 3b hr rbi bb so sb cs e
baerga , c .312 .455 .354 161 657 92 205 299 32 1 20 105 35 76 10 2 19
alomar , r .310 .427 .405 152 571 105 177 244 27 8 8 76 87 52 49 9 5


this is fascinating. you say that alomar was the better hitter last
year , and immediately follow that up with numbers showing that baerga
had a better year. the only category that i see which shows an advantage
for alomar is obp

hmmm...what about walks and sb \? baerga got clobbered by alomar in obp and
beat him in slg by a lesser margin. even putting aside any other factors ,
a player with a 51 point edge in obp is more productive than a player with
a 28 point edge in slg. the issue has been studied before , and i doubt you
could come up with any convincing argument the other way.
people see the batting average and the hr , but they do n't really know
their value is worth unless they 've studied the issue closely. the fact is that
baerga ate up a lot more outs than alomar while baerga was making outs ,
alomar was drawing walks and being on base for carter , winfield et.al.

i agree , though i 'd also be happy with a stadium that looks
like new comiskey. the new park was also made for baseball.
unlike three rivers , the vet , riverfront , etc. , it 's not a
football park in which they also play baseball.

while we 're on the multipurpose subject , let 's not forget shea , which
was designed to accommodate both the mets jets. it was the first
stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football.

not the first. rfk , olim dc stadium , was built 2 years earlier.
nowadays they do n't move the seats back for the few exhibition
games but the 3rd base lf lower deck used to move. it was all
metal , which was pretty noisy on bat day.

of course , with the jets gone to jersey (and a truly good football
stadium) , the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where ,
because it 's circular , the seats are almost always too far from the
action. the mets announcers kiner murphy in particular have
always hyped it as beautiful shea
stadium , a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

it 's vastly better than it was before they fixed it , though. back in
the late 70 's it was a dump .

one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and has n't
yet been addressed. i believe the rule also does not deal with this
situation

however , if the infield fly is not caught , at what point can a runner
legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for advancing too
early \?

the runner can leave his base at any time. if the ball is caught ,
he 's got to tag up. if it is n't caught , he does n't have to tag up at
all. so , if he 's feeling lucky , your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up. if it is n't caught , he 's probably scored
a run. if it is , he 's probably headed for aaa.

the only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out ,
thereby removing the force on the runners on base. all other rules apply ,
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.

the mle is not a projection , it 's an equivalence . it 's a this is how
well he hit last year , in major league terms rating. so , in essence , he
has already reached it. i would guess (bob \? clay \? ) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous mles in their rookie seasons. maybe
more than half , since all of these players are young and improving.

if that were your purpose , maybe. offerman spent 1992 getting
acclimated , if you will. the dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season.

did they \? offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
and last place , but no more.

perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant \?

sure they did n't have anyone better. i suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire jay bell or spike owen or somebody if they were really
in contention.

the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample , but rather that he
had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real , or to send him
down until he gets warmed up .

for a stat head , i'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training.

if you 'd read what i wrote , you 'd be less amazed. nowhere do i claim to put
any credence in spring training. quite the contrary i said that lopez had n't
done anything that even the bozos who do put credence in spring training
could interpret as failure . just because i think spring training numbers
are meaningless does n't mean that bobby cox does it 's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending lopez down.

the kid will improve playing at aaa ,

just like keith mitchell did \?

wait a minute. i missed something here.

keith mitchell did very very well at aa , aaa , and the majors over a season ,
then did very , very poorly for a year in aaa.

to all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career , the answer is johnny mize in his career with the
cards and the yanks. he hit three 6 times. i am almost sure about this. in
case anyone is wondering , the record for two homer games is held by babe
ruth and is 72. mize 's record may not last for much longer because of juan
gonzalez. he has at least three games with three and maybe 4. i know that
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie. i do n't have any record
books at college for me to check on though. please let me know , okay , if i
am wrong.
onto the padres. is there anyone out there who follows them \? especial ly those with access to local news \? i do n't here anything in los angeles and i
ca n't get mcpaper consistently around here.
comment it looks as though san diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought bell and plantier to the padres. it has also forced the team to use darrell shermann. of course , plantier could get injured again or he could
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average. bell always could finish
with .240 and 15 18 hrs essentially jerald clark 's numbers.
leadoff comment craig shipley \? \? \? \? \? \? i get on base 29 of the time if i'm
lucky at leadoff \? hell , of the usual starters , use gwynn. he 's got 4 steals
already. is shipley starting because of an injury to stillwell , though \? i
have n't seen stillwell 's name in any box scores. anyway unless you are going
to use shermann at leadoff then use gwynn. he at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.
sheffield comment though the season is early and stats mean nothing.
witness phillips batting .500 currently. but does sheffield have an injury ,
or anythingelse wrong with him. i just do n't hear anything.
andy benes is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91 \? or is
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then \? has anyone
seen him pitch the two good games \?
score for today , sunday april 18 padres 10 , st louis 6. padres sweep the
cardinals as gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer. sheffield and tueful also homer
in a winning cause.

lines 95

having run completely out of time , i 've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the a.l. out. qualifications one of the worse
finishes in last year 's prediction contest.

al east 1993

1. baltimore orioles
why the orioles \? well , i pondered long and hard , and it all came down to
this
the blue jays are going the wrong direction.
ca n't bring myself to pick the yankees
milwaukee was a fluke
indians are n't ready to contend
red sox were bad last year , and did n't get any better
detroit 's pitching will be the new definition of replacement level
but you do n't really think the orioles will win , do you. no. as a matter
of fact , i ca n't see any team in the american league winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the yankees , who i hate). but some
body has to win , so i pick the orioles. you do n't really think that brady
anderson is going to repeat , do you \? no. i'm basing the orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from cal ripken and glenn davis. glenn
davis \? that 's insane . yes. so , without further ado
strong points hoiles , ripken some years , olson , getting rid of billy ripken.
weak points segui may start. valenzuela (the original 30 something) may be
the fifth starter. oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
(does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
the effect of a slumping ripken \? if you ca n't move ripken out of the 3
spot , why not move the rest of the line up \? )
would be a good sign glenn davis wins comeback player of the year.
would be a bad sign in a tight pennant race , team trades for pecota.
obprediction the streak continues. harold reynolds leads the team in
caught stealing.

2. new york yankees.
strong points abbot , key , perez. could have best pitching in american
league. boggs should improve on hayes.
weak points mattingly still considered best hitter. the steinbrenner
factor. (the yankees lost to the mets. can wholesale changes be far
behind \? ) never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. wickman millitello) to
win a division.
would be a good sign boggs hits over .300
would be a bad sign howe gets arrested again.
obprediction mattingly wo n't top a 700 ops.

3. toronto blue jays
strong points management willing to make big deals. management has eerie
power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects. olerud.
guzman. alomar.
weak points the jackson for bell trade has shaken my faith in gillick.
losing stewart may hurt rotation (that 's really a bad sign). no one in
the outfield can get on base. pitching is thin behind guzman and ward.
would be a good sign jack morris considered cy young contender in august
would be a bad sign club makes no major deals in august.
obprediction morris will post better era and whip totals than last year. and
have a losing record.

4. milwaukee brewers
strong points pitching staff was exceptional last year.
weak points molitor gone. surhoff at third \? why \? eldred ca n't keep it up.
would be a good sign listach and eldred play like last year.
would be bad sign bones plays like last year.
obprediction surhoff wo n't finish the year at third.

5. cleveland indians
strong points baerga , belle , nagy
weak points pitching staff thin losing olin really hurts. starts felix
fermin.
would be a good sign bielecki 's era is consistent with his atlanta starts.
would be a bad sign ted power bullpen ace.
obprediction alomar will be back on the dl by the all star break.

6. boston red sox
strong points clemens , viola , clemens , detroit , clemens
weak points most incompetent gm in baseball. key free agent signing andre
dawson. burks is gone hatcher in center.
would be a good sign rainouts in between clemens starts.
would be a bad sign clemens on the dl
obprediction russell will make sox fans forget reardon. interpret that how
you will

7. detroit tigers
strong points tettleton , phillips , whitaker
weak points if fielder keeps declining , he 'll be a shortstop this year.
worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced but not necessarily better.
this year could be very ugly.
would be a good sign cecil fielder deserving the mvp.
would be a bad sign cecil fielder not whining about deserving an mvp.
obprediction cecil wo n't lead the league in rbis.

one more division to go....

the phillies salvaged their weekend series against the chicago cubs
by beating them 11 10 in a wild one at wrigley field sunday
afternoon. it was the phils only win in the three game series , and
was the first time the phillies have lost a series in the young
season. the phils jumped to a 6 0 lead in the game thanks to 2
john kruk 2 run homers and two wes chamberlain homers. however danny
jackson , and the phillies middle relief was unable to hold the lead.
mitch williams entered the game with the phillies leading 8 4 ,
however candy maldonado hit a ninth inning homerun to tie it. in
the 11th , dave hollins hit a three run shot , his first of the year
to push the phils ahead to stay. however , in a shaky bottom of the
11th the cubs scored 2 runs and had the tying runner on base when
the cubs pinch hit randy myers for bob scanlan (they were out of
position players) and myers bunted into a double play to end the
game.

the phils bring their league leading 9 3 record back to action
tuesday , wednesday , and thursday against the padres.

lines 74

i 've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the marlines to finish ahead of the cubs....how \?

first base

grace vs destrade...could destrade be the second coming of cecil
fielder \? i doubt it. if destrade performs to the height of expectations ,
then even , otherwise , edge to cubs

second base

sandberg vs barberie...no contest. sandberg will be back may 1. edge
to cubs...a big edge.

shortstop

vizcaino vs weiss...vizcaino is excellent defensively , but is an
automatic out at bat. weiss is n't much better with the stick. even.

third base

dave magadan vs buechelle...magadan has a higher obp and is a better hitter.
buechelle has more power and is better defensively (i think) edge to
florida.

catcher

santiago vs wilkins...wilkins is ok , but santiago is better. edge to
marlins

left field

conine vs maldonado...wow ! 4 for 4 yesterday...i know conine has potential.
i watched him play at omaha the last couple years. until he actually proves
himself , i give maldonado the edge , however , like at 1b , this is position
where florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year.

center

scott pose vs wilson may...edge to may , even if wilson. hopefully the
cubs will use may and save wilson for pinch running and the like. may
is n't ken griffey jr , but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays
full time.

right

felix vs sosa...felix jose has occasional power and a bad obp. so does
sosa , but sosa also has speed and a good glove. edge to cubs

starters

aquino \? armstrong \? hammond \? a lot of fifth starters here. the cubs wo n't
remind anyone of the brave staff , but morgan castillo guzman hibbard
is average to ok...better than the marline. edge to cubs

middle relief

even. the cubs have some decent middlemen , and so do the marlins.
carpenter anf klink or decent , but so are assenmacher and mcelroy.

closer

a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins. meyers is decent , but
no harvey. of course , the cubs may have a few more games to save.
look for 30 saves , 5 blown from meyers , and 25 saves , 3 blown (with
a better era) for harvey. edge florida.

overall , an edge to chicago.
neither of these teams will threaten to win anything , of course.

i would amend your definition to

talent.

ok , the mets and o 's are good examples , but what about the '90 reds \? do you
really think that anyone expected them to sweep the a 's \? i know people who
did n't even think they 'd win a game , let alone win the series.

these people were very silly. any team that gets to the world series
can win the world series , and anybody who ever expects a sweep is
crazy. if you put the best team in baseball in the series against
the worst team in baseball , the worst team would win at least a game
most of the time and very well could win the series , though the odds
would certainly be against them.

not clear to me at all. i 'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
4 1 games than 2 1 games. in the 2 1 game , luck is going to play a much
bigger role than in the 4 1 game.

but you still need the pitching staff to hold the opposing team to

i was watching the dodgers marlins game yesterday and a couple of
things impressed me.

first is that the way the sun was shining in miami , it had a summer
atmosphere in early spring for baseball. in comparison wrigley field
in early april still has a wintry look to it with the dead ivy and
bundled up fans.

the second and most important was the fans. i like these guys gals !
i will admit i am a football fan first but i still enjoy baseball.
it was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the miami dolphins. the way they were cheering , i thought it was the
afc playoffs. of course opening day may have a lot to do with it ,
but i really got feeling of electricity that i think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities.

baseball certainly needs a charge and i hope these two expansion
teams bring back some excitement. we 'll find out friday how denver
bronco fans respond.

mvp votes are conducted by mediots , but given that he got jobbed out of the
mvp he deserved in 1983 , it seems that he was n't overrated by the media.
lee smith \? hmmmm... this one 's actually pretty close. he 's had a s
solid , dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks
(wrigley , fenway...). i 'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it 's been
a while) , but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber.
you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers ,
simply racking up a lot of saves does n't mean a whole hell of a lot if you
blow a bunch , too. simply because minnesota and boston and (for a month)
atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one ,
the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves. no way should
homerman be in the hof , imho.
darrell evans \? nice career , actually a bit underrated (kinda like
ted simmons , imho) , but not a hof'er.

well , in any case , i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards ,
marginal.

lemme ask you this. who the hell playing the game isn't marginal \?

honestly , ozzie smith and robin yount do n't belong there. they 're both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal.
let 's be a little more selective , huh \? stop handing out these honors so
liberally. save them for the guys who really deserve it. face it , if something

now , wait a goddamn minute here. ozzie smith absolutely redefined the
position of shortstop. his defense was so good that he 's won something along
the lines of 10 gold gloves. again , gold gloves are mediot biased , and a
good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzie 's more
recent awards , but usually , this is tempered by someone else in the early
80 's getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career. ozzie 's
offense , you ask \? good obp , great speed numbers , in a park which , for most of his
career , depressed offense , admittedly , no power ('cept against tom niedenfuer
) , but still , a definite asset offensively.
yount \? 3 , 000 hits , mvp at two different positions , uh huh , a real
stiff. his '82 was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory ,
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks , as far as
ss numbers go. he 's a clear hof'er , imho.

is n't done , there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when
certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential
candidates , the absurdity is apparent. gee , can these guys even compare to
the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan \?

well , as far as garvey goes , you 're right. garvey is a mediot
candidate , pushed because of his winning attitude (a minor factor , if one
at all) , and his great defense (no errors , admittedly , but the range of
a tree stump...). garvey should n't be in the hof.
skyjack \? i 've said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last
year or so , but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about morris' ability to win which is nothing more than morris' ability
to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs . at this point , morris is an
average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93 , he may be damned
close to done.). but , in all fairness , morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80 's for up and down tiger teams. while 1984 was (obviously) a great year
for detroit , the rest of the decade , the team was generally in contention , but
not favorites. morris' career numbers are quite good , and worthy of hof
consideration .
ryan \? of course , but be careful. i guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who
hung around a long time . after all , nolan never won a cy... damn , he 's
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years... his w l record is mediocre...
(of course , nolan 's a hof'er...)
puck \? probably , although he 's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years (10 years , even good ones , are n't enough to make the hof , most
likely). that said , i believe puckett will make the hof , pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something really
tragic or sudden). he 's very popular in the media and with fans , and
legitimately has been one of the best cf 's in the game since he joined the
league. i 've always liked the guy , and i hope he does make it. and , in the
end , i think the puck will make it in. but , really , it 's too early to sell.

this debate comes up rather frequently on the net , and , believe it
or not , i never tire of it. it 's an interesting subject. here 's an off
the top of my head list of potential hof'ers from each team. i probably
left a couple of guys off , so feel free to follow up. i wo n't consider anyone
who started playing after about 1985 (again , too early to tell.) note these
are all active players , i'm not counting recent retirees

baltimore cal ripken (should be a lock by now , even if gehrig 's record stands)
boston roger clemens (might be a lock already , which is amazing) , dawson ( \? )
detroit alan trammell and lou whitaker (possibilities)
milwaukee robin yount (discussed earlier)
new york wade boggs (possibly) , mattingly (long shot)
toronto paul molitor and jack morris (possibilities)

kansas city george brett (lock)
minnesota kirby (too early to tell) , winfield (lock)
oakland eckersley (lock) , mcgwire (too early) , rickey (lock) , welch (long shot)
texas the mighty nolan too early to consider canseco or strange )

cubs sandberg (lock)
st. louis ozzie (lock) , lee smith (probably)
new york murray (almost a lock) , saberhagen (obviously , he 's got to regain
past form)
and most certainly , not vince coleman , despite what he 'll tell you )

los angeles butler , strawberry , and hershiser are all long shots.
san diego tony gwynn (pretty good shot)
colorado dale murphy (a good shot) , ryan bowen (just to see if you 're awake)

before i get flames this is an off the top of the head list , there 's
probably a few deserving candidates that i left off , and , i did n't include
barry bonds , will clark , any atlanta starting pitcher , frank thomas , canseco ,
mcgriff , etc. because i only considered guys who started playing before
1985)

i 've been following the giants closely over the off season newspapers ,

the stick.

after watching giants hitters struggle last year , barry 's swing was
very impressive he 's very quick and his swing seems effortless , even
compared to clark (particularly clark as of late).

it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well. i'm not sure if
barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b , 2b , hr) for 5 rbi 's.

the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to bonds. there has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better. clayton 's defense has been superb.
mcgee seems to like leading off this year. manwaring is driving the ball.
so on so forth.

i hope it continues...i think they need to continue well into june before
people are really sold that they are for real particularly the pitching.

for myself , i think the fresh start of magowan baker etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.

subject torre the worst manager \?
organization georgia institute of technology
lines 31

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

for anyone who did n't see sunday 's game ,

with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform , a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey , both right handers.

later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the hell
is he thinking.

earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt , but torre said
he liked gilkey coming off the bench. gilkey hit over 300 last year ,
what does he have to do to start , the guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

furthermore , in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate ,
the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home ,

i ca n't take this anymore

alomar only has a 50 point advantage in the most important offensive
category , while baerga , who studied in the joe carter school of out burning ,
has more impressive mediot stats , largely due to opportunities rather
than quality.

the lines are fairly close in value , but edge to alomar.

the facts are that morris
has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club.
clemens has n't.

what does it take to play on a ws winning club \?

we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris' contribu
tion from the rest of the team 's. there is only one way of determin
ing best in baseball. and that is by looking at the scoreboard at
the end of the game. each game determines which team is the best
that day. at the end of the season , the team that was the best the
most often is the best in the division. the playoffs determine the
best of the best. but the point is that the only decision making pro
cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re
lates to the teams . not the individual players. there is no method
inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances. and that
is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game.

to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab
solutely that player a 's team would have played better with player b
in their lineup. sheer speculation. impossible to ascertain.

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has
done better with those statistics as a criteria , then fine. but you
have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the
individual 's contribution to winning the ws because that is the
only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base
ball. so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham
pionship more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub
jective and is mere opinion. i have yet to see that any of you can
predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon.

the fact is that morris did n't win any ballgames , toronto did , in
spite of morris' contribution . this has been explained to you

exactly. the jays won with morris pitching. and boston wins with
clemens pitching. i am not saying that morris is better than clemens.
i am saying that individual comparisons between players are totally
meaningless and that anyone claiming that clemens is better based on
his era has missed the point of what baseball is all about.

many , many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.

you do n't have to be rude.

you are completely consumed by the post hoc , ergo propter hoc fallacy.

for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of my argument , or you yourself have committed a fallacy ignoratio
elenchi. i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because
he has more rings (although i have , tongue in cheek , claimed
that in the past). i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an
individual 's performance from that of his team 's for the purpose of
comparing that individual 's performance with another individual 's per
formance.

the stats are a nice hobby and that 's about it. there is no new
knowledge being produced. so when a poster claims that morris is better
than clemens because he has more rings , the poster is no more nor less
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

about the infield fly rule
so , if he 's feeling lucky , your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up. if it is n't caught , he 's probably scored
a run. if it is , he 's probably headed for aaa.

unless he 's deion sanders , in which case he just heads back to the
dugout and waits for his next base running blunder opportunity.

no , he 's not nuts , wip is second to none the sports station. they
do n't have tony bruno working espn radio and al morganti doing friday
night hockey because they suck. i live in richmond va , but i visit
phila often , and on the way i get wtem washington) and wip. i hear
the fan at night wherever i go (the signal used to be wnbc , when they
played golden oldies) because you ca n't avoid it. of those three ,
wip has the best hosts hands down. chuck cooperstein is n't a homer ,
and neither is jody mac. wtem is too generic to be placed in the
catergory. in fact if you have heard wtem and the fan you notice the
theme music is identical...same ownership \? \? i think so ! wip is
totally original. their hosts actually have a personality (this is a
knock at tem (the team) not the fan because mike and the mad dog and
sommers are good) i mean comparing the morning guys in philadelphia
to the ones in washington is a total joke. anyway , i like the fan
and wip , but i think the edge goes to 'ip.

when i get back from philly , i go into withdraw cause richmond has
nada except the national sports line (and those guys are totally
clueless)
i was really mad when wcau was cancelled because they had steve
fredericks doing sports phone after the phillies games. (wcau is
another strong station , now it 's an oldies station , but they still
have the phillies) i started listening to the fan because i heard he
went there. i finally heard him last summer and he was n't the same
guy. those ny fans got to him. i was glad to hear him back in
philly when i went to see a few eagles games.


i will admit , i am die hard eagles fan and wip is basically an
eagles station 365 days a year. but , i bet you the phillies are in
control right now.


about the knock on g. cobb , i like him. he knows the eagles like a
book. i remember the weekend before they went to play san fran ,
(when everyone thought the eagles would be blown away) cobb said that
the eagles usually play their best when no one believe they can win.
well they were inches shy of pulling the victory.

mss@netcom.com (mark singer) said

we know that very , very few players at this age make much of an impact
in the bigs , especially when they have n't even played aaa ball.

yes. but this is irrelevant . you 're talking about averages , when we
have lots of information about this player in particular to base our
decisions on.

do you really have that much information on him \? really \?

why is n't lopez likely to hit that well \? he hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such) he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than olson or berryhill did. by a lot.

i do n't know. you tell me. what percentage of players reach or
exceed their mle 's in their rookie season \? we 're talking about
1993 , you know.


as for rushing... if there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and i do n't
believe there is) , then would n't you rather waste lopez 's 22 year old good
season than his 23 year old very good season or his 24 year old excellent
season \? the sooner you get him acclimated , the more of his prime you get to
use.

if that were your purpose , maybe. offerman spent 1992 getting
acclimated , if you will. the dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season. perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant \?


lopez was hitting .588 over 17 ab when he was cut from spring
training. what does he have to do to earn a chance \? maybe not a full
time job , but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove
his worth \?

the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample , but rather that he
had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real , or to send him
down until he gets warmed up .

for a stat head , i'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training. did you notice who he got those 10 ( ! ) hits off of , or
are you going to tell me that it does n't make a difference \?

the kid will improve playing at aaa ,

just like keith mitchell did \?

wait a minute. i missed something here. first , forget keith
mitchell. are you saying that a kid who moves from aa to aaa
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors \? if a player does well at aa and then
does not improve at aaa , is n't that a sign that maybe he does n't
belong in the bigs \?

now , keith mitchell. as i recall (no stat books handy surprise ! )
he jumped from aa to atlanta in 1991. he did so well that he was
returned to the minors , where he did n't do very well at all. now
his career is in jeopardy. so how does he fit in with your
point. good mle 's in aa. moved him right to the big club. now
he 's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.
duh.


that was me , and you so far your only counter proposal is that they
really do n't understand how good lopez is , or overvalue experience ,
or some combination of the two. i think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.

well , i 've cast my lot. certainly you may understand better how
good lopez is. and i may overvalue experience. but neither one
of us runs a baseball team.

argh ! here is where you are obviously dead wrong. not since the yankees
of the 20 's and 30 's has a team been so nicely setup as this years(and
years to come) braves. i do n't think that the all star team will be able
this may be an appropriate comparison.
the 1929 31 yankees finshed 2nd , 3rd and 2nd finshing
18 , 16 and 13 1 2 games out of first.
in 1933 , '34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only
7 , 7 and 3 games out).
even great teams can lose that 's why they play the season.
(on the other hand... i'm still picking the braves to go all the way)

um , surely you did n't intend to compare the '93 reds with the
29 philidelphia a 's. the yankees were finishing 2nd to
a team that was as good as the 26 28 yankees , while the
yankees had aged some from their peak years. ruth and gehrig
could n't play every position simultaneously.

imo , given the various ages of the braves and reds this season ,
that the braves will be closer to their peak , while the reds
have slightly passed their peak.

also , if you 're going to compare braves and yankees , a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 braves might be the '23 yankees.
after falling short two years in a row in exciting world series ,
both teams won will win the series this year , despite the
heroics of some old fart on the other team.
(casey stengel dave winfield \? \? \? )

perhaps so. i was only responding to the yankees of the 20 's and 30 's
part of the comment. if those teams were a 'sure thing' and lost ,
then it 's probably not so unreasonable for someone to pick another
team (not that i did).

hi all you ryno fans (and those interested...)
todays chicago tribune had this written in it today in regards to
ryne sandberg...

ryne sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken
left hand and could be back in the lineup by may 1 , manager jim
lefebvre said friday.
doctors cleared sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his
gloved hand.
'' i'm not surprised his rehabilitation has been moved up , '' said
lefebvre. '' he 's a fast healer , and he does n't like being on the
disabled list. he 's been running since he was hurt march 5 and
is in the best shape of his life. may 1 is his target date for
getting back in the lineup.

from karim edvard ahmed ka0k @andrew.cmu.edu

since i have n't been able to keep up with baseball much this season , i
have a few questions about my favorite team , the minnesota twins

1. how good does their rotation look \? the last i heard , the order is
tapani , erikson , mahomes , banks , and some guy i 've never heard of.
(sounds pretty pathetic to me)

well , maybe it will be. banks is a 24 year old prospect who has n't
matured as quickly as they would have liked. mahomes is a 22 year old
who is very highly touted. tapani and erickson are also young , and
have looked very good this spring. the last spot was between jim
deshaies , formerly of houston and s.d. and mike trombley. deshaies
has n't looked very good this spring , so i believe that the spot has
gone to trombley , although they had n't wanted 3 starters this unproven.
i personally believe very highly in mahomes and trombley.


2. who is playing short and third \?

well , scott leius is the shortstop. he played mostly 3b last year , but
was a ss in the minors , and moved back after gagne left to k.c. 3b is
split (maybe) between pagliarulo , who has had a great spring , and terry
jorgenson , a good looking kid who has languished in portland for 3
years. i'm not sure how the time will be divided , but they seem to be
happy with what they have here. i like jorgenson , but i fear they
might give too much time to pags.

3. how 's winfield doing \?

sorry , ca n't help you here.

frankly , no. offense and defense are equally important. but the
pitcher is 80 of the defense. the primary role of every other player
is on offense. even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive
game than of the defensive game. (they might not do much with their
part of the offense , but that 's another issue.)

that being said , i think both smith and yount deserve the hof. they

insgnia on the front of the jersey. to my knowledge it is the
first time that has been changed since 1962 , and it reminds me
a little of the dodger logo.

as far as i know , toronto , pittsburgh , and new york (nl) change their
uniforms every year. every other year (e.g. , new york) , it will say mets
in cursive , new york in cursive , or new york in all caps. minor changes ,
but they do change them often. last year , i think they had new york in all
caps. did toronto have blue jays or toronto last year \? what about
pittsburgh \?

many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform , or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(phillies , reds , expos , white sox , padres , etc.) and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray. the trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years , as opposed to the cookie cutter saucer stadiums
construcrted throughout the sixties.

i hate the gray. they should opt for more color (like the white sox).
i hate white team versus gray team. spring training uniforms look much
better.

with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs , no one
in the comissioner 's office , and inter league play on the
horizon , it 's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it
was meant to be.

i 've said the braves would improve by injury as well. here 's how.

javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson.
ryan klasko is a better firstbaseman than bream.
chipper jones is a better shortstop than anyone the braves
put out there.

mel nieves is better than nixon sanders.

that 's how. it forces them to play the young guys.

bob gaj

i continue to be amazed at these comments. while lopez might some
day be a better catcher than olson , i find it totally amazing for
you to suggest that this 22 year old with three seasons of professional
baseball is now better than olson , a five year mlb veteran who is
noted for his ability to call a game , and who has a better than average
arm. oh , perhaps you are talking about hitting. well , sure , lopez
might hit better. perhaps he probably will.

but has there ever in the history of baseball been a 22 year old (or
younger) rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
catchers in terms of defense and brought a .247 bat \? was n't it

yes , ivan rodriguez , last year. batted .260 and threw out 51 of the
baserunners. not too shabby for a rookie from aa. 20 years old last
year.

sandy alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year \?
not. was n't it benito santiago who was supposed to be that good
in his rookie year \? not.

i can continue this thread with the others mentioned , but you get
the point. you and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the
seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies. perhaps
just perhaps the management team of the pennant winning braves
knows something more than you do. and perhaps what they know is
that very , very few 21 and 22 year old rookies come up to the majors
and make an impact.

all the braves fans out there that are capable of driving me crazy with that

however , i do have to protest anyone saying that all cubs fans are stupid. the
way i see it , either i'm just too stupid to acknowledge it , or that observation
was just plain wrong. you might have us confused with bear fans. )

anyway , about a two weeks ago just about everyone was saying that the cubs
would finish up last in their division. (even behind florida \? ! \? sheesh ! )
these same people were predicting the braves to clean up in their respective
division. well , we 're ten games into the season and these people are a little
less vocal now. i wonder why.

well , the way i see it , the east is up for grabs , and whoever wants it most is
going to take it , with the exception of florida. every team seems to have
good batting and pitching , with philly presently leading the pack. but , i just
have to point out , if the cubs do take the east , they 'll do it without the

kevin mitchell 's sacrifice fly in the eighth off brett saberhagen plated
pitch runner cesar hernandez to give the reds a 2 3 come from behind victory over
new york. hernandez ran for pinch hitter cecil espy , who got the inning started
with a solid single to right , moved to second on bob kelly 's infield sneaker
down the third base line , and to third on jeff branson 's well placed bunt a
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless reds offense.

cincinnati trailed 2 0 after starter tim pugh blinked in the fifth. he had only
given up one hit in the first four innings , a fourth inning lead off double
by vince coleman. coleman was left stranded at third by bobby bonilla after
joe orselak popped to short. orselak was pinch hitting for eddie murray who
argued plate umpire kellogg 's inside strike by drawing the line (really , he
should know better than that). murray , and later manager jeff torborg ended up getting
tossed.

the mets' fifth started with a howard johnson 's first pitch homer. pugh must
have been slightly shaken , as he was popped on the next pitch by jeff kent 's
single , then a ryan thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by mitchell
and turned into a rbi triple. catcher hundley 's grounder to the drawn in branson
failed to bring thompson in , then the play of the game occured

saberhagen was due up , so reds pitching coach larry rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze. they called it perfectly
thompson was hung out to dry after pugh 's first pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(is n't the national league great \? \? )

the reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game. after barry larkin 's
ground out , mitchell , chris sabo , and randy milligan got back to back to back
singles the third scoring mitchell. reggie sanders then plated sabo with a long
fly to center. a double by oliver might have scored runner dan wilson , but
third base coach dave bristol threw up the stop sign too late wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the reds rally.

rob dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily. with two outs and a runner
on second bonilla came to the plate and all i could think of was the sunday game
in late august last year when bonilla 's three run dinger slapped a loss on
dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for cinci 's season. bonilla ended
up walking , and hojo flied out to left to give the reds their first win in a
week , and earned dibble his third save in as many opportunities. the win went
to steve foster (1 2) who got in what must be an ego boosting two perfect innings
work , striking out three. saberhagen (2 1) got the loss though i'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth. i 'll take it , though.

the reds are now 3 9 , still the worst team in baseball with the royals victory
today. the mets are 6 5.

the year , snow , but with don mattingly at first for another 8 years , why
bother.

i 'd be willing to make two wagers
1) snow does n't win roy.
2) mattingly is out of baseball within five years.

i'm skeptical of the first , because i do n't think snow is that good a
player , and he is on a losing team.

i'm skeptical of the second because of his back. mattingly is 32 this
year , and how many players play until they are 40 \? not too many , and
most of them did n't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

could be wrong on either or both , but i think that 's the smart way to

i agree , though i 'd also be happy with a stadium that looks
like new comiskey. the new park was also made for baseball.
unlike three rivers , the vet , riverfront , etc. , it 's not a
football park in which they also play baseball.

while we 're on the multipurpose subject , let 's not forget shea , which
was designed to accommodate both the mets jets. it was the first
stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be
oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football.

of course , with the jets gone to jersey (and a truly good football
stadium) , the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where ,
because it 's circular , the seats are almost always too far from the
action. the mets announcers kiner murphy in particular have
always hyped it as beautiful shea
stadium , a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is.

one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and has n't
yet been addressed. i believe the rule also does not deal with this
situation

if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught , runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk , as on any fly ball.

however , if the infield fly is not caught , at what point can a
runner legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early \? when the
ball hits the ground \? when a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground \?

enlightenment would be appreciated.

i'm not sure i understand this question. when the if rule is invoked ,
the batter is automatically out. this relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. other
than that , is n't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball \? that is ,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay) , and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

he wanted to shake up the lineup a little , because bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and jerald clark has not been hitting.
he was true to his word i went to thursday 's game and gerald young
was in right and daryl boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
baylor was careful to say though that he did n't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while clark and bichette were not playing well.

in defense of bichette , it looks like right field in mile high stadium
is a bitch to play. some of the visiting outfielders have been having

i am participating in an nl league that uses standard rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used

for position players
lowest batting average
strike outs
caught stealing
errors

for pitchers
losses
blown saves
higest era
'taters allowed

this is the fifth year that i 've participated in this blowtisserie
league. last year i won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
i had terrible pitching. i would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because i do have jose offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors). anyway ,
someone offered

andres gallaraga for bud black

i can afford to give up bud black because i still have kyle abbott.
however , i am afraid of andres actually doing well this season.
should i make the trade or not \?

your comments will be appreciated.

after reading my local paper today , i found out that the phillies
started the 1964 season at 10 2. i am not as old as 1964 , but i 've
heard many talk about the serious choke job the phillies did that
season. they were ahead of the cardinals by 15 games that season in
mid august. they managed to lose a bunch from then on and the
cardinals took the division. 15 ! ! ! games ahead and lost it.... i
hope this season is much different.


strictly from memory , i think the phillies were something like
ten games up with 12 to go , lost 10 in a row , and 11 of last 12
to lose to the cardinals. seems impossible , but thats how i
remember it. i also felt at the time that johnny callison of
the phillies lost the mvp as a by product of their swoon.

assuming you 're serious , i guess you 'd be surprised to hear
that us guys do n't think so. i would guess that a tiny fraction
of 1 of the folks reading your post agree with it. i kind of
doubt that even you agree with it.

i'm not going to go through your points one at a time , because ,
after all , not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.

i'm only replying to this because you brought up pam postema , the
aaa umpire who sued (is suing \? ) baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she was n't promoted to the majors.

jeez ! look at pam postema. just because she 's a woman , everybody on the
face of the earth thinks it 's great that she 's getting an opportunity to
ump. if you even watched the games and had an iq greater than that of
roast beef , you 'd see that she is not nearly as good as most aaa umpires.

i 've never seen her ump a game. i have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire.

but i have seen her on talk shows. and her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. it seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that 's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game , well i would n't promote her
either.

the umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out hell , joe lundy could do that. their primary function is
to maintain order in the game , keep the game moving , and keep the
players from trying to kill each other.

umpires have to be extremely tough people. that disqualifies most
of us , both men and women. and if ms. postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook , then i think that disqualifies her as well. umpires
need to command the game command of the rulebook is secondary.

this is an interesting line. his 1988 figure was slightly below average.
his 1990 was pathetic , and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody. part of
that may be his mobility. 1988 was with the yankees. 1990 was with the
padres , who appear to have a rotten infield. 1991 was with the twins , and
judging by leius and gaetti , the metrodome may be a good place to play

i like to think they have good players in any park. not sure if i remember
completely or not , but i think gaetti played with the twins in '87 for the
world series , and again in '88 (note that 's his lowest of the 4). i believe
the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played with the angels. lots
of factors make a player excell... i hate it when so many use the dome.

philadelphia at chicago teams tied for 1st after sunday
dick redding battled chet brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series. one friday , one saturday , and a good old sunday doubleheader.
what could be better , declared ernie banks. perhaps the fact that the cubs
are challenging \?
it 's pitching , it 's always been pitching that we 've lacked , announced
ryne sandberg. if we can get by brewer , then beat carlton , alexander , or
bunning preferrably 2 of the last three we 'll know we might be able to
win.
lord , i hope we pull it off.
the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled , pete
rose followed with a hit , sending ashburn around second. kiki cuyler cut
the ball off in left center , and threw a bullet in to ernie banks , who threw
to ron santo to get ashburn at third. rose went to second on the play.
christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center , moving pete rose to
third. schmidt was walked the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them. both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw 130 150 walks this
year. chuck klein is starting to hit very well , and he lashed a double into a
gap in right center. cool papa bell 's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent schmidt from scoring. nellie fox was walked , and bob boone
grounded out to second , ending the threat.
teams are starting to realize that you do n't have to pitch to schmidt or
torrienti , and that is lowering their run total. it puts a lot of pressure on
klein and dick allen (who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells
rose at first) , and it 's a credit to the phillies that they 've been able to
sustain their pace. the picthers have slumped at times. so came the
analysis from frank chance.
the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit , thomas' grounder
moved him to second , and after sandberg made out billy williams singled
home a run. in the sixth , ron santo launched a two run homer to make it
3 1. dick redding got in trouble in the eighth , as schmidt singled and klein
singled him to third. ed reulbach entered to face fox , but dick allen popped
out of the dugout to hit. allen doubled to right , but luckily for the cubs ,
williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense.
he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third. lance parrish , hitting
for boone , was walked , and bruce sutter entered. larry bowa grounded into
a 1 2 3 double play , but ed delahanty walked as a pinch hitter. desiring a
strikeout , since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
trillo pinch running at third , chance brought in lee smith , who induced a
pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder , ending the inning. the
cubs took the win , 3 2 , moving a game behind the phillies.
steve carlton was called upon to battle 3 finger brown saturday. to get
another righthander in the lineup , ron santo moved to first and bill madlock
played third. unfortunately , brown allowed six doubles , and the cub bullpen
was worn down even more , as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against
lefty. madlock , batting sixth , had knocked two doubles of his own , driving
home four runs. gabby hartnett hit two home runs , and cuyler added
another , and the score was 8 6 , cubs after six innings. the phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth , as the cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11 7 triumph.
sunday 's twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one
point , including a rare outside the park home run in the second game , off
robin roberts. grover alexander of the phils took the first contest , 4 2 , but
the cubs captured the second one 5 4 , with waddell gaining the win. bruce
sutter tossed two innings for the save , though he allowed one run in the
eighth. the cardinals stood half a game behind these co leaders , and would
conclude their series with the expos on monday.

montreal at st. louis(august 3 6) 3 way tie for 1st
dennis martinez is on a roll , and he continued it versus john tudor friday.
the expos have a wide variety of hitters , and while they are n't among the
all time greats , they are getting the job done. after winning their first
first two games , they suddenly found themselves only 2 1 2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
martinez triumphed 5 3 on friday , and williams outdueled dizzy dean 3 2
saturday. however , the cardinals refused to give up , winning 6 2 on sunday.
the cards captured monday 's game , too , as steve carlton outdueled steve
rogers 3 2. we 're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed , remarked lou brock. i do n't see why we ca n't win this
division.
the phillies and cubs may have some reasons for them. two thirds of
the way through the season , there is a 3 way tie for first.

new york at pittsburgh(august 3 6) 3 straight 3 2 wins for bucs ,
now 2 back but in 4th !
when your team is in a slump like we are , the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher 's park like this , spoke gil hodges before the series. keith
hernandez added that their defense takes away quite a few runs per year ,
and it must be giving them an extra 6 7 wins. the pirates have made only
26 errors all season , 6 ahead of the second place dodgers. error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive all time teams.
rube foster defeated sid fernandez 5 2 friday , and candelaria outshone
seaver 3 2 saturday , in a game featuring some outstanding defense. when
nolan ryan and two relivers 6 hit the mets in another 3 2 win sunday , the
pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark. they had been unable to several times in the past month. bert
blyleven met dwight gooden in the afternoon game. both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff , and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs a solo shot by rusty staub of the mets and a two run blast by ralph
kiner for the pirates. the mets' darryl strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off jesse orosco , working his second inning , after mookie
wilson pinch ran for gary carter at second. with one out and a runner on
first , lee mazilli was sent in to pinch hit. the pirates countered with kent
tekulve , placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting barry bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter. tekulve induced a groundout forcing
strawberry at second. he slid hard into honus wagner , preventing the
pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon. tekulve
allowed a hit , but clemente threw mazilli out at third from near the right
field line , ending the inning. tug mcgraw relieved randy myers , who entered
to pitch the eighth , and got one out before bonds launched a rocket to deep
center , running through the stop sign at third to score an inside the park
homer to win. the pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3 2 wins ,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place , with seven weeks to go.

san francisco at boswaukta(august 3 5)
another sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule , as the giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just would n't tire. in fact , reported manager john mcgraw ,
once this rough part of the schedule is over , maybe as early as this coming
week , we may shift to a 4 man rotation again for a little while.
juan marichal continued his hot pitching friday , beating lew burdette and
the braves 4 1. willie mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits. rick reuschel
faced joe niekro saturday in a slugfest. the braves' park had been a homer
haven , but this took the cake , as the giants won a seesaw affair 16 13.
willie mays had three homers , willie mccovey , eddie matthews , and don
baylor had two , and hank aaron , ernie lombardi , biz mackey , and mel ott had
one each. the braves had collected 149 home runs going into sunday 's
doubleheader , putting them on a pace for 223 , which would be 4 short of the
national league record. they were still a tad behind the '61 yankees' pace.
they had allowed over 120 , though. vida blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth. he allowed only a run in the sixth , but
faltered in the seventh. joe mcginnity earned the save.
in the doubleheader , the braves' hoyt wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game , but hank aaron homered off bill foster in the eighth as the
braves won , 4 3. the giants took the second game , however , by a 6 2 score.
the homer by aaron was a magical 150 by the braves however , they fell to
three game below .500 , making a comeback extremely unlikely.

san diego at cincinnati(aug. 3 5) randy jones faced ewell
blackwell in the first of this 3 game series , and the padres felt rather
good. with don mattingly straining his back in the last cleveland game , the
trade looked even better. mcgriff 's batting average was even rising. of
course , the bench was very poor , and joe gordon was only adequate in the
outfield , but these were minor problems , since the pitching was holding up.
jones pitched a good game friday , and won 6 3. mcgriff launched two
home runs. mel harder earned a win with the help of mark davis and ray
narleski saturday 5 4 was the final score. tom candiotti battled satchel
paige to a 3 3 tie through eight innings before departing. the game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth. paige had departed after
10 , and john franco hurled a scoreless inning. tom browning was working
his second scoreless inning , when dave winfield doubled with one out and
joe gordon was pitched around. thurm munson doubled both runners home ,
and the padres gamed a 5 3 win. the three game sweep had pulled the
giants into a tie with the reds. though the reds denied it , the highly
emotional series with the dodgers may have taken too much out of them.

brookangeles at houston(august 3 5)
another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the astrodome. the astros sent joe niekro to the hill in
the first game , opposite don drysdale. normally , drysdale remarked , i
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them. i ca n't afford
to with this team , though we have to get our own runners going we ca n't
afford to let the astros beat us. he then winked and said well , maybe
davis will get decked once.
the fact that glenn davis leads the team in homers with six ( ! ) is
primarily why he would be decked , but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season. the hitting on this team is
a little better , but the power is all doubles and triples. still , carl furillo is
the main reason no astro home runs were hit over the weekend , as he threw
two runners out trying for inside the park homers. for those unaware of
the nastness of the astros' park , they have a 23 foot high gray wall all
around the outfield balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs. the
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate , but the alleys are 400 feet away ,
with center field at 420 feet. it 's as if some three year old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates 'if i ca n't hit home runs , nobody will hit
home runs' , remarked roy campanella.
the dodgers stole five bases friday , but the astros decided to revitalize
the baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before for tonight , anyway ,
davis , jim wynn , and jose cruz did not have to mess with their swings ,
according to the manager. after poles and willie wells reached base via the
baltimore chop , drysdale decked jose cruz with a pitch. he responded with
a two run double , but wynn playing first for davis popped up , and the
astros did n't score any more in that inning. they did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3 2 deficit , and the astros wound up winning 6 4. they threatened
to do even better the next game , as tommy john would be their opponent.
walt alston met privately with the starters at 6 a.m. before the game.
i think i know how we can beat the baltimore chop , he explained.
how can we do that , pee wee reese wondered.
they 're going to be beating the ball down , so we 've got to be ready to
throw on the run. steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt , but i
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws. we 'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.
the plan almost worked. mike scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings , but the astros got three two of them scored when bill doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third. 3 2 astros was the final , with dave smith earning another save. the
dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill sunday , as nolan
ryan walked five , three of whom scored in a 4 1 dodger win. fernando
valenzuela lost the second game 4 2 to don sutton , however , as the dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
we 're mostly a power team , remarked ron cey. jackie and , when he
plays , maury wills are our only real speed demons , though a couple other
plays can do it now and then. we 're sunk in a place like the astrodome. i
guess that 's why they 're so successful there. indeed , it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome. the 'stros
swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts , giving them 230 on the season.

the walks should give it away. obp 's , in general , somewhat more valuable than
slugging , and alomar 's edge in obp was quite a bit larger than baerga 's edge
in slugging.

i'm no sdcn , but what 's more valuable

28 hits w 5 more doubles , 12 more hrs or
7 more triples and 52 bbs \? (let 's not forget the 39 extra sbs. how many cs \? )

alomar had 9 cs. baerga had 2.

do n't forget the 59 more outs baerga had (his gidp balances out his cs , and
he had one more sacrifice than alomar). a replacement level second baseman
could have had 17 hits , 5 walks , and a couple of xbh for the additional
outs baerga had. a triple is little different than a home run. we 're talking
exchanging almost 60 walks for six or seven home runs and four doubles. i
would say the almost 60 walks are more valuable.

also , alomar got a far greater boost from his home park than baerga did from
his. and six or seven home runs \? hmm.

so , if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in toronto , you 'd take
alomar. anywhere else , and you 'd probably take baerga.

did anyone notice the words not for baseball printed on the picture
of joe robbie stadium in the opening day season preview section in usa
today \? any reason given for this \?

also , i just noticed something looking at the nolan ryan timeline in
the preview. on 8 22 89 , rickey henderson became nolan 's 5000th strikeout.
on 6 11 90 he pitched his 6th no hitter against oakland. i believe the
last out in the game was made by rickey henderson. and on 5 1 91 , nolan
pitched his 7th no hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base , which overshadowed it. it seems that nolan is having a lot of
publicity at rickey 's expense. imo , rickey deserves it , and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what i 've seen on it lately. they are
both great players , but imo , nolan has outclassed rickey , both in playing
and more importantly , in attitude. just my thoughts.

subject proposed catcher re sub rule
organization brookhaven national laboratory , upton , ny 11973
lines 19

a lot of teams carry 3 catchers on their 25 man roster ,
but the 3rd catcher is seldom ever used. he is only
insurance in case of extra innings or the 2nd catcher
is injured during a game. so to free up this roster
spot for an extra pinch hitter or reliever , why not
invoke a catcher re substitution rule

if the last roster catcher on a team is
injured during a game , the team is permitted
to substitute in his place for defensive purposes
a catcher who has previously been yanked from
the game.

given this rule , a team would n't need 3 roster
catchers. the 3rd catcher could be playing
in aaa or be a non roster bullpen catcher.

this is an interesting line. his 1988 figure was slightly below average.
his 1990 was pathetic , and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody. part of
that may be his mobility. 1988 was with the yankees. 1990 was with the
padres , who appear to have a rotten infield. 1991 was with the twins , and
judging by leius and gaetti , the metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

gaetti , gary .616 .638 .655 .632 0.637

apologies if i do n't know what i'm talking about ) , but as a twins fan ,
i like to think they have good players in any park. not sure if i remember
completely or not , but i think gaetti played with the twins in '87 for the
world series , and again in '88 (note that 's his lowest of the 4). i believe
the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played with the angels.

actually , gaetti 's first year with california was 1991. his .632 da was n't
out of line with his career averages , and his .616 was actually below average
in 1988. but check out the last three years at the metrodome.

for the last three years , the highest das in either league have been posted
by minnesota players three different ones , including one (pags) who was
mediocre to horrible elsewhere. that does n't prove a park effect is at
work , any more than san diego 's horrible infield numbers prove a park effect
is at work. but it looks like a strong possibility to me.

were completed before the first pitch. )

al east
1. new york yankees the most (only \? ) improved team in this division
2. toronto blue jays stewart and morris \? no way.
3. milwaukee brewers they always seem to do better than i expect
4. baltimore orioles pitching , but devareaux , anderson , and hoiles will drop
5. cleveland indians still do n't seem to know what they are doing
6. detroit tigers all key players but fryman are another year past peak
7. boston red sox any team with clemens and viola might be beter than 7th

al west this division was the toughest for me to pick. whoever of the top
4 gets pitching should win it.
1. minnesota twins young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2. texas rangers i do n't know why i have them here. jose canseco \?
3. chicago white sox frank thomas but no pitching.
4. oakland a 's larussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5. seattle mariners i like pinella , but do n't see much here
6. kansas city royals will score no runs
7. california angels will win no games

nl east
1. montreal expos good all around , plus no wallach !
2. st. louis cardinals (jeffries whiten) (jose clark) , no galarraga
3. pittsburgh pirates youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4. new york mets some good players , still not a team
5. philadelphia phillies they do n't impress me
6. florida marlins they know what they 're doing
7. chicago cubs they do n't know what they 're doing

nl west the 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1. atlanta braves awesome starters , but offense could be a concern
2. cincinnati reds would not surprise me if they won it all
3. houston astros any team that signs uribe wo n't contend. closer to 4 than 2
4. san diego padres plantier could be the sheffield of 1993
5. los angeles dodgers better pitching than the giants
6. san francisco giants because the rockies just stink
7. colorado rockies will become the seattle mariners of the nl.

right. so who cares which player gets credited , as long as the team
gets more runs \? if a player helps the team get more r and rbi , but
does n't score them all himself , who cares \?

amusing , is n't it \? seems only the sdcns realize how much baseball is
a team game , combining efforts from every player for the win.

consider the red sox game last night. the sox won 4 3 in the bottom
of the 13th. who won the game \?

clemens pitched a strong nine ( \? ) innings , allowing only two runs.
ryan pitched a couple shutout innings , though he needed some excellent
defensive plays behind him to do so.
quantrill pitched a couple of innings , gave up the go ahead run , and
got credited with the win when the sox scored two in the bottom of
the inning.

looks like a team effort to me ! yet only quantrill got credit for
the win.

how about the offense \?
dawson and vaughn hit (i think) hrs early in the game. without either
one , the sox would have lost in nine.
quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.
zupcic pinch ran for quintana , providing the speed to go from first
to third when...
cooper ripped a second single in the inning.
melvin avoided the dp , getting the run home with a sac fly. not much of
a help , but it was something.
scrub richardson then hit a double , scoring the speedy cooper all the
way from first ! (hill 's lack of defense helped.)

cooper and zupcic were credited with runs , melvin and richardson were
credited with rbis. but it seems to me that it was quintana 's hit
that set up the whole inning ! and did melvin really contribute as
much as richardson \?

furthermore , people seem to consider rbis to be more significant than
runs. did melvin contribute more than cooper \? cooper provided the
game winning baserunner , and moved the tying run to third base with
only one out !

assigning credit based on runs and rbis is clearly ridiculous. you
can argue that obp and slg do n't show you who came through in the
clutch , but r rbi do n't do any better. at least obp and slg do n't
claim to try to tell you that.

i'm still catching up from spring break , but bear with me...

in the bigs , especially when they have n't even played aaa ball. we
certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day , but
there is really no need to rush him , especially since we have a mega
million dollar staff that is probably well served by a battery mate
who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling. lopez'
time will come. let 's give him some time in aaa.


javy lopez has proven , over 1400 ab in the minor leagues , that he is
ready to play in the majors. he is not being rushed. players who are
clearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time , and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them , at aaa.

no. maybe i need to improve my writing skills. lopez , who is very
ordinary defensively , is not likely to hit so well at age 22


unless lopez is me defensively (i'm 5'7'' , 165 and born to play
second base )) , he belongs in the major leagues.

training. what does he have to do to earn a chance \? maybe not a full
time job , but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove
his worth \?

gee. i do n't know. 17 abs sounds pretty good to me ! about as good
as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather
than start every day at aaa. talk about me as a gm...

valentine is n't saying he should back up. he 's saying he should be put
in a position to win the job in the major leagues , which , imho , he
would if given the opportunity. (val , if i'm misinterpreting , please
let me know.)

so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez
1) he is very ordinary defensively.
2) he is young , and most players suck when they are young.

the first is irrelevant. he 's trying to make the majors with his bat.
and the second involves seriously warped reasoning.

valentine

ok. most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22 (see current
related posting on clayton , one of my favorites). most players
benefit , rather than being stagnant or hurt , by playing at aaa.
most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs. those are the arguments against lopez for the
braves for this year.

but the players who are ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors. javy lopez is not a middle
of the road prospect. he 's the real thing. now.

again , the most important thing a player can do is hit. lopez does that
miles better than olson or berryhill. if his defense is good enough for
greenville , or richmond , it 's good enough for atlanta. if he really was
awful defensively , he would no longer be a catcher. see sprague , ed.

now. the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games , to work with the pitchers , to throw out
runners. not superstars mind you , but solid , experienced veterans.
the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the
outfield , an excellent platoon at first , a solid mvp candidate
at third and one of the better hitting shortstops. the center
field platoon will probably hit .300. however good lopez'
what they have to offset the differential in experience and
defensive ability. the kid will improve playing at aaa , and
he probably wo n't being a reserve with the big club.

oh , where to start... ok. first of all , solid ! good. i want good players.
solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
are n't very good at baseball. think of it as twg without the caps.
it 's a losing strategy to say , we have solid guys , we do n't need to improve.
you used it four times in that paragraph , btw.

same for experienced. i might add , though , that greg olson and damon
berryhill are n't exactly carter and fisk. olson has played three years ,
berryhill five , although 90 and 91 were a wash. the only difference ,
imho , between olson and valle is the supporting cast.

two big bats. hrm. i like justice , but i find mr. gant 's trend disturbing.
call it one and a maybe. the braves' platoon is ok , but neither player
has any value outside of the platoon. bream vs. lh and hunter vs. rh
are awful. i 'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already. if the cf platoon hits .300 , i 'll retrace
mr. likhani 's midnight run down forbes , and i live in ny and la.
(got that , mike \? )

and does n't cox call pitches , anyway \?

goodness. do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez
is being held down because of his future earning potential \?
why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision \?
are they idiots who have built this ballclub \? jeeeesh...

nope. they 're baseball management , possible the most short sighted
collection of people in the nation. do you not believe this goes on ,
mark \? do you think frank thomas needed those three months in aaa in
1990 \? or cal eldred was n't really better than ricky bones last year \?

and i'm the treasure...

viola is younger , and is left handed (how many left handed starters does

well , i agree that viola is a better signing. however , why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters \? i understand lefthanded
spot relievers , even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters. i just do n't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters , unless there is a park effect (e.g. , yankee stadium).
most batters in mlb are righthanded , so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
i guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to lhp 's than rhp 's. however , this is probably
only a factor in the postseason , because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

i think you just want the best starters you can get , regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties. lefthanded starters tend to have
higher era 's than righthanded starters , precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

am i missing something here \?

back in september i was listening to wip , and i remember the morning
guys were talking with mayor ed rendell. the topic of conversation
was a new ball park for the phillies. the location for this new park
was suggested to be near 30th st station. at the time , the mayor was
optimisitic that in the future this could become a reality. has
there been any new news on this subject or is it still a pipe dream \?
i know the city of philadelphia has other projects ahead , such as the
new convention center and the upcoming spectrum ii. but it would be
nice to see this a reality. it is planned that the phillies leave
the vet and leave it solely to the eagles (and if that 's the case ,
the eagles should make the vet a grass stadium , but that 's another
story). i want to see that day !

above) and the expos bullpen (barnes , walton , fassero , gardiner and
rojas) have been the prime target. apparently john wetteland was roughed
up by the ack people during spring training due to the fact that his
system rejected the takeover , and has been on the dl ever since. contact
the authorities ! this evil plot must be stopped ! (the ack people can

every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball
being 50 offense , 50 defense. a run scored is just as important as a run
prevented.

this certainly passes the common sense test for me , but is there any
statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what
percent is fielding \? i 'd really like to know. btw , sherri , thanks for
the da data i find it fascinating.

of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
just as a penny saved is a penny earned. enough with the cliches.
my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to
their potential , they wo n't need much offensive support.
i realize this is a big if. this staff leaves the '92 bosox in the dust.
there is no legitimate comparison. two cy young winners , and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter. it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound , the other teams score less runs. the team that scores the most
runs wins. this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). a low
scoring game would clearly benefit the braves. they should have many
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
on the flip side , if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players ,
i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
they would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent. the name of the games is to win. even ray knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
all i'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the braves have , the offense does n't need to be as strong.

subject rbi , risp , and slg
organization bill 's safety cab and record bar , chickasha , ok
lines 49

off and on over the last several months , threads about rbis and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can
predict a player 's rbis using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position (risp)
that he bats with. in the brock2 model , bill james calculated
predicted rbis as rbi .235 (total bases) home runs. this
completely ignores the context , which was all that brock2
could do , since context was unknown to it. so i thought i 'd
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing (rbi home runs) to slg risp.

i 've started with team data , using data from the elias 's that
i 've picked up over the years when a) i could afford them and
b) i could stomach the thought of increasing elias 's profits.
that gave me the years 1984 1986 , 1988 , and 1990. (i do n't
have team rbis for '87 or i could add that year.) if you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get

(rbi home runs) 0.81 slg risp.

the correlation between the lhs and the rhs is 0.86 , which is
significant at a ridiculously high level. so , i feel like the
fit is good at the team level. i 've no started to move on to
the player level and have looked at 4 players (will clark ,
ozzie smith , joe carter , and don mattingly). i hope to
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.

it does n't do too badly , except the equation underpredicts the
low hr hitter (smith) , which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be ozzie. the results

rbi hr
years actual predicted
carter (84 88 , 90) 400 402.6
clark (87 , 88 , 90 , 92) 269 269.6
matt'ly (84 88 , 90) 471 460.8
smith (84 88 , 90) 317 280.6

i think we can make a case (and i hope to make it stronger) that
rbis can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

more later ,

can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let 's , for
argument 's sake , define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger , and performing below
expectations) , whose career was damaged by this rushing \?

i tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
the braves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis , as they
had little talent on their roster for some time. steve avery , for example ,
was rushed to the majors , and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
his subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5 era during his rookie
year. bill james pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound.

bob horner was also rushed to the majors (out of arizona state directly) had
good numbers immediately.

i am not certain of the ages of people like pete smith , craig mcmurty , and
derek lilliquist. the braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed. lilliquist and smith struggled , but it
did n't hurt ps and dl may have been overhyped. i seem to recall cm pitching
well initially , though i do n't have stats handy.

you all know how things turned out. the orioles , red sox , and yankees
all disappeared. the jays and tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace. the brewers and indians cranked in the second half.

the rangers predictably took a dive. that should n't have surprised
anybody. meanwhile , as predicted , the mariners dropped behind the
angels and royals. they clearly did n't deserve the 22 33 record in
june. the white sox and a 's upped their game a bit , while the twins
dropped off a little. but for the most part things were as expected.

okay , so there were a few blatant errors. but for a predictive
calculation , i thought this did pretty well.

was n't released until the end of the year. i wo n't comment on the
bullpen. (jeff reardon \? \? \? )

2. blauser wins the starting shortstop job outright by the end

honeymoon (a la gregg jefferies in 1988) platooning with hunter.
mitchell wins the center field job a bit later (all star break \? ) and
nixon stays on as a valuable pinch runner. lonnie is released unless
the braves find a taker in a trade.

right on blauser. wrong on bream and mitchell. a bit early on
lonnie , as with bielecki. did n't pick sanders. (did anybody \? )

he will be back up to his previous standards (i think he will be better)
90 rbi 's is not that much of a stretch.

sometimes us statheads get lucky. grace did n't hit behind dawson
the entire season , but he also finished with only 79 rbis.

the most ballsy prediction ever

mark mcgwire will hit 61 or more hrs this year.

nope. he slowed down , and the injury finished him off. did n't
even reach 50. but a ballsy prediction , nonetheless.

(1) baltimore will not fade. they will not win the division this year ,
but they will finish within five games. i find the prospect of two
orioles winning 20 each easier to comprehend than that of two sox.
no offense i think their pitching is about as good as the division
has to offer.

the orioles finished seven games out. none of them won 20 (though
mussina might have had a chance , with better relief and more starts).

(2) nobody else in the division is worth a darn. they all finish a minimum
of fifteen games out , the tribe 30. that 's another reason to watch
baltimore this year and next they wo n't waste many of those games
against the rest of the division.

except for the brewers (who you probably forgot) , you were right ! the
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre. the yankees and indians
led with 76 wins , the red sox trailed with 73 wins. none were
horrible , but four were five or more games below .500.

right. that was me. i never said the jays were a cinch to clinch it
but i said that milwaukee will be more of a threat than baltimore. i
do think that toronto should win it but after '87 i do n't consider
anything a cinch unless you have something like a 4 game lead with 3
games to go. i do think that the jays have the best talented team in
the al east and if we had a good , or even average manager we might
have a bigger lead right now. i also think that the orioles will not
play much better than .500 baseball for the rest of the season.

you win !

1. jose rijo will win the 1992 cy young award if he is healthy enough to go
at least 210 ip. (who would have thought he would try to steal a base \? why
risk such an injury \? \? \? )

he had 211 ip , but did n't win the cy young. maddux surprised all.

2. the orioles will win 88 games in at least 3 of the next 6 years
(probably the last 3) and their pitching staff will have a team era
among the best 4 in the al in at least 3 of the next 6 years (but not
necessarily all the same years as they win 88 ). this one will take a
long time to verify.

i do n't think i want to wait that long. but they won 89 games last
year , and they were fifth in the league in era. not a bad start.

4. ben mcdonald will not challenge for an era title in the next 2
years , nor will he have 18 victories either year. (by challenge , i
mean finish among the leaders being among the leaders before the
season is done does n't count.) he will probably never be the pitcher
he was hyped to be , but is still a decent starter to have.

looks like it. he was n't bad last year , just too consistent to be an
ace. so far this year looks like more of the same.

5. the phillies will give up many fewer walks if when they get rid of their
bullpen coach (ryan). (i am not predicting when or whether they will get rid
of him , and you will have to give the team a little bit of time to adjust
before seeing the radical change. they would have a fine pitching staff if
they would just steal ray miller away from pittsburg. the white sox seem to
have the same problem , but not as bad.)

i honestly ca n't say. did they get rid of him \? their bb totals were
down last year.

7. ricky jordan will have 90 rbi if he starts 145 games , hitting in
the 3 or 4 or 5 spot in any lineup or the 6 spot in a lineup with very
good obp in the 4 , 5 hitters. this applies for each of the next 3
years.

i just do n't think he 's that good....

12. billy ripken will never again hit over .240 with 400 ab.

are the o 's going to sign cal , of is eli 's wallet welded shut (outgoing
money only , wide open for incoming cash 8 ))

my prediction (which you may make note of , valentine ) ) , is that eli jacobs
will defer any serious negotiations on cal ripken 's contract until the '92
season is over. eli will give cal every opportunity to have his stats tumble
a bit from last year 's pace before coming forth with an offer.

(despite claims that op@cy was designed to cal 's strength , my feeling is that
the 411 foot left center canyon will cut down on cal 's power stats.)

after all , it 's hard to credibly to offer 3 4 million year to an
all star game mvp al mvp gold glove shortstop baseball deity )
but it 'd be a lot easier to offer a similar salary to an obviously
declining but above average shortstop who had a career year one full
season ago.

of course , if cal does match his '91 numbers , then eli is going to be faced
with a rather huge (and expensive) problem...

how much did cal sign for \? when did he sign \? if i remember
correctly , he got a rather hefty contract despite a weak season.

generally , because of expansion in 1993 , there will be a lot of
mediocre talent hanging around. much of it will not make it , as the
expansion teams look for younger talent around which to build their
teams. my specific predictions

as of april 7 , 1993

jim acker and cory snider will be selling aluminum siding.

snyder is still in sf. acker is gone \? \?

neither charlie kerfeld nor vance lovelace (presently in tiger aa but
formerly big leaguers) will be playing professional ball.

they are n't in the majors.

nor will dave rozema (who says he 's keeping in shape with a hope for
another shot with expansion).

never heard of him.

shawn hare and jody hurst will be in the major leagues.
(they are outfielders in the tiger minor league system)

i do n't think they are in the majors.

ron hassey will be a minor league manager with the yankees.

dunno what happened to him.

it will be bye bye for balboni.

if he 's still around , he 's stuck in the minors.

bo jackson will not be a starter.

hm. with raines out , bo looks to get a lot of pt.

gary huckaby will have moved to alaska permanently (they 're on the
net ! ) ,

)

and dave kirsch will return to canada to live.

an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season

the confrontation with bobby bonilla a few days ago , i almost

baltimore on saturday , july 31st. i have n't been to the new park ,
and i was wondering if anyone out there can give me pointers or good tips
or anything helpful about the place so that i can enjoy every moment spent
there.
for instance , what time do the gates open \? do we see the orioles take bp \?
when will the red sox take bp \? anything you can tell me would be
appreciated. thank you in advance.
please respond to my e mail address.
i know it 's still three and a half months away , but i'm psyched !

2)tartabull. the book on tartabull was , keep him healthy and
he 'll produce. well , he has n't done too much so far. sure. he 's
hit a few homers , but those were all solo shots , and he has n't
gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed
to give you. then again , he had a slow start last year (once he
got off the dl , that is) and turned into a one man wrecking crew
see you in the series !

alan


let 's see... april 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he
has n't done too much so far !

cut this guy some slack. danny will produce this year. it 's scary to think
just how much he 'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.

the yanks have a lot going for them this year good starting rotation , good
bullpen , good defense and a good lineup. also , i like buck showalter. frank
howard on 1st is also a good move. everything sounds good so far.

if the yanks stay healthy , they have a good chance at winning the pennant. this

in article 1qr05cinnpel@skeena.ucs.ubc.ca stlouis@unixg.ubc.ca (phill st. louis) writes
jack morris' starts have been like his playoff starts. he has an era of
17.18 in his 3 starts.

what does luck have to do with a 17.18 era \? he was lucky to get 21 wins
last year , but he had an era of 4.04 with a team that scored a lot of
runs. i would be happy if he could still pitch with an era of 4.04 , but
he seems to be suffering from a total callapse.

bad pitchers are more prone to this total collapse than good pitchers.
they are closer to the chasm of mediocrity. the smallest push and
they completely lose their grip.

but good ones can collapse somewhat , then come back the next year.
burleigh grimes went from 20 wins and an era of 3 or so in '24 to 13 19 and
an era around 4 in '25. he pitched well for several more years. carlton
won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27 10 record. (source bill james
historical baseball abstract.)
and let 's not forget john tudor , who started 1 5 and finished 21 6 in
1985. he had a pretty bad era when you take busch stadium into account at
the start of the season.

he gave up early runs
in his '92 games and would get stronger as the game went on , thus giving
up few runs in the last going. he stays in the game and gets the win.
how else would he have pitched so many innings \?

yup. he used to dig himself a hole , then get it together and stick in
until the run support eventually came through. this year he just
has n't gotten it together.

if i recall , he had a 4.50 era in the 1st half and a 3.50 era in the
2nd half of last year.
hmmm , 21 runs in 11 innings. suppose he starts 30 more games , and winds
up w 200 innings pitched. if he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
innings , he 'll have a 4.75 era or so at the end of the year. (i think i have
his totals right.) this is going to be hard to come back from.

jack may be finished. it is time to retire or be released , if he does
not return to his form from last year.

his 5 million contract is an awful lot to eat !

my 1st hunch is that morris is very gutsy , and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone. my 2nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.
(perhaps when stewart comes off the dl \? or will danny cox , who went 3 or 4
scoreless innings against the tribe today , start for morris \? he looks like
a really good one. gaston is scrambling to find starters , i 'd imagine.
luckily , the jays have a very good offense.)
i do n't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.
he 'll just be replaced by stewart or cox.

nntp posting host andrew.cmu.edu


so far simmons looks like a total idiot.


1) zane smith should learn how to switchpitch and return from the dl. i
would rather have zane smith pitch right handed than have moeller pitch at all.

2) i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an
impressive win last week. now otto 's latest debacle has restored simmon 's
reputation. now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
al 's highest era among starters. four our sake(not ted 's sake) , i hope he
pitches with a 3.5 era for the rest of the season. yeah , right.

3) tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing. they are still doing decently.
but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons , they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse. tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
merced had a very good oba his rookie year. he showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.

4) walk well , he seems to be on the losing end tonight. but i still think that
walk desrved his contract.

5) leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation. i
ca n't understand his and management 's fear of losing tom prince through
waivers. even if they do , what 's the use. he is aright hander like slaught.
not a very smart platoon. also , i am blaming leyland in this case , since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through , while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffs(slaught
should have played in all 7 games he has a good average against right handed
pitching). did n't leyland and simmons forsee this last year , and attempt to
trade lavalliere last year itself \? any fool could tell them lavalliere
was n't very fit last year.

6) dennis moeller is scary ! ! !
7) candeleria well , he is not going to have such a high era at the end of the
season. maybe it will be in 3 4 range. but 1 million plus \? come on. other
than the customary home run giving stage patterson goes through for a few weeks ,
patterson has served the pirates very well each year. so far , he seems to have
pitched well for the rangers. i think the pirates should have spent the money
on patterson in stead.

8) the rookie batters well , young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. other than that , their excellent performance has n't been too much of a surprise. i think we should thank doughty for that.

9) rookie pitchers worse than expected , especially cooke.
10) slaught how come he was n't given a contract extension last year \? now his
value has increased immensely.

11) lonnie smith ! ! well , eric davis was signed for a comparable amount.
let 's see. eric can hit better. he can run better. he can field better.
now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis. an injured davis is better
than a healthy lonnie smith. even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year , he wo n't be an asset. he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

12) management big big zero. sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. he seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay.
13) alex cole fiasco. the pirates infield and cf positions look good. the
rf and lf would have looked good if we could have gotten cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. eric davis , van slyke and cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. even without eric davis , thye pirates would have
a respectable outfield with cole , svan slyke , and merced(i think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). simmons did have options
for the outfield. ironically , the biggest accomplishment of simmon 's tenure was
getting alex cole really cheap. too bad.

14) compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it. the pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. as of now , the issue is still being appealed.
now , if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots ,
nothing else will.

on a final note. tim wakefield wo n't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. but do n't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. also , if the pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season , they will miss redus 's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)

mss@netcom.com (mark singer) said

most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs. those are the arguments against lopez for the
braves for this year.

now. the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games , to work with the pitchers , to throw out
runners.

this is the crux of the argument (to me at least). both the
sdcn and the non sdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher 's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present. you can talk about how
important calling a game is , or framing the pitches , or blocking balls
in the dirt. but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher 's rank in defense .

looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher \? as far as i
can tell he does n't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as sasser). he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball , or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time. i ca n't see how repetitions
at aaa are any better then reps in the majors !

all we 're left with is the calling the game aspect. olsen and
berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff. but this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers. how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn
the major league pitching staff \? the only way any catcher is going to
learn tom glavine 's pitches is to catch tom glavine. similarly , i would n't
be supprised if the pitcher 's claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over
pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen. but
given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez.

now , since lopez ca n't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher 's while he 's in aaa and since he does n't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics , what is he going to learn in aaa that he
ca n't learn just as well while in the majors \?

i 've read all of the followups to this , but i thought i 'd go back to the
original article to make specific comments about the method


jao@megatest.com (john oswalt) said

he has obtained the play by play records , in computer readable
form , for every major league baseball game for the past several years.
he devised an algorithm which i call sum over situations , and wrote
a computer program to calculate every major league players contribution
using it. it works like this

look at every situation in every game in a baseball season. a
situation is determined by inning , score , where the baserunners are ,
and how many outs there are. for each situation , count how many
times the team eventually won the game that the situation occured in ,
and divide by the number of times the situation came up , to come up with
a value for that situation.

this was first done by george lindsey in the late '50s early '60s , and
reported in

article an investigation of strategies in baseball
author george r. lindsey
journal operations research
issue volume 11 4 , july august 1963 , pp. 477 501

later , pete palmer did the same thing using simulated seasons to generate
a larger set of data to avoid the kind of small sample anomalies that other
people have worried about. he reported this in the hidden game of baseball
(with john thorn). gary skoog modified the method a bit and did some work
on what he called a value added measure based on these situational values.
his were based directly on marginal runs , though , not on win probabilities.
these results , as applied to the 198 \? season , were reported in one of the
bill james baseball abstract books (1987 \? help me out here , somebody...)

for example , a situation might be inning 3 , score 2 0 , runner on second
and no outs. there were 4212 regular season major league games last
year. (with the rockies and marlins , there will be more this year.)
say this situation came up in 100 of those , and the team ahead won
75 of them. then the value of this situation is 0.75.

description of method look at change in win probability based on the at bat
plus any baserunning , and credit debit the player by that amount each time
he gets a plate appearance.

now , for each player , sum up all his at bat and base running values
for the season to obtain an overall value for that player. obviously
the sum of all players' values for each game , and for the season as a
whole , will be 0.

that 's only because you always credit x to the batter and x to the pitcher
there 's no validation involved.

ok , there 's a very big problem here that nobody has yet commented on you 're
adding probabilities , and probabilities do n't add. runs you can add the
total team runs breaks down into how many runs joe contributed plus how many
runs fred contributed , etc. but probabilities do n't work that way. if bob
increases his team 's chance of winning by 1 in each of 400 pas , that does
not mean that bob increased his team 's chance of winning by 400 . in fact ,
it does n't mean anything , because the units are screwy.

i agree and disagree. john is saying that the batters efforts will result
in 4 more wins then losses. while you are probably correct that 400
does not mean 4 more wins then losses , it means something. i would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1 in
each of 400 pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning
by .5 in each of 400 pas. thus , there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between john 's statistic and winning games. thus ,
before you disregard this stat , it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is.

consider an example bob hits a 2 out solo hr in the bottom of the first
about .12 on your scale. he does the same thing again in the fourth , with
the score tied , for another .14. and again , in the seventh , with the score
tied , for another .22. and , finally , in the ninth to win the game by a score
of 7 6 , for a value of 0.5. bob hit 4 solo hr in 4 plate appearances , and
was credited by your method with .12 .14 .22 .5 .98. but what does
that mean \? was bob 98 responsible for the win \? certainly not the defense
is always 50 responsible (if you include pitching in that) , and bob was n't
pitching. in fact , bob was only 4 7 of the offense (which is a lot , but not
even close to 100 ). furthermore , what about the other 3 team runs \? say
they all came on solo hr by fred then fred was hitting hr to tie up the game ,
which are just as valuable as hr to take the lead (see lindsey) , and fred will
himself have accrued a good .4 rating or so. so fred and bob combined have
amassed 138 of a win in one game. there 's clearly a problem here.

the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has. first , we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game. second , remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning. that is a
player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases.
thus , i'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game. sometimes ,
they will add up to more then one sometime , less than one. also ,
the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game. also , any batter that
pulled an 0 4 night would give large negatives.



greg thinking about the right things , but his intuition is off the
mark. closers are enormously important. the total number of runs
value is outweighed by when they come , or are prevented from comming.
the doubling which greg allows is not enough.

in another article , i proposed a test of this. we can predict a team 's
won lost record quite accurately by looking at how many runs total they
score and allow , without regard to when those runs score in the game. if
late runs are really more important than early runs , then looking only at
late runs should lead to a better predictor , right \?

no , but really only because you have a smaller sample size. i would
think however , that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score
in the last inning. and , realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation , not a blow out. it is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning. look , a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games. on , the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win. the
offence has many more outs to do something about. but , i am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either. if
i am down 8 runs in the ninth , it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.

here 's another thought experiment apply this method to basketball. what
you find is that points scored in the first half of the game have almost
exactly no value , because no lead is safe with an entire half yet to play.
furthermore , the sub in off the bench who sinks the winning free throws with
no time on the clock gets a 1.0 for the game , while the star forward who
scored 27 points in the first half before spraining his ankle gets a zero.

does this make sense \?


no , but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made. look ,
if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left , there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball. and , do not forget that somebody elses missed shots , turnovers ,
fouls , bad defense , etc. caused a negative chance that the team
would win.

from reading all of the discussion on this statistic , i feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.
at first look this statistic valadates clutchness. but , it really
does not. cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down. i 've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.
so , if you assume there is no clutchness , then that means that except
for a lot of noice , this statistic has a positive association to
player performance. there is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness. certainly , we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example. we may find for
instance , that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15
on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5 .
i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.

how do we evaluate relief pitchers \? say john and sam have the
exact same pitching statistics (runs , earned runs , k 's , bb 's ,
etc.) both had exceptional numbers. john , however only pitched
in closer situations , while sam was a mop up man. who was more
valuble to their team \? probably john. who was the better
pitcher \? they were probably about the same.

maj 598 153 23 4 36 52 30 11

this is what jackson looked like in 88 91 , with everything converted
to a neutral park , on the basis of run production. his equivalent
average started at .253 in 88 , was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. so
let us say he had established , in his last two seasons , a .280 level
of play.

i'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated. it appears that in
a neutral park bo 's hr and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs). or do they \? what is equivalent average \?

one thing , when looking at bo 's stats , is that you can see that kc took
away some homers. normally , you expect some would be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks , or to be caught , and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway. but bo , despite his speed ,
hit very few doubles and not that many triples. so i would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.

that is good. very good , in fact. but it probably does n't make the top
ten in the league. the 10th best eqa in the al in 1992 was dave
winfield 's .296 thomas was first at .350. first in the nl was bonds ,
an incroyable .378 tenth was bip roberts , .297. but .280 is better
than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what
mattingly had in 1988 (.285) what felix jose had the last two years
just ahead of time raines' five year average better than ryan
klesko 's mles.

felix jose has been a .350 .440 player in a fairly neutral park.
i would offhand guess the `89 `90 bo at around a .330 .530 player.
maybe .330 .550 . not even close.

he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing , though his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
that is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. the
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. i think he was a
good , maybe very good hitter. he was imo , something like the 30th best
hitter in the majors.

i 'd put him about there too.

note i had n't realized the media had hyped him so much. i thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player , and only so so
at baseball. he did only have one 30 hr , 100 rbi season , and kc was n't
winning.

note 2 i maybe have harped on this a bit in the past , but there is a
mistake being made (by the sdcn 's , as they are known , on this group)
with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton (and perhaps others).

we find , that if you look at a large group of players , their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
their are some caveats the younger they are , the less good the prediction
the lower the minor league , the less good (i imagine) , the more recent
the player has left college ball , etc.

now of course , this prediction involves quite a bit of error. sometimes
a player with poor mle 's (dave justice , the 1990 ventura) becomes a star.
some hitters develop (shane mack , brian downing) , some do n't (oddibe
mcdowell , mickey brantley). this error involves real things there are
real reasons why oddibe did n't hit and shane did. it may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

but still , you have this big pool of players , and things work pretty well.
one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players. one thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball. their backgrounds are similar.

what has n't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background \? is there some reason to believe that a
bo , or a deion , or a lofton , or a tony gwynn ( \? ) , or an ainge , or so
on , has such a different background , that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly \?

it has n't been established that you can use mle 's with two sport players.
(it has n't been established that you ca n't , but then statistics is , after
all , an art). i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton.
look at those good but not great minor league numbers , they say. well ,
what happens if those numbers simply do n't mean what they usually mean \?
it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than
tuscon. it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half year in
atlanta than greenville.

then again , it might not. ken and deion might go right back in the tank
this year , live up to those poor mle 's. but you guys don't know. what 's
worse , you do n't know that you do n't. and you do n't know that there are
other players you wo n't know about injuries and lifting and wheaties
again. you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal. it 's not.
it 's got some error.

oh well.

one of the chapters in palmer and thorn 's 'hidden game' is titled
'pitching is 44 of baseball , ' implying that fielding is 6 . how do
they determine that \? beats me it 's been a long , long time since i
read it.

this was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the hidden game. the
argument was

1) defense , or runs allowed , is 50 of the game.
2) unearned runs amount to 12 of the runs allowed earned runs , 88 .

3) since unearned runs are the result of fielding , not pitching , and
earned runs are the product of pitching , not fielding , fielding is 12
of defense and pitching is 88 of defense.
4) caombining with 1 , pitching is 44 of the game , fielding 6 .

pete is usually sharper than that. my own feel is that fielding is in
the 25 33 of defense range call it 30 70 between fielding and
pitching.

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning , with the
split probably somewhere around 49.5 and 0.5 .

i 'd give baserunning a little more credit than that , maybe 45 5 , or
even 40 10. give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds
identical batting stats (which would n't be that unreasonable) , and
even if you do n't let roberto steal a single base , they 'll score a lot
more than the oleruds by going first to third more often. (no offense ,

in article 93095@hydra.gatech.edu gt7469a@prism.gatech.edu (brian r. landmann) writes
joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

he 's not the greatest this is true.

for anyone who did n't see sunday 's game ,

i saw it.

with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform , a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey , both right handers.

lankford was hurt , although the announcer said he told torre he
could pinch hit if they needed him to.

later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the hell
is he thinking.

i wondered the same thing. but giving joe the benefit of the
doubt , i 'd say he was thinking that lankford is hurt enough that
he did n't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
speed on the bases so pinch run him. alicea i was completely
confused about. maybe he had a good record hitting against that
particular pitcher \? i do n't know. anybody got an idea \?

earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt , but torre said
he liked gilkey coming off the bench. gilkey hit over 300 last year ,
what does he have to do to start , the guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

well , so far i have n't seen much to say whiten should n't be playing
but it is too bad that gilkey is the odd man out when they play
jordan ahead of him. that i do n't quite understand.

furthermore , in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate ,
the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home ,

yup , i looked for this on the replay too. if i'm joe torre , i'm
going to have a talk with bucky after the game on that one. he 's
got lankford at third with todd zeile i believe a hot hitter
coming up there 's no reason to risk giving lankford the go sign
in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.
it 's his job to watch the play develop he should have known larkin
was there to back up a bad throw. that seemed inexcusable in my book.
btw , i saw dent do the same thing last year with zeile rounding third
and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation. on the
replay , there 's dent waving him around. it looks like this might be a
serious problem. the card 's were n't good base runners at all last year
and i wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

like a single a hitter up there. who swings on 3 1 count with maddux
pitching and your teams down by a run , and you have n't touched the ball all

organization university of southern california , los angeles , ca
lines 60
nntp posting host mizar.usc.edu

went to the dodgers game tonight it was cap night.

astacio pitched ok , but had control trouble all night.
in the first , he walked a batter , balked him to second , then
a single scored the run , with the batter taking second on the
throw home. another single made the score 2 0 cards.

lasorda tried a new line up featuring butler , reed , and piazza
batting third ! darryl and eric were benched in favor of snyder
and webster.

piazza homered in the first to make the score 2 1 cards.
the dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single
by offerman.

by the fourth inning , astacio had already made about 80 pitches , but
the score was still 2 2. the dodger defense made several impressive
plays. piazza looked great behind the plate , gunning down a runner
trying to steal second , throwing a runner out at first who
had strayed a bit from first base , etc.

karros also made a spectacular play , keeping a ball from going into
the outfield. the runner on first was so sure that ball was going
through , he just kept running past second. karros got up and threw
to third and easily got the runner at third.

my heart sank in the 7th when gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.

astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter , and when gross entered the game
with the score still 2 2 , dodger fans just knew it was over.

gross was relieving because he stunk on tuesday , pitching just 2 1 3
innings , forcing lasorda to use much of his bullpen. the 15 inning
game had the same effect the next night...so only gross was fresh
given his light work out tuesday.

gross lived up to his name. he walked the first batter , gave up a hit
to the second , and walked the bases loaded. after a grounder resulted
in a force at home , zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it
3 2 cards. gross paid little attention to the runners , and the next
thing you knew , the cards had stolen a fourth run. the runner on
first was eventually tagged out in the run down , but the 4th run had
scored long before that.

meanwhile , the dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.
lee smith pitched the ninth. he had little trouble getting karros
and wallach (does anyone have trouble with wallach these days \? ).
cory snyder collected his first hit as a dodger , a single , but
that was all the offense the dodgers could mount. smith got his
third straight save against the dodgers and all i got was my
free dodger cap and a good look at piazza. if piazza keeps this
up all year , he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year
honors. though its really early , karros is already showing signs
of a sophomore jinx year.

the final score...cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.
dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.

i was hoping somebody would mention clutch. clutch \? baerga \? the
two words simply do not go together. with runners in scoring
position , baerga batted .308 .366 .418 last year. this does n't quite
suck , but most batters hit better in this situation.

alomar \? he hit .354 .439 .517 with runners in scoring position !

the difference \? alomar had 68 rbis in 147 such ab. baerga had 81
rbis in 182 such ab. baerga got 25 more chances , yet succeeded only
20 more times.

and do n't tell me boston will win this year. they wo n't
even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th.

if this is true , it wo n't be for lack of contribution by viola , so who cares \?

i do n't see why people expect boston to finish sixth. the bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied. boston , in seventh place , had
73 wins. the yankees and indians , tied for fourth place , had 76 wins.

now i should think it is obvious that the red sox improved more than
the indians or tigers. basically , the red sox are stronger this year
at 1b , dh , ss , lf , and rf. they have healthier starting pitchers (so
far , at least) and better relievers. i see no reason why they
should n't win 85 games. meanwhile , the indians are in shambles and
the tigers still have no pitching. they will win some 20 3
blowouts , but they will lose an awful lot of 7 5 games too.

maybe the sox will play poorly , win 78 games , and finish fifth.
but i think third or fourth place is more likely.

the royals will set the record for fewest runs scored by an al
team since the inception of the dh rule. (p.s. any ideas what this is \? )

they will fall easily short of 600 runs , that 's for damn sure. i ca n't
believe these media fools picking them to win the division (like our
tom gage of the detroit news claiming herk robinson is some kind of
genius for the trades aquisitions he 's made)

would you say the same thing about the dodgers in '65 or '66 \? true ,
cone is probably as good as drysdale , and they have no koufax , but still ,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals , with
lots of low scoring games , etc. and they did n't use relievers , whereas
jeff montgomery is having a super season for them.
that being said , i still picked them 5th or so , but i think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting. there 's more of a
chance of that , i think , than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching. at least , to me.
i wonder , though which one do you people think would do better a team
with johnson , koufax in his prime , seaver , carlton , and young , in no real
order , as the starters , with sutter , fingers , and lyle in the bullpen , but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense , like mazeroski , maranville , etc.)
or a team with poor pitching , but with an offense of cobb , carew , ruth , gehrig ,
mays , schmidt , wagner , and bench again , you pick the order.
i would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end. even the best hitters can succeed only 2 5 of the time in
their best years , but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts taking all
the players in their prime , they might throw 50 shutouts in a year. and all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.
i wonder if someone with stratomatic or something could plug such all
time teams into a regular season , have it played , and report the results
i would love to see that.

as for rushing... if there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and i do n't
believe there is) , then would n't you rather waste lopez 's 22 year old good
season than his 23 year old very good season or his 24 year old excellent
season \? the sooner you get him acclimated , the more of his prime you get to
use.

can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let 's , for
argument 's sake , define rushed as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger , and performing below
expectations) , whose career was damaged by this rushing \? i'm serious i
tend to agree with david that bringing the player up sooner is better , but
i 'd like to look at players for whom this theory did n't work , if there are
any. i 'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so , because then i can
look up their minor league stats. (it 's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected , as opposed to players who were hyped and failed , but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).

let 's kick it off with an example of a player who was rushed , although
there does n't seem to have been any damage to his career. jay bell was
given 135 pas in the major leagues at age 21 , and performed well below what
you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season. he got 236 pas the
next year at age 22 , and still underperformed. however , the next year , at
age 24 , his performance improved , and he won the everyday shortstop job ,
and has been there ever since. it 's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in aaa) during this time , rather than being rushed
cleveland might have been better off , i suppose , because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

yes , if you bring a player up early , he 's likely going to struggle. but
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling , and starts
performing up to expectations \?

in article 2482@adobe.com , snichols@adobe.com (sherri nichols) writes
every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball
being 50 offense , 50 defense. a run scored is just as important as a run
prevented.

of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
just as a penny saved is a penny earned. enough with the cliches.

it 's not a cliche , and (unlike your comments below) it 's not a tautology.
it need n't have been true. if every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability) , then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them , simply because the ability to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker.

my point is that if the braves starters are able to live up to
their potential , they wo n't need much offensive support.

if that 's your point , you should have said so. what you in fact said was
pitching and defense win championships , and later pitching is the essence
of baseball . neither of which says what you are now claiming was your
point , and neither of which is true.

it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound , the other teams score less runs. the team that scores the most
runs wins.

and you accuse sherri of mouthing cliches ! \?

this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). a low
scoring game would clearly benefit the braves.

it 's not clear to me at all that this is true. in high scoring games , the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time. in low
scoring games , the split is essentially 50 50 regardless of team ability.

they should have many
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
on the flip side , if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players ,
i would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.

i thought you said pitching and defense win championships and pitching is
the essence of baseball .

a less well publicized part of the now infamous darrin jackson for
derek bell trade was the fact that san diego included 300 , 000 in the
deal. even less publicized than this , however , was that the 300 , 000
did n't come from the padres , but from an un named source , and that the
money did n't go to the blue jays. in toronto , the money was diverted
into a london bank account owned by a shadowy character named vincent
gray.

i should be so lucky the account number must have been rejected ! )

the odd thing was that gray was n't some british financier , but a
canadian social scientist working at the university of western
ontario. gray was previously known to the authorities only as an
associate of john palmer , and as the man who had the previous year
discovered the true tater name of bing bang ben macdonald.

to be accurate , it is big bang ben macdonald.

soon after that , gray and palmer sent word to ottawa that canada had
achieved absolute superiority over the united states in the field of
baseballistic research , as she controlled both the acker cook
pitch alike contest and the binaca blast research institute. the prime
minister smiled.

realizing the taterific importance of this work , john palmer and i

ted , you 're missing a vital point. as roger lustig pointed out in a
previous response , the reason why schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis. such thoughts affected her hiring practices. bonilla ,
on the other hand , was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
if he had been known to go around , criticizing homosexuals , it would be a
different story. furthermore , he is merely an athlete. he does n't have to
hire anyone as schott had to do. dave pallone , the former nl umpire who is
an admitted homosexual , has decided to assist in a protest before a mets
game at shea. he , like you , thinks that bonilla should be suspended from
baseball. pallone is hoping for a year 's suspension. in my opinion ,
that 's downright ludicrous. as howie rose on wfan said , if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions , then you 'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three on three game. now , honestly , if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article , i
would think that you 'd reconsider your thoughts.

organization esca corporation , bellevue wa
lines 49

icop@csa.bu.edu (antonio pera) writes


hispanic magazine(april 1993) had a couple of interesting articles about
hispanic players including its hispanic all star team.
some of the major points are

npr 's morning edition aired a report this morning (4 19) on
hispanic latin american players in mlb and how they have many of
the same problems faced by black negro african american players
when they first entered the league. however , although baseball
has adjusted to the presence of black players , many hispanic
players still labor under the stereotype of being fireballs ,
hot blooded , flashy . the report also emphasised that despite
the rantings (my word) of jessie jackson about baseballs
discrimination against black players in its upper echelons ,
baseball has actually done much better by black players than
hispanic players.

another interesting point was the language barrier problem. the
reporter elaborated on an interview with ruben sierra which he
gave in spanish to a spanish speaking newspaper reporter with
the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that
speak spanish , despite the fact that spanish is one of (if not
the) easiest languages to learn , so easy that the author cormac
mccarthy learned spanish at age 50 in order to research his
book , all the pretty horses . yet , few mlb organizations
employ spanish speaking personel , one of the exceptions being
the oakland a 's.

another point

nearly 90 of latin american players have some african blood.
yet , most report that they 'd never really felt black until
playing ball in the us.


ironically enough , it is the early presence of latin american
baseball players in the major leagues that support the idea that
baseball was integrated before the arrival of jackie robinson ,
as many light black or brown , latin americans were
incorporated into baseball.

it sure does. and it all depends on the definition that you use for better .
yours is based on what could have been and mine is based on what really
happened.

well , actually , most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. but that 's ok , i understand you
have a hockey background. stats like plus minus make rbi look good.

is it viola 's fault that boston had no offense \? is it because of morris that
the blue jays had such a strong offense \? do n't tell me that morris has this
magical ability to cause the offensive players to score more runs.
this is the perfect example of your problem. you are isolating viola 's
contribution from the rest of the team 's efforts. you can only do
this if you can say for sure what the team would have done without
viola. only then can you compare. but you cannot know how the team
would have done without viola. your analysis is fallacious.

ok , how about a straigh answer , then. here 's a very simele question to which
i'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. please
answer yes or no , roger
can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs \?
al only , please.

for anyone else following along , it is a well known and demonstrable fact
that a team 's win loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. it 's not a definite ,
hard and fast function , but there is definitely a correlation. in fact , as a
rule of thumb , if teams a and b both score x runs and team a allows y runs ,
for every 10 runs fewer than y that team b allows , it will win another game.
so , for instance , if we look at the 1991 toronto blue jays , we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682 , of which morris allowed 114. all other
things being equal , if frank viola , with his 3.44 era had replaced jack
morris for the 240.2 innings morris threw (plausible , since viola threw 238
for boston) , the red jays would have allowed about 15 fewer runs , or
enough for 1 2 more wins. now , that does n't take into account that viola
pitched half his innings in fenway , which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than skydome. so , um , roger. unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores , could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis \? clearly , it would be foolhardy to claim that viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the jay last year , but
that is not the claim. we look at what the actual performances were and

rogers is the one batter lefty in the bullpen. dusty has also said he
trusts rogers to get the final out in a ballgame where beck is
unavailable , so you might see a couple of saves for kevin. then again , if
any of the regular rotation falters , rogers is a possible candidate to
start , though this would appear less likely now that dave burba did well
in an emergency start.

just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the dodgers (one of
my least favorite) in la (sweet ! ). also the mets (my other least
favorite team) loss to the rockies made this this a great day and a
great start to the weekend as the cardinals are on the espn tonight.

big lee smith is having a great start and the cardinals seem to be
hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
of hits and not many runs. hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training , the runners lob will be lower
this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by jose and
lankford and zeile 's off year).

i do n't know why all the fuss about the fillies. the media and all the
filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.
give the wild thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games
and we 'll see who is in first then. i believe the cardinal pitching
staff is more complete than the filly staff and that will make the
difference.

on a side note , a few years ago (5 6) , a comment was made by some
baseball player or manager about the dodger defense. he was asked
where to hit the ball against the dodgers and he replied fair. i
remember it being in the they said it section of sports illustrated.
i would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.

buck showalter just ca n't win.

bob wickman 's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (yanks
lead 6 1) , so buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game. wickman manages to get two outs , but in between , four funs score ,
and all of a sudden it 's 6 5 , and wickman just ca n't get the third out.
so buck goes to the bullpen , and farr gets out the first guy he faces.

last night , jimmy key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life (this guy just keeps getting better ! ) through eight innings (yanks
lead 4 0). this time , buck thinks , i do n't want a repeat of that
near fiasco with wickman , so i 'll give my bullpen some work. steve howe ,
whose era was 54.00 coming into the game , left with it at 81.00. he did n't
do too good. then farr comes in. he gives up a two run homer , and the
royals win it , 6 5.

what 's going on \? this is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead. farr howe have done it twice together ,
monteleone 's done it once , and i think even habyan did it once. what 's the
deal \? we finally have terrific starting pitching , so all of a sudden , our

the weather is n't great i should be able to get tickets. if not , what 's

does any one out there listen to wfan \? for those of you who do
not know what i am talking about , it is an all sports radio
staion in new york. on a clear night the signal reaches up and
down the east coast. in particular , i want to know how len
berman and mike lupica 's show is. i go to school in virginia
so i ca n't listen when there are on during the day. just
wondering.

you 're right about the signal being strong. i live in west philadelphia ,
and i can get fan almost perfectly. it 's a sports fans dream (especially
if that person is from ny and wants to hear about his teams while he 's
away at school). as for lupica berman , it 's turned out to be lupica ,
then berman. neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show , so ed
coleman and dave sims' old four hour slot was broken down into two
seperate two hour show lupica from 10 12 , and berman from 12 2. and they
both happen to suck in comparison to eddie and dave. come back , guys !


the fan is an okay sports radio station , but does n't come close to
the ultimate in sports radio , 610 wip in philadelphia. the signal
might not be as powerful , but then again only stations in new york
feel obligated to pollute everyone else 's airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum mets fans complaining 24 hours a day. wip took two of your
best sports jockeys too , jody macdonald and steve fredericks. 610
wip is rockin with sports talk from 5 30 am till midnight , check it
out anytime your within a few hours of philadelphia. if i'm not
mistaken , wip has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation \?


like i said , i live in philly , so i can hear fan and or wip whenever i
want. but i cannot stand wip. and it is n't because i loathe the philly
sports teams the phillies are my favorite nl team (yanks are favorite
al) , and the eagles are n't too bad either. there are two big problems

1)total emphasis on the home teams , especially the eagles. unlike
the fan hosts , who can at least answer a question about an
out of town team if a caller asks , the wip hosts seem
to have no clue about any team that does n't play on
broad street. also , fans periodic sports updates (every 20
minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
country. it 's very rare to hear an out of town score
being reported on wip.

2)the hosts. with the exception of jody macdonald , who i miss
from his days at fan , none of the hosts really seems to have
both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on air presence.
the worst is gary cobb , who seems to have been hired solely
on the basis that he used to play for the eagles.

anyway , that 's my two cents on the whole fan vs wip battle.

am i supposed to take that as a compliment or a put down \? just wondering.

it was meant entirely , 100 , as a compliment.

i do this as a service to the entire baseball world on usenet , especially
for those in the east coast who ca n't get final scores for west coast games
in their newspapers or late tv newscasts. this is helpful to fans in other
countries who either receive only weekly scores or updates by the week. also ,
many have requested for this kind of service previously but it was only
available through bbs 's or some pay news services. by the way , mine is free

i was not trying to criticize your service at all.
in fact , i was trying to encourage others to use it.
i do n't personally use it , but i'm sure others do , and that was my point in
posting there is no need for individuals to duplicate , in an ad hoc fashion ,
what you have already organized.

if you want to send updates and scores , set up a private mailing list
and use that.

remember i only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. other than that , everything is done through
private e mail. currently , there are 986 people on my mailing list that
branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. and the list

having one person , such as yourself , who does it , is a great idea.
having 100 do it is not. that 's all.

gonzales , rene .685 0.685
it 's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only. as with first
and second base , 1988 was the year of the glove. average da was 20 points
higher in both leagues than any other year.

leius , scott .653 .680 0.672

pagliarulo , mike .631 .575 .744 0.649
this is an interesting line. his 1988 figure was slightly below average.
his 1990 was pathetic , and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody. part of
that may be his mobility. 1988 was with the yankees. 1990 was with the
padres , who appear to have a rotten infield. 1991 was with the twins , and
judging by leius and gaetti , the metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

williams , matt .633 .653 .656 0.647
add another to the elite fielders list.

caminiti , ken .675 .630 .653 .596 0.642
sabo , chris .751 .626 .616 .613 .575 0.642
too fielders whose career average may overstate their value. i do n't know
what happened to caminiti judging by the three previous years , his low
1992 may be a fluke. sabo is merely average , however. his incredible 1988
(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.

schmidt , mike .628 0.628
according to reputation , one of the best fielders ever at third base.
but at the end , he was below average. (average in 1988 was .643).

boggs , wade .643 .659 .550 .653 .634 0.626
boggs has been pretty good. i do n't know what happened in 1990 , but every
other year he has been above average , usually by quite a bit.

martinez , egdar .621 .645 .599 0.624
last year a fluke or a portent \?

nl average .643 .625 .602 .623 .603 0.619
seitzer , kevin .654 .583 .593 .635 0.616
al average .641 .612 .604 .620 .602 0.615
why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close
to one another , but very different from year to year \? any ideas \?

jacoby , brook .624 .621 .600 .597 0.613
brook is declining.

hansen , dave .611 0.611
magadan , dave .609 0.609
jefferies , greg .606 0.606
three first time regulars , above average in 1992. i'm not sure why jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding. he 's never had a good year , but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder , and is an average fielder
at third.

zeile , todd .614 .593 0.605
zeile , on the other hand , is a below average fielder. each year he 's about
10 points below average. and it 's probably not just the park , since terry
pendleton had excellent das in the three years before this.

baerga , carlos .604 0.604
moving back to second was a good idea.

hayes , chris .601 .622 .606 .574 0.602
so why is hayes supposed to be good defensively \? he 's had a grand total
of one year above the league da , and was pretty bad last year.

johnson , howard .628 .549 .611 .573 0.588
lansford , carney .620 .578 .594 .550 0.587
howard johnson and carney lansford separated at birth. to his credit ,
hojo did have one above average year (1990). lansford could n't even break
the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.

hollins , dave .577 0.577
good hitter , but his fielding needs work.

sheffield , gary .584 .567 0.575
not a good fielder.

blauser , jeff .573 0.573
fryman , travis .571 0.571
both are better off at shortstop.

gomez , lee .551 .542 0.546
two consecutive horrible years for leo. camden yards does n't seem to
have helped his fielding any.

palmer , dean .520 0.520
texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career da , but the lowest

i just wanted to let everyone know that i have lost what little respect i have
for jim lefebvre after seeing today 's cubs game. first of all how could he
start maldonado over may. after the way may played at the end of last year and
the way he tore up the cactus league how could you let him sit the bench \? not
to mention that a right hander (maddux) started. i really blew my top when
lefebvre pinch hit for rick wilkins with tommy shields ! how can you do that
just because of the lefty righty thing , too much is made of that. wilkins is
twice the hitter that shields is. then the next batter was jose vizcaino , one
of the weakest hitters i have ever seen , and who had looked terrible at bat all
day , and lefebre let him hit , while may still sat the bench. i think even arnie
harris was stunned by this because he showed may sitting in the dugout while
vizcaino was batting. face it lefebvre has got to be the worst manager in
baseball.

the situation with the giants' bleachers is a case in point for the
need for a commissioner.

this is true , but the main thing the commish i.e. selig needs to do
is to suspend bobby cox. you cannot allow a team to come out at
the ump as the braves did. i usually rip umps , but in this case ,
the players were dead wrong. cox should go for 5 games. if i
had ever umped a game where that happened , i 'd have ejected every
player that came out. only cox and gant would have been spared , and
then cox would have gone in the ensuing argument.

and michael jackson , jack nicholson , and bill cosby would n't be
making near as much money if they were n't entertainers. so what 's
your point \?

i just do n't understand how some athlete , who only plays a sport
for a

if nobody will sign him for his asking price , he will be the one
hurting.
the a 's will still win without him.

will they \? you ca n't usually take away one of the team 's best
players and still expect them to win. or do you think the
pirates will continue to win without barry bonds.


remeber , many of these athletes have nothing if not for their
athletic
ability. nothing. they are getting paid much more than most hard
working
citizens , and they are complaining of not enough pay.

so. again , jack nicholson gets paid much more than most hard
working citizens (and much more than rickey henderson for that
matter).


i do n't have a problem with them making millions. my problem is
when the
say they are n't being paid enough , when they already get 3
million also ,
their numbers get worse.

the reason the latter often happens is that many of these folks
start making the real big salaries late in their career , when they
are on the decline. (there are exceptions , of course. dave parker
fell apart after making his first million because he put most
of that million up his nose.)

if you come in and pitch the last three innings , and your team was ahead

sort'a correct. if you pitched at least 3 innings , entered with your team
in the lead , was the pitcher when the game ended , the game was never tied
during your stint , and your team won , you get a save.
well , the rulebook says that in the opinion of the scorer , you must have
pitched effectively for your 3 innings this save is not automatic ,
unlike the others.

someone in sabr actually looked at these games a few years ago
and found that the official scorer awarded the save in every one
of the games even those in which the pitcher had pitched badly

gt7469a@prism.gatech.edu (brian r. landmann) writes

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

for anyone who did n't see sunday 's game ,

with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform , a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey , both right handers.

later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the hell
is he thinking.

for your information , lankford is injured (i think it is his shoulder or rib
cage) , so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.

earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring mark whiten he commented
how fortunate the cardinals were to get whiten and that whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that gilkey would be hurt , but torre said
he liked gilkey coming off the bench. gilkey hit over 300 last year ,
what does he have to do to start , the guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

i do believe that whiten was a very good aquisition for the cards. he does
not have too much offensive capabilities , but he is an awesome defensively.
since when have the cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense \? )
i forgot who st. louis gave up for him , but it was not too much.

as far as gilkey is concerned , he is a leftfielder and so is brian jordan , who
beat him out. i expect to see a gilkey jordan platoon in lf.

furthermore , in sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate ,
the replay showed bucky dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home ,

i agree with you on this one. as soon as larkin threw that ball , i knew that
lankford was a dead bird. but how could dent have known that larkin would make
a perfect throw \?

i strongly believe that torre is one of the best managers in baseball. do n't
forget the overachieving cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the braves
twins last to first climb). he won a division title , and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the braves (why atlanta ever even considered firing him i
will never understand). with torre at the controls , the cardinals are heading
in the right direction.

one more thing , one game does not make a season. yes , they lost to the reds ,
but with the second best pitching staff in the national league (first in the
east) , and a pretty good offense , the redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose. maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

erickson did go on the 15 day dl with a pulled muscle in his left side (near
rib cage). he is on until 4 18 93.

no news as to who the twins will bring up.

i think most of the problems mainly arose from manager gene mauch 's
ineptitude in managing the pitching staff. down the stretch , he
abused jim bunning , chris short , and robin roberts (i think those
are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some
time. by the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season ,
obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm. oh
well.

roberts was long gone he was probably an oriole in 1964. or maybe a
colt .45. the 3rd starter was art mahaffey , the previous year 's ace.
dennis bennett was the 4th starter.

they were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go , but they won their final two
games after the horrid 10 loss streak. the final game victory
(bunning 's 19th win , if memory serves) kept the reds from tying for the
title they and the phils were both 1 game behind the cards , with the
giants( \? ) another game back. the mets could n't hold an early lead
against the cards that final sunday , or there would have been a 3 way
tie. too bad they could n't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they
scored on saturday when they crushed st. louis.

javier lopez is a better catcher than greg olson.
but has there ever in the history of baseball been a 22 year old (or
younger) rookie catcher who compared favorably among all league
catchers in terms of defense and brought a .247 bat \? was n't it
sandy alomar who was supposed to be that good in his rookie year \?
not. was n't it benito santiago who was supposed to be that good
in his rookie year \? not.

hrm. sandy alomar , 24 year old rookie 132 games , .290 .326 .418. threw
out a few baserunners. benito santiago , 22 year old rookie 146 games ,
.300 .324 .467. he threw out a few baserunners , too. ivan rodriguez ,
20 year old rookies 88 games , .264 .276 .354. did n't exactly suck
behind the plate.

i can continue this thread with the others mentioned , but you get
the point. you and others seem to be so quick to dismiss the
seasoned veterans in favor of the hot young rookies. perhaps
just perhaps the management team of the pennant winning braves
knows something more than you do. and perhaps what they know is
that very , very few 21 and 22 year old rookies come up to the majors
and make an impact.

true. which only makes it more important to realize when you have one of the
few. lopez' season last year , adjusted to major league equivalencies , was
.306 .330 .472 , 15 hrs. how bad does he have to be behind the plate for that
to not be better than olson 's .238 .316 .328 \?

hey valentine , i do n't see boston with any world series rings on their

future. therefore , i would have to say toronto easily made the best
signing. and do n't tell me boston will win this year. they wo n't
even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th.

gee , i never knew valentine made a comment about how viola signing
with boston was gonna bring a world series title to boston. i do n't
think valentine ever said boston will win this year. boy , talk about

in any case , i think viola would have made a better signing. why \?
viola is younger , and is left handed (how many left handed starters does

between gonzales and gruber they 'll manage the hot corner. polonia

personally , i think they can finish over .500 which makes them a
winning team.

i'm skeptical of the second because of his back. mattingly is 32 this
year , and how many players play until they are 40 \? not too many , and
most of them did n't have chronic back problems when they were 32.

could be wrong on either or both , but i think that 's the smart way to

what i think is hotdogish about his ab 's is the way he leans out over
the plate to watch outside pitches etc. this not done to get a better
look at the pitch , but to make it seem , this ball is so far out i need
to lean just to get near it so you better call it a ball . this is my
unbiased opinion of what i see. your mileage will vary.......
rickey is agreat player to watch if you forget who he is at the time.

a lot of batters lean in when pitches come. rickey 's crouch tends
to exaggerate that , i think.

not really , though i would n't personally say the most deserving

season , and there have been several duds in recent years. but this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else. (i wonder. if

i think they are a second division team. they should finish ahead of
the royals , mariners , and possibly athletics. but i do n't think
they 'll be above .500. (i think the east is stronger this year.)

last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible. this
year their offense is better , but their pitching is still pretty bad.
even if finley returns to form , he wo n't replace what they lost in
abbott. sanderson \? farrell \? i do n't believe it.

and while their ba may be good , and they have decent speed , their
offense lacks punch. they do n't have any bona fide power hitters.
(salmon , snow , davis , and curtis \? none with more than 20 hr
potential.)

p.s. which al team had the most steals last week \? those go go tigers !
the mediots finally managed to convince them that they needed more

the red sox usually have 2 catchers. i do n't think they have a backup now ,
but they used to use randy kutcher as a backup catcher , as well as a middle
infielder and outfielder. you do n't need a good 3rd catcher , just a
competent one , so you can afford to lose a little catching ability and pick
a player who can be of use elsewhere on the field.

my dad has always blamed the phillies collapse in '64 on me... on sept 21 , 1964 , the phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to play. i was born on sept 21 , 1964. the phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the cards won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact numbers \? ) , and a pennant was blown. to this day my dad likes to remind me that it all began when i was born !

hey valentine , i do n't see boston with any world series rings on their
fingers.

yah. so \?

damn , morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his
future.

he certainly did n't earn his last one. how many games did he blow
in the world series \? all of the ones he started \?

therefore , i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing.

oh , yes. definitely. therefore morris is better than clemens.

do n't give me that shit. if boston had alomar , olerud , henke , and
ward while toronto had rivera , jack clark , jeff reardon , things would
have looked a little different last fall. give credit where credit is
due. this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick.

and do n't tell me boston will win this year. they wo n't
even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th.

i'm willing to bet they do n't finish sixth. i'm also willing to bet
they do n't finish first. and if you give me 3 2 odds , i'm willing to
bet that they finish ahead of the blue jays.

i 'd have to say the most impressive hrs i 've ever see came from dave kingman
and his infamous moon raker drives...

i remember one he hit circa 1976 at wrigley field that went across
the street (in dead center field) and hit a house on the roof. he
whiffed a lot , but when he did connect , watch out !

the best home run i have ever seen came off , believe it or not ,
roger clemens (sorry , val) a couple of years ago. he threw a ball to
incaviglia which was literally at inky 's neck , and he absolutely
hammered the crap out of it. after the swing , clemens nonchalantly
motioned for a new ball he did n't even turn around to look , or
even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left field standard ,
some 70 or so feet about the green monster (over 100 feet above the
ground total ! )

truly an amazing shot.

unfortunately , you seem to lack the ability to rate players. dave
winfield has had a better career than half the people in the hall of
fame. eddie murray and darrel evans are both one of the top 100 players
of all time. lee smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since 1960 , with the possible exception of gossage.

on the other hand , kingman probably is n't one of the best 750 players
of all time.

and reardon , though a good pitcher , is n't in smith 's class career wise.

well , in any case , i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
giving
hall of fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards ,
marginal.

honestly , ozzie smith and robin yount do n't belong there. they 're both
shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal.

we 're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here. there probably
are n't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.

let 's be a little more selective , huh \? stop handing out these honors
so
liberally. save them for the guys who really deserve it. face it , if
something
is n't done , there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when
certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential
candidates , the absurdity is apparent.

garvey sucked. morris , while a very good pitcher , simply does n't
belong near cooperstown.

gee , can these guys even compare to
the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan \?

if puckett and ryan (okay , no if there) get into to the hall , they will be
marginal hall of famers (unless puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer)

to put this in perspective , here 's a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention. in parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.
while no one would claim these are perfect rankings , they should give
you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

robin yount 43.0 (41)
ozzie smith 42.1 (45)
dave winfield 40.3 (53)
eddie murray 37.5 (68)
darrel evans 35.2 (80)
kirby puckett 24.3 (180)
nolan ryan 21.6 (219)
jack morris 11.8 (478)
dave kingman 0.4
steve garvey 5.8

to give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the hall
of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0 , 64 are in the hall
of fame. the ones who are n't include 4 19th century players , ron santo , bobby
grich , and bob johnson.

of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9 , 15 of 25 are in. of

justice drove in the only run with an rbi single in the first. get
ready for him to have a monster year. he is now hitting the ball to
the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural
power to right field and his good batting eye. if he stays healthy
which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should
get over 100 rbi and close to 30 hr.

in another note , the marlins got off to a good start beating the
dodgers. i believe the score was 6 3 but i'm not sure. i wish

personally , i think that alomar is all hype. he is producing incredibly now ,
but in the long run , he will never put up the numbers that sandberg has. for
this moment , alomar may be the best , but overall sandberg wins out by a long
shot.

when sandberg was alomar 's age , he was putting up .261 seasons with no power.
alomar 's 1992 oba is 25 points higher than sandberg 's career high. alomar 's
career high in doubles and triples is higher than sandberg 's. sandberg is
still better than alomar , but only because alomar has n't reached his full
potential yet. alomar 's got a 2.5 year headstart on sandberg (he has 862
hits sandberg did n't have 862 hits until he was 26) , and is likely to
put up better career numbers than sandberg in everything except home runs.
he 'll pass sandberg in stolen bases sometime in 1995.

sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases. what competition did
alomar have \? sandberg came in a year after ripken , and the same year as boggs ,
gwynn , and the other magicians. so less attention was given to sandberg.
alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre. besides the
numbers do n't count. national league pitchers are much better pitchers.

eddie

murray and jeff reardon.

i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points.
however , i think you approached this the wrong way. i believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does. i
feel they were all much better players. i am not saying i fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more.

imho
dave kingman definately not. they guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. the rest of his career i do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. i also do not think he did a lot for the
game. i mean really i am a met fan he was a met for part of his career and i
still would not back him for the hall of fame.

dave winfield i think so. he is feared by pitchers , he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion without stats) better than kingman 's (probably by quite a
bit). i also perceive him to be a leader , maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. i think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (i know some of this from when he
was with the yankees). i think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i
think it deserves some consideration.

lee smith maybe , i would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of kingman.

darrell evans no.

eddie murray maybe , he has had a very good career , he is a leader (although
a silent one) , he is a good role model. are the stats good enough \? i am not
sure but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman 's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as winfield 's). just
think , eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

jeff reardon my guess is no , but it kind of depends on his numbers. off the
top of my head i would take lee smith first.


well , in any case , i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
giving

hall of fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards ,
marginal.

honestly , ozzie smith and robin yount do n't belong there. they 're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal.


well , i strongly disagree here. both of these guys deserve it for sure. i
talked about leadership above , both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have
shattered aaron 's home run mark by now. how many of those great plays saved
games \? how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game \? while i believe both of these guys have numbers , baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame. as does
george brett who also belongs in this class of player.

let 's be a little more selective , huh \? stop handing out these honors

steve garvey i am not sure , probably not but i guess i could see someone
making a case for him.

jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might
bring up his name.

kirby puckett probably. the only reason i do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. if he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

nolan ryan is there really any doubt \? i think i heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good i do n't know i did not
hear any of them just the number). he has the numbers , he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. i would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame
because of his accomplishments (no hitters , strikeouts , respectable numbers
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. i really hope he gets all
the possible votes.

so in summing up i have 3 groups , those that belong , those that probably do
but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying do n't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

yes winfield , yount , brett(not in your mail) , o. smith , puckett and ryan
maybe murray and l. smith
no reardon , garvey , morris , evans and definately kingman

as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this
up these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.

every single piece of evidence we can find points to major league baseball

prevented.

this certainly passes the common sense test for me , but is there any
statistical evidence to say what percent of defense is pitching and what
percent is fielding \? i 'd really like to know. btw , sherri , thanks for
the da data i find it fascinating.

one of the chapters in palmer and thorn 's 'hidden game' is titled
'pitching is 44 of baseball , ' implying that fielding is 6 . how do
they determine that \? beats me it 's been a long , long time since i

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning , with the

actually , i'm not sure that philly won but they were ahead 2 7 in the bottom

of the eighth. i was going to post the box score but since cinci was playing
so criminally bad , the pub i was at had to turn the game off.

so here 's what 's up

cincinnati had seven hits , all singles , by the end of the eighth. this makes
it six games with exactly one extra base hit.

cincinnati was 0 5 with runners in scoring position.
now if a team is going to be completely without power , they absolutely
have to hit in clutch situations.

cincinnati starter tom browning pitched 4.1 innings , giving up 5 runs and 10 h
its
while striking out 5. he was surely the loser tonight.
reds starters , while supposedly solid , have won only one game this year.
(of course , the reds have only won two...)

clean up batter sabo went 0 4. besides yesterday 's homer , he 's sucked at the
plate.

dibble may not actually return friday. this may not mean anything since cinci
may
not find themselves in a save situation for a while...

speaking of which , the reds have ha exactly one lead this week... for one and
a half innings after chris' dinger on tuesday.

manager tony perez says the reds are just not swinging the bat well right now.
good call , doggie.

well , there 's a big difference between just not swinging the bat well and
what the reds are doing at the plate....uuuggghhhh ! ! ! ! !

there 's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid. i thought
i 'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant. i splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars the
highest paid player is frank thomas , at 900k. i cut some players , like
kenny lofton , chris hoiles , keith mitchell , tim wakefield , and a bunch
of pitchers , all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of 1 million for the lot of them. the total team salary is
7 , 781 , 500 , averaging slightly over 300k a player. if that 's too steep ,
you can dump thomas and bagwell , replacing them with paul sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars , and still have one
of the best teams in the majors.

as i have read this net the last few days , i am continually amazed at the
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals. especially when it
comes down to saying that the bosox have n't a prayer. as a long time red sox
fan , i will simply say the impossible dream year 1967 for those of you
with short memories. short lives , or both.

to be a red sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'. this statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'brave woofers' out on the net. a true fan of a
team , any team , will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years , and be amply rewarded when the time is right.

yeah , so what if buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86. who cares if
clemens told cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower. the
fact is , they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them. now that it appears that they are on lean times , the number of
detracters come from all over. so what ! let them play and we will see what
happens come september. the red sox may not be that good , but they are certainly
not that bad , either and they do have a chance to win the world series , after all ,
remember the `69 mets \? who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far , let alone beat baltimore.

let 's face it , baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than football
and basketball. because of this , one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.

the walks should give it away. obp 's , in general , somewhat more valuable than
slugging , and alomar 's edge in obp was quite a bit larger than baerga 's edge
in slugging.

i'm no sdcn , but what 's more valuable

28 hits w 5 more doubles , 12 more hrs or
7 more triples and 52 bbs \? (let 's not forget the 39 extra sbs. how many cs \? )

of course the 28 hits and 12 homers are more valuable.

but do n't forget the 58 outs. you ca n't have it both ways baerga 's higher
raw numbers are due to him having more playing time , and thus he had more
hits and homers , but do n't forget the cost of those outs.

(btw , just to answer your question , alomar had 49 sb and 9 cs baerga had
10 sb and 2 cs , which gives a minute plus on alomar 's side.)

something else to consider

alomar 's h r splits were .500 .363 slg , .444 .369 obp ! baerga 's was .486 .424
and .392 .318. pretty clearly , alomar got a huge boost from his home park.

i 'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. t p

mark singer brings up the strawberry incident , where he lost a homerun
and the fan caught it.

before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any
that are in the field of play. was the fan wrong \? should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference \?

yes , i think he should have done more to get out of the way. as much
as fans want to catch a ball , they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important. as a dodger fan , he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium , and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible. as soon as the ball was hit that far , his first
instinct should be to root for darryl to catch it , not to try to catch
it himself , particularly when he is sitting that close.

i enjoy the attitude of the wrigley fans , where they are against
visiting team home runs so much , they actually throw them back on the
field.

now , this has nothing to do with whether darryl could have caught it or
not. sure , he probably screwed up , but the fan should realize his
first responsibility is to get out of the way and help the team win.

his joints a little stiff \?

thanks for the help...

all they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder
after throwing a curveball that did n't loosen. because of the cold
night in denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than
let him pitch. he is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation
(expected to be april 20 , at shea vs the giants).

i 've been a giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained
about the old ballyard place. sure , it 's been cold , the food lines were long ,
and the hired hands were surly , but this was all part of the giants mystique.
or so i thought.

i went to tuesday 's game (3 1 giants over the marlins) and the 'stick was
a much different place. nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind , but
everything is a lot better. the lines are a lot shorter , the bathrooms are
clean and have running water , and the hired hands were very polite.

the new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence
are very nice , as are the new bleachers. the bleachers start right at the top
of the fence and give a great view , and they 've got beer stands at the
bottome of the bleachers. the only complaint is that the electronic
old fashioned scoreboard looks electronic could be better.

these things should have been done a long time ago , but it took a real
businessman (ex safeway president peter magowan) to figure it out. just
like he used to tell his checkers , if the customers do n't come back , i do n't
need as many checkers . this is n't a knock on bob lurie he was a competent
businessman but he did n't deal much with the general public.

i 'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. the onion
dispenser jammed as i was using it. an attendant came over , apoligized for
the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. after he was done , he cleaned
the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. in the old days , there
was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say go to
the stand 100 feet away they might be able to help .

i do this as a service to the entire baseball world on usenet , especially

available through bbs 's or some pay news services. by the way , mine is free

if you want to send updates and scores , set up a private mailing list
and use that.

remember i only post final scores and the updated standings once a day to the
rec.sport.baseball newsgroup. other than that , everything is done through
private e mail. currently , there are 986 people on my mailing list that
branches off into other mailing lists available for many others. and the list
grows by an average of 35 people a day.

remember it 's still early. look for his offense to tail off , and
his defense to improve (hopefully). he has that rep because i heard
that either last year , or over the last 5 years , or something like
that he has the third highest fielding percentage among major league
shortstops behind c.r. and tony (i'm not gonna help this sorry mets
team at all) fernandez. i do agree though that he has not looked all
that impressive in the field thus far.

owen only has one error so far , i believe. that seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.

owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches. he will have a fine
fielding percentage , like always. the problem is that he does n't
reach anything that is n't hit straight at him !

this would n't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
kelly gruber or robin ventura. but the third baseman for the yankees
is wade boggs (who should have moved across the diamond last year) !

i 've only seen one game , abbott 's first start , but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players. instead they were charged as hits against abbott.

some pleasant (and then some not so pleasant) surprises about the 1993
edition of the bronx bombers so far.

first , the pleasant

1)spike owen. all through spring training , this guy was
looking like the second coming of mike gallego , but with
even worse hitting. now the guy is third in the major leagues
in ba , and he 's ranked pretty high in total hits and runs
scored. i know it 's still early in the season , but he and
pat kelly (more on him in a minute) have provided a lot of
spark at the bottom of the order that 's given the big guys
(mattingly , tartabull , o'neill) plenty of rbi opportunities.
let 's hope he keeps this up.

2)pat kelly. the guy is finally showing some of the ability
that led stick michael to label him a star for the 90s .
i would n't go that far , but kelly looks infinitely improved
at bat (i guess the tips he took from boggs in spring training
really paid off. huh ! and here i thought boggs would never
do anything to help anybody besides himself ! ). and his glove ,
like always , has been terrific (he and mattingly comprise the
best defensive right side of the infield in all of baseball imho).

3)paul o'neill. we had to get rid of roberto kelly , partly
because he was under too much pressure in ny to be the next
barry bonds (he wo n't do that in cincy , either) , and partly
because he had this real unprofessional tendency to give up
in the second half of the year. i just felt that we could 've
gotten more for him than o'neill. well , so far , o'neill is
turning out just fine. he looks like he should be able to
duplicate (if not surpass) mel hall 's numbers from last year ,
and he keeps opposing pitchers from pitching around tartabull.
now , if only buck would play him against lefties some more to
see what he can do !

4)wickman. a friend made a comparison between wickman and jack
morris they never have impressive stats but they always
find some way to win (although morris seems to be losing that
ability). i figured that wickman would be the least important
part of the steve sax trade (best trade since we got that ruth
guy) , maybe winding up as a good middle reliever. but i like what
i 've seen so far. he does n't pitch pretty , but he gets the job done.

5)key. what 's going on here \? key was just supposed to provide
the rotation with some stability (you know , shore up the left
side , provide experience , get maybe 15 wins) , and here this guy
is dominating everybody he faces ! who needs maddux or cone (0 2) \?
i 'll take key any day.

and now , the not so pleasant surprises

1)spike owen. sure , he 's hitting like crazy , but the guy cannot
field to save his life ! and they said he was brought in to
provide defense \? velarde , stankiewicz , and even silvestri
are better defensively than owen.

remember it 's still early. look for his offense to tail off , and his
defense to improve (hopefully). he has that rep because i heard that either
last year , or over the last 5 years , or something like that he has the third
highest fielding percentage among major league shortstops behind c.r. and
tony (i'm not gonna help this sorry mets team at all) fernandez. i do agree
though that he has not looked all that impressive in the field thus far.

2)tartabull. the book on tartabull was , keep him healthy and
he 'll produce. well , he has n't done too much so far. sure. he 's
hit a few homers , but those were all solo shots , and he has n't
gotten any of the big rbis that your cleanup man is supposed
to give you. then again , he had a slow start last year (once he
got off the dl , that is) and turned into a one man wrecking crew
late in the year , so we 'll see.

3)the bullpen. ugh ! ! ! ! ! what happened \? we were supposed to have
one of the most solid pens in the majors ! meanwhile , the pen
has already blown three saves (maybe more i have n't checked).
the great howe farr lefty righty tandem \? farr 's era is in the
20s or 30s , and howe 's is.....infinite. (i did n't think such
a thing was possible , but it is). hopefully , they 'll get their
acts together , or else buck 's gonna burn out the starters
for fear that the bullpen 'll blow a lead.

in the immortal words of the scooter , holy cow , seaver ! that johnny key
guy can pitch , ca n't he \?

see you in the series !

i was watching peter gammons on espn last night , and he 's got me a little
confused.

while talking about expansion , he started mentioning people who might benefit
from the fringe players they 'll be facing mcgriff hitting 50 home runs ,
sheffield getting 150 rbi 's , and glavine winning 25 games. this was ,
of course , all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball
has expanded (early 60 's , late 60 's , late 70 's).

what really confused me , though , was the mention of al players who would
do well next year. specifically , roger clemens winning 25 games , and the
likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 50 home runs.

my question is how in the hell will the rockies marlins help the al \? the
last time i looked , there was n't a lot of talent jumping leagues. did i
miss something \?

only if you persist in believing that peter gammons is more knowledgable about
baseball than the average mailbox. okay , i'm overstating. still , the man
actually had the gall to say that one out of every six pitchers in the nl this
year did not pitch in the majors last year.

huh \?

imo , this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the
other expansion drafts had , since the talent was diluted over both leagues.
in gammons' defense , because the talent drain came from the al as well , some
increase will be seen. he also gets credit for mentioning that the 1969 jump
in offense was due also to the rules changes after the 1968 season. he 's still
full of it...

let 's look at the effects of inflation on 1930 's superstars' salaries.

i read once that the babe made 80 , 000 one year and that was about as good
as it got for him.

let 's assume he made that in 1928 (i'm not sure of the figures , but i know
i'm in the ballpark pun intended). )

today , assuming a 4 yearly inflation rate , which is an understatement if
not accurate , his measly 80 , 000 salary would be worth.

fv 80 , 000 x (1 4 ) (1993 1928)
80 , 000 x (1.04) 65
just over 1 , 000 , 000.

assuming inflation is average of around 5 .

fv 80 , 000 x (1 5 ) 65
almost 2 , 000 , 000.

(i did n't crunch these numbers beforehand).

these numbers might lead one to believe that today 's players are slightly
overpaid. the babe appears to have made then what today 's average to above
average players make now. perfectly accurate salary , year of salary , and
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate , but i don`t
think i'm off by much.

sorry , this does n't fly. the good players have always been ready
for the majors early. how many hofers were not contributing major
leaguers by the time they were 22 \?

that brings up an interesting point. anyone else catch espn 's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age , career length , mvps and hall of
fame members \? it was part of their preseason special. basically , they looked
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or abs) by the time they
were 24 , and noticed some interesting things.

for starters , they found out such players comprised the majority of mvps in
the history of the game. they also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. the kicker , though , was that
they actually did some number crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. they also
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (hrs , etc) of the other players. the first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw ba , and blew away
the second group in such categories as hrs , 2bs , rbis , etc.

it was the most impressive thing i 've seen on espn in recent memory.

i guess ray knight makes his rebuttal tonight.

sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases. what competition did

gwynn , and the other magicians. so less attention was given to sandberg.
alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre. besides the
numbers do n't count. national league pitchers are much better pitchers.

you 're right thomas , gonzalez , sheffield , and griffey do n't even begin
to compare with ripken , boggs , and gwynn , so no wonder alomar gets so
much attention.

sandberg got no attention his rookie year because his rookie year was

confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.

you
can talk about obp and slg all you want , but the fact remains

the team that scores more runs wins the game !


uh , so \?

you 've just explained why we use obp and slg to evaluate players.
precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.
traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored that 's
where obp , slg , runs created , linear weights , etc. come in. these
simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player 's
offensive contribution to the team 's runs scored.

summary opcy is just too small...

hell , the orioles' opening day game could easily be the largest in history
if we had a stadium with 80 , 000 seats. but unfortunely the yards (a
definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45 , 000 with 275 sro spots.
ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. bleacher seats are almost
gone for every game this year. it 's a extremely likelyhood that the o 's
could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for
most of the year like '89).
on another front , the sale of the orioles to anyone is likely to be
forced upon eli jacobs who is major debt apparently. maybe we can get an
owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.
fernando has made the o 's as the fifth starter. the o 's pitching
staff looks pretty good. sutcliffe , mussina , mcdonald , rhodes , and fernando.
baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive al east.

5) leyland should accept a part of the blame for the lavalliere situation. i
ca n't understand his and management 's fear of losing tom prince through
waivers. even if they do , what 's the use. he is aright hander like slaught.
not a very smart platoon. also , i am blaming leyland in this case , since he is hcurrently convinced that lavalliere is through , while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season and the playoffs(slaught
should have played in all 7 games he has a good average against right handed
pitching). did n't leyland and simmons forsee this last year , and attempt to
trade lavalliere last year itself \? any fool could tell them lavalliere
was n't very fit last year.

sorry , but this is the biggest load of bunk i 've seen in a while.
a) the pirates have been trying to trade lavalliere for some time now.
nobody was even vaguely interested.
b) several other teams had made it known that they would grab prince ,
who was out of options.
c) lavalliere 's release had nothing to do with him being through. he
was released , because , in the event of an injury to slaught ,
lavalliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday
catcher.

since slaught is as good against righties as he is against lefties ,
the offense should actually improve with this move.

mss@netcom.com (mark singer) said

we know that very , very few players at this age make much of an impact
in the bigs , especially when they have n't even played aaa ball.

yes. but this is irrelevant . you 're talking about averages , when we
have lots of information about this player in particular to base our
decisions on.

i might as well say we know that very , very few people are more than 7 feet
tall , so chances are that manute bol is really only 6 foot 4.

no. maybe i need to improve my writing skills. lopez , who is very
ordinary defensively , is not likely to hit so well at age 22
(having not played at aaa level) that it is probably not a good idea
to rush him into the braves lineup in 1993.

why is n't lopez likely to hit that well \? he hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such) he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than olson or berryhill did. by a lot.

as for rushing... if there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and i do n't
believe there is) , then would n't you rather waste lopez 's 22 year old good
season than his 23 year old very good season or his 24 year old excellent
season \? the sooner you get him acclimated , the more of his prime you get to
use.

lopez was hitting .588 over 17 ab when he was cut from spring
training. what does he have to do to earn a chance \? maybe not a full
time job , but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove
his worth \?

gee. i do n't know. 17 abs sounds pretty good to me ! about as good
as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather
than start every day at aaa. talk about me as a gm...

the point was not that 17 ab is a significant sample , but rather that he
had n't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real , or to send him
down until he gets warmed up .

ok. most players are not ready for the bigs at age 22

most players are never ready for the bigs. what does this have to do
with javy lopez \?

most players
benefit , rather than being stagnant or hurt , by playing at aaa.

see above.

most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their
clubs in the bigs. those are the arguments against lopez for the
braves for this year.

but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds. most
players are n't that good , so they probably wo n't be that good this year
either.

now. the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid
abilities to call games , to work with the pitchers , to throw out
runners.

and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.

not superstars mind you , but solid , experienced veterans.

not superstars , not stars , not even good players. maybe average , if we 're
being charitable.

the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the
outfield , an excellent platoon at first , a solid mvp candidate
at third and one of the better hitting shortstops.

ummm. justice is a very fine hitter. pendleton might have another big year
in his bat , but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell. gant is a
big question mark. the bream hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
has rotten obp or slg (depending on who 's in). blauser is a very valuable
bat... for a shortstop.


the center
field platoon will probably hit .300. however good lopez'
bat might be (given the above) it wo n't be so much better than
what they have to offset the differential in experience and
defensive ability.

wanna bet \? the difference between lopez 's bat and olson berryhill could be
20 or 30 runs over the course of the season. given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play , i 'll take the latter every time.

the kid will improve playing at aaa ,

just like keith mitchell did \?

i am just so surprised i have to spell all of this out. my
goodness. do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez
is being held down because of his future earning potential \?

that was me , and you so far your only counter proposal is that they
really do n't understand how good lopez is , or overvalue experience ,
or some combination of the two. i think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.

are they idiots who have built this ballclub \?

me , too... rbi are a worthless stat. of course , so is stolen bases because
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. and of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases ,
so batting average , slugging and obp out , too. hmmm... i guess homers would
not count then , either.
my point \? rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. and no stat (or lack
of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. maybe no stat can tell me ,
either , but some people are... i just know it ! ! ! 8)

but why would you want to use rbi \? rbi is an attempt to measure is some
combination of clutch hitting and power hitting. if you believe in
clutch hitting , then look at how the guy hit with risp. if you want to
see how good of a slugger he is , then look at his slugging average.

in terms of evaluating players , rbi totals are better than nothing. but
why use them when so many better stats are out there \?

i would tend to call the offensive contributions even , but alomar wins hands
down in defensive capabilities. i'm not just talking about the number of
errors nobody (including lind ! ) has the range and athleticism at second base.
i ca n't recall in the recent past anyone turning the double play better
than alomar.

well , why do n't you look up those stats \? baerga may not be the best defensive
second baseman in the league , but he 's damn good. check the stats for dps
last year and see for yourself.

according to the defensive average stats posted by sherri , baerga had the
highest percentage of dps turned in the league , while alomar had the worst.
however , alomar had a higher defensive average. so who would be better \?

using alomar 's opportunities (469 groundballs , 73 possible double plays)
alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 dps.
baerga would have had (with same da dp ) 328 groundouts and 35 dps.

using baerga 's opportunites (545 groundballs , 99 possible double plays).
alomar would have had (with the same da dp ) 386 groundouts and 25 dps.
baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 dps.

baerga looks better , though it 's possible his dp would be lower with a
different ss.

will baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays , however \? alomar
has established a high level of defense , baerga has not. i would bet on
alomar to be better next year , but last year baerga was just as good overall.

if i remember correctly (which is always in doubt) , horner 's signing

joe torre has to be the worst manager in baseball.

for anyone who did n't see sunday 's game ,

with a right hander pitching he decides to bench lankform , a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey , both right handers.

later , in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford , a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses luis
alicea , a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter. what the hell
is he thinking.

educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.
lankford injured himself in a previous game and torre was resting
him.

as far as the whitten gilkey controversy. whitten adds some more
needed power , and if jordan continues to hit the way he has been ,
gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough.

at age 23 alomar had a brilliant rookie year. true , he was limited
by injuries in his sophomore season , but his numbers both that yaer
and the year following were quite mediocre. this season the same
bill james projects a ba of .265 , ops of 675.

the same bill james \? why do you say that \? it sounds like you 're suggesting
bill james had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. au contraire
he was fairly critical of him after his roy campaign , noting that he was n't
all world as a catcher or a hitter. he called him basically average when
everyone else in the media was predicting the next johnny bench or roy
campanella.

both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers ,
expected to be among the best ever in baseball. the reports i
read indicate that lopez is very ordinary defensively.

which reports are those \?

the dodgers options are parrish and hernandez , and now only carlos.
piazza is 24. as long as he continues with his very hot bat ,
they will keep him in the lineup because they need the offensive
production. when he cools off , look for the much better defensive
catcher hernandez (only 25) to play more.

i like hernandez a lot , but if piazza can catch the ball , you 've gotta play
him imho. he 's a much better hitter , although hernandez is n't a bad hitter.
right now , it sounds like piazza will catch most of the time and hernandez
will be candiotti 's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. as long as they
play up to their abilities , the dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.

the braves options are berryhill and olson. i agree that olson is
nothing special , but i do think berryhill is better than many
people on rsb believe. but both the braves' catchers are very
good defensively (calling a game , blocking the plate , throwing)
and although they are somewhat weak offenivsively , they play on a team
that is not so much in need of another big bat.

i think both are overrated defensively (see nichols' law of catcher
defense) , but that 's something that 's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. about the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent 's sb , and that 's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
catchers era is a possibility , but it 's subject to way too many biases.

as for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat' , i disagree here too. about the only chink in the braves' armor is that
they 're weak offensively at several positions (cf , c , 2b , ss if belliard
plays , 1b unless bream and hunter form another super platoon) and very weak
defensively if blauser plays. i 'd like to see the braves give at least one of
mel nieves , javy lopez or chipper jones a shot , but much like the talent rich
jays of recent years they 'll be conservative and stick with what they have.
i'm not saying that 's wrong , just conservative.

the dodgers have been shopping harris to other teams in their
quest for more left handed pitching. so far , no takers.
personally , i think harris is a defensive liability , and he
has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
plays , or at least been among the leaders.

sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day , he can get the job done. if sharpy played just
one base every day , say third , he 'd also improve defensively.

wallach has helped tremendously on defense , as has reed.
the improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff. both astacio and martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years.

astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
the dodgers are turning double plays , and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year. and piazza has also been great
on defense. he has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first.

wallach , clearly , has contributed to the over all improvement on
defense. but his offense is awful and he has cost the dodgers
some runs. but i do n't think he is as bad as his current average.
i suspect he will come out of this slump much as davis and straw
seem to have come out of theirs.

48th.

another home run that i thought was totally incredible was in the
1986 alcs. the ca angles had the boston red sox 1 strike away from
the pennant until don baylor hit a two strike pitch for a home run.
that was the most incredible turn of events i have ever seen in
baseball. the sox later took the pennant away only to have the same
thing done to them in the ws against the mets. speaking of the mets ,
is n't it strange how the nlcs that year with the astros almost
mirrored the 1980 nlcs with the phillies \? \? the astros have been

continued to walk alot after his promotion. he was then (i think) left

even the braves will tell you he underperformed because he was so mad

greg ,

the story goes like this

spanky is too slow ! if he were quicker , he would still be here.

to bring up that 11th pitcher. slaught is about as good as spanky and
prince is coming along nicely !

alomar last year.

what \? do you have some measure (like popularity in toronto does n't count)
that you are basing this statement on \?

uh , yes. baerga has a lot of flash , but alomar was the better hitter
last year.

this is fascinating. you say that alomar was the better hitter last

for alomar is obp.

for the second straight game , california scored a ton of late runs to crush
the brewhas. it was six runs in the 8th for a 12 5 win monday and five in
the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12 2 win yesterday. jamie navarro pitched
seven strong innings , but orosco , austin , manzanillo and lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. how 's this for numbers \? maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and navarro 's era is 0.75. the next lowest
on the staff is wegman at 5.14. ouch !

it does n't look much better for the hitters. hamilton is batting .481 , while
thon is hitting .458 and has seven rbi. the next highest is three. the next
best hitter is jaha at .267 and then vaughn , who has the team 's only hr , at
.238. another ouch. looking at the stats , it 's not hard to see why the team
is 2 5. in fact , 2 5 does n't sound bad when you 're averaging three runs game
and giving up 6.6 game.

still , it 's early and things will undoubtedly get better. the offense should
come around , but the bullpen is a major worry. fetters , plesac and austin gave
the brewers great middle relief last year. lloyd , maldanado , manzanillo ,
fetters , austin and orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. the starters will be okay ,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around , but the bullpen
is a big question mark.

in other news , nilsson and doran were reactivated yesterday , while william
suero was sent down and tim mcintosh was picked up by montreal. today 's game
with california was cancelled.

dtate @pitt.edu (david m. tate) writes

of course they left rbis off we 're comparing alomar the individual with
baerga the individual , so only individual stats count.

i forgot. most runs are scored by players stealing home , so rbi do n't
count for anything.

uh , right. you also forgot that you ca n't get an rbi (barring a hr) with
nobody on base. what fraction of all runs come on solo hr \?

most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good. i use the phrase happened to be advisedly.
lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to turn it up a notch in clutch rbi whatever situations , and
what they 've found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an
ability to any measurable extent. there are no clutch hitters. people who
tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base
end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.

my mistake.

i agree.

me , too... rbi are a worthless stat. of course , so is stolen bases because
sometimes runners are in front of a player that would otherwise run. and of
course pitchers pitch differently with different people on different bases ,
so batting average , slugging and obp out , too. hmmm... i guess homers would
not count then , either.
my point \? rbi might not be a perfect stat but nothing is. and no stat (or lack
of) can tell me there are no clutch hitters. maybe no stat can tell me ,
either , but some people are... i just know it ! ! ! 8)

2) astros relief corps holding together. if doug jones keeps his changeup
effective and xavier hernandez can be effective , then it 's passable.
there 's no reasonable left handed help , and the middle relief is iffy.
tom edens was expected to take over the joe boever setup man role , but
he 's been injured , and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway.
houston thought that boever would demand too much money , so they let him
go. doug jones can lose his touch he went from cleveland 's all star
closer to the minors in a pretty short span.

from what i understand , boever and murphy were considered expendable by the

club. houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players.. art doug jones is the key to houston 's success. he must have
another great year for houston to challenge in the nl west.
no argument at all with murphy. he scared the hell out of me when he came in
last year. on the other hand , the club though enough of boever to put him into
an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances he did at
least at some point). he seemed to be a very viable setup guy but i guess
that 's not considered that crucial by the club. i can just remember two years
ago so well , though...
...
the unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
club so far. biggio and finley just are n't doing their job of getting
on base. instead of filling his role as an rbi man , bagwell has had to
assume biggio and finley 's job. biggio concerns me , since he usually
starts the season very strong.

i'm not that concerned. those guys have been relatively consistent over the
years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries , not old , ...).
i expect them to come through just fine. it 's those guys that have not
been consistently good that are the worrisome part , even if they are coming
through right now.


on a side note , are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year 's uniform \? there is talk that their road uniform will be
(blech..) traditional grey , with the word houston written across the
chest. if i'm not mistaken , their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange (shiver..). mclane 's favorite color is red , so...

this sounds like their old road unis. pretty dull. buttons or pullovers \?
i 'll check through my uniform book to see if they 've always had some orange.

i'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible. i 'd like to see the uniform of the mid 1980s return. they
may not have been pretty , but houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball and i liked it.

well , we 'll see. i 've got a astros pullover shirt with the astros stripes
across the shoulders and i have trouble making myself wear it in public. i
can see why they might want that to change. gee , if they eliminate the
orange , will they reupholster the seats in the astros stripes section (what
used to be the gold and yellow levels i do n't know those numbers they use
now).

i saw a pinstripe version of an astros cap and i actually thought it looked
good !

as a philly fan as as a penna. baseball fan , i'm anxious to see the
penna. series. anyone know when it starts and where the first games
will be played \?

also off to a good start.

i totally agree with each point you made. jose viscaino looked
like a single a hitter up there. who swings on 3 1 count with maddux
pitching and your teams down by a run , and you have n't touched the ball
all
day. i also think too much is made of that lefty righty thing.
watching
the cubs games i get the feeling steve stone knows a lot more about
what
the cubs should be doing than lefebre does. harry said it best when he
stated after another terrible vizcaino at bat we ca n't wait til
sandberg returns !

i tell you , steve stone is like a prophet.
he must be making a ton in the boradcoast booth because
i ca n't understand why he 's not actually back in the game itself.

the other day he called sosa 's homerun against the sox and
claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the
score was 8 3 in the 5th.

so yesterday he notices that sosa 's ahead in the count against
maddux and says , this is a fastball situation and sosa will be
looking for it. but this is also the spot where maddux throws
the straight change. sure enough. sosa gets ahead on it and pops
it up to the infield.

was going over some videos last night.....

studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of jose canseco proved to be very
interesting. and enlightening.

here 's my analysis of jose canseco , circa sep '92 , and jose canseco ,
circa june 1986.

1. he 's bulked up too much. period. he needs to lose about 20 pounds ,
not gain more bulk.

2. his bat speed has absolutely vanished. conservatively , i 'd say he 's
lost 4 7 of his bat speed , and that 's a huge amount of speed.

3. that open stance is killing him. note that he acts sort of like
brian downing way open to start , then closes up as ball is
released. downing could do this without significant head movement
canseco ca n't. also , note that canseco does n't always close his
stance the same way sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes ,
they 're fully closed. without a good starting point , it 's hard
to make adjustments in your swing.

what would i do , if i were jose \?

aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch ,
so that i 'd never have to work again , i 'd restructure my entire swing.

first , minimize movement before the swing. close and widen the stance ,
and severely cut down the stride i take on my swing. hopefully , this
will cut down on the time i need to swing , and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

second , drop 20 pounds. cut out the weight work.

third , relax the wrists. will cost some power , but until i can find
my 1988 stroke , concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up , rolling
the wrists through the strike zone , and hit line drives. his strength
is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

if canseco 's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems , he 'll be out of baseball in three years. if not , he could
still hit 600 hr.



gary huckabay you think that 's loud enough , a hole \?

nntp posting host bruchner.biochem.duke.edu

since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of
approx. 40 posts (going back to the braves could be better off
if an injury happens) , i may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame !

1) back at the beginning of spring training , i though
lopez would make the squad easily. olson was still
recovering from his late season injury (knee , i believe) ,
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before june. and then berryhill was dinged up.

i was looking forward to this , because i believe that lopez
can hit and field the position. before last season , he was
the braves defensive catcher prospect , while brian deak was
the braves offensive catcher prospect. besides , olson
and berryhill could n't hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box , and do n't walk enough to be useful.

but olson recovered quickly , berryhill recovered , and the braves went
with the two vets. i still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season , he would n't have gotten his job back.

2) there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around.
after all , ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear. there are teams out there without one average ml catcher
(california and seattle come to mind). certainly , trying to
move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.
plus , you 'd have to eat that salary , which is n't huge , but is n't
tiddleywinks either (i think olson 's at about 800 , 000 , berryhill
at 450 , 000 , but that 's only what i recall).

3) yes , i think arbitration eligibility may have a role to
play in this also. what is it , that 5 6 of the 2 year players
are n't eligible for arbitration \? only the 1 6 that were on the roster
the longest are eligible \? of course , the system may change ,
but the extent of that change is not yet known. from a business
standpoint , it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the
first time olson berryhill go on the dl.

4) i am still disappointed that lopez is n't on the team.
i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves ,
and the truth is that i 'd rather see our best team on the field ,
which , imo , includes lopez.

of course , today we play the cubs. hopefully , we wo n't need him. )

as for the schuerholz cox conversation , i imagine it went
like this (remember , they 've both been gm 's)
(the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired)

cox ok , we 've sent jones down. his fielding could be a
little smoother. besides , blauser can hit ok and his fielding
is better than it used to be.

schuerholz well , we 'll have to send nieves down too. deion
just wo n't sign that baseball only contract. we ca n't count
on him in october , so we have to keep nixon around for the
defense. besides , gorman 's not ready to give up on
billy hatcher yet. once hatcher 's gone and deion signs ,
we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez. that ought to
give us some pitching depth in 1995.

cox yep , that 'll be nice. too bad deion wo n't sign.
ok , i 'll look for nieves when justice starts having
berry berry...er , back problems again. now , what about
klesko \?

schuerholz well , we 've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil
for bream. if we keep klesko , we either lose the money
or cabrera. i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell ,
but somehow he does n't seem to be the same gm. first
jeffries for jose , and now whiten for clark ! if he
gets rid of brian jordan , then i 'd have to believe that he
and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings !

cox ok , keep trying on bream , and i 'll wait til the trading
deadline for my hunter klesko platoon. maybe i can get a few
extra at bats for cabrera while we wait. try california...
if snow starts slowly , maybe whiteydal will bite on sid.
and if that does n't work , then perhaps sid 's knees
could be persuaded to act up. there 's always the
15 day dl ! mwa ha ha ha ha !

schuerholz what about caraballo \?

cox well , he 's not that much better than lemke. maybe if he starts
in richmond , he 'll start walking more. besides , if he 's going to be
arbitration eligible , better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.

schuerholz now , let 's see. that leaves lopez.

cox nooooo ! i gotta keep lopez ! sure , i did n't think olson
would recover this quickly. maybe i can talk caminiti into
running into him again \?

schuerholz nope , lopez has gotta go. you know that he 'll get
3 million in arbitration. may as well put it off that one
extra year. besides , until olson 's shown his stuff a little
bit , i ca n't trade him. besides , berryhill 's a left handed
hitter. you know how rare that is \?

cox do n't you mean a left handed whiffer \? pretty common ,
if you ask me. i mean , he made pat borders look good in
the world series. pat borders ! ! !

schuerholz hey , you 're the one who would n't write lopez
into the lineup.

cox well , you 're the one who went out and got me jeff
reardon ! besides , i thought lopez would n't be used
to our pitching staff 's stuff. he got some time with
them this spring...looked pretty good. come on , surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate \?

schuerholz yeah , but which stiff \? whichever one we keep
will be hurt by may.

cox ok , ok , you made your point. keep them both. surely
one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest. then i
can call up lopez , and then we can win 110 games ! the pennant !
the world series ! i 'll be up there with john mcgraw ! casey
stengel ! earl weaver ! oh , they laughed at me in toronto ,
but have you ever had to deal with george bell \? i 'll finally
get my just reward ! mwa ha ha ha !

schuerholz easy , bobby. have you been taking those
happy pills left around by chuck tanner \? why 'd you
ever hire that guy anyhow \?

cox do n't ask me ask ted.

well , perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be lopez in there. but they do have others worth playing , at
least in their opinion.

catcher is their weakest position , with the possible exception of second base.
they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team , and they
want to play olson and berryhill instead \? !

i disagree , in that i do n't think it is a tangible skill , any more than
leadership is. i do n't deny that it is a real skill , and that some catchers
may be much better than others at it , but i really do n't see any way that we
could ever know who they are. nichols 's law of catcher defense is eerily
accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very
seriously.

sorry. new. do n't know nichols' law.

a catcher 's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
recent offensive level of performance. thus , mickey tettleton goes (in
the media) from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger
in two short years. the rule does n't apply to perceived superstars , who
get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead. greg olson is probably
considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he ca n't hit.


do n't believe in catchers'
era. but i am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.

are n't they the same thing \?

in other words , we know more than they do , so the only logic behind
a different decision than we would make must be financial.

either that or just stupidity.

i presume
we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta , no \?

of course.

is it fair to the young players \? no. does it make organizational sense \?
i think it does.

well if it does make organizational sense , one can hardly fault them
for their decisions. i mean , please do n't tell me how to run my
business. especially when i'm being successful.

one could make the same sort of argument in other cases. pete rose , in
pursuing ty cobb 's record , was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet). the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime
of eric davis. that may be good business , but that does n't mean i do n't
loathe them for it.

you admit t p as a reliable( \? ) , objective source \? then you will note

or second starter. it seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound , the other teams score less runs. the team that scores the most
runs wins. this puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs). a low
scoring game would clearly benefit the braves.

not clear to me at all. i 'd certainly rather have a team who was winning
4 1 games than 2 1 games. in the 2 1 game , luck is going to play a much

therefore ,
16 wins thompson incaviglia

you obviously do n't know what the hell you 're talking about. no ,
thompson and incaviglia do n't equal 16 wins , but i 'll take the two
of them over stan javier and ruben amaro (.249 1hr , 334ab
.219 7hr 374 ab) i 'd say this improvement should equate to 6or 7
wins at least.

then , i 'll take lenny dykstra who played 85 games last year and
project his numbers (.301 , 104 hits , 18 2b 's , 6 hr , 39rbi , 30 sb)
over 150 games. thus(.301 , 188 hits , 32 2b 's , 11hr , 70rbi , 54 sb)
okay , now we 'll put these numbers in the leadoff hole and thus
i have to bump kruk , hollins , daulton rbi numbers up just a tad...
now lesse... they knocked in 70 , 93 , and 109 respectively. do n't
you think it 's fair to add about 5 or 6 rbi to each \? they managed
to knock in a pretty nice amount of runs with a .219 leadoff hitter.
okay bozo , do you think it 's fair to add maybe 7 or 8 more wins
now \? oh , and how can i forget wes chamberlain , 275 ab 's 9 hr ,
41 rbi even with a month and 1 2 in aaa and a horrible first half.
well project that over a full season to get 18 hr and 80 rbi or so.
is that worth a win or two \?

finally , take the worse pitching staff in the nl last year , add
the worse injury decimation of 1992. okay , now we add danny

smiley trade was good for the pirates. but i think ted could have gotten

the cole trade was excellent. but simmons has botched it up now.
this year 's draft seems to have gone well for the pirates. but then they

orioles vs. texas at camden yards , april 5 , opening day

batting 9th for texas , playing second base

billy ... ripken

the hometown crowd gave their favorite ex 2nd baseman a 2 minute standing
ovation as billy , wearing flashy shades , took the cheers smiling and
waving.

consummate role player (in the words of p.a. caller jon miller)
tim hulett failed to receive similar cheers when announced. mainly because
he did n't have the courtesy to show up.

was n't hulett injured yesterday after being hit in the face with a ball
while running bases \? i heard something about him recieving stiches and a
possible broken nose. is he at the park \?

fernando was warmly received , good to see that.

let 's see how they feel when he 's 0 and 4 with a 4.9 era. i have my
doubts about fernando.

f.y.i , when cal was announced , jon miller says
it seems like yesterday when this young man...began a consecutive
game streak ... 10 time all star , 2 time mvp , 2 time gold glover , our
future hall of fame shortsop , batting 3rd , cal ripken . the standing o
lasted about 15 seconds. 1 45 less than billy. blargh.

well , when a fan favorite gets dumped , he 's gonna get an outstanding
ovation on his first return. let 's add up the ovations cal has recieved
over the years during the game and compare that to billy.

btw , sutcliffe 's getting knocked around pretty good. rangers up 5 1 in

just wondering. a friend and i were talking the other day , and
we were (for some reason) trying to come up with names of jewish
baseball players , past and present. we were n't able to come up
with much , except for sandy koufax , (somebody) stankowitz , and
maybe john lowenstein. can anyone come up with any more. i know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this , but
humor us. thanks for your help.

hank greenberg would have to be the most famous , because his jewish
faith actually affected his play. (missing late season or was it world
series games because of yom kippur)

the other jewish hof'er is rod carew (who converted).

did he ever really convert \? he married a jewish woman , but i 've never
heard him say he converted. elliot maddox , on the other hand...

lowenstein is jewish , as well as montana 's only representative to the
major leagues.

undeserving cy young award winner steve stone is jewish. between stone ,
koufax , ken holtzman ( \? might have the wrong pitcher , i'm thinking of the
one who threw a no hitter in both the al and nl) , and big ed reulbach ,
that 's quite a starting rotation. moe berg can catch. harry steinfeldt ,
the 3b in the tinkers evers chance infield.

yep , holtzman. saul rogovin won an era title in 1949 or so before blowing out
the arm.

is stanky jewish \? or is that just a dave cohen kinda misinterpretation \?
whatever , does n't look like he stuck around the majors too long.

i 'd be surprised. btw , they may just be shopping gallego around to
make room for as.

i'm pretty sure that sandberg has done this at least once. (i know someone

rbis and runs scored are the two most important offensive statistics. you
can talk about obp and slg all you want , but the fact remains

the team that scores more runs wins the game !


right. so who cares which player gets credited , as long as the team
gets more runs \? if a player helps the team get more r and rbi , but
does n't score them all himself , who cares \?

consider

player a single.
player b grounder to short reaches on the force at 2nd.
player c double , b to 3rd.
player d sac fly.

b gets a run , d gets an rbi. are you sure they helped the team
more than a and c \? think hard , now.

in article 8994@blue.cis.pitt.edu traven@pitt.edu (neal traven) writes

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning , with the
split probably somewhere around 49.5 and 0.5 .

i 'd give baserunning a little more credit than that , maybe 45 5 , or
even 40 10. give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds
identical batting stats (which would n't be that unreasonable) , and
even if you do n't let roberto steal a single base , they 'll score a lot
more than the oleruds by going first to third more often. (no offense ,
gordon).

i would n't give baserunning that much value.

the above effect is clear , but there are other effects as well. if
olerud hits a double , any runner on first will score if alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap , the runner on first may need to hold
at third. thus olerud 's doubles have more advancement value than
alomar 's. (of course , alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams. no
team in the 1950 's ran much , but some teams certainly had faster players
than others. still , the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950 's for all teams.

bill james gives the 1955 1958 senators as an example. they used harmon
killebrew regularly as a pinch runner , and in 1957 , stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing. yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by runs created.

has jack lost a bit of his edge \? what is the worst start jack morris has had \?

uh , jack lost his edge about 5 years ago , and has had only one above
average year in the last 5.

again goes to prove that it is better to be good than lucky. you can
count on good tomorrow. lucky seems to be prone to bad starts (and a
bad finish last year ).

(yes , i am enjoying every last run he gives up. who was it who said
morris was a better signing than viola \? )

hey valentine , i do n't see boston with any world series rings on their
fingers.

oooooo. cheap shot. )

damn , morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his
future.

who cares \? he had two of them before he came to toronto and if the
jays had signed viola instead of morris , it would have been frank who
won 20 and got the ring. and he would be on his way to 20 this year , too.

therefore , i would have to say toronto easily made the best
signing.

your logic is curious , and spurious.

there is no reason to believe that viola would n't have won as many games
had he signed with toronto. when you compare their stupid w l records ,
be sure to compare their team 's offensive averages too.


now , looking at anything like the morris viola sweepstakes a year later
is basically hindsight. but there were plenty of reasons why it
should have been apparent that viola was the better pitcher , based
on previous recent years and also based on age (frank is almost 5
years younger ! how many knew that \? ). people got caught up in the '91
world series , and then on morris' 21 wins last year. wins are the stupidest ,
most misleading statistic in baseball , far worse than rbi or r. that he
won 21 just means that the jays got him a lot of runs.

the only really valid retort to valentine is were n't the red sox trying
to get morris too \? oh , sure , they said viola was their first choice
afterwards , but what should we have expected they would say \?

and do n't tell me boston will win this year. they wo n't
even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th.

if this is true , it wo n't be for lack of contribution by viola , so who cares \?

obbase apparently the new owner (drayton mclain (sp \? )) does n't particularly
like excuses. an item in our paper (the austin american statesman if you

injuries as an excuse for losing because that possibility should have been
accounted for. uh , oh. i do n't want an owner that 'll keep everybody on
edge i 'd never gotten that feeling about him , but who knows \? does


to be honest , i think the city of houston loves the new owner. he has
brought baseball back to houston with key acquisitions players that
were from the houston area and wanted to play for the astros. i do n't
think that too many people are fearful that mclane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he does n't know a whole lot about baseball.
mclane is a businessman , and does n't like excuses. he makes a valid point
that injuries should n't be an excuse to this club. look at the depth of the
bench this season.. canadele can play 7 positions bass and james are solid
outfielders and can hit well too uribe is nice to have as well.. the
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters. we 're dealing with a young
houston team , so injuries should n't play a big role. the only threat is
the bullpen if jonesy goes out , we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season , there is less pressure on the pen.

my question to you all is why does the media seem to embrace the theme of the
death of baseball so strongly \? i have seen articles of a similar vein in
the chicago tribune and in sports editorials on tv.

maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom.
these allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times , losing
money , bankruptcies at an alarming rate , and there 's going to be an
increased degradation of the product they produce. could you imagine
ibm , with all their problems , promoting themselves the way major league
baseball does \? their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not
that they are too far from it now ). what would happen at gm \? where
would gm be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
inferior product because of alleged labor problems \? i think it shows a
lack of confidence for the people who run the game.

anyway , it just frustrates me when the media says such things , because it
inevitably leads to owners trying quick fixes like increasing play offs to
satisfy television or trying interleague play to drum up interest.

forget it. word has it three divisions with a wild card is just about
a done deal. it has to be decided soon since negotiations with the
networks also have to begin soon.

summary oh please , it 's way too early to get upset.

mamatha devineni ratnam mr47 @andrew.cmu.edu writes
so far simmons looks like a total idiot.

whatever you say. i think it 's just 12 games into the season myself , so
i'm going to wait a bit before calling names.

2) i am sure simmons was ready to say i told you so after otto had an
impressive win last week. now otto 's latest debacle has restored simmons'
reputation. now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
al 's highest era among starters. four our sake(not ted 's sake) , i hope he
pitches with a 3.5 era for the rest of the season. yeah , right.

i expect that dave otto will be a really bad pitcher , and i have no
idea why simmons ever wanted him. on the other hand , i expect him to
release otto if he does n't turn things around pretty fast. (btw ,
otto 's game score for that 0 ip stinker was only 22 , which points out
a problem with the method since otto 's performance was infinitely bad ,
and excruciatingly prolonged.)

3) tomlin and merced are a bit disappointing. they are still doing decently.
but considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons , they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse.

i think merced 's rookie year was a bit flukey , but are n't you willing to
give him some more at bats (and tomlin a few more starts) before acting
so gloomy \?

4) walk well , he seems to be on the losing end tonight. but i still think
that walk desrved his contract.

no he did n't. walk is a time bomb. he has no stuff whatsoever , and when
the league finally realizes this , it wo n't be pretty at all.

8) the rookie batters well , young has surprised me a bit with his
instant impact. other than that , their excellent performance has n't
been too much of a surprise. i think we should thank doughty for that.

do n't be so fast. doughty is the guy who signed steve buechele , which
was a move that threatened to bury kevin young in the minors.
meanwhile , i'm not sure whether doughty or simmons signed martin as a
six year free agent before the 1992 season.

9) rookie pitchers worse than expected , especially cooke.

twice through the rotation , and you 've given up \? yikes.

10) slaught how come he was n't given a contract extension last year \?
now his value has increased immensely.

but so has his age , at least in baseball terms. the useful half life
of a 34 year old injury prone catcher ca n't be much longer than a year.

11) lonnie smith ! ! well , eric davis was signed for a comparable amount.

but he wanted to be a dodger , and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992. i do n't think there was any chance for the bucs to sign
him.

let 's see. eric can hit better. he can run better. he can field better.
now why didnt the pirates go after eric davis. an injured davis is better
than a healthy lonnie smith.

he certainly was n't last year.

even if lonnnie smith gets some big hits this year , he wo n't be an asset.
he has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

hey , that 's the skates smith package deal. anybody who acquires
lonnie for his defense or base running (particularly at this stage) is
a real weirdo.

12) management big big zero. sauer has yet to make a forceful argument
in favor of revenue sharing. he seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot danforth by preparing the team for a move to tampa bay.

if that 's the goal of the team ownership , than i do n't see why sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy. i do n't know what he has or
has n't said about revenue sharing , so i ca n't comment there.

13) alex cole fiasco.
stuff deleted
ironically , the biggest accomplishment of simmons' tenure was
getting alex cole really cheap. too bad. that he gave him away in the
expansion draft.

it 's annoying , but since leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain jeff king , it was probably unavoidable. meanwhile , i think
bigger accomplishments of simmons' tenure were getting some value for
john smiley , not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year , drafting well in 1992 , letting the rookies show something
in 1993. foley , smith , and candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts , which means that even if fail it has n't done serious damage to
the bucs' future.

14) compensatory draft picks for bonds forget it. the pirates can rant
and rave. they will not get those picks. as of now , the issue is still
being appealed.

does this mean that the bucs lost the initial arbitration case \? i
never heard the outcome of this. when will the final verdict be in on
this \?

now , if this doesnt convince anyone that simmons and sauer are idiots ,
nothing else will.

i'm not sure who was the idiot in this case , so i do n't know who to
blame. it might have been doug danforth , after all. in fact , i
seriously suspect it was doug danforth , who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet.

(btw i 've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting
off site , so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can see
this , would he drop me a short note \? )

spanky is too slow ! if he were quicker , he would still be here.
but with slaught and tom prince , they did n't want to lose prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher. slaught is about as good as spanky and
prince is coming along nicely !

tom prince is a 28 year old no hit catcher. think of him as a young dann
bilardello.

or a young don bordello...

i ca n't begin to fathom why the pirates have been so afraid of
losing this guy , who 's been in aaa most of the last 5 seasons. the pirates
released kirk gibson last year because prince was out of options , then
eventually sent prince down anyway , and he cleared waivers without a peep.
he 's another year older , and still ca n't hit why do they think he would n't
clear waivers now \? why would they care \?

there 's a strong possibility that the bucs have absolutely no other catching
prospects in the minors at this point at least nobody ready for any serious
aaa majors duty. the main reason they might have stayed with prince could be
just age , especially if spanky was creeping toward his mid 30s or something.

all things considered , though , i 'd be a lot more comfortable with spanky behind
the plate than prince. is n't there decent backup backstop out there looking
for work \?

waivers as three other clubs were also very interested in him. a gamble \?
yes.

oh , it will \? as a royals fan , i am skeptical. they say he pitched well
in winter ball. he also pitched well at omaha while with kc. he just
did n't pitch well (or even acceptably) when in the majors. (i do n't have
his atlanta stats , but he must not have impressed them very much either.)

spanky is n't very good defensively anymore , he 's an offensive liability , and ,
judging from his outburst this winter after the bucs failed to sign drabek ,
he 's a jerk with his head in the sand. tommy prince , on the other hand , ca n't
hit. in the paper , simmons was citing the case of tom pagnozzi , who never hit
in the minors or majors , but suddenly somehow learned how.

geez , dal must have slipped something into ted 's drink sometime. comparing
prince to pagnozzi offensively is laughable. prince has never hit well in
the minors and he 's now 27 years old , i think. pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors. (i 'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming i do n't have
another brain cramp and forget.) he had a very good year at louisville
before coming up to the majors. as i recall , the hype on pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit , decent fielding. when he got to the
majors and did n't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time \? ) , he
became exhibit 312 in nichols' law of catcher defense and got the reputation
as an outstanding defensive catcher. it 's not clear he ever learned to
hit. his four years with more than 100 ab

no power , less than league average walks , peak year when he turned 28 ,
now declining. if ted is going to invoke pagnozzi as a model for prince ,
given that prince has underperformed pagnozzi in the minors , it 's not
a rosy picture.

btw , i'm still unhappy with moving zeile , who had the same reputation
coming up in the cardinal organization as pagnozzi , except that he was
a much , much better hitter , to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a well above average hitter
as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to
death , but i have n't seen anything in rsb yet.

gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run. he stroked a line drive into the
right field corner. the ball cleared the three foot high fence and
went into the crowd. darryl , racing over from right center , got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence , but he
missed the ball. a fan sitting in the front row , wearing a mitt ,
reached up and caught the ball. home run.

now i 've seen the replay several times and i have concluded that
darryl missed the ball , and that the fan 's glove was essentially
behind darryl 's. several dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
strawberry. what cannot be disputed , however , is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing. he was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

stuff about daryl and tommy and everyone blaming fan for the loss deleted

i saw the replay several times too. no question about it. daryl missed
the ball , then the fan caught it. daryl is so tall that he had the
first shot at the ball. daryl 's just whining again. i think it shows a
lack of class when tommy , daryl and the dodgers blame a single fan for
losing the game. what about the pitcher who threw up the gopher ball \?
what about the pitchers that gave up 6 runs up to that point \? sorry , tommy.
if it were a 2 1 game and daryl was 5 feet 2 inches tall , then maybe
just maybe you 'd have an argument.

most of this discussion has been between mark singer and david tate ,
with valentine weighing in on the same side as dave at various times.
my opinion , fwiw , to all

mark , age does n't matter ability does. i would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best. i do n't care if he is 15 if he plays
better than what i have , i want him out there. sandy alomar had decent
minor league numbers , grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las
vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter (which is good for a catcher , i 'll admit). santiago 's
numbers would probably come out the same as sandy 's , but i do n't have
the league data from the mid 80s to check it out.

that being said , i agree with sending lopez to richmond , at least to
start the season. as the box below shows , he has one minor league
season in which he hit well. he has two in which he hit very , very
poorly. i want to see that the 92 lopez is real. olson and berryhill
are not complete mediocrities for catchers , especially nl catchers ,
they are essentially average hitters , with equivalent averages around
.220. if he had hit well at prior levels , i would say he belongs on
the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as alomar in 90 or santiago in 87. one year at
any level , at any age , does n't satisfy my standards of evidence.

on a similar note , i do n't understand why more people are not
supportive of neon deion. granted , i thought his behavior with
mccarver last year was completely bush. last year was the first time
he ever got 300 ab in one place , so his lines are hard to read. but he
has a combined 720 ops in minor league play with his speed is more
valuable than the ops alone indicates and at a still young age (24) ,
had a monster year with an 868 ops. he has a total , major and minor ,
eqa of .249 above major league average , and above average for cf
(which was about .240 in the nl last year). he has shown at least the
potential of going into the .290s , which would make him one of the 15
best hitters in the league. he has two full seasons before reaching
his prime season of 27. he should be considered as a legitimate
prospect , and not as a simple side show attraction.

just wondering. a friend and i were talking the other day , and
we were (for some reason) trying to come up with names of jewish
baseball players , past and present. we were n't able to come up
with much , except for sandy koufax , (somebody) stankowitz , and
maybe john lowenstein. can anyone come up with any more. i know
it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this , but
humor us. thanks for your help.

hank greenberg would have to be the most famous , because his jewish
faith actually affected his play. (missing late season or was it world
series games because of yom kippur)

the other jewish hof'er is rod carew (who converted).

lowenstein is jewish , as well as montana 's only representative to the
major leagues.

undeserving cy young award winner steve stone is jewish. between stone ,
koufax , ken holtzman ( \? might have the wrong pitcher , i'm thinking of the
one who threw a no hitter in both the al and nl) , and big ed reulbach ,
that 's quite a starting rotation. moe berg can catch. harry steinfeldt ,
the 3b in the tinkers evers chance infield.

is stanky jewish \? or is that just a dave cohen kinda misinterpretation \?
whatever , does n't look like he stuck around the majors too long.

i was watching peter gammons on espn last night , and he 's got me a little
confused.

while talking about expansion , he started mentioning people who might benefit
from the fringe players they 'll be facing mcgriff hitting 50 home runs ,
sheffield getting 150 rbi 's , and glavine winning 25 games. this was ,
of course , all in reference to what happened the other times that baseball
has expanded (early 60 's , late 60 's , late 70 's).

what really confused me , though , was the mention of al players who would
do well next year. specifically , roger clemens winning 25 games , and the
likes of mcgwire and gonzalez hitting 50 home runs.

my question is how in the hell will the rockies marlins help the al \? the
last time i looked , there was n't a lot of talent jumping leagues. did i
miss something \?

dennis cleary
dfcleary@ucdavis.edu


i wondered the same thing. when he first mentioned it , i thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over. and then in the
examples from other years , he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded.

so (since stats never lie ) ) , i guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up
players that , normally , they would not have had there not been expansion.

make sense \?

of course they left rbis off we 're comparing alomar the individual with
baerga the individual , so only individual stats count.

i forgot. most runs are scored by players stealing home , so rbi do n't
count for anything.

uh , right. you also forgot that you ca n't get an rbi (barring a hr) with
nobody on base. what fraction of all runs come on solo hr \?

most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good. i use the phrase happened to be advisedly.
lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to turn it up a notch in clutch rbi whatever situations , and
what they 've found is that there is no evidence that anyone has such an
ability to any measurable extent. there are no clutch hitters. people who
tend to do things that would cause an rbi if there were somebody on base
end up getting rbis proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.

my mistake.

i agree.

calderon \? martinez \? kittle \? the spot was there. the talent was
there. sure , i say go for it.

i am not convinced that lopez is anywhere near as talented as thomas

cal eldred was 24 when he came up , with a full season at aaa and a

make the club in 1992. bones is a year younger with a lousy prior

the rotation has changed due to a strange injury to scott erickson. he
developed a twinge in the stomach area and has been taken out of the

kevin tapani , jim deshais , pat mahomes , willie banks.

add mike trombley in there somewhere , since they need five people. mark
guthrie will remain in the bullpen as the long lefty.

as to ss and 3b
short will be played by scott leius who played short for much of his career
before the twins. at third mike pagliarulo and jeff reboulet will platoon.

pags and terry jorgenson will platoon at third , with reboulet as the
backup infielder. pags looked pretty miserable yesterday for a guy who
lead the league in da in 1991 , muffing what should be routine grounders
(heck , muffing a grounder i would probably have gotten to). jorgenson
did nothing exceptional that i noticed. leius missed a ball i think
gagne would have reached we will certainly miss gag 's glove this season.

winfield has struggled during preseason. sunday against the colorado
rockies he went 2 for 3 with 2 rbis and scored once.

he looked pretty good there. contrary to what the mediots have been saying ,
he looked reasonable at first. he is n't mid 80s hrbek , but then neither is
the pretty big guy himself any more (note i'm used to seeing the twins
1b looking kinda big on the field , but not that big ! ). if he hits vaguely
like last year , he 's a perfectly good first baseman.

note much of this posting is from personal observation yesterday in a game
where the regulars were mostly pulled after several innings. winfield may
have big holes in his defensive game that did n't show up (he did n't have to
pick any bad throws , for example) , but i 'll take what i saw so far.

damn , morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his

he certainly did n't earn his last one. how many games did he blow
in the world series \? all of the ones he started \?
he certainly did earn it ! he was a valuable member of the blue jay team.

not particularly in the world series. during the season , he was probably
more valuable than , say , putting olerud out there to pitch , but yeah , he
was valuable in getting them there. in the postseason , he sucked dirty
canal water through a straw. the jays won in spite of morris much more
than because of him.

therefore , i would have to say toronto easily made the best signing.
oh , yes. definitely. therefore morris is better than clemens.
your definition of better refers to some measurement on a scale that
has nothing to do with winning ws rings.

umm , roger \? return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago ,
where the poster valentine was replying to used of ws rings as a measure
of better. the concept is called context , and you should really become
familiar with it someday.

the facts are that morris
has shown us that he has what it takes to play on a ws winning club.
clemens has n't.

unless this transaltes to clemens has n't gone into lou gorman 's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he 'd been traded to
the jays , i'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.

you can go on about what clemens has done in the
past and claim that he is better than morris if you want to. but
the facts are that morris has shown us that he can win and clemens
has n't.

what on earth does this mean \? over their careers , clemens has won 68 of
the games he 's started , morris 58 . per year , clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins , morris just under 15. would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning a game \? if
so , then consider that clemens allows 2.8 runs 9 innings pitched. morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. in fact , jack morris has never in
his career had an era for a single year as good as clemens' career era. but
i forget , in the maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to buckner missing that grounder in 1986 had morris been on the sox , it
would have been a routine groundout , right \?

whether or not clemens is better by your standard of measurement
is totally meaningless. the object of the game is not to compile
high figures in statistics that you have chosen to feel are important.
the object of the game is to contribute to ws victories. but this
has been patiently explained to you many , many times and you are
either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.

speaking of stupid , it has been patiently (and not so patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.

do n't give me that shit. if boston had alomar , olerud , henke , and
ward while toronto had rivera , jack clark , jeff reardon , things would
have looked a little different last fall. give credit where credit is
due. this lavishing of praise on morris makes me sick.
yes and the dog would have caught the rabbit too...forget about what
did n't happen and open your eyes , for once , and look out there and
see what is really happening. forget about how morris should n't
have won 21 with an era over 4.
when morris pitched , last year , the jays won. stop crying about it and
get on with life.

no one is crying the jays won , and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the al east. they performed well in two short series and won the
world series , and i congratulate them for it. as a red sox fan , i hope they
keep morris. i was happy when they picked up stewart , and elated when they
traded for darrin jackson. you see , unless you believe in some mystical link
between morris and the offense , you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. luck runs
out , just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50 odd more innings than 1992 ,
gave up exactly one earned run more than in 1992 , and went 17 16.

seriously , roger , i 'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 morris and the 1992 morris. which one was a better pitcher ,
and why \? did morris somehow learn how to win in the intervening ten years \?
if so , then why did he go 18 12 in 1991 with minnesota with an era over half
a run lower than 1992 \?

subject new uniforms
organization university of virginia
lines 22

usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor
uniform change per season , but the past few seasons have been
incredible.
any thoughts on the new (old) reds uniforms. i
remember seeing a pete rose rookie card , and unless i miss my
guess he was wearing the exact same duds.
the mets (how about doc's performance today \? ! ! ! ! ! ) have
reinserted the mets patch on the shoulder , and changed the mets
insgnia on the front of the jersey. to my knowledge it is the
first time that has been changed since 1962 , and it reminds me
a little of the dodger logo.
many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform , or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(phillies , reds , expos , white sox , padres , etc.) and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray. the trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years , as opposed to the cookie cutter saucer stadiums
construcrted throughout the sixties.
with salaries now reaching unbelievable highs , no one
in the comissioner 's office , and inter league play on the
horizon , it 's nice to see that baseball at least looks like it
was meant to be.

the dodger batting coach who flew in from florida three days
ago and gave them a pep talk and some instruction. davis was
4 5 yesterday and had a couple more hits today. strawberry
had two hits yesterday and i believe he had two more today , with
two home runs.


foolish me. and here i thought it had something to do with the
fact that they were hitting against wakefield , who had no kncukle

reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the

keeping in line with the pessimists on the net , i 'll hold off on the astros
being all the way back. they could indeed contend , but that would count on
1) atlanta encountering some unforeseen problems , such as injuries or keeping
up their early season abysmal hitting.

while atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation , i feel that their
relief staff may be suspect. they do n't have a real closer although
mike stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role. did n't stanton start off
great last year and then falter \? despite this , your point is well taken.
atlanta does n't seem to have the same personality as a ny team , thus is
unlikely to self destruct. for houston to take 'em , atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries , particularly to their starting rotation.


2) astros relief corps holding together. if doug jones keeps his changeup
effective and xavier hernandez can be effective , then it 's passable.
there 's no reasonable left handed help , and the middle relief is iffy.
tom edens was expected to take over the joe boever setup man role , but
he 's been injured , and he was an expansion team acquisition anyway.
houston thought that boever would demand too much money , so they let him
go. doug jones can lose his touch he went from cleveland 's all star
closer to the minors in a pretty short span.

from what i understand , boever and murphy were considered expendable by the
club. houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players.. art doug jones is the key to houston 's success. he must have
another great year for houston to challenge in the nl west.

lousey spring.
closer to the minors in a pretty short span.


right ! a strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling
bullpen.


bit of shakiness at the fifth starter slot (but that 's basically normal).
4) taubensee , anthony , gonzalez , and cedeno fulfilling some hitting potential.
anthony appears to be about there , taubensee 's swing looks a lot better
this year (solid knock against expos last night) , gonzalez is showing
some early power , and cedeno still has the loopiest swing this side of
tim wallach.

the unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
club so far. biggio and finley just are n't doing their job of getting
on base. instead of filling his role as an rbi man , bagwell has had to
assume biggio and finley 's job. biggio concerns me , since he usually
starts the season very strong.




on a side note , are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year 's uniform \? there is talk that their road uniform will be
(blech..) traditional grey , with the word houston written across the
chest. if i'm not mistaken , their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange (shiver..). mclane 's favorite color is red , so...
i'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible. i 'd like to see the uniform of the mid 1980s return. they
may not have been pretty , but houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball and i liked it.

end of the bargain (remember two years ago \? a little relief goes a long way) ,
then they could win 90 games. but , i doubt it. i 'll project them at 85 wins.

i dont know if an expansion team has ever finished not last but i think
this year might be a first if it hasnt ever happened. the cubs are worse

the 1961 angels were 1 2 game out of 7th. the athletics and
expansion senators finished tied for last.
the 1962 colt 45 's finshed 8th ahead of the cubs (the mets were last).
the 1969 royals finshed 4th ahead of the white sox (the pilots in last).
the 1977 mariners finished 6th ahead of the athletics(in last).

apparently being an expansion team with a poor a 's or chicago
team around is a `good thing'

i meant that one should not let the exception make the rule.

it 's not an exception. good players come up young most players who come
up young will be good. this has always been the rule.


are most players who come up young always good when they 're young , or
later \?

worse it 's not a shift . this is the way it has always been. several
detailed studies of this have been done , and they 've all shown that players
are n't coming up any younger or older than in the past , and they are n't
playing any more or less in the minors than they used to. the only thing
that shifts is our memories of the good old days ).

damn. i was afraid you would say that !


but all after the fact , which makes it not applicable to the current
discussion , which is about how you decide whether to play the rookie who
has n't established himself in the majors over the mediocre veteran. the
padres played santiago that year because they clearly had nobody else worth
playing.

well , perhaps if the braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be lopez in there. but they do have others worth playing , at
least in their opinion. and i happen to agree.


both of these young men were highly touted defensive catchers ,
expected to be among the best ever in baseball.

not by rec.sport.baseball consensus. that may sound like an incredibly
arrogant comment , but i 've found that the sdcn consensus (when one exists)
is right far more often than the media consensus or the opinions of baseball
people affiliated with mlb.

i can believe that. i'm a newbie here , so i 'll take your word. but
alomar is a fine defensive catcher , which was my statement above.
that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age , as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit. lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess , and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded seasoning .


i do n't know who knows . i suppose the same people (or similar) who
know he will be better than some other catcher. these are , of
course , just differing opinions. i read that his arm is not that
strong (i suppose somewhere there is some measurement of sb ratios)
and that he is still learning to call a game. that latter skill may
be difficult to project on someone without an intimate knowledge of
his performance , but it is a tangible skill.

i disagree , in that i do n't think it is a tangible skill , any more than
leadership is. i do n't deny that it is a real skill , and that some catchers
may be much better than others at it , but i really do n't see any way that we
could ever know who they are. nichols 's law of catcher defense is eerily
accurate far too often for me to take defensive assessments of catchers very
seriously.

sorry. new. do n't know nichols' law. do n't believe in catchers'
era. but i am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.
any info on that \?



absolutely. the evidence is piling up , year after year. the only other
alternative is that the braves really do n't know that their young players
are , on average , better than their current starters. i'm not ruling out that
kind of gross incompetence , but i think the salary schedule explanation is
more charitable.

in other words , we know more than they do , so the only logic behind
a different decision than we would make must be financial. i presume
we feel this way about other franchises than atlanta , no \?


consider we know that the braves are about the strongest team in baseball
right now , even with olson and lemke and nixon and bream in the lineup. they
have as good a chance of repeating as champs this year as any team ever has.
it actually makes some sense to say rather than making our team marginally
better this year by bringing up the young studs and dumping the elderly , let 's
go ahead and compete this year with what we have , and then bring up the studs
only as we have to , so that we 'll still have them under reserve three years
from now and beyond when the current team will be collecting pensions.

is it fair to the young players \? no. does it make organizational sense \?
i think it does.

well if it does make organizational sense , one can hardly fault them
for their decisions. i mean , please do n't tell me how to run my
business. especially when i'm being successful.


c i could make it 107 or 108 wins if you let me bring up lopez.

s listen , bobby. i 'd like to. but the way i see it , if he hits
the big club this year we 'll be paying mega arbitration bucks
down the road in a couple of years and there 's no way i want
to do that.

...and continues with

we can win without him , and then keep winning next year with him.
how 's that \?

i'm sure you could be right. you could also be smoking some illegal
substance.

(hey. that 's a joke. do n't get offended. please.)


hey , i 'd love to be wrong about this. if you think it 's unlikely , i 'd love
to know why. do n't cite anybody 's innate ethical rectitude , though , unless
you know them personally.


well , i ca n't cite anyone 's ethical rectitude because i do n't know
what it means. )

but again , if it makes organizational sense , then so be it. baseball
is a business , and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
lopez on the farm then that 's what the braves should do.

i happen to believe that it 's a baseball decision. while you from
your armchair may disagee , i do n't. i think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made. i predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training. i
think it is a very normal decision to have made. it is certainly
more reversible than to have started lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers. sure , it may be conservative. it
may also be logical. i do n't know what ethics have to do with it.
seems like pretty good common sense to me.

a team that was as good as the 26 28 yankees , while the
yankees had aged some from their peak years. ruth and gehrig
could n't play every position simultaneously.

imo , given the various ages of the braves and reds this season ,
that the braves will be closer to their peak , while the reds
have slightly passed their peak.

also , if you 're going to compare braves and yankees , a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 braves might be the '23 yankees.
after falling short two years in a row in exciting world series ,
both teams won will win the series this year , despite the

this is fascinating. you say that alomar was the better hitter last

had a better year. the only category that i see which shows an advantage
for alomar is obp.

well , obp is the most important offensive statistic , and by a big margin.
50 points of obp is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
that being said , i still think baerga was very slightly better last year ,
but i think this is as close to a wash as you 're likely to find.

i personally do n't care much for alomar 's defense. i do n't think he 's
nearly as good as people make him out to be , and he ca n't turn the dp
to save his life. he comes across the bag improperly , and his release
is slow. considering the high leverage of the dp , this is a shortcoming
i ca n't overlook. in the long term , i 'd move alomar to another position.

if the jays could trade a hot devon white for something , i 'll be alomar

this is what jackson looked like in 88 91 , with everything converted
to a neutral park , on the basis of run production. his equivalent
average started at .253 in 88 , was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. so
let us say he had established , in his last two seasons , a .280 level
of play.

that is good. very good , in fact. but it probably does n't make the top
ten in the league. the 10th best eqa in the al in 1992 was dave
winfield 's .296 thomas was first at .350. first in the nl was bonds ,
an incroyable .378 tenth was bip roberts , .297. but .280 is better
than any season in the past five years by joe carter it is about what
mattingly had in 1988 (.285) what felix jose had the last two years
just ahead of time raines' five year average better than ryan
klesko 's mles.

he got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing , though his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
that is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. the
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. i think he was a
good , maybe very good hitter. he was imo , something like the 30th best
hitter in the majors.

the next 3 (or at least the last two) were played with the angels. lots
of factors make a player excell... i hate it when so many use the dome.
it may not be ideal , but nice to comfortably enjoy baseball and football

i'm sure the company for which i work does not have all the same opinions

the event that had the most impact on gaetti 's career was his leg injury
in 1988. his performance dropped radically from 1988 to 1989. he was
still with the twins in 1989 and 1990 , but if you look at his stats (both
offensive and defensive) , he never has come back to his pre injury level.

moe berg , my hero ! we were just talking about him on monday at the

i think the title is moe berg athlete , scholar , spy , by tom sewell
and two other people whose names i forget. sewell wrote the chapter
on berg in danny peary 's book cult baseball players this is a good
source for some of the more famous anecdotes about berg. also excellent
is the section on him in bill gilbert 's book they also served , about
baseball during wwii. i'm told berg 's spy activities are mentioned in
the recent book heisenberg 's war .

his sister also wrote a book about moe that she self published. the
title is something like my brother , morris berg . it 's mainly some of
her memories and page after page of xerox copies of pictures and letters
that moe had saved. copies are kinda hard to find , but the smith baseball
library has one for those in minneapolis...

we have one here , at berg 's alma mater (class of 1923). it 's kind of

i have posted two new postings on the net , since i discovered how to use it ,
and both times i received redicule for predicting the red sox as high as
third in the al east. id like to hear why it is people dont think the sox
can be as high as third this year. here are some of my observations

well , had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions , the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured. be that as it may....

1. roger and frank are in vintage form , and the sox are rresponding to them.
clemens is always in this form , and viola is n't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected. how do you know that the sox are
responding to them , and not to al bumbry , hobson , or (my most likely
suspect) new hitting coach mike easler \? i certainly am more likely to give
easler credit for mo vaughhn 's hot start than clemens or viola.

2. greenwell is hitting as he did before his injuries.
this was the optimistic scenario , but not unreasonably so. he has n't shown
much power yet , though.

3. dawson is providing the leadership and some hitting they need from him.
how can you tell that dawson is providing the leadership \? perhaps it 's
calderon \? perhaps it 's clemens and viola \? maybe hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. or maybe
it 's all a myth. and dawson has been hitting reasonably well , but not as
well as greenwell , vaughn , cooper , or fletcher.

4. russell is finishing well.
in three games. why do n't we look at this one again in , say , july \?

5. fletcher is hitting well as a leadoff hitter.
a bit better than could reasonably have been expected. but do n't forget that
zupcic looked like wade boggs lite for about 75 ab 's last year. beware of
small sample sizes. still , if fletcher hits as well as he did last year he 'd
be a great improvement over any sox leadoff hitter from last year. be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he does n't have to make more than 300 ab or so in a year.

6. cooper is hitting well (i think he 'll be better then boggs in the field
and just as good at the plate)
ummm...sorry , no. i can buy the in the field part , and i think he 'll be
better at the plate than the 1992 boggs , but in general cooper , while he 'll
be a pretty good hitter , could n't carry boggs' jockstrap. with a little
luck , he could be the fourth or fifth best 3b in the al (martinez , boggs ,
ventura , and palmer will all be better).

if the sox pitch like last year (they have a better pitchiong staff , now)
and hit like they are so far , they coiuld run away with thee division. but
since i think that their hitting and pitching may not be up to the challenge
of running away with the division , i think that they win be over .500 and at
least third if not second or first.

see , here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500
is plausible , third is not unlikely , but phrases like could run away with
the division are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats. it 's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. if
russell does well , darwin does n't go on the dl , and hesketh does n't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation , they could
be better. on the other hand , if hesketh pitches miserably and they 're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up conroy or somebody , fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he 's a
lefty , and russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

i 've been following the giants closely over the off season newspapers ,
notesgroup , etc but i had my first up close and personal last night at
the stick.

after watching giants hitters struggle last year , barry 's swing was
very impressive he 's very quick and his swing seems effortless , even
compared to clark (particularly clark as of late).

it was interesting to see bonds hit maddux so well. i'm not sure if
barry was after revenge against the braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b , 2b , hr) for 5 rbi 's.

the giants always hit maddux well , but it was interesting that maddux
did not pitch around bonds to get to clayton last night. he threw 2 straight
fastballs over the plate to bonds in the 1st last night , got away with the
first one , but bonds hit the second one out of the park. then in the 3rd ,
when clark was at third base with one out , maddux did not intentionally
walk bonds , and bonds dropped a single to left center.


the giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to bonds. there has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better. clayton 's defense has been superb.
mcgee seems to like leading off this year. manwaring is driving the ball.
so on so forth.

the braves announcers pointed out that mcgee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet. he will always hit around .300 , but i'm concerning
about his on base percentage. the key in the lineup is matt williams , he
has to stay hot so that bonds can hit with runners on base.


i hope it continues...i think they need to continue well into june before
people are really sold that they are for real particularly the pitching.

the pitching gets a set back as bud black is placed on the dl. burba
has done a superb job filling in so far , he looks like a different pitcher
from last year. however , swift is terrible in both of his starts. with
burba moving into the rotation , mike jackson is the only right handed
reliever aside from rod beck , he 'll get a lot of actions. i also hope that
dusty can manage his bullpen better than roger craig , especially on beck.
i was concerned when beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.


for myself , i think the fresh start of magowan baker etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.

so far so good !

was going over some videos last night.....


and you wrote an excellent report about it.


1. he 's bulked up too much. period. he needs to lose about 20 pounds ,
not gain more bulk.

2. his bat speed has absolutely vanished. conservatively , i 'd say he 's
lost 4 7 of his bat speed , and that 's a huge amount of speed.

3. that open stance is killing him. note that he acts sort of like
brian downing way open to start , then closes up as ball is
released. downing could do this without significant head movement
canseco ca n't. also , note that canseco does n't always close his
stance the same way sometimes , his hips are open , sometimes ,
they 're fully closed. without a good starting point , it 's hard
to make adjustments in your swing.


i understand (from an unreliable source) that canseco was considered
expendable by the a 's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance. the a 's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated , if not caused , by having a wide open
stance , closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
(that 's a paraphrase of what i remember).

in any event , canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance , and the a 's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.



aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that i could never touch ,
so that i 'd never have to work again , i 'd restructure my entire swing.

apparently , you sound like larussa.

second , drop 20 pounds. cut out the weight work.

the a 's also objected about this.


if canseco 's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems , he 'll be out of baseball in three years. if not , he could
still hit 600 hr.

again , i'm just repeating something i heard. but possibly the cause
and effect is the reverse of that.

the braves' pitching staff is already showing signs of
cracking under the strain of knowing they 're not going to get many

long that the organization put so much stress (and i mean stress )

it sounds pretty lame to be racking our brains over this , but
humor us. thanks for your help.

thanks.

summary baltimore o 's not looking stellar

the o 's just lost to the rangers a few minutes ago i was not too happy about
the pitching of rick sutcliffe (6 runs in 6 innings , 5 in the 3 \? ) this puts
me in remembering the 1990 o 's season. after '89 we did n't do much over
winter and we wound up in 5th. now i know that mussina , mcdonald , and rhodes
are better pitching prospects than ballard and milacki but are any other
oriole fans scared out there \?

admiral steve c. liu

p.s. other scores as of now.
cincy over montreal , 2 1 i think
florida is leading la 6 3 in the 8th !
braves vs. cubs , 1 0 in the 8th. futility of cubs batting haunting them.
yanks beat the tribe i believe.

something else to consider

alomar 's h r splits were .500 .363 slg , .444 .369 obp ! baerga 's was .486 .424
and .392 .318. pretty clearly , alomar got a huge boost from his home park.

not necessarily. it could mean that , or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see frank thomas' home road
splits in '91 for an example). i would guess that some of alomar 's split
is due to the skydome , but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
there 's no way to be sure , of course , but the only hitters the skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters , and
alomar is not a home run hitter.

i 'd say you could make a good for them being about equal right now. t p
rated baerga higher , actually.

only because of t p 's bogus fielding stats , which rate alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league. on a career basis , i think t p 's
fielding stats may mean something , but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this. alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is , but he sure is n't the worst in baseball.

offensively , t p rate alomar much higher last year.

regarding the a vs. b argument , i 'll just say they 're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

the term stopper is generally used to refer to a pitcher , one
who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going
on a losing streak.

the braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description ,
although right now i 'd expect smoltz or glavine to take the mantle.

what the braves lack , however , is an offensive stopper ,
somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.
there 's just no one there. the braves got rid of their best pure
hitter , lonnie smith , and only terry pendleton on the current roster
has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.

oh , and another thing that worries me. ron gant seems to have
slowed down a step. that 's scary. a slow ron gant does n't have much going
for him.

hi , baseball fans ! so what do you say \? do n't you think he deserves it \?
i

mean , heck , if dave winfield (ho hum) is seriously being considered for it ,
as

is lee smith (ha) , then why do n't we give dave kingman a chance \? or darrell

evans ! yeah , yeah ! after the hall of fame takes in them , it can take in
eddie

murray and jeff reardon.

well , in any case , i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
giving

hall of fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards ,
marginal.

honestly , ozzie smith and robin yount do n't belong there. they 're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal.

let 's be a little more selective , huh \? stop handing out these honors
so

liberally. save them for the guys who really deserve it. face it , if
something

is n't done , there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when

certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential

candidates , the absurdity is apparent. gee , can these guys even compare to

the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan \?



q steve

what 's the difference between nolan ryan and yount \? both have hung
around for years , and continue to post great stats. why should n't dave kingman
get into the hall \? or murray , evens , reardon , and others \? what the hell do
you have to do \? ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that winfield should
be in the hall... god. pretty soon you 'll be saying that cal ripken does n't
deserve to be in the hall. then , i 'll flame you. )

here is the opi (offensive production index) for all al players with at
least 10 at bats.

it is early in the season so there are some very high numbers. last years
leader was frank thomas at 0.682.

teams are denoted by an as the first character of the name and each
player has his team preceeding his name.

the equations used are found at the end of the post.

i believe we are down to two the 15 day and the 60 day. (i do n't remember
a 30 day , but rather a 21 day. anyways , it 's gone now.) the period length
is a minimum , not a maximum. you can keep a guy on the 15 day for as long
as you want , if he 's still certified as injured. the player must be
periodically re evaluated to determine if he 's still injured (thus you
cannot park a player on the dl who maybe is out of options and you do not
wish to expose to waivers). if you get someone qualified for the 60 day
that reduces the frequency of re evaluations. there is no longer , i
believe , any limit to the number of players you can place on the dl. when
there was , you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between
the lists.

well , officially it 's the braves. at least up until they started winning
it was. are they still , officially \?
if so , why \? and how did they receive this label \?

unoffically , but without a doubt , america 's team is the cubs. why \?
well , my guess is because america loves underdogs. every year , no matter
the cubs' talent or the predictions , they never (as close to never as
possible) win anything. over the years , as the losing has mounted , america
has fallen in love with these perennial losers. the cubs have more fans
in chicago then some teams do worldwide. the cubs have more fans
worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined.
an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season
like no one else. (including the ws champs) it must be that eternal hope.
this is the year. they 've got the talent. they 're off to a good start.
they 've got the pitching (or hitting , or whatever their strong point is
at the time). it 's that inevitability that the cubs will eventually
win the ws again. when \? only god knows. since it 's been so long , it
could come at any time , or it could be another 85 years. but until they
do finally win , and start winning consistently , the cubs will remain
america 's lovable underdogs. the cubs are...america's team.
orin.
bradley u

the defenition of the underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
out of nowhere to contend. the '69 mets and '89 orioles are prime examples ,
not the cubs. i root for the cubs , because i feel sorry for them , but
basically they are dogs. the pirates today are a great example of an underdog.
if the rockies and marlins compete , they will be underdogs. the north stars
trip to the stanley cup finals was a good example of an underdog 's journey.
the cubs have a good team this year , and play in a weak division , they are much
less than america 's team.

i also believe they kept wickman and millitello in their rotation , which is
much nicer than that kaminiecki and mike witt combo i thought they 'd throw
out their to the slaughterhouse because of their experience . granted , witt
might be good , but i think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
up and not given the job to witt because he was a good pitcher and has
experience.
the yanks are showing that they are taking positive strides forwards the
jays with the loss of dave stewart are looking at gigantic holes in their

i hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of wfan and wip(i go to school in philadelphia , and i listen to
both stations on a consistant basis.) now that the fan has mike
lupica on from 10 to noon , they have a person who can get the
big name guests for interviews , and not just of local importance
he did have dave cheketts and fred wilpon on his show , but he
had bob costas and magic johnson on too.
now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent
morning show
in my opinion , i think imus is much better than bruno , cataldi ,
and morganti , even though i would feel different if morganti
had a better crew of people to work with. to me , wip tries
to copy imus but make it all sports as a theme. in terms of
sports , imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves , but he
interjects humor and politics into his show.
10 am to 12 noon
i think chuck cooperstein and lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show , but i think chuck has the
advantage over lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round. lupica and the other hosts on fan get
better interview guests , but i heard the pd of wip say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story.
i would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host.

12 noon to 2 pm
at this point , i would have to give a big advantage to
jody mcdonald over len berman because lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks. i just think jm has the ability
to transcend the homer mentality of the philadelphia fan
base. this is most evident when the iggles(philadelphia
spelling) play the cowboys because jm is a huge dallas fan.
where else can you have people call up and predict a 93 0
score without the egging of the hosts(re wip morning 'guys')
i do agree that jm was great on the fan weekend overnight
and i miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts. i feel that jm is the best sportstalk host on
either station by a good margin. if you are in ny and
you ca n't get wip , jm does fill in on the weekends sometimes.

2pm to 4pm
this is the time when jm goes up against francesa and
russo(fatso and froot loops) and i become the most divided
in my loyalties. mike and the dog are very entertaining ,
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10
to 20 minutes without talking about sports. matd do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show , so
it is like the 10 to 12 debate. another plus is the
appearances by mike and chris on imus in the morning , which
are often hilarious.

4 pm to 7 pm
matd go up against fredericks and missanelli. i like
mike missanelli but i just ca n't stomach steve fredericks.
i know that sf came from philly originally , but when he
was at the fan , he was a ny homer as much as he is a philly
homer now. i do n't listen to wip much after 4 pm unless there
is a game on that night , but you will see later for the
reason. that is why i give the advantage to fan.

7 pm to midnight
s m are on wip until 8 and then it is the man who makes
eli that calls matd all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism , g cobb. this man is so grating on my
nerves that if i listen to him for a few minutes i go
nuts.(i know that is biased , but listen to his show)
on fan , there is usually a game on , knicks , rangers , mets
jets , or st. john 's basketball. if the game is on the
west coast , then it is usually howie rose. of course
i think dead air would be better than g cobb on wip , but
wip does air sixers and flyers games during the season.
(if this is the sports station , why did they lose the
iggles to wysp(home of howard stern in phil.))
during the summer , it
is all talk on wip.


overall , i would have to give the advantage to wfan , with
the exception of 10 to 12 , and 2 to 4 where it is even , and
12 to 2 where wip has the advantage.

one last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and has n't

situation

if infield fly is declared and the ball is caught , runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk , as on any fly ball.

however , if the infield fly is not caught , at what point can a
runner legally leave his base w o fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early \? when the
ball hits the ground \? when a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground \?

one also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning , with the

i 'd give baserunning a little more credit than that , maybe 45 5 , or
even 40 10. give a team of roberto alomar and a team of john oleruds
identical batting stats (which would n't be that unreasonable) , and
even if you do n't let roberto steal a single base , they 'll score a lot
more than the oleruds by going first to third more often. (no offense ,
gordon).

i would n't give baserunning that much value.

i meant to comment on this at the time.

there 's just no way baserunning could be that important if it was ,
runs created would n't be nearly as accurate as it is.

runs created is usually about 90 95 accurate on a team level , and
there 's a lot more than baserunning that has to account for the
remaining percent.

how many runs will be scored in denver \?
i do n't know.

but some idea can be gotten by looking at the runs scored in
mile high stadium during the last few years of the bears zephyrs
tenure in the american association.

here 's the total runs scored per game in zephyrs games ,
all league games and the ratio. i found the same ratios for hr.

year rpg lea ratio hrpg lea ratio
1992 10.22 9.10 1.12 1.65 1.58 1.04
1991 9.53 8.87 1.07 1.41 1.26 1.12
1990 10.71 8.72 1.23 1.49 1.24 1.20
1989 9.07 8.34 1.09 1.27 1.11 1.14
1988 9.90 8.37 1.18 1.29 1.08 1.19
1987 12.55 10.70 1.17 2.39 1.92 1.24
1986 9.45 9.33 1.01 1.35 1.38 .98
1985 9.50 8.54 1.11 1.53 1.34 1.14

1446 13 1.11 1444 13 1.11

it seems pretty clear that denver will have a large effect
on runs scored (i 'll stick with my prediction from last year
that it 'll be one of the top 3 in the nl this year)
and a fairly large effect on homeruns though apparently not as large as
atlanta , wrigley , cincinnati and san diego.
still it ought to be a pretty decent home run park.

dave was one of the better of all time , but obviously not the best. he was
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. he hit line drives that hit
the scoreboard in left center field , a feat np one has done in the new
stadium. heck , only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence
since it has been remodeled. he could field , had a bullet arm , and his
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields , and barry bonds
of last season. he is older now , and slowing down , takes more of an
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park , but he will always be my hero ,
and my idol. there is nothing that could make me happier than george
inviting dave back to the bronx to play his last year of ball with the
yankees. of course , he will most likely refuse the offer , but who knows \?
for 3 million dollars , he 'll play. heck they are giving gallego 2.5
million this year , having dave as their dh , while leaving him time to play

hi , baseball fans ! so what do you say \? do n't you think he deserves it \?
i

mean , heck , if dave winfield (ho hum) is seriously being considered for it ,
as

is lee smith (ha) , then why do n't we give dave kingman a chance \? or darrell

evans ! yeah , yeah ! after the hall of fame takes in them , it can take in
eddie

murray and jeff reardon.

um , what \? eddie murray was a superb first baseman for a long time.

winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years , and excellently
on several occasions.

dave kingman 's best year was like darryl strawberry 's typical
year with the mets.

darrell evans , too , did a whole lot more than just hit homers , which
is all that kong did.

well , in any case , i am sick and tired (mostly sick) of everybody
giving

hall of fame consideration to players that are by today 's standards ,
marginal.

whom are you talking about \? yes , eddie murray is marginal , but that 's
because he 's 38 years old. he was n't marginal for a long time.

honestly , ozzie smith and robin yount do n't belong there. they 're both

shortstops that just hung around for a long time. big deal.

not.

smith has hung around for a long time and fielded the position better
than anyone else ever has.

yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago , in case you had n't
noticed.

one of his two mvp awards was as a centerfielder.

let 's be a little more selective , huh \? stop handing out these honors
so

liberally. save them for the guys who really deserve it. face it , if

like whom \? there are many players in the hall who are n't anywhere near
as goos as the guys you 're running down.

something
is n't done , there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore. when

that 's already the case , by some standards. but the bad players in the
hall are all from the 20 's and 30 's. recent picks have generally been
excellent.

certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential
candidates , the absurdity is apparent. gee , can these guys even compare to
the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan \?

no , but who cares \? was stan musial anywhere near as good as babe ruth \?
not really. but he obviously belongs there.

the hall has generally had about the top 1 of major leaguers. as
more players come through the game , more will be in that top 1 .

and , yes , it 's pretty easy to argue that smith , . yount , evans , winfield ,
etc. are in the top 1 . dave kingman on the other hand , was a liability
throughout most of his career.

of course , garvey has n't gotten a lot of hof press , so i do n't know
what you mean.

as for ryan , is his w l better than morris' \? that 's what a lot of voters
tend to look at. and morris was awfully good for a decade , and does n't
lead mlb history in walks allowed , either.

tigers' manager sparky anderson gets his 2 , 000th career win as moments ago ,
the tigers completed a two game sweep over the oakland a 's at tiger stadium
by beating the a 's 3 2. here are the highlights


r h e
oakland 2 9 0
detroit 3 7 1

chad krueter scored skeeter barnes from 1st with an rbi double in the
bottom of the ninth against none other than dennis eckersley to give the
tigers the victory. barnes also had an rbi single to score thurmond to
tie the score in the ninth , also off eckersley (sp \? ).

the a 's got their runs on an rbi single by mcgwire in the 1st and a solo
homer by reuben sierra in the 6th. deer doubled home kirk gibson in the
7th for the other tiger run.

john doherty pitched another strong game for the tigers , once again lasting
through the seventh inning. he was relieved by bolton and then david haas
in the 8th , and haas got the win. bobby witt started for the a 's , and was
replaced by honeycutt in the 6th , followed by goose gossage in the 8th , and
finally eckersly in the 9th. doherty gave up both of the a 's runs , while
witt gave up the first tiger run and eckerseley gave up the last two.

in the post game interview (on wjr radio in detroit) , sparky anderson said
its one of the few times he 's gotten emotional in his managing career. it
was a big moment for him , and i'm sure all of us tiger fans are unanimously
very happy for him. and what a way to get number 2 , 000 ! .

considering the circumstances , i think it might be appropriate to say

woof ! go tigers !

please tell me he 's not...

he evidentally got hit in the elbow by a fernando pitch. his arm swelled
from the elbow to the wrist (or something like that). they took x rays
of the arm and there is nothing damaged. he missed the last game with the
orioles , but he is suppose to be ready for the next game.

hope this helps.

mr. hernandez

i apologize for the misunderstanding. i explained that i know that it
is essential for some fans to get scores here , for they cannot get them
elsewhere. i have no problem with what you do , posting scores after the
games have been completed. however , like i said earlier , i do n't think it
is a necessity to post scores during the middle of games , like some others
have come to practice.

the media is beating the incident at dodger stadium on wednesday to
death , but i have n't seen anything in rsb yet.

gerald perry of the cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run. he stroked a line drive into the
right field corner. the ball cleared the three foot high fence and
went into the crowd. darryl , racing over from right center , got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence , but he
missed the ball. a fan sitting in the front row , wearing a mitt ,
reached up and caught the ball. home run.

now i 've seen the replay several times and i have concluded that
darryl missed the ball , and that the fan 's glove was essentially
behind darryl 's. several dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
strawberry. what cannot be disputed , however , is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing. he was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

that exuberance disappeared immediately , however , when strawberry
went into a tirade at the man. all reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference , and therefore of
costing the dodgers a game. shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch. dodger stadium
officials started to remove him from the park , but then relented and
just relocated him to another area. in an interview after the game ,
lasorda blamed the fan for the loss. strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they do n't care about
winning. l.a. times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

before each dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any
that are in the field of play. was the fan wrong \? should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference \? or was he human and just reacting \? by the way , he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the stadium where future interference is
impossible.

others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

i question what he was doing in right center with a left handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line. had he been closer to the play ,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.
