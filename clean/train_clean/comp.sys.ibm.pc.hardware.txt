hi. i am trying to set up a conner 3184 and a quantum 80at drive. i have
the conner set to the master , and the quantum set to the slave (does n't work
the other way around). i am able to access both drives if i boot from a
floppy , but the drives will not boot themselves. i am running msdos 6 , and
have the conner partitioned as primary dos , and is formatted with system
files. i have tried all different types of setups , and even changed ide
controller cards. if i boot from a floppy , everything works great (except
the booting part )). the system does n't report an error message or anything ,
just hangs there. does anyone have any suggestions , or has somebody else
run into a similar problem \? i was thinking that i might have to update the bios
on one of the drives (is this possible \? ). any suggestions answers would be
greatly appreciated. please reply to

lyourk@cbnewsc.cb.att.com (loran n. yourk) writes

with a sound card on interrupt 5 , two serial ports (one for modem on i4 ,
one for miracle piano on i3) and a printer port on i7 , i have run out of
low interrupts. what i would like is a mouse port with an interrupt of
10 , 11 , or 12 (which ever interrupt the ps 2 mouse port uses) in in isa
i486 computer. i called technical support of microsoft , logitech , ati
(checked what interrupts the mouse port on the ati video cards can use)
and they all said the only interrupts possible on these cards was ones
lower than 7. does anyone know of any board for an isa bus which will
allow a mouse port (or even a serial port) with high interrupts \?

try putting one of the irqs for your com ports onto irq2. the hardware will
automagically wrap irq2 to irq9 on at class machines (eg , anything with high
irqs). this is what i'm doing on my set up right now.
i 've got com2 on irq2 (really irq9 address it this way in software) , com1
on irq3 , soundblaster on irq5 , lpt1 on irq7 , and my ati busmouse port on one of
the interrupts in between. works just great.
if you need even more , there 's a text file floating around somewhere that
details how to hack up any serial card (and probably any others) to work on the
higher irqs. it basically involves cutting the trace to the low irq and running a wire over the a high irq pin on the 16bit expansion bus.

it will be best to put the modem 's com port onto irq2 9. this will be the

first irq serviced by the system , giving the modem a better response
especially handy under multitaskers like os 2 which i'm running with no
problems.

well , some quick math on my part shows that an 8.3mhz bus , 16 bits
wide , performing a transfer every two clock cycles will provide 8.3m

perform a transfer , so that reduces the transfer rate to 5.5mb s ,

i almost got a hernia laughing at this one.

you 'll probably get one when you realize that your 100 vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...

if anything , scsi (on a pc) will be obsolete killed off by vesa local
with any luck pc bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.

have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus. it actually slows down your system
bus ide. it must be real nice to get shafted by 20 100 bucks for the
extra cost of a scsi drive , then pay another 200 300 for a scsi controller.

yeah , there is absolutely no use for vlb except for video graphics.
and no ide could possibly take advantage the vlb , because it runs at
8 mhz and 16 bits. do people forget that the ide was specifically
designed to interface directly with the at isa bus \? we 've seen
ides come out for eisa , xt isa , and now even mca , but at all times
it was a 16 bit standard , running at somewhere near 8 10 mhz. when
you run an ide off of the vlb , there 's no way that you 're running it
at 33 mhz , it would burn up. of course same goes for scsi , esdi , whatever ,
none of them run at cpu speed.

the only way to gain advantage with a vlb ide is to hook it up to
a caching controller. i suspect it would be much , much better to
get a software disk cache instead , since you get write caching as well.

because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.

i 've seen some fuji ide drives going as high as 1g.

too right it does !

fixing it \? are there alignment screws that you can adjust \?

the very very first thing you do is make sure that all files on
the floppies that you can currently read in the drive , which are n't
already on your hd or another floppy (if you have two floppy drives)
get copied to your hd (and or to a floppy in your other drive).

if you do n't do this before fixing the alignment problem you have kissd
those files goodbye. (well , you can try to re misalign the drive back
to read your floppies , but do n't count on be able to do so ! )

generally , head alignment is something i 'd only trust to a good repair
shop (though there are have been diy guides).

windows drivers have a number of bugs. shadows remain when windows are
erased and text boxes are often unreadable. all attempts to get help from
diamond have failed. i have called the tech support and never been able
to get past the hold line (a toll call) in a reasonable time (ie 10min).
leaving voice mail has not helped either. the bbs is a joke ! it always
has too many people on to download anything. you cannot even get a file
listing (it considers that a download ! ). i have faxed the tech support group.
all this with no reponse.

the bottom line is if you are looking for a fast card and want to use it
for windows , do not get a diamond product. try another vendor , i wish i had.

while others here may have had better experiences , i , too , share the
sentiments posted above. though i have the original stealth vram ,
it is only relatively recent that the windows drivers for this card
have evolved to a point of decent performance. note that there are
still a couple of modes i cannot use (ie. will not) due to shadowing ,
mis drawn check boxes , etc. i believe the version i have is 2.01.
if there 's a more recent release , i 'd appreciate if someone would
drop me a note to let me know i have n't been able to get on their
bbs lately to check again. naturally , diamond does n't even bother
notifying me of fixes releases.

diamond was helpful when i finally reached the right person in curing
some of my windows' problems due to an address conflict. the conflicting
addresses (2e0 , 2e8) were omitted in at least my version of the
diamond vram manual. i hope it has been corrected by now. the tech rep
explained that all s3 based boards use these addresses. i have not
confirmed the validity of that statement.

when i upgrade my motherboard in the near future (hopefully with some
form of local bus) , i 'll seek a video solution from someone other than
diamond.

michael hamilton

some motherboards support vl bus and 50 dx cpu. there is an option
(bios i think) where additional wait(s) can be added with regard to
cpu vl bus transactions. this slows the cpu down to a rate that gives
the vl bus device(s) time to 'do their thing'. these particular wait(s)
are applied when the cpu transacts with vl bus device(s). you want to
enable these wait(s) only if you are using a 50 dx with vl bus devices.

this is from reading my motherboard manual , and these are my interpre
tations. your mileage may vary.

strictly speaking , vl and 50mhz are not compatable. and , there is at
least one 'fudge' mechanism to physically allow it to work.

andrew , yes there is a dx and dx2 version of the 50mhz 486. if you are
considering buying one or the other , definitely go for the dx with a nice
size external cache ! the performance is far greater.

the dx2 only has the internal 8k cache to work with at 50mhz , while the dx
has a potentially much larger cache to work at 50mhz with. neither
systems could actually run a program out of main memory , since dram is
still too slow for that high of bus speed ( 60ns 16.66mhz 50mhz ).

if your gateway is equipped with a western hard drive , then the noise
is probably coming from there and not from the fan. the western drives
are notoriously noisy. on the other hand , if you do n't have a western

i have a question concerning scsi on dos.

i have a st01 scsi controller and two hard disks conected
(id 's 0 and 1). i 'd like to connect a scsi streamer , but i
do n't have software to access it. does such a beast exist
as shareware or pd \?
also what if i want a third disk \? i know that dos only can
see two two physical and four logical disks. will it be
possible to use extra disks \?

contrary to what others might have thought , i actually did have a scsi drive
once. it was the seagate 296n and the st 02 controller. i found that the
controller could n't keep up with a 1 1 interleave , so the best i could do
with the drive was a 2 1 interleave and a data transfer of about 450 k sec.

i have had that drive controller coexist with mfm , rll , and ide drives
because the st 02 bios will kinda muscle itself in there with no help
needed from the computer 's bios. dos will see many logical drives , much more
than 4 (i 've had up to 10). i 've often wondered how many scsi drives you
could hang off a st 01 02.

i bet it suddenly started sticking when you started leaving the pc running the
menu all night. there is a limitation bug in the date roll over software in
pc 's that means you have to be doing something like waiting for keyboard input
via a dos call rather than a bios call (as menus often use) otherwise the code
to update the date after midnight never gets called.

somebody might be able to correct the details in case i 've mis rememberred
them , but i think you have to change the menu program (if you have the sources)
or add a tsr or system patch or something. as far as i know the cmos clock
keeps the right time (in fact about 7 seconds day better than dos 's clock).

wow , you guys are really going wild on this ide vs. scsi thing , and i think
it 's great !

however , i think that some people (such as myself) would benefit from answers
to the simple( \? ) question which would you choose , and why \?

like lots of people , i 'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a) , and
what i would say is a standard (not special , no cache i believe) ide controller
card on my isa 486 50.

i'm currently thinking about adding another hd , in the 300mb to 500mb range.
and i'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a grinding in my head)
about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit). i believe i'm getting
something like 890kb sec transfer right now (according to nu).

how would this
number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for my isa pc , and
the state of the art scsi hard drive (the wailing est system i could hope for) \?

obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would
you want to use on your isa system \? and how much would it cost \?

along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd 's if i
were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my 200mb , 15ms hd \?
and how much would it cost \?

i actually have a pas 16 , and could (what a waste i guess it would be...) hook
up a scsi hd through it 's scsi port which yields an optimum of 690kb sec.
actually , i have a borrowed 12ms fujitsu hd hooked up through it now (and
own the trantor hd drivers for the pas 16 scsi port). is this scsi port a
scsi 2 port \? how could i tell \? is the fujitsu 2623a a scsi 2 \? are all scsi
hd 's scsi 2 \?

thanks for any comments.

a program in the archive keymap00.zip on simtel and mirror sites in the

best if you have a compiler to create a new keyboard map. it is possible ,
however , to use a binary editor to edit the provided compiled keyboard
driver if you do not have a compiler. i used hexed100.zip , also available
on simtel. simply serach for the codes 00 01 02 03 to locate the biginning
of the normal keyboard map. then swap the codes for the keys that you
wish to swap. see the keyboard directory of simtel for programs that report
the scancode for each key to you (some bios programs also have this info).

it depends on what you 'd like your joystick for. i 've seen gravis
joysticks at radio shack. they seemed flimsy and did n't fit well in my
hand. i have heard on c.s.i.p.games that they do n't last well (less than
a year) on flightsims. one redeeming feature does seem to be the ability
to adjust the tension of the stick.

i recently purchased a ch flightstick. there are n't any suction cups and
no tension adjusters but otherwise it seems to be an excellent joystick.
i'm currently using it for the wing commander series and red baron. works
quite well. the large base does not require a steadying hand and so
leaves it free. the buttons provide good tactile response (you can hear
and feel them well). there are other models made by ch that can go up or
down in features.

for price comparison gravis analogue joysticks sell for 35.00 here
compared to the 45.00 i paid for a ch flightstick. i think the extra
10.00 is worth it just in feel. best thing to do is to ask a salesperson
to let you try them out or at least feel it before you buy.

just another note , analogue joysticks are best for flightsims or something
that needs sensitive touch. if you 're only playing games such as castle
wolfenstein or some other game that only uses digital input (ie. only up ,
down , left , etc. instead of 'how much right') you might want to look into
a gravis gamepad. they look like a nintendo control pad but i do n't know
much beyond that.

someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
orchid v9000 card has that card arrived \? what do the benchmarks look
like \?

the one i got only does about 4kb s in text and 320x200 (vga mcga) mode ,
which is almost identical to the other w5186 based cards (ati 68800
does about 6kb s). this is weird since the orchid supposedly should
be much faster (and i was told by someone that it can do almost 16 kb s) ,
since the vga chip is covered by the orchid label , i ca n't really tell
for sure if it uses a 5286 chip , but the spec. sheet that comes with
the board (no docs ! ) did say it has 1 meg dram and uses a 5286 chip.
winmarks (3.11) is about 4 mil. slower than a viper (34 vs 38) using
standard palette.

btw if anyone is insterested , i'm trying to sell a diamond viper (2 megs
vram) for a friend for 300 , email if interested (i'm too broke to
take it myself).

also , is the ami p9000 based card real \? what does it use for vga \? speed \?

i think it 's available in limited quantites. no idea of what vga
chip it uses though.

be very careful with oem p9000 boards though , the orchid i got
for example only has a readme file on disk that serve as
documentation , and conflicts the hell with my vlb controller
card (or maybe it 's my motherboard , an a.i.r. 486 vlb)

hello

i have recently suffered from various problems concerning
an adaptec 1542a controller.

problem 1
floppy disk drive does n't work. there 's apparently at least two jumpers
on the controller that affect the floppy disk drive. unfortunately i
have located only one of them (in the lower front corner). i would like
to know , if there are any other such jumpers and possibly where they
are located.

problem 2
my hard disks refuse to boot. with my two scsi hd 's (rodime , miniscribe)
i get a message 'missing operating system' , even though the disks have been
formatted with the same controller and they damn sure have an operating
system on them. if i boot from a quantum i might get as far as getting
the ms dos version information. this might of course be due to incombatible
memory drivers.
are there any jumpers that could affect the hd causing such errors \?

thanks in advance

and they too said that the nanao t560i was the best monitor to get if

this monitor can be had for around 1070.

has anyone actually seen any of these \?

i am responsible for choosing standard components in my company and as part
of my review i got the viewsonic 7 , mitsubishi 17 , and nanao f550is. i picked
the f550i even though it costs more than the other two choices because it
has a the best clarity and text is not fuzzy at all. the viewsonic 7 is the
worst , the mitsubishi 17 is much better but the nanao f550i blows both of
them out of the water. i do n't understand why the nanao is so much better
since one would think that the mitsubishi 17 with it 's trinitron tube would
be better. i can only imagine that the nanao t560i must be incredible if it
is beter than the f550i.


michael g. reamy (mreamy@rock.concert.net)

the light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon.

one of the monitors i reviewed for the june issue of windows magazine was
the mitsubishi. i also reviewed a new nanao , the f550iw , which has just
been released. last year for the may '92 issue of windows , i reviewed
several monitors , including the nanao t560i. there 's no question that the
nanao monitors are the best available this year , just as they were last
year. the difference between my ranking of the best in windows and the
ranking in windows sources is due mainly to a difference in the testing
criteria and the scoring. i used different tests than they did , and i
scored differently. there 's nothing wrong with the mitsubishi , and it
scored very highly in my tests , but it was a few points shy of perfect.

incidentally , one of the things everyone should do when they 're reading
reviews of any product , whether it 's monitors or mice , is to read the
criteria and methodology carefully. unless you know how the product
testing was done , and on what the scores are based , you ca n't possibly
know what they really mean. just seeing that i rank a monitor differently
from windows sources is meaningless without knowing how we did the
ranking. likewise , it 's impossible to tell whether a monitor will meet
your needs unless you know how we did the testing. after all , some of
what we do may not apply to you. likewise , some of what we do may apply
more closely in one review than in another. you ca n't always tell
anything from reading the 300 or so words of commentary we write if you
do n't also understand the scoring.

i 'd appreciate any advice about a video card for my system

486 33 dx , 16 mb of ram
on a novell 3.11 network
monitor nec 4fge , capable of 76 hz vertical refresh rate

major considerations

i expect i will work mostly in windows , but with some dos
applications and i would want decent speed in dos. i do mostly word
processing , database and communications not much intensive graphics.

with a 15 monitor , i expect i will work mostly in 800x600 and 256
colors seems plenty , but i 'd like like the image to be sharp , fast ,
and rock solid.

other considerations

i sometimes run a unix clone (coherent) and i understand that some
companies (e.g. diamond \? ) do n't encourage the third party
development of drivers.

i might move to os 2 if i decide i need better speed and reliability
than i get with windows for my database work and multitasking.

i do n't have a local bus motherboard i'm not sure how much to invest
in an isa video board (versus getting something less expensive now and
upgrading to local bus later).

i like buying things from companies that treat their customers well.

if you have any advice for me , i 'd love to hear it via email or post.

i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good , well implimented
data highway , but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.

i have been following this thread and figured i 'd throw in my two cents...

the amiga zorro ii bus is comparable with the isa bus (7.16 vs 8.33 mhz).
the amiga has had a pre emptative multi tasking os since '85 and can
operate with 1 mb ram ! scsi is used almost exclusively on these systems.

a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory. a controller that allows reselection can operate
even better with multiple devices. this is espically true with scsi tape
units. for example , when rewinding or formatting a tape , the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus. this greatly increases productivity or , at least , do
something else while backing up your hard drive ). which happens to be
what i am doing while reading this group.

its a long story , but i still use ide on my 486 except for the cdrom which ,
thanks to scsi , i can move between both machines. if , and when , scsi is
better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines , i plan to
completely get rid of ide.

him to override the standard irq assignments.

unfortunately there a lot of such software. i also find it to be
the case that the majority of the software that is bad in this regard
is commercial software. way too many commercial packages are very
poorly written. but then most of the programs in ms dos are crap , such
as the print command tsr that locks up your system for long periods of

what is the deal with the ide transfer rates \? is anybody getting throughput
anywhere close to the platter controller rate \? i have n't seen anything
even close to the 5mb sec limit of the ide interface. these drives are 1 1
(non interleaved) , are n't they \?

here are the rates i get

1) sequential read (msdos c program that uses bios calls to read 64 sector
blocks sequentially from outside (first) track inward)

8mhz bus 10mhz bus

maxtor lxt340 860kb sec 976kb sec
quantum lps240 862kb sec 887kb sec

2) disk buffer read (same c program , but re reads the same block repeatedly
so in effect is reading the ram buffer on the drive)

8mhz bus 10mhz bus

maxtor lxt340 1046kb sec 1212kb sec
quantum lps240 1015kb sec 1276kb sec

3) coretest v2.7 transfer rate (seems to agree with (2) above)

8mhz bus 10mhz bus

maxtor lxt340 1051kb sec 1224kb sec
quantum lps240 1026kb sec 1298kb sec

i managed to get hold of the quantum lps240at product manual and it goes
into excrutiating detail describing how the bits get from the platter ,
through the controller , and out the ide interface. nowhere do i see
anything like after the bits are whipped of the platter at high speed
they sit around in a buffer to thaw before they are sent to the host
(even though i swear that 's whats happening ). here are some relevent
quotes from the manual

data is transferred from the disk to the read buffer at a rate of
3.75 mb s maximum , 1.87mb s minimum. (my calculations show 3121kb sec
maximum and 1578kb sec minimum... disk spins at 4306 rpm with 87
sectors per track on the outside and 44 on the inside)

single burst errors of up to 24 bits within one sector can be corrected
'on the fly' , in real time as they occur , allowing a high degree of
data integrity with no impact to the drive 's performance. (i take
this to mean error correction is n't the bottleneck)

for page mode operations , the data transfer rate to and from the buffer
ram is up to 10.0 mb s. this high transfer rate allows the at interface
ic to communicate over the at bus at a data transfer rate of 5.0 mb s ,
while the dcs simultaneously controls disk to ram transfers

so the thing can even do it 's cache pre fetch while it 's sending the
requested sector (it has 3 64kb read buffers for pre fetching , i guess
you could call that a cache ).

so when i do a sequential read on the outer tracks , why am i getting a
measly 862kb sec when i should be getting around 3mb sec \? \? \?

any of you hard disk engineers out there know \?

i'm buying a new system this week to replace my brain dead 286 , and
could use some feedback on a couple systems i'm looking at if anyone is
familiar with them.

the system that looks the most interesting is the budget 486 66 vlb
tower. for about 2343 (delivered) it offers vlb , 8mb , 200mb ide , a mitsumi
cd rom (with software bundle) , media vision sound board , 14 ctx 1468ni ,
128k cache , and the usual drives , ports , os software. since my budget is
2350 for a system , it seems almost too good to be true (which may mean it
is too good to be true , of course). among other things , i 've never seen a
review of the budget systems (or their parent company , micro smart) , or of
the motherboard they are using (the aetana). any feedback would be
appreciated.

in a similar vein , the second system i'm considering midwest micro 's
elite vesa 486 66 tower with a diamond viper (2mb) midwest micro 14 mi
monitor is one i 've never seen reviewed anywhere. i'm familiar with the
firm but not the product line and some idea of their quality would be abig
benefit here as well.

any other suggestions in the price range would be appreciated my
greatest needs are speed and graphics capabilities.

email response would be greatly appreciated.

they produce , ide may no longer be sufficient for me (510 mb limit).

i 've seen a listing of a seagate 1g ide hard drive.

second , (rumor is) microsoft recognizes the the importance of scsi
and will support it soon. i'm just not sure if it 's on dos , win , or nt.

windows nt already supports scsi , a variety of adapters , for disk ,
tape , and cd rom. so does os 2 2.0.

what 's the difference between loading mouse.com in autoexec.bat and
doing device mouse.sys in config.sys \? \?

the only difference is the time the driver gets loaded. mouse.sys will be
loaded during the config.sys and therefor before the command.com. mouse.com
will be loaded during autoexec.bat and so after the command.com.

which one is better \?

mouse.com could be started from the commandline after the booting and it
could perhaps be unloaded , if no other driver is loaded after it.
the working of both drivers is totally the same.

when i ran dos , i preferred loading most of the drivers in autoexec.bat ,
because some programs wo n't run with some drivers and i could choose the
ones i needed during startup. but with drdos6 , this advantage is gone ,
because drdos lets you choose in config.sys which drivers should be loaded.

i have the same question as guido. it is possible to use the esdi drive
as a master and the ide drive as the slave \?

i can definitily say that you can use an rll as master and ide as slave , as
i have just upgraded my machine with a 200mb ide ( and custom controller
mdl ci 1010 extended ide controller ) while maintaining my rll 'd wren as
master drive. the trick is the controller which supports up to 4 ide drives
while coexisting with existing controllers ( mfm , rll , esdi , scsi ).

so according to the documentation it should work with esdi , and i can assure
you it works with rll.

everybody , dos 6 users in particular , take note if you want to play games
that hate use their own upper memory manager , dos 6 is not a problem. no
boot disks required. as your system starts up , hit the f5 key. this tells
it to bypass config and autoexec altogether. you get a plain , generic session
of dos , with nothing loaded. there 's another function key that actually
steps thru config.sys asking if you want to execute each line , but i 've
forgotten it at the moment...you can try finding it i think it 's f9...

no , you need not bypass the config.sys , in dos 6.0 , there is a function
of multi config , have you tried boot.sys \? the multi config is the kind that
you can choose you config.sys at the startup. and i find that is very good.
it has no conflict to qemm. (i have problem when using boot.sys)
the key you say is f8 , which is trace the config.sys step by step.

this might be a silly question but i have to ask it anyway. i am in
the process of purchasing an eisa vl bus 486 dx2 66 computer and i
found two places that sell machines that have what i want and have the
same price. the first is ares and they use a cache motherboard (that 's
the brand of the motherboard) with opti chip set , the other is micron
(formerly edge technology) and they use the micronics eisa vlb
motherboard.

i said that this might be a silly question since i believe that
micronics is a very well known motherboard manufacturer while i never
heard of cache ! i am however leaning towards the ares machine because
my impression is that they are known for building good , solid machines
and they have good tech support (24 hr , 7 days wk) , and a better
warrantee (2 years). micron , on the other hand , seems to have
recently aquired edge technologies and i'm not sure how much i should
trust the company.

i would really appreciate any input on this. is the micron machine the
clear choice \? does anyone know anything positive or negative about
either company \? has anyone ever heard of cache motherboards \? should i
go with micron just because it has the micronics motherboard \? etc.

you need to massage few switches in your system.ini.
in the virtual memory section , flip the 32bitaccess switch on and the
associated driver (wdctl or some such) switch on. this will enable

it 's also where the two annoying lines across the screen (one a third

the 2 lines are not a result of the high end trinitron tube , these
2 wires will be found on all 17 trinitron tubes (e.g. , mitsubishi 17 ,
sony 1604 , etc). on 14 sony tubes , you 'll find one wire.

their level of annoyance is purely subjective. i'm so happy with the
sharpness of the t560i that i do n't even notice the lines.

the t560i uses a trinitron sa tube which , when viewed as a complete tube ,
has a larger diameter than the standard trinitron tube. this results in
a flatter screen than other 17 monitors using the standard trinitron
(which has a vertically flat but not horizontally flat surface) , and
apparently the ability to provide a tighter beam focus.

recently my cousin got a second internal ide drive (a seagate 210mb ,
i can look up the model number if it 's important) and i 've been
trying to help him install it. i 've got a vested interest , since
my machine 's busted and i have to use his until i get mine fixed.
he already has a seagate 85mb ide hd (again , i forget the model number
but i can find out.)

anyway , i ca n't seem to get the bloody thing up. i 've managed to get
one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected) , but not both
at the same time whenever i try , the thing hangs during bootup
never gets past the system test. the ide controller 's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives i think i 've configured the cmos
correctly the power 's plugged in properly i even learned about the
master slave relationship that two hds are supposed to have (did n't
know pcs were into s m ! 8 ) and i think i configured the jumpers
properly (the 85mb one is the master , the new 210mb one is the slave).

the only thing i can think of is maybe i'm doing the cabling wrong. i 've
tried several combinations

controller master slave
controller slave master
master controller slave

none of them worked. unfortunately , i ca n't think of any others.

another possibility is that the 85mb one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives , c and d , and the cmos asks for c drive and d
drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others
i 've seen. could this be confusing things \?

so , i need help ! the drive came bereft of any docs , except for some
info for the cmos setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card i cannibalized the cable (it 's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle , so
it looks like a serial connection) now i be lost !

many , many thanks in advance ! this is practically an emergency (i have
two papers to do on this thing for monday ! ) ! help !

which may have also been revised or is new. i'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems , so you 'll have to get it
from someone else.

someone else , could you please comment on that. i have just bought
a twincom 14.4dfi , which has a rockwell chipset. it was n't cheap
so i would like to hear of problems i'm likely to run into.

however , i can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
rockwell mpu (as opposed to the dpu) for an internal implementation.
this is because the mpu used speed buffering instead of having a
16550 interface. without the 550 interface , the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows). as far as i know , the speed buffering
works ok for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

phew , i was lucky ! the twincom internal version has a 550a and one
of the rockwell chips is marked rc144dp.

but still i would like to hear more of the above mentioned firmware
problems.

i read a recent article in personal computer world mainly about the new
digit audion formats (dcc and md) but at the end talked about how nice
it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
how much data you could store. the author had been talking to someone
from sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply md
is a purely audio format , we would n't use it for data , then when
pressed for info about mo the sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on md !

what i think the original poster was wanting was mo drives at md audio
player prices. i 'd assume that the problem here is that an md system
can have higher tolerances than an mo system as the ear does n't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program !

hi there. we just bought a 486 dx2 66 gateway system with a 2 meg ati
ultra pro video card. everything seems to work fine except for the
windows drivers for 800x600 24 bit , and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes. the fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup ,
and within minutes of use , everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible. naturally , i called gateway tech support to inquire
about this. the technician asked me about the drivers , and i told him it
was version 1.5 , build 59. he told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ati ultra pro simply do not work ! ! ! is this true \? if so , i'm simply
amazed. how could this be \? the strange thing is i would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the faq ! ! ! ).

one very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the windows accelerator boards have working 16 and or 24 bit drivers
for windows 3.1. i easily challenged him on that because i 've been
running a diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now , and i have
tested and used the 24 bit mode as well. he then backed off and said
well , diamond has been working on those drivers much longer. anyway , i
just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
it. any feedback will be appreciated.

the system configuration is

gateway 486 dx2 66 local bus
16 megs ram
scsi hd cd rom
ultrastor 34f local bus scsi controller
ati ultra pro local bus with 2mb vram
dos 6.0
windows 3.1
mach 32 drivers version 1.5 (build 59)

i have been able to successfully use both 16 and 24 bit color modes on my
gateway system , although my setup is less complicated than yours. it sounds as
if you may have a hardware conflict or problem. is your memory aperture above
16m \? i have heard rumors of incompatibilities with that scsi card with a
variety of systems. call up gateway and give them hell until they help you
fix it.

i'm using int15h to read my joystick , and it is hideously slow. something
like 90 of my cpu time is being spent reading the joystick , and this
is in a program that does nothing but printf() and joyread().

if you only do read print then there is no reason for the joystick stuff
not to take 90 of the time even if it is efficient.

the problem is that a lot of programs trap int15h ( like smartdrv ) and
so it is a slow as hell interface. can i read the joystick port in
a reasonably safe fashion via polling \? and that is n't platform or
clockspeed specific \?

the truth is that int 15h joystick reading is slow. i read it directly
from the hardware port. note that doing so exposes you to intermittent
disturbance from interrupts , so you may want to read (say) twice in a
row and keep the lower results. do n't just turn interrupts off , it may
prove detrimental to the health of any high speed comms and other
devices.

here is an example of how to do this

joy.c

an example of how to read pc joystick port by polling the hardware port
directly.
uses inp() outp() for byte port access.
will timeout when 'int count 0' counts up to zero.
this sample reads one port (a is presented and b is in the comments).
you can read both at once by merging the two , but it will time out
when either joystick is not connected.

there is no need to optimize this routine since it runs for as long as
the joystick circuitry needs.

the same code does not work on my desktop machine. i have heard that i might

you need a monitor cable that has a vga connector on one end and five bnc

since i 've been seeing all kinds of complaints regarding gateways
lately on here , i thought i post my recent pleasant experiences. my
machine (4dx2 66v) this past friday. this was two weeks to the day from
when i called the order in.

upon unboxing it i found everything to be in perfect order. all the
peripherals i ordered were properly installed (jumbo 250 cd rom). i
was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the gateway
documentation. all software came with the original disks and manuals.
the gateway manual itself is in a nice 3 ring binder. the ati gup came
with build59 drivers. all other software i specified (microsoft office)
was properly installed. the machine came right up out of the box and
has been performing flawlessly. it 's been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature. i think the big roomy tower case has a
lot to do with it.

it 's up and running dos 6.0 with no problems. i 've also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications.
i used the dos 6.0 interlink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at 115.2k baud. it then maps the other
machines two hard disks as my disks f g. you can cd to these
drives and either run programs or copy files. it 's almost like a
peer peer lan except you can also run programs on the other machine.
it 's not a two way street. the other machine is the server and this
machine is the client. so thats where it seems to differ from the
peer to peer stuff. for a bundled dos utility its very impressive.

my jumbo 250 took about 11 minutes to back up 117mb of data. i also
by passed any potential gateway monitor problems by taking the 430
credit and applying it towards a nec 4fg. i love this monitor !

so , i'm glad there is some good news gateway stories and i'm glad it
was me. (now if it just keeps working). )

i have been following this thread and figured i 'd throw in my two cents...

the amiga zorro ii bus is comparable with the isa bus (7.16 vs 8.33 mhz).

except for the fact that it 's superior in just about every way to
the isa bus.

the amiga has had a pre emptative multi tasking os since '85 and can
operate with 1 mb ram ! scsi is used almost exclusively on these systems.

except for the new systems that now ship only with ide controllers.

experiences with diamond viper vlb video card

several problems

1) the ad specified 16.7 million colors at 640x480 resolution with 1mb
of vram , which is what i have. this color depth is not supported
with video bios version 1.00 and drivers version 1.01. a max of 65k
colors are supported at 640x800 and 800x600 resolutions with 1mb
vram.

2) with the 65k color choice i notice two minor irritations

a) under ndw , when an entry in a list is highlighted (such as in an
open menu) and then is deselected , a faint vertical line often
remains where the left edge of the highlighted rectangle used to
be.

b) with word for windows , when you use shading in a table , the
display shows the inverse of the shading for example , if you
shade the cell as 10 , the display is 90 (the printout is ok).

3) the big killer bug is using the borland c integrated development
environment. the problem occurs when you click on the turbo debugger
icon (or use the debugger option in the run command) , and the
debugger application goes to vga character mode (as it is designed
to do). the screen goes haywire , and is largely unreadable. the
turbo debugger display is all garbled.

through trial and error , i have found that when the disrupted screen
is displayed you should do alt spacebar followed by the letter
r . this instructs turbo debugger to refresh the screen , and it
does this satisfactorily. i wish i did n't have to do this.

the bug is more than with the diamond drivers. the same disruptive
behavior happens with the standard vga driver that comes with
windows. there must be something in the video card that mishandles
the vga mode.

the problem is not my monitor. the same bug shows up when i use
another monitor in place of my usual one.

i still like this video card , and am hoping its problems will be
remedied (they do offer a 5 year warranty).

anything acts weird ( e.g. you get unexplainable floppy drive errors , your
modem locks up , you have video problems , etc. ). if you overdrive the at
bus , then that should be the first thing to check if you get an error on
your system.

it is pretty safe to overdrive your at bus , as long as your isa cards
still work flawlessly. i suggest backing up your hd before playing with
it though.

on my 486dx 50 (really 50 , not dx2) , my at bus is set to clk 3.

at 16.67 mhz , i have no problems. soundblaster pro , zoom 14.4 fxm , rll

if i set it to 2 (25 mhz) , i simply do n't get past the post routines.

additional warranty up to one year. does it apply to the purchase of
computers \? i wonder if anyone out there has used it. is there any catch \?
thanks in advance.

i am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase. one
of the key points was the ability to use my american express card. i
read the fine print between double warranty policies of amex and citibank
visa. sure , both will allow you double warranty on computers , but citibank
has a maximum claim of 250.00. could you imagine trying to get your
monitor or mother board fixed for 250.00 \? amex has no limit on claims.

remember , if you use amex , you must either send a copy of the warranty info
to them in 30 days from purchase , or you must call them to pre register and
then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre register
pak arrived today). citibank visa requires no pre registration.

i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one
i already had. my problem is this. my system only had a ide cable
for one drive , so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors
on it , and consequently have to switch cables. the problem is ,
the new hard drive 's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the ide card. but
for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug
in the cable to align these.
secondly , the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them.
i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into
the drives. does it matter which i plug into the master drive
and which into the slave \? any help appreciated. thanks...

organization university of texas at austin

hi there. we just bought a 486 dx2 66 gateway system with a 2 meg ati
ultra pro video card. everything seems to work fine except for the
windows drivers for 800x600 24 bit , and 800x600 and 1024x768 16 bit
modes. the fonts and icons start deteriorating after windows startup ,
and within minutes of use , everything on the screen is totally
unintelligible. naturally , i called gateway tech support to inquire
about this. the technician asked me about the drivers , and i told him it
was version 1.5 , build 59. he told me that the 16 and 24 bit drivers for
the ati ultra pro simply do not work ! ! ! is this true \? if so , i'm simply
amazed. how could this be \? the strange thing is i would have expected
to see some discussion on here (unless the subject has made the faq ! ! ! ).

one very suspicious point that came up later was that he stated that none
of the windows accelerator boards have working 16 and or 24 bit drivers
for windows 3.1. i easily challenged him on that because i 've been
running a diamond 24x in 15 bit mode at home for 4 months now , and i have
tested and used the 24 bit mode as well. he then backed off and said
well , diamond has been working on those drivers much longer. anyway , i
just wanted to see if anyone else had any trouble and what they did about
it. any feedback will be appreciated.

the system configuration is

gateway 486 dx2 66 local bus
16 megs ram
scsi hd cd rom
ultrastor 34f local bus scsi controller
ati ultra pro local bus with 2mb vram

since your io card only has one serial port this should default to com1 \?

when you set two 'devices' onto the same irq like com1 and com3 (or 2 and 4)
the 'latter' one will always win , i.e. if you have your mouse on com1 and
start using your modem on com3 , your modem should work but your mouse will

my advice buy 4megs of ram , save 70 and enjoy performance.

i still want to know if some (most \? ) ide drives can handle bus speeds 8 mhz.


i recently bought a micron 486dx 33 vlb computer and the the local bus
ide card was getting around 1k s transfer rates (says norton). i caled
micron because this seemed pathetically slow and they said that norton
6.xx does n't recognize local bus and wo n't give accurate results. i was
told i would need norton 7.0 in order to get a true account of my ide
transfer speed.

i did n't really like this answer in part because the drive does n't seem
as though it 's cranking along at much more than that , but i also do n't
know if i could tell the difference.

i tried playing around with settings in the cmos (bus speed at the like)
and noticed no significant change in performance.

fine , but whenever i use it in 800x600 (windows , autocad , gifs) the screen
gets about 1 1 2 inches shorter. at the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a 3 4 bar of black. the screen is n't cut off , it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio. while i can
manually change the v size on the back , this is a pain in the ass , and it just
should n't happen anyway. i 've called gateway numerous times and they have n't
been able to help me at all. two different times they sent me a new card , and
both times the new card did n't work at all in my computer. they even tried
to bill me for the first card because they did n't get it back in a couple of
days , when they told me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
before billing my card. but their customer support is a different story...
so , if anyone has had this same problem , please let me know if you know what

maybe its a monitor problem. you mentioned that you swapped cards , but not

mg i went buying simms recently , and the sales person told me that
the
mg are 9 chip simms and 3 chip simms , and one cannot use them interchan
mg if you use one , you have to use all of the same type.

do n't believe everything you are told. i can tell you that mixing them
between 'banks' ok , and i ca n't see why mixing in one bank is not unless
they are of different speeds ( e.g. mixing of 60ns and 100ns simms in one
bank ). the two only differ in the type of chips it uses. assuming that
the simms are 1mx9 ( 9 bit wide ) , here is the two equivalent
configuration. the 3 chip simm uses two 4 bit wide 4mbit (1m of 4 bit
nibbles ) and one 1 bit wide 1mbit chip ( for a total of 9 bit wide 1mbyte
). the 9 bit simm uses nine 1 bit wide 1mbit chips. these are equivalent
because of the way that it is 'pinned' on the simm board. at the simm
interface , they both act as 9 bit wide 1mbyte simms ( 2 4 1 9 1 ). sorry
if too techie for ya .


mg similarly , one cannot plug in two 1mb simms and one 4mb simms to
gi
mg the system a total of 6 meg. why is that so \? \? if my system supports
mg of 8 meg (it has 8 simm slots) , can i plug in 4 4mb simms to give my
mg 16mb \? \?

that sounds correct. the problem is that if your computer takes 9 bit
wide simms , you can not mix different sizes in one bank. why you ask \?
simple , if you understand why there is banks. assuming you have a 32 bit
cpu ( 386dx or 486 ) , the data bus (e.g. the mechanism to retrieve data
from memory ) is 32 bits wide , so the computer expects to see 32 bits when
it asks for data. to get that bandwidth ( 32 bit wide ) , the motherboard
links 4 1mx9 ( one bit is not data , but parity , so i will ignore that in
this simple explaination ) to get 32bits (9 1) 4 32 bits . that means
that a simm in a bank stores only 1 4 of the 32 bit wide data. if you
have a 16 bit bus , two 1mx9 simms are linked together to get 16 bit wide
data , which is the reason why 286 banks are 2 simms wide , and 32 bit banks
are 4 simms wide. if your computer required 1mx36 ( e.g. 32 bit wide data
with 4 parity bits , used in some ps 2s and asts ) , you could upgrade by
one simm at a time.

hope that this message is not over your head , but the answer to your
question was not simple. i could of just said , 'because i said so.'

can anyone tell me if this card works with the march os 2 2.1 beta \?

i believe so , since the buslogic cards have proven to be very
reliable in os 2 2.0....

the buslogic cards have an os 2 2.0 driver that does work with the march 2.1
beta. support for the buslogic cards is not included with os 2 2.0 any longer.
if you wish to install the beta from the cd rom , you will need to rem out the
adaptec device drivers , as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic
cards when os 2 attempts to use them. (thanks adaptec ! )

so you add the buslogic drivers to the config.sys on the cd rom boot disk , and
rem out the adaptec drivers.

then you install the whole 1st half of the beta.. and it wo n't work ! ibm
nicely copies in the adaptec drivers once again. (thanks ibm ! ) so.. rem out
the adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. if you have everything in the
right order.. it will work.

things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except os 2
will try to install the adaptec scsi drivers once again at the end... so.. you
are off to more rem statements and more fun.

the bt 542bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers. the dos drivers work great. this card can easily be
configured to work with 8 different sets of i o ports (and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine) if you get a new card.. it will also be
able to support up to 8 gb drives under dos.

hope this helps..

i have a colorado memory systems jumbo 250 tape backup unit in my gateway
486 33v tower system. i have found the supplied backup capability to be
fairly unreliable. in approx 3 cases out of 10 , i have had the backup fail
at one point or another , often hanging in the middle of writing the tape.
seek errors , drive communication errors seem to be most common. i use the
dos backup software from colorado memory systems. should i return the drive ,
get some better backup software , reformat the tapes (am using cms tapes) \?
any hints would be appreciated this stuff is to time consuming to do over
and over again until it cooperates...

i 've been using an identical setup , except for the tower config ,
for several months now. from previous discussions on the net ,
the first thing to check for is dma conflicts with other devices ,
especically if you 've got any funky ones. next off , suspect
your tape try a fresh one. good luck !

a hard drive with xt type controller can be added , but i recommend not trying a
full height 5 1 4 hard drive , as i have run into trouble with the 63.5w
supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy platters.

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc , you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed , but it manages.
when booting is finished , plug in your floppy drive , now it will work.

(ok i know this is not very user friendly , maybe you are better off
buying a 486 66 with 300 watt power supply or something like that)

attention voters

i had a problem with my mailbox on the first day of voting.
please check the vote acknowlegement (ack) at the end of this cfv.
if your name address is not there , please send your vote again.
(actually , check even if you voted after the first day)


introduction

this is the third (and final) call for votes (cfv) for the creation
of four os 2 newsgroups and the renaming of one
(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)
(b) renaming of comp.os.os2.programmer to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)
(c) comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)
(d) comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)
(e) comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

this is the second attempt at creating comp.os.os2.programmer.porting
and comp.os.os2.setup , and renaming comp.os.os2.programmer to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc. the first attempt failed in the summer
of 1992 (the voting deadline was august 31 , 1992). the voting rules
state that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started
after a six month waiting period (in this case , it is march 1 , 1993).
this is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and
comp.os.os2.bugs.

this document contains
the background showing the need for these proposals
the proposed charters for these proposals
voting instructions
a voting ballot
some example ballots
the voting rules
the voting schedule
the mass acknowledgement


background

the creation of two , free , 32 bit compilers for os 2 2.x (gcc 2
and emx gcc read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred
a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms , such
as emacs , less , awk , grep , sed , xscheme , ispell , flex , yacc , and
much more. borland has released its c c compiler for os 2 2.x ,
allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software.

much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos , and
later , windows. as more people are discovering os 2 2.x , the
number of people asking questions about os 2 's compatibility
with their hardware increases , as does the questions on the
availability of drivers for their hardware , installation
procedures , etc.

multimedia is becoming popular. os 2 2.0 supports windows
multimedia extensions using win os 2 3.0. furthermore , ibm is
including direct multimedia support in os 2 starting with version
2.1 (in addition to using win os 2 3.1).

any non trivial software will have bugs os 2 is not exempt ,
especially since ibm is constantly adding new features to os 2.
so far , ibm has issued system patches and corrective service disks
(e.g. the service pak) for free (free from bbss and ftp sites , or
for free plus a small media charge for diskettes read
comp.os.os2.misc for details).


proposed charters

(a) create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)

it will provide a forum for developers of ported software so
as to coordinate efforts , avoid duplication of effort , and
spur additional development. the group will also cover
topics such as porting from other platforms (such as dos ,
windows , unix , etc) , toolkits which aid in program
portability (including porting tools such as mirrors) , and
so forth.

(b) rename comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)

to keep the structure of the os 2 newsgroup heirarchy
orthogonal , comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to
comp.os.os2.programmer.misc.

comp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup
for os 2 programmers to discuss programming issues and
technical aspects of os 2 in an unmoderated setting.

(c) create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)

it will be devoted to os 2 system setup topics , including the
availability of device drivers , compatibility information ,
installation procedures , system requirements , and overall
performance optimization.

(d) create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)

it will provide a forum for discussion of multi media issues.

(e) create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)

it will provide a forum for os 2 system bug reports , bug
diagnosis and work arounds , the availability of system
patches and corrective service disks , and so forth.

note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other
newsgroups , and discussion of bugs in os 2 betas belong in
comp.os.os2.beta

voting rules

one vote per person. if you vote more than once , only the most
recent vote will be counted.

votes must be mailed to me by the person voting. proxy voting ,
forwarding , posting votes to a newsgroup , etc. will not be counted.

do not ask how the votes are going. the status of the votings
will be revealed only after the poll closes.

i will acknowledge votes by mass acknowledgement (ack). i will
post the ack twice (see schedule below).

if you need help for using your editor , using e mail , how
voting works in general , etc. then ask an expert at your site.
also see the ``how to create a new newsgroup'' article which is
posted to news.answers on a regular basis.

if you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this
cfv , send me e mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.

when the voting period is over (see schedule below) , a proposal
passes if both of the following formulas are true
1) the number of yes votes exceeds the number of no votes
by at least 100 (i.e. yes no 100 , or yes no 100).
2) the number of yes votes exceeds at least twice the
number of no votes (i.e. yes 2 no , or yes no no).
in other words , a proposal passes if
yes no max (100 , no)
where max() returns the highest number given to it.


schedule

the voting period started on march 29 when the first cfv was posted
by david lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).

this third cfv is a repeat of the first cfv , but it also has the
mass acknowledgement (ack) of names and e mail addresses of those who
have already voted re send your vote if it is not there. if you
have not voted yet , vote now !

the voting period will end at 11 59 59 pm (central time) , on
april 24 , 1993. votes received after that time will not count.
the voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that
date.

i need a cdrom drive as my order was cancelled and thought 'why not ask
the net.community' \? i was ordering a nec cdr 74 but saw so much cheaper
ones that i want to know more.
the drive will be used to install software and (if available) for listening
to cd 's. perhaps some day i 'll want to use it to read the other cd 's , but
that 's not really relevant at the moment.

i 've been offered the following cd rom players , for the prices stated.
they all claim to have scsi i , and operate under os 2.
the drives are not listed in the cdrom faq and therefor , please give
your opinions on the drives , i 've got the impression that they 're not
all scsi. actually the nec was listed as non scsi in the cdrom faq and as
a compatible scsi product in the os2faq.

i 've calculated the prices as having dutch guilders times 2. it 's actually
about times 1.8.

who bought that trantor that is in the faq \? it 's extremely cheap and scsi ,
so what 's the trick or where can i order it (holland using mastercard).

there are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. one with 9 wires
and another with 34 wires.

the controller has two connectors for a 9 wire bus and one for a 34 wire
bus.

now i got a 20 mb harddisk from a friend of mine , and i wondered whether
i can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room
for a 9 wire bus , but not for the 34 wire bus)

how can i solve my problem , any suggestions \?

where does all this disk space go \? the dos partition table is fixed length

if i remember right , the partition table is allocated an entire cylinder.
to find out how much it takes up , you need to calculate

also , if you create an extended partition , there is a second 'partition'
in there for the logical drives.

i think the original respondent (guy dawson \? ) was refering to something
much more elementary.

every partition (whether it is the entire disk or not) has two fats and
an initial directory.

if you have a small disk (50 meg or less) , i would recommend that it remain
a single partition. unless you have some other consideration.

if you have a large disk (greater than 200 meg) , multiple partitions can
make sense.

managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached. if we are
only talking about a single drive , explain why scsi is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive.

the adaptec 1540 series use bus mastering. this means that the cpu
does n't sit waiting for data bytes , it can go off and do other
computing if you have an advanced multi tasking os , that is. dos
just sits and waits anyway.

why do n't you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first \?
you can quote scsi specs till you 're blue in the face , but if they
exceed the isa bus capability , then what 's the point \?

who says ide is limited to 5 megs sec \? what about vlb ide \? does anyone
know how they perform \?

why do n't you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first \? ) ide
was designed to plug into isa virtually unaided in essence , ide is
isa , on a ribbon cable. therefore it 's specs are the same as isa
8mhz clock , 16 bit width , 5mb sec.

this is why i 've concluded that ide on vl bus is a waste of a fast
slot. the card 's job would to slow the vl bus transactions to isa
speed. heck , that 's what isa slots do i 'll just use one of those
instead.

i am trying to get my system to work with a tandberg 3600 future

the system boots up if the tandberg is disconnected from the system ,
and of course no scsi devices found (i have no other scsi devices).

the system boots up if the seagate mfm controller is removed from the
system. the future domain card reports finding the tandberg 3660 on
the scsi bus. the system then of course stops booting because my mfm
hard disks ca n't be found.

the system hangs if all three (tandberg , future domain tmc 1660
seagate mfm controller) are in the system.

looks like there is some conflict between the seagate and future
domain card. but the funny thing is that it only hangs if the tandberg
is connected.

i have checked that there are no conflict in bios addresses , irq i o
port. have i missed anything \?

i am lost here. any suggestions are most welcomed. thanks in advance.

wow , you guys are really going wild on this ide vs. scsi thing , and i think
it 's great !

like lots of people , i 'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from
the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms 210mb ide drive (seagate 1239a) , and
what i would say is a standard (not special , no cache i believe) ide controller
card on my isa 486 50.

i'm currently thinking about adding another hd , in the 300mb to 500mb range.
and i'm thinking hard (you should hear those gears a grinding in my head)
about buying a scsi drive (scsi for the future benefit). i believe i'm getting
something like 890kb sec transfer right now (according to nu). how would this
number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for my isa pc , and
the state of the art scsi hard drive (the wailing est system i could hope for) \?
obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would
you want to use on your isa system \? and how much would it cost \?

along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd 's if i
were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my 200mb , 15ms hd \?
and how much would it cost \?

i actually have a pas 16 , and could (what a waste i guess it would be...) hook
up a scsi hd through it 's scsi port which yields an optimum of 690kb sec.
actually , i have a borrowed 12ms fujitsu hd hooked up through it now (and
own the trantor hd drivers for the pas 16 scsi port). is this scsi port a
scsi 2 port \? how could i tell \? is the fujitsu 2623a a scsi 2 \? are all scsi
hd 's scsi 2 \?

my gateway 2000 486 33dx vl bus system with ati graphics ultra pro lb.
when i have my computer in any resolution other than 800x600 , everything is
fine , but whenever i use it in 800x600 (windows , autocad , gifs) the screen
gets about 1 1 2 inches shorter. at the very top and very bottom of the screen
there is about a 3 4 bar of black. the screen is n't cut off , it just squeezes
everything into the smaller space and messes up the aspect ratio. while i can
manually change the v size on the back , this is a pain in the ass , and it just
should n't happen anyway. i 've called gateway numerous times and they have n't
been able to help me at all. two different times they sent me a new card , and
both times the new card did n't work at all in my computer. they even tried
to bill me for the first card because they did n't get it back in a couple of
days , when they told me over the phone that they would wait more than 2 weeks
before billing my card. but their customer support is a different story...
so , if anyone has had this same problem , please let me know if you know what
to do. hell , let me know if you do n't have a solution , just so i know i'm
not the only one with this problem. thanks in advance.

i have a maxtor 212mb on an isa ide controller , although my machine is

the variations of the isa bus speed. i tested it with speed between

(geoffrey sherwood) writes

in going with the modern trend , the orchid p9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver. of course , this breaks any dos program
which uses svga modes (like most of my cd roms).

this is not the case the rom on the p9000 supports vesa modes of up to
1024x768 in 256 colors. vesa compliant applications should have no trouble
setting these modes. (but i'm forwarding your posting to our software group ,
just in case. ca n't be too careful.) not that i doubt that your applications
are failing to run lots of stuff depends on figuring out which exact svga
they 're looking at , and do n't use vesa calls (vesa is still pretty new).
every new chip set confuses them.

the supported resolutions really annoy me. you can do 1280x1024 at 75hz if
you tell the driver you have an nec 5fg (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'generic' , and if you choose generic you ca n't get any high
refreshes at all). but at 1024x768 you are limited to 70hz. seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024 ! ). higher vertical resolution
was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f. vlb i currently have ,
and it will do 1024x768x70 hz as well.

i think we go to at least 76 hz at 1024x768x8 , and maybe more (and
it 's a function of the ramdac speed , not the power 9000). we need to
fix the problems you 've noted (they were already on the list). if
you 're really interested , though , take a look at the text file
p9000res.dat , which holds the data from which the choices in the
p9000 monitor installation program are built. working by analogy ,
you can build up a new monitor definition that has the right
combinations of refresh rates for your monitors. keep a backup copy
of the file ! once you 've built a new version of the p9000res.dat
file , run the p9000 installation program , inst , and your new choices
should show up. (this assumes you have the weitek v. 2.2 drivers.
you can tell the rev number by looking at the modification time of
the driver 02 20 is version 2.20. microsoft uses this gimmick ,
too.)

the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules
speedy program. this program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels second. i do n't have the numbers for the graphite card , but they
were close to half of the ofvlb (ie , slower) but that was running in a 20mhz
386 , isa , so the numbers are n't really comparable. the following numbers
were all obtained using a 486 , 33 mhz , air motherboard (umc chipset) , with
8 mb memory. i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them , and these tend to jump around a bit.

the speedy benchmark was put out by hercules and iit , who to my
knowledge were unencumbered by any motivations except making the
hercules graphite iit agx014 card look really good. so i 'd take the
numbers with a ton of salt. (texas instruments did the same thing
with wintach , trying to make the 34020 look good compared to the
8514 , as if anyone cared.) it 's safer (though not safe) to use
benchmarks from unbiased sources , such as testing labs , columnists ,
etc.


interestingly , the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement , and hatched polygons (ie ,
filled with cross hatching) and ternary rops (whatever they are. graphics
operations like xors maybe \? \? \? \? ) are a dead loss on the 9000.

i think you 'll a large discrepancy between the results of speedy and
the results of anything else in the universe on these things.

i give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts , because i think they are caching.
when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly
1 3 the speed of the ofvlb. then the speed increases dramatically. sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

font caching is a perfectly legitimate optimization windows has
hooks for it built right into the gdi. what 's kind of silly is iit 's
use of a hardwired the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog then
sat on a tack string in their driver. not only is it useless in
real applications , it lacks the programming elegance of the bart
simpson optimization , in which you save the bitmap of the
most recently drawn string in off screen memory , and just do a
screen to screen bitblit if you happen to be given that same string a
second time in a row. (we call it the bart simpson optimization
because bart 's the only person we can see benefiting from it he
could right i will not cheat on benchmarks a hundred times and be
done in half the time it would take to actually form each character.)

i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all. its just what
i saw when i ran them on my computer. i normally do n't write disclaimers ,
but this time maybe i 'd better. my testing is totally unconnected with my
work (i program under unix on decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge , blessing , or equipment of my company.

we do n't have any lawyers they 're all working for intel. there
used to be a lawyer in montana who did n't , but he died.

anyway the next stage is to use the midi port to enter music and play
the fm synth remotely. the problem is that i have little or no info
on the sb midi port.

i have tried using the sound blaster freedom project routines , however
this just results in the port locking after a couple of accesses and
loss the of note velocity data byte.

i am using turbo c and would be grateful for any info or source fragments
may help. when i was in berlin this summer i saw a book which seemed to
have all this information , but my german is poor to say the least , if anyone
has this book could they please mail me.

my second request for help concerns standard file formats (how can a file
format be standard if you keep it secret \? ) i need to know the file format
for instrument bank files .bnk and roland music files .rol.

finally does anyone have a source for displaying pcx or gif files to ega
or vga monitors.

please help , you know it makes sense.

organization netcom on line communication services (408 241 9760 guest)

pd@world.std.com (peter f davis) writes

i 've just installed a new colorado jumbo 250 tape backup unit from
gateway , and i have a couple of complaints with it. i do n't know how
common or serious these problems may be. i would appreciate some
feedback from others who have used this system. (btw , this is on a
4dx2 66v tower system.)

i have a similar configuration colorado 250mb on 66 dx 2 tower.

the problems are

o firstly , gateway shipped me only 120 mb tapes , even though the
drive is a 250 mb unit. when i called to complain , they only
said that 's all we carry , and with compression , you can
fit 250 mb on one tape. maybe so , but then why did i pay
extra for the large capacity tape drive \?

you got suckered in the same way i did. silly me , believing
that the 250 logo on the front meant actual carrying capacity.
the people who do this sort of thing for a living call it
marketing. lawyers who prosecute it call it fraud.
perhaps we can have a bunch of other duped buyers march on
their corporate headquarters.

o i have about 230 mb of data on my c drive. i choose the
space optimizing compression scheme and started a full backup.
the software estimated it would take about 22 minutes. it
took 4 1 2 hours. does this sound about right \?

this is a bit long. my system takes about 45 minutes to do
the same thing. usually 4.5 hours , particularly if the tape
is grinding away the whole time means that your block size for
the write is too small. is there any way to change the block
size or write buffer size so it 's bigger \?

o during the backup , about a dozen files came up with access
denied errors. most of these were in c windows system
(comm.drv , keyboard.drv , shell.dll , etc.) , but also
c windows progman.exe and a couple of files in the c tape
directory. anyone else had this happen \?

this is because the files are opened by dos. the files in the
tape directory are likely the executable file or the configuration
file for the tape system. i would recommend running the backup
from dos so it will make a complete backup of the tape directory.

thanks for any and all feedback on this system. i 'd also appreciate
hearing of good sources for blank tape cartridges , preferably 250 mb
size.

the 250mb cartridges wo n't do you any good since the drive
wo n't write 250mb of physical data on the tape.

thanks.

what are the current products available to upgrade the resolution \?
which ones support postscript \?

any experiences with them , either good or bad \?

is the quality difference really noticable \?

i'm planning on producing camera ready copy of homes. will the higher
resolution be noticed for these \?

if you are talking about laser jet 4 then i believe it has to be postscript.
i do n't see any advantage to using pcl when you have a peice of hardware
plugged into the lj4 that is doing the work and it can support any language
that is suited for the job. besides i do n't think pcl is even capable of
handling 1200 dpi specifications. i only have experience with the laser
master winjet 1200 which brings the lj4 up to 1200 dpi and it uses postscript.
it also has a fast print mode which is not postscript , and it is at a lower
resolution (600dpi i think) , but it is fast ! ! ! ! this particular product
uses your host processor to process the postscript , so even with a decent
pc you know it 's going to be slow i.e. slow compared to a high end workstation
processed ps.

the quality difference is very noticable and is almost worth the wait (for
the ps processing) i'm rather impatient.

we were using it for b w camera images (rs 170). the gray scale image was
accepted by ms word and handed to the winjet ps printer driver which converts
the image into postscript and then hands it off to the winjets postscript
processor. the postscript is rendered into ram (lots of it) and when it
is done it shoots it directly to the printer. the ps processor can also
accept ps files created from other sources including dos applications , but
windows has to be running at the time of printing. the ps processor is
responsible for the halftoning and i 'd say it does a pretty good job. our
camera images came out very good in my opinion. (not as good as laser master 's
demo though).

i do n't know how many other similar products are out there but i would be
surprised if there are several.

but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.

a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.

ide also uses dma techniques. i believe floppy controller also uses dma ,
and most a d boards also use dma. dma is no big deal , and has nothing to
do directly with scsi.

ide does not do dma. this is because it 's like te pc at hard disk
interface. the controller moves a sector to some buffer memory on the
controller card , then the cpu moves the data from the buffer to main
memory where it 's needed. if ide does n't work this way , then it 's not
compatible.

heck , if ide used dma , then you 'd hear all kinds of complaints about
isa bus systems with more than 16m ram not working with their ide
drives. 16m is the dma addressing limit of the isa bus , and if ide
did dma there would be trouble.

(btw , there are dma enabling signals in the ide cable spec , but the
last report i heard was that they are never implemented , because it
would require a different kind of ide adapter and different drivers.)

my current setup is a 386sx 25 (amd) with 387sx 25 (itt i think) and 9

basically i have two choices

1) get a 386dx 40 387dx 40 or
2) get some sort of 486.

unfortunately i live in the uk where computer prices are far too high.
the first option works out at about pounds 200. 486 m boards start at
this price for a sx 25.

i have a couple of questions.

1) how much of an improvement in speed should i notice if i get a
386dx copro. remember i'm using a 32 bit os , and alot of floating point
operations.

2) how much faster would a 486dx 33 be than the 386dx 40 copro \?

should i get an upgradeable m board with a 386dx 40 and wait for
amd pentium price pressure to reduce the costs of the 486 \?

any experiences will be most helpful ...

fellow netters ,

i'm in the market for a hand scanner. however , i do n't know anyone who has
one. i have my eye on two choices.

dexxa this scanner is available at wal mart for 90. it includes grayworks
software and provides 400 dpi and 32 grayscales (i think). the ocr software
catchword is available through mail order for about 90 also.

mustek (gray artist for windows) this scanner offers 256 grayscales
(according to cad graphics) and 800 dpi. it is available for 169
mail order and comes with perceive ocr and picture publisher le.

i am also looking at a genius hand scanner (b105) from cad graphics. it
is basically the same as the mustek scanner except for the resolution (400
dpi) and price ( 149).

basically , i would like recommendations on which to buy. i have heard that
logitech makes the best and manufactures dexxa scanners. but which one is the
best buy \? would 800 dpi really be helpful (output would be no better than hp
laserjet iii or canon bj 200 300x300 to 360x360) \? i am leaning toward the
mustek because it offers the most features and is in the middle in terms of
prices. which should i buy \?

if you have a hand scanner , please let me know whether or not you would
recommend it. also , if you know of another scanner within the price range
(under 225) that would be a better deal , please e mail me. any and all help

h e l p !

i have a problem in which i'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

some background about my pc

american megatrend bios (clone 386 sx) with 32m of ram
config.sys file

device c dos himem.sys
dos high , umb
device c windows emm386.exe noems
files 30
buffers 30
stack 9 , 256

autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe c
cmos set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.

the problem application error from win31

i started off with a newly installed win31 and then installed excel.
run excel , no problem. a permanent swap file of size 18k was in place
for windows.

ok , i then proceed to install norton desktop
for windows version 2.0. no problem with the installation. i also
allow ndw to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c ).
the problem came when i try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
first of all , i always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. the
following are some of them

stack fault , by tc1024.drv at address 0001 xxxx where xxxx is some
number. (tc1024.drv is the vga driver provided by the manufacture)
general protection fault , by ndw.exe at the same address
segment load failure , by ndw.exe at same address

some how , the address flagged was always 0001 something. what is address
0001 xxxx means \?

i have absolutely on idea what this mean. i tried commented out the
tsr programs from autoexec.bat , no help.

is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
win31 what it suppose to know. looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. i'm willing to try
anything.

a silly question i frequently edit small files and need to make copies of them

copying without swapping files temporarily to my hard disk (which is 99.9 full)

diskcopy a a

hi. i recently switched my old amiga 500 with a 486dx 50. my computer

16mb ram

when i use norton6.0 harddisk benchmark , i get a harddisk data transfer
about 980 kb sec. and sometimes 1mb sec. is that good \? i thought
that with eisa i could get about 2mb sec.
somewhere in the manual for my harddisk i have read , that some host
adapters need to perform a low level format to optimize the harddisk
performance in that system , do i need that \?
a guy i know , gets a hd transfer about 1.2mb sec , and he has an st3283a and
a isa 486dx 50 , how can a isa with the same system be faster \?

is there anything that i can do to get a speedier harddisk \?


1. dont rely on benchmarks. they often show incorrect due to different
tsr programs.

2. scsi often needs a driver to get the speed from the card.

3. make sure the card is operating in synchronus mode which is 2x faster.

4. you can disable disconnect and get some kb s but just to loose the mouse
or other int`s when diskaccesing.

(i get 2.3mb s with dx50 lb and scsi lb and maxtor lxt340sy coretest)

we have a gateway 486dx50 with a smc elite16 series ethercard plus.

when we use ncsa ftp to send from the gateway with hash turned on , we see
4 hash marks immediately. then the computer r e a l l y drags. if we turn
off the internal cache of the 486 , the speed is better , but does n't match

it does n't matter if we send from the gateway or get to it 4 hash marks and
then extreme slowness if the cache is not disabled.

does anyone know any more about this \? is there a fix \?

stuff about the connection between ide and ida deleated
8mhz clock , 16 bit width , 5mb sec.
if ide speed come from ida where does the 8.3mb s sighted for ide come from \?

scsi is not complex. it is just the way the industry uses and talks about it.
there are three key differences in scsi the controller chip , the port , and
the software. that is it.
let us look as scsi in from this stand point.

scsi 1 asynchronous and synchronous modes software scsi driver only
asynchronous is slower then synchronous mode only 0 3mb s vs. 0 5mb s
synchronous speeds can be reached by most scsi 1 divices with a
rewrite of the software driver as is the case for the mac quadra.

scsi 2 8 bit this is the main source for the confusion. this differs from
scsi 1 only in the controler chip in most machines. in the mac and some pcs
this is called 'fast scsi 1' because it uses scsi 1 ports and software drivers
and can produce scsi 2 speeds through scsi 1 inspite of this even in the
slower asynchronous mode. average speed in asynchronous scsi 1 mode
4 6mb s with 8mb s see in both quadras and higher end pcs synchronous
mode just allows a higher burst rate 10 mb s

scsi 2 16 bit two versions wide fast. wide scsi 2 requires two things
over 8 bit scsi 2 a scsi 2 software driver and a wide scsi port on the
machine and the external device.
fast scsi 2 also requires two things over 8 bit scsi 2 scsi 2 driver
software and that the recieving devise support 16 bit fast scsi 2.
speed of both is the same 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst.

scsi 2 32 bit also know as wide and fast scsi. over 8 bit scsi 2 this
requires scsi 2 driver software , wide scsi 2 port , and that the recieving
devices also have a 32 bit mode scsi 2 chip. as expected this is very
expencive. speed 15 20mb s with 40mb s bursts


as i said simple. seven versions of scsi seperated by software , the
controler chip , and the port. standarize the software and it drops to
only five versions of scsi seperate by only hardware the chip and the port

ahhhuuuurrrrrrggggghhhh ! ! ! ! ndd undoes it of course. the problem seams to
be getting worse and worse. however when the hdd is low level formatted
again the problem goes away for a while , only to return in a day or so.

i'm so pissed off right now i'm considering buying another hdd , and i really
ca n't afford it.

i'm using smartdrive , and windows 3.1 (i'm not using the 32 bit disk access
though , i know that can create problems). the disk is using the second
option to trick the controller into thinking it 's got less then 1024 cyls ,
and everything else selected is standard , maybe i need to use a different

reference to running ati 's install program and using

i thought this was a neat feature until i noticed that
when an image is re sized , the scanning frequency is
necessarily changed. this causes digital multiscan
monitors like my mag mx17f to get confused as to which
mode to use if the frequency gets too far from the
standard selections. for this reason , i use the
factory defaults for position size on the ati card
and adjust each mode individually (only the first time)
at the monitor. the mag (and many other multiscan
monitors) has (have) the ability to recall these settings
the next time each mode is detected .

1) after i switch the isa boards into the eisa board (all of the cards are
isa) the system seems to work with no problem what so ever. but some of the
interupt problems that we had with the isa board continue with the eisa board.
is it my understanding that the eisa board should be able to handle irq
conficts when running windows.

problem when running our network via telnet (tcp ip) with windows
running the system kicks us out of windows (irq confict within windows
i assume).

also , are there any memory address problems that will happen when the
boards are switched (base memory that is).

as far as i know , if you are using eisa mother board , you have to use also
eisa cards or else your computer system will be slower than when you 're
using isa board with isa cards.

cards cost more , but they are worth it.


i almost got a hernia laughing at this one.

you 'll probably get one when you realize that your 100 vesa super
dooper local bus ultra high tech controller sucks...

if anything , scsi (on a pc) will be obsolete killed off by vesa local
with any luck pc bus archeitecture will be doen any with by sbus.

have you ever seen what happens when you hook a busmaster controller to
a vesa local bus. it actually slows down your system
bus ide. it must be real nice to get shafted by 20 100 bucks for the
extra cost of a scsi drive , then pay another 200 300 for a scsi controller.

maybe my workstation does n't understand what your vesa local bus
ide is

vesa local bus will be killed off by pcmi \? whatever intels spec is.
vlbus it not good for much more than vga cards.

to each his own. i 'll laugh when you start crying over how much you
spent for your 2 little ide drives and then finding out you need more
space.

the biggest advantage of scsi right now is that you can add more
different kinds of devices , such as tapes , etc. , easily , and can add
bigger disks. the best and most cost effective hard disks available
are scsi.

here here....



only of you need drives larger then 500 meg. oh yes , gotta have 10 megs sec
transfer rate for those speedy tape backups and cd rom drives.

do n't stick your foot in your mouth when you make a statement you know
nothing about.


i 'd rather wait a second compared to the 5 minutes and ide would take.
(obviously exaggerated).

have you ever tried to backup 2 gigs of disk \? oh i forgot you ca n't
because you have an ide and no one makes ide disks that big.


basically , if a person has to ask which one is better for him her ,
then they will probably never see the expensive benefits from scsi.

i guess you probably bought a 486sx too


also , all this arm waving about scsi expandability is a moot point if
the user only has one or two drives on it. and with scsi those two
drives may be fast , but that speed is only due to the onboard memory
cache something i can duplicate with a caching ide controller.

what \? the scsi 2 fast , wide spec has much more bandwidth than any stupid
vlbus ide crap....

stop this thread now , its just cluttering up bandwidth. if you want
to read about scsi vs ide just pay a visit to you local usenet archive.

the best scsi 2 fast , wide , etc is clearly faster than any the best ide drive.
all the response given are based upon personal experience with 1 or 2
drives. you ca n't judge such completely different interfaces.
ide has the low cost adavantage a descent performance.
scsi has the ability for super high capacity expandibility and speed.

neither one is better in all cases.

if you do n't belive what i said about busmastering and vlbus then pick
up a back issue of pc week in whihc they tested vlbus , eisa and isa
busmastering cards.

hi netters !

i'm looking at purchasing some sort of backup solution. after you read about
my situation , i 'd like your opinion. here 's the scenario

1. there are two computers in the house. one is a small 286 (40mb ide drive).
the other is a 386dx (213 scsi drive w adaptec 1522 controller). both
systems have pc tools and will use central point backup as the backup
restore program. both systems have 3.5 and 5.25 floppies.

2. the computers are not networked (nor will they be anytime soon).

from what i have seen so far , there appear to be at least 4 possible
solutions (i'm sure there are others i have n't thought about). for these
options , i would appreciate hearing from anyone who has tried them or sees
any flaws (drive type x wo n't coexist with device y , etc.) in my thinking
(i do n't know very much about these beasts)

1. put 2.88mb floppy drives (or a combination drive) on each system.
can someone supply cost and brand information \? what 's a good brand \?
what do the floppies themselves cost \?


2. put an internal tape backup unit on the 386 using my scsi adapter , and
continue to back up the 286 with floppies. again , can someone recommend a
few manufacturers \? the only brand i remember is colorado memories. any
happy or unhappy users (i know about the compression controversy) \?


3. connect an external tape backup unit on the 386 using my scsi adapter , and
(maybe \? ) connect it to the 286 somehow (any suggestions \? )


4. install a floptical drive in each machine. again , any gotcha 's or
recommendations for manufacturers \?

i appreciate your help. you may either post or send me e mail. i will

oh yeah , i just read in another newsgroup that the t560i uses a high quality
trinitron tube than is in most monitors.(the sony 1604s for example) and this
is where the extra cost comes from. it is also where the high bandwidth
comes from , and the fantastic image , and the large image size , etc , etc...

i agree that the image is as sharp as it gets with these sony tubes ,
however in the 17 monitors using these tubes , the 2 annoying black
lines on the top and bottom quarters of the tube , which are created due
to the wires holding up the invar shadow mask , are quite annoying after
a while. that is the only thing that is making me lean more in favor
of the nec 5fg (or now also available the nec 5fge only difference ,
no accucolor ). any experiences or opinions from people who have used
the nec 5fg would be appreciated since i want to get one right after
my exams are all done (ie about a week from now).

all it is doing is running in a loop while the operator is idle and
after a while of sitting , it will screw up all the variables. this leads
me to believe that my stack is filling up and overflowing.

does the program take memory up when it is calling void functions

fails. find a bbs or ftp site where you can get a copy of port finder. put

this little program will locate all existing ports and make sure the bios

did i once hear that in order for the date to advance , something , like a
clock , has to make a get date system call \? apparently , the clock
hardware interrupt and bios do n't do this (date advance) automatically. the
get date call notices that a midnight reset flag has been set , and then
then advances the date.

anybody with more info \?

there are two 'problems'
(1) the bios tod routine which updates the bios clock uses only 1 bit
for day increment , so a second wrapping of the clock past midnight
will get lost if no one calls the bios to read the clock in the
meantime , and
(2) the bios resets the day wrap indicator on the first 'get date'
call from anybody (after the wrap indicator has been set). so
unless the first bios 'get date' call after midnight is done by
the dos 'kernel' (which is the only part of dos which knows how to
increment the date , the day wrap indication is normally lost.
my guess is that kevin 's 'menu' system uses bios calls to read the
clock (in order to display the time) , and is hence the entity which
causes the day wrap indication to get lost. even if the 'menu' system
'notices' the day 'wrap' (which i think is indicated by a non zero
value in al) , there really is n't any particularly good way to tell dos
about it , so that dos can update the day. the menu system 'should' use
dos calls to get the time , which would cause the dos 'kernel' to do
the bios call , and the wrap indicator would hence be processed
properly. possibly , though , the 'menu' system ca n't easily use dos
calls for time , because dos is not reentrant , and perhaps time
incrementing ofters occur while the 'menu' system is 'inside' some
other dos call.

another statement (maybe right)
ide harddisk do n't have precomp and lzone. the precomp is a built in parameter

the jumpers' names are given as printed on the hd 's board , often only a

when i installed a conner cp3204f (203 mb) as master and a wd caviar 2200
(203 mb) as slave , both with and without the cp jumper , the caviar had
seemingly normal behaviour. however , when doing writes to the caviar , once
in a while it would overwrite directories etc. using fastback was almost
impossible.

the workaround is to install the caviar as the master , and the conner
as the slave.

bios setting for the m2614et in my system is 667 cylinders , 33 sectors
and 16 heads.

i was trying to set my ide drive in the subject above to a slave drive for
a conner 170mb drive and contacting the support company gave me this answer (which works). the factory default on sw2 is on off off off off off (1 6). this sets the drive to be a single drive. setting sw2 to off on on off off off makes it a slave drive. sw1 has been set to on off off on (1 4) all along.

link options

in order to install the rodime ro 3000a series drives the dumpers for
the single dual drive and led operation on the drive need to be set as
described in the relevant product specification.
i a single drive environment the drive is described as a master.
in a dual drive environment the drives are described as a master and a
slave. this is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives
when performing diagnostics.
there are four links , lk1 , lk2 , lk4 and lk5 , adjacent to the 40 way
interface connector. they have the following functions and are described
in order as viewed from the end of the drive , with the first jumper
described nearest the 40 way interface connector.

lk2 led
when fitted , this jumper connects the led drive to pin 39 of the
interface. this allows a led to be connected to the interface. an
external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with
the led when this option is selected. the value of the resistor will
be dependant on the led type chosen but will be in the range of 130
ohms ot 220 ohms.

lk1 dual drives
this jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single
bus. it fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector ,
indicating , to the master drive , the presence of a slave.

lk4 master
when fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a master. if
there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be
jumpered in this way.

lk5 iochrdy
when fitted this connects the iochrdy signal to the drive , it is
fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher
data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 mbytes per
second when using 1 1 interleave. this jumper is not normally
fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 mbytes per
second.

there are four possible master slave configurations in which a drive(s)
may be jumpered

master , single drive with led on interface lk2 lk4 fitted.
master , single drive without led on interface lk4 only fitted.
master , dual drive without led on interface lk4 lk1 fitted.
slave , dual drive without led on interface no jumpers fitted.
master , dual drive with led on interface lk4 , lk1 lk2 fitted.
slave , dual drive with led on interface lk2 only fitted.

the master drive will delay power up for approximately two seconds to
reduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.

the other connections for a led will be found close to the 28 way
connector at the other end of the drive. this led driver is not affected
by the link options. an internal current limiting resistor is on the
drive for this led driver. refer to the product specification for further
details.

if you are handy with a soldering iron , the loopback plugs are easy to
make. on a serial rs 232 nine pin port , use a female db 9 connector and
connect pins 1 to 7 to 8 2 to 3 and 4 to 6 to 9. for serial rs 232
25 pin ports , you 'll need a female db 25 connector with pins 1 to 7
2 to 3 4 to 5 to 8 6 to 11 to 20 to 22 15 to 17 to 23 and 18 to 25
connected. to test a centronics 25 pin parallel port , you 'll need to
connect pins 1 to 13 2 to 15 10 to 16 11 to 17 and 12 to 14 in a male
db 25 connector.

any other resolutions. all the video cards designed for this sort of

up a back issue of pc week in whihc they tested vlbus , eisa and isa

is vlb busmastering bad because it stops the processor fetching from

i opened up the box and removed all the other cards above. no help there.
then , not having anything better to try , i changed normal irq to delayed
irq on the disk controller (did n't make any difference) and iochrdy not
driven to ide drive controls iochrdy (also had no effect). so i put
everything back to the way it was and re installed the cards.

i then unplugged the floppy drive cable from the disk controller. voila ! ,
the pc booted from power up , although it seemed to take several seconds
before the first access to the hard disk. plug the floppy cable back
to the controller and the original (non boot) behavior returns.

o.k. , with this additional information , does anyone in netland have any

it took 75 seconds to scroll through an x window over the modem link ,

on my pc at work (hp) every day for the same unix access from a pc over

2 seconds on the lan connection.

i just tried a few experiments. i cat 'd a 20261 byte file (471 lines)

uw win in a seamless os 2 window using pg 30 sec , could have been a
little faster (i had to keep
hitting the space bar)

i was using an ati wonder xl video card , by the way.

so pc xview for dos looks pretty good (and the line by line scrolling
in os 2 desktop looks pathetic , although full page redraws are pretty
good).

i tried it under pc xview using my normal (9x15bold or 10x20) font ,
and with a very small font , and there was no difference in the times.
the modem receive light was on pretty solidly , so it looks like the
bottleneck was the 9600 baud modem , not the screen drawing.

good , but it 's a bit expensive (700 bucks is the best deal i 've seen).
so i thought perhaps i might find something as good for less. any
recommendations \? i also thought about the nec 3fgx , which has the
same specs as the 4fg except for the scan frequency , which is more
limited anybody have any comments on this one \? would it work with

i believe that nec is replacing the 4fg and 3fgx with 4fge and 3fge
models , reportedly being released at the end of this month. i'm
waiting for a 4fge , the main difference being a 3 year warranty and
higher refresh rates at the higher resolutions. it sounded from a pc
magazine note that the 3fge was being boosted in a number of ways.
call the nec 800 number and have them send you info.

i have been using a nec 3fgx for several months now. several others here
also have this monitor. we have had no problems. personally i would spend
extra money for this monitor and sacrifice other features on a pc such as 33
mhz viz 50 mhz. based on the comments of others you might want to view the
3fgx vs the 4 series on a pc running windows at 1024x768. the refresh rate
appears ok for me , but you might feel differently. finally speaking of
spending money , with the size of today 's files , etc , a tape backup is
certainly worth 200 300. recently i set up a friend 's pc 50mhz and vesa
local bus. the redraw time for a graphics program was only a factor of 2
faster which i doubt warrants the extra cost.

orchid is aware of the problem , the new rev of the board (rev d) should (not would) take care of the problem. production was scheduled to start
on april 15 , i have no confirmation that production did start on this day
just the word of the tech on the other line.

now the flame......
you would think a company like orchid who has produced good quality products in the past would be more helpfull and willing to make right on a screwup of theirs.
very poor tech support (the first 2 times i called i must have spoke with the
janitor because they where talking craziness) the last time i talked to a tech named paul and he seemed to have a pretty good idea what was going on.
until these problems are resovled neither myself nor my department will buy

i'm not sure if this will work , but how about using one of those 't' expanders

have 2 or 3 sideways slots. this is actually how it is done in the low

and the expansion cards plugged into the 't'. i guess you could do this at

the 't' connectors are simply tracks with slots on them no electronics

is no help at all. as an example , it says 'the serial port can be changed to
com2 from com1 by moving jumpers.' but does not say what jumpers to move ! ! (

there are 2 banks of jumpers. the first one is labeled as follows
c1
c2
s2
p2
p1
g

the second bank is labeled irq and has the following labels
5c
5s
4
3
3s
2c
2s

i have determined that the c1 c2 jumpers tell it to address the first
serial port as com1 or com2. the p1 , p2 jumpers tell it to use the printer
port as lpt1 or lpt2. i am guessing that the g enables the game port and
the s2 should enable the second serial port , but i ca n't get it to work. i
have tried numerous setting on the irq bank without success. i assume that
this bank must tell the card which irq 's to use for both ports , but i don t

g 'day all ,

i was looking to build a parallel port digital to analogue converter the other
day and came across this schematic which i promptly threw together on a piece
of veroboard


p2 22k
p3 48k
p4 100k
p5 200k
p6 400k
p7 800k 10uf electrolytic
p8 1m6
p9 3m2

47nf ceramic


p25


(please excuse the obvious limits of the lower ascii char set )

i have it all constructed here and sitting inside a nice little grey abs box.

unfortunately i ca n't get it to work... i have a little demo here by the name
of cronologia (which the schematic came from) and all i can get it to pump
out of the box is data type hash static with a small amount of music signal
behind it it 's even worse than the speaker inside the machine.

does anybody out in net.colourful.computer.world have any ideas suggestions
better designs improvements wastepaper bin... etc \?

many thanks for a reply via this conference or email.


x regards , jason.

i recently bought a leading edge 80386dx 33 mini tower case and everything
works fine. leading edge seems to be a decent brand and what not. i would
tend to say that it is a decent deal. the only things you might want to be
wary about is that my l.e. computer has a back plane mounted motherboard.
ie the motherboard itself is a card that can be plugged in to a backplane.
some people do n't like these configurations. the second thing is that
whoever set up my computer at the factory did n't really know what they were
doing. the installed windows video driver did n't even take advantage of the
svga card monitor. look forward to configuring the system optimally
yourself.

hi
i have an orchid fahrenheit vlb with 2mb of dram. it is an s3
86c805 based card. i had a problem for a while after installing my
second meg of dram for the video , and thanks to orchid , i got a fix
from their tech support (it was jumper settings not given in the
ordinary manual. i assume it would come with memory ordered from
them , so i guess i should be glad they did n't just say buy the memory
from us or something like that.)

the one thing that i was puzzled by was why there was not a
1024x768x32k color mode on the thing , either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode. my ati ultra plus can handle that , given 2mb
of memory. all the 2mb buys you on the fahrenheit is 1280x1024x256.
just one more mode. geez. had i known , i would n't have bothered. i
asked them why , and all i got was your point is well taken , but
orchid 's software developers are busy with other projects.

so , to get to the point , finally , are there any s3 86c805
drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes \? i 'd love to
get another card , but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out , since this card came bundled with my
system and it 's not so easy to exchange these things unless they 're
broken.

if you want these modes , steer away from orchids s3 86c805
cards (ie. vlb or va vlb) , at least until their developers are less
busy . if the magazines are to believed , i 've only seen one s3 86c805
product thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (genoa \? ) ,
although evenn that might be a misprint.

please , if there are generic or semi generic drivers out
there , let me know where i can get them. 800x600x32k is ok , but i
coulda gotten that with my ati vga wonder xl.

what 's the word on the chipset \? is this a rom bug specific
to a specific brand using the rockwell , or is it the rockwell
chipset itself \?

there were an assortment of firmware problems , but that is pretty much
expected with any fax modem talking with a different fax or modem
which may have also been revised or is new. i'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems , so you 'll have to get it
from someone else.

however , i can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
rockwell mpu (as opposed to the dpu) for an internal implementation.
this is because the mpu used speed buffering instead of having a
16550 interface. without the 550 interface , the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows). as far as i know , the speed buffering
works ok for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

hope this helps...

in the latest pc magazine (pentium isssue) , there
is an editorial on the
advantages of a pc using eise vesa lb rather
than just plain isa vesa lb. supposedly users
will eventually want more than 16mb of ram.
however since the isa bus has only 24 bits ,
then anything on the bus can access only 16mb
even if i have 32mb on the motherboard.
so far i agree with the arguments.

then the writer claims that glitches can
occur in systems with over 16mb because
of that limit. that part i do n't understand
because the ram is right on the motherboard.
so the cpu should have no problems talking
with the ram. can anybody explain this \?

the problem is with isa bus masters which
can only address the first 16mbs of system
memory. bus masters do not use the cpu
nor the system dma to do the actual data
transfer but transfer their data directly
to the system ram.

try a bios level format via the debug command.
g xxxx 5 where xxxx is the hex address of the hd controller bios
location.
if this will not work , a last resort would be to take a large magnet
to the hard disk , but this has to be done properly or you will cause
or could cause more damage than has been done already.

disclaimer i am not responsible for your actions by directly applying
a large magnet to your hard disk.

if done correctly the magnet trick will wipe out everything on the
hard disk completely and a low level bios format might succeed

they no longer package the data sheets in a book , as they did when i got

) an 493 a comparison of the ins8250 , ns16450 and ns16550af series

both of the application notes i listed have proven to be at least as
valuable as the data sheets themselves (more , actually). an 491 , in
particular , is an exceptionally well written application note that goes

to take advantage of it.

recently my cousin got a second internal ide drive (a seagate 210mb ,
i can look up the model number if it 's important) and i 've been
trying to help him install it. i 've got a vested interest , since
my machine 's busted and i have to use his until i get mine fixed.
he already has a seagate 85mb ide hd (again , i forget the model number
but i can find out.)

anyway , i ca n't seem to get the bloody thing up. i 've managed to get
one or the other drive up (with the other disconnected) , but not both
at the same time whenever i try , the thing hangs during bootup
never gets past the system test. the ide controller 's instruction
sheet says it supports two drives i think i 've configured the cmos
correctly the power 's plugged in properly i even learned about the
master slave relationship that two hds are supposed to have (did n't
know pcs were into s m ! 8 ) and i think i configured the jumpers
properly (the 85mb one is the master , the new 210mb one is the slave).

the only thing i can think of is maybe i'm doing the cabling wrong. i 've
tried several combinations

controller master slave
controller slave master
master controller slave

none of them worked. unfortunately , i ca n't think of any others.

another possibility is that the 85mb one is already partitioned into
two seperate drives , c and d , and the cmos asks for c drive and d
drive setup info rather than drive 1 and drive 2 like most others
i 've seen. could this be confusing things \?

so , i need help ! the drive came bereft of any docs , except for some
info for the cmos setup the controller has a little piece of paper
about the size of an index card i cannibalized the cable (it 's one
of those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle , so
it looks like a serial connection) now i be lost !

many , many thanks in advance ! this is practically an emergency (i have
two papers to do on this thing for monday ! ) ! help !

i was recently loaned an older dec 210 286 at work , and i have the option
of adding an additional western digital hard drive to the machine. the
existing drive is currently a western digital as well , and is working fine ,
but i do not have any documentation available for configuring the master slave
relationship necessary for a c d drive setup.

the first drive is currently formatted to tandy dos v3.3 but i am eventually
going to upgrade both to ms dos v 5.0

the drives themselves are both model number wd95044 a circa 5 07 1991
they are 782 cyl 4 head drives. a note to add is that there is no exact
configuration for these in my current bios , but it seems to work at a
setting 17 (977 cyl 5 head , 300 write pre , 977 landing zone).
there are three pairs of jumper pins on the back that i presume are
for setting up the master slave. originally , the drive in the machine
had none. currently , i was suggested to try the far right (looking at the
back) for master and the middle jumper for the slave.

when booted , the reinitialize seems to puke accessing the d drive. it does
flicker about three times on the second drive , but then gives the error.
hopefully the problem is as simple as the drive not being formatted , but not
being a person who has ever had to actual format and unformatted drive , i
would not even know how to do that.

any and all help on this is great fully appreciated. if not , a number
for western digital might just do as good !

can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why , if i get os 2 , i might
need an scsi controler rather than an ide. will performance suffer that
much \? for a 200mb or so drive \? if i do n't have a tape drive or cd rom \?
any help would be appreciated.

so , when you 've got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

one way is with dma or bus mastering. either of these make it
possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the cpu. the alternative is for the cpu to move
the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and
bus mastering.

how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus \?

ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface
created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data
bytes , with no dma.

if we 're talking isa (at) bus here , then you can only have 1 dma channel
active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device.
so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus , explain how
all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card
to the isa at bus at the same time.

also , i'm still trying to track down a copy of ibm 's at reference book ,
but from their pc technical manual (page 2 93)

the (fdd) adapter is buffered on the i.o bus and uses the system board
direct memory access (dma) for record data transfers.
i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter.
so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at
hdd controller does n't ! \? ! \? that makes real sense.

have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone. at least
locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong , and
he has to fix it.

how long does he have to take in fixing it \? does he have to use new

but he claims are due to improper maintenance on your part \?

when it comes to local dealers

have fun getting consistently good support. most of their techs are
re treaded salesmen , not trained technicians , with a high turnover rate.

have fun getting in warranty work done quickly and courteously.

have fun getting out of warranty work done cheaply , or even done

having been both a service technician , and a service manager , at a

to push when they 're selling. it 's that same old song that car dealers

experienced mail order buyers know that there are some mail order
companies that give excellent service , including overnight replacement parts ,

good service , too. but if you think all local dealers give consistenly good

i'm running linux on an 80486 eisa system , and i'm having what i think are
hardware problems. it could be software , but i do n't see why i 'd be the
only one having trouble. i 'd like some advice on how best to debug this.

the symptom when i try to build gcc , i get unpredictable and unrepeatable
results. sometimes a .o file is not in valid a.out format. recompiling the
file gives me a valid binary. sometimes the compiler aborts or dumps core ,
but works fine when run again with the same input. compiling the same
source files with the same arguments gives slight differences in a few
object files. (note that linux , unlike many other systems , does not put
timestamps in object files so compiling twice should give bit identical
results.)

i also have occasional filesystem corruption on my scsi drive , but that
could be caused by using development software. it could also be related to
my problems compiling. the compile problems are not caused by disk
problems i get the same results whether i do my work on an ide or scsi
disk.

i 've set the memory speed and cache write speed to the recommended values.

recommended for what , dos \? that is a junk.


i suspect the external cache , but i have no real evidence for this.

the motherboard is a nice super eisa with 256 kb write back cache and a dx 2
66 mhz processor.

what i'm looking for

. a system test program to run under dos or linux

linux gcc. fire up gcc to compile libc and kernel at the
same time running x11r5.


. suggestions about the cause of the problem

bad memory , bad motherboard , bad cache.


. suggestions about how to debug the problem


change wait state of ram.
turn off turbo.
change bus speed
swap ram.

i love it when magazine writers make stupid statements like that re
performance. where do they get those numbers \? i 'll list the actual
performance ranges , which should convince anyone that such a
statement is absurd
scsi i ranges from 0 5mb s.
scsi ii ranges from 0 40mb s.
ide ranges from 0 8.3mb s.
esdi is always 1.25mb s (although there are some non standard versions)

by your own data the although scsi is twice as fast as esdi is correct

(how is 0 40 twice 1.25 \? do you just pick whatever scsi setup that makes
the statment correct \? )
even if you could make such a statement it would be meaningless unless
you understood that esdi and ide (i include scsi and ata) are
completely different (esdi is device level , like mfm rll).


with a scsi 2 controller chip scsi 1 can reach 10mb s which is indeed
20 faster than ide 120 of 8.3 is 9.96 . all these scsi facts have been

great , you can compare two numbers (ata has several speed modes , by the
way) but what the article said was misleading wrong.

posted to this newsgroup in my mac ibm info sheet available by ftp on
sumex aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the info mac report as
mac ibm compare version .txt (it should be 173 but 161 may still be there)

i would recommend people call the ncr board and download the ansi specs
if they are really interested in this stuff.


part of this problem is both mac and ibm pc are inconsiant about what scsi
is which. though it is well documented that the quadra has a scsi 2 chip
an apple salesperson said it uses a fast scsi 1 chip not at a 6mb s ,
10mb s burst it does not. scsi 1 is 5mb s maximum synchronous and quadra
uses ansynchronous scsi which is slower it seems that mac and ibm see

something is missing there. ) anyway , i agree. there 's a lot of
opportunity for marketing jingo like scsi 2 compliant which tells
you nothing about the performance , whether it has wide support , etc.

one reference for the quadra 's scsi 2 controller chip is

what does it use \? hopefully a good ncr chip (e.g. 53c710)

i 've been intently following the mag thread while waiting for
mine to arrive in the mail. there seems to be a lot of
complaints about minor alignment problems with the mx15f. one
article contained a comment that the owner called the factory
and was told that his screen rotation was within spec (1 4 ).

that figure (1 4 ) for image rotation would seem to be a little high...
on my nec 5fg the specs call for no greater than 3mm (0.12 ).

well , my monitor arrived last night and , sure enough , it has
a very noticable barrel distortion. it 's not dramatic , but it
is there and it is especially noticable when the image does n't
fill the entire screen. the fact that it is worse on the right
side does n't help matters.

what i'm trying to find out is if these minor imperfections
are the norm or are most of their monitors perfect \? i do n't want
to send it back and get one with the same or an even worse
problem. does the factory consider this kind of thing normal
and ship their monitors with less than perfect alignment \?

i ca n't speak for mag innovision but as far as nec is concerned , they are
adjusted to factory spec before leaving the central usa distribution point
(ma) for the eastern canadian market. now , here 's the key nec knows that
the 15 monitors' adjustments are very sensitive to shipping over
distances (with all the bumps , rough handling , and such) and therefore
expect and (at least in theory) require that the local distributor
(not dealer) have it adjusted at the local service centre (bull hn
information systems in toronto) before sale. this is the correct and
probably only way of having any chance of receiving a perfect monitor
(the definition of perfect seems to depend on how picky one is , in my
case quite ).

are other netters just living with these kind of imperfections \?

i , for one , was not willing to accept what i considered a substandard
monitor and , after two months of wrangling and direct contact with nec ,
finally received a satisfactorily adjusted monitor (not perfect , imho ,
but a major improvement over what the dealer and distributor were trying
convince me was normal ). the short answer is no , do n't accept these
imperfections as normal because for the premium one pays for the
larger screen monitors , one has a right to expect higher quality , and
if you 're persistent , you 'll receive it.

no marketer in their right mind would let you do this , unless they had

have fun trying to get hold of technical support over the phone. at least
locally you can walk right up to the dealer and tell him what is wrong , and
he has to fix it.

phone support is quick and competent from many mail order firms , but not so
quick and not so competent from others (gateway included). but my experience
with computer retailers (which is significant) has lead to the conclusion that
sales personnel and retail technical personnel are forbidden to actually learn
about the products they sell. talk about incompetent ! o.k. , so a few percent
of their answers are correct , but those salesmen do n't even realize how stupid
they are. ... ....... o.k. ...i 'll settle down now.... .... let me
catch my breath..... ..

fact retail stores never provide a better value in terms of price per product.

retail outlets are desirable , however , to those people who are n't interested
in learning about computers enough to make their own decisions. this is fine
for example most of my education about carpeting , wall paper , lawn mowers ,
microwave ovens , etc. has come from sales personnel. i assume i must be an
idiot. but i do n't care about those things. i do , however , care about my
computer i.e. i demand features and performance , and i 'll be damned if i 'll
pay some high school drop out commission on an over rated , over priced system
and in the process be subjected to his distorted b.s.

that clk n means how many wait states.

i think it all depends on your motherboard and the cards you have in your system. your hd stopped boot probably because your hd controller ca n't handle the faster bus speed. i have a 486 33dx , i set my bus divider to clk 2.5 , that is close to 13mhz. i can gain singificant performace increase on my video card and harddisk transfer rate when i boost the bus speed. and my system work flawlessly under this setting. and you know what , when i go to clk 2(17mhz bus) , my hd refuse to boot.

i was told that it should be possible , but that they had no idea how

please , if anyone has any suggestions , post them !


you might try asking on one of the comp.sys.ibm. echos (the best one
may be comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware). i say this because the conversion
seems more geared toward a pc user wanting to use that monitor , than
an atari user who already can use the monitor (unless maybe they
want to really go wild converting the monitor to vga , then
using it as a vga monitor with a falcon )

as for graphics cards , assuming that the atari monitor can be
modified adapted to handle vga signals , you should probably be able
to use any vga card (at least with a res around 640x400). i have n't
tried this , but that would be my guess...

...you might want to price mono vga monitors anyways it may be cheaper
to go that route than to do the conversion besides , with the falcon and

clockspeed specific \?

the joystick reads in anolog values through a digital port. how \?
you send a command to the port to read it , then you time how long
it takes for the joystick port to set a certain bit. this time
is proportional to the joystick position. obviously , since time
is used as a position , you cannot get rid of this ridiculus waste
of time. if you wrote your own routine instead of the bios , it
would speed it up some , but the time would still be there.

if you bought your ide drive from a dealer , you shouldn 't have to
perform a low level format. even if the 1st hd is already partitioned
into c and d , fdisk will automatically assign the 2 nd hd to d and
change the 2nd partition of 1st drive to e.

as described the manual the following steps must be done for th initialization
of the s3 card.

initdisplay
( bios call
with ax reg 4f02h
with bx reg 105h for 1024 x 768 x 256 resolution
interrupt 10h )
unlock register lock 1 (cr38)
( for access to s3 register set )
unlock register lock 2 (cr39)
( for access to syst. control and syst. extension register )
unlock graphic command group (cr40)
( set bit 0 to 1 in syst. configuration register )
unlock advanced display functions
( set bit 0 to 1 in function control register )

after these operations the fifo stack of the s3 should be empty.
when we watch the status (graph. proc. status) , we always get
the value 0fh instead of 0h.
full would mean 0ffh (8 places occupied) , empty would mean 0h
(0 places occupied).

it is possible to read this register in two different ways.
both times we get different results.



our machine is a 486 dx 2 with eisa bus and a s3 86c805 local bus.

can program displays on the keys to show some specific characters , et.c.
does it mean that there is some way of transmitting some non trivial data
to the kb (as opposed to standard numlock ... on off , typeamatic specs.) from
inside the pc software \? i have not found any corresponding reference in the

may encode data by the sequences of the standard commands mentioned above ,
which would n't look too neat , besides , what would one do from an xt \? )

i got the 1 mb viper card. the first one was defective , but zeos
replaced it with only minor hassles. this one works fine. i have n't
noticed any problems in any of my applications. i also ordered it
because of all the complaints about the ati a few months ago. guess
you can choose either buggy state of the art stuff , or robust average

for my particular configuration (tower , 300 watt supply , pkg 3 , no

i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding
extended operation of my g2k 486 33v with the cover removed

this , including quick access to jumpers during complex i o card

my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the
cooling flow of air from the fan , hot spots may develop on my
motherboard or elsewhere. my g2k has intake air vents in the
front of the enclosure right at mb level. these vents would be
removed along with the top cover in this scenario , rendering
airflow from the fan pretty useless.

however , short periods in this mode do n't seem to heat things up
too much , but my conclusions are far from scientific...

tim

i ran a 386 33 out of a cardboard box for more than a year with no
major effects (yeah , no case at all , mb sitting on a static bag)
other than the noise from the poersupply it ran pretty good.
as for cooling problems i bought a 12 14 inch fan and turned
it on full and set the output directly on the motherboard.

i did finally get a case though and i am still running the parts
with no ill effects.

i also had no kids to spill things on the mb i had no cat leaving
hair on the mb etc. etc. on and on....

the two major concerns are keeping static away and keeping the mb cool

if it was only off for a couple of hours and then turned on
again , the display works as normal like before.

does anyone know what is causing this \? is it a warning that
it will give up soon or just signs of aging (the system is a
386sx and its about 3 yrs old). i 've used systems at work for

you should n't have troubles. i have heard of machines having problems

it should run without any trouble of course but why do you want to buy some
60ns and mixed them with 80ns \? 60ns is more expensive than 80ns and
furthermore your machine will run the slowest simms clock speed eventhough
you have 60ns. just my 0.02cents thought....



your machine will run at whatever the bus is jumpered to cmos is set to
(usually wait states) regardless of what speed ram is installed. no
motherboard can sense the speed of the ram installed , unless you call
failing as a sort of auto sense. this is how you can sometimes use
slower ram in a machine. you either set the number of wait states to
accomodate the slow ram (in which case , all memory will run at that
slower rate) or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the
slower ram will act like faster ram and you wo n't crash.

putting faster ram in wo n't speed things up unless you tell the machine
it has faster ram.

mixing fast and slow ram will not help you if you have to keep the bus
slowed down to accomodate slow ram.

actually , it does make a reasonable amount of sense. fixed disk
sectors are buffered by the controller , and transferring them to
memory with a 'rep insw' (or whatever the instruction is called) is
quite efficient (single instruction , goes as fast as the
controller cpu know how to use the bus). since the 286 was n't cached ,
the bus is likely a critical resource relative to cpu performance , and
it 's possible that dma bus interference would cause as much or more
loss of cpu cycles (for 'computing') as does the 'rep insw' sequence.

the floppy , on the other hand , is not buffered , so that using the cpu
for floppy data transfer (as was done on the pc jr , by the way) really
does stink.

why do n't you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first \?
you can quote scsi specs till you 're blue in the face , but if they
exceed the isa bus capability , then what 's the point \?

who said isa was necessary \? eisa or vlb are the only interfaces worth
investing thousands of dollars (e.g. a new pc 's worth of money ) in .

then do n't complain (maybe it was n't you) that scsi was so expensive on
pc 's because all we 've had until a year or two ago was the isa bus.
(ie no one buys scsi for isa because isa is slow)
are you saying that scsi on an isa bus is not an automatic winner when
compared to ide \?

you did n't read to carefully. vlb ide uses the same connection mechanism
as standard ide. if transfer rate is limited by ide , whether it 's
interfaced to isa , eisa or vlb matters not.

i get different transfer rates out of my ide when i change my isa bus speed.

on mine , for one thing. scsi blows ide out of the water , hands down. if
ide has better throughput , why is n't it used on workstations and file
servers \?

ide is just a variant of the old ibm mfm at controller. (at least that 's
how it looks from a software point of view). it was never meant to be
an all encompassing protocal standard to be implimented across different
platforms.

is there any argument that
ide can (or ca n't) transfer data from the ide drive at least as fast as the
drive is able to provide the data \? are scsi versions of ide drives able
to deliver higher sustained transfer rates to their scsi interface (because
of a higher rpm platter , different arrangement of heads , etc \? ) \?

given the original question (scsi used only as a single hard drive
controller) , is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do
at least 5 , maybe 10 megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence \?
what does a 200 400 meg 5 megs sec scsi drive cost \?

no , that 's the nice thing on a multitasking os , scsi can use both drives
at once. i 've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time. it 's pretty ugly.

if data is going from one drive to another , and if scsi has the ability to
perform that transfer without the data having to go through the cpu or main
memory , then yes , that is the optimal way to do it. as far as i know , ide
ca n't do that. but when the cpu wants data from both drives (data to be stored
in main memory) are you saying that scsi can grab data from both drives
at the same time and store transfer that data to main memory also at the
same time \? working off 1 irq and 1 dma channel on an isa (or whatever) bus \?

i just bought at quantum 240 for my mac at home. i paid 369 for it. i
have n't seen ide drives cheaper.

a friend of mine just got a maxtor 245 meg ide drive for 320. (that 's 245
million bytes , or 234 mega bytes). with the basic 20 interface , he gets
close to 1 meg sec transfer on his 286 20. does your figure include a few
hundred for scsi drivers \?

no , actually , we 're talking about scsi being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the pc. if they had a common (read
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a pc (like as in a sun or
mac) , then you 'd find scsi the connection medium of choice.

so you 're saying that scsi would have been the default interface type ,
considering that the vast majority of pc 's do n't have cd rom drives or
tape backups or etc \? that most pc 's only have (or had) 1 hard drive and
run dos \? that scsi hard drives cost a lot more than mfm or rll drives
at the time \? (and how common were scsi drives under 80 megs 4 to 10 years
ago \? ) there 's a lot more than the lack of a common interface card that
prevented scsi from becoming the connection medium of choice.

i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good , well implimented
data highway , but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.

on a single drive , scsi is more expensive.

but on that point , is it faster \? this is what all this is about. do you
get more performance for the money. for all the people that will only have
a single hard drive in their system (regardless of the os) will the scsi
choice really give them more performance than ide \?

but , you bought your pc for
expandibility , so , you 'd want to add more drives or whatever.

true , but expandibility can also start on the bus , which means the option
is there for cd rom drives or tape backups that run off their own cards.

1. you can add many different types of devices and access them
concurrently.

no argument. this is always held up to the first time scsi buyer as the
best reason. but how many scsi devices will the first time scsi buyer
eventually acquire \? again does it make sense to go scsi for a single
hard drive system \?

2. a scsi device works on many different machines (i have a mac
and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice
with scsi hook them up and away they go)

with all the postings on the scsi i or ii specs , are you really sure that
pc and apple scsi hard drives are compatible \? and even if they are ,
is the data accessible from either machine (ie are there no formatting
partitioning or file table differences \? ) is it really plug'n'play \?

3. scsi devices work together better than ide devices. for
instance , recently , i added an older connor 100 meg ide to a maxtor
212 meg ide. the connor must be setup as the slave. it will
work no other way. on scsi , you set the address , check the
termination , plug it in , and away it goes.

so the c drive on the connor becomes a logical d drive to dos. is this
really a problem \?

4. i have a problem with ide 's mutual exclusion i notice that
the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is
quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c
to d on a scsi system. under a multitasking os , this is very
noticable , as many things can be going on at once.

after having two ide drives in my system for temporary file transfers ,
i have never seen any differences when switching between drives , nor
have i ever seen any differences when transfering files between drives or
to from the same drive.

one neat thing that i 've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a scsi system with
little problem we 've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that i 've
added to my pc. i 've now got the interface full , but , it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives , 1 240 meg drive , 1 tape drive , and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card.

that is nice (as long as the power supply can keep up). i do believe that
there is the possibility for up to 4 ide drives on a pc.

simply put , scsi is handier than ide. no mysterious jumpers to figure out.

but what about mysterious (and expensive) drivers to figure out \? at least
ide does n't require drivers that consume precious conventional (dos) memory.

from your own figures scsi 1 is indeed twice esdi as the article pointed out

the pc world seems to have scsi 1 and scsi 2 mixed up. fact is scsi 2
controler chips allow near scsi 2 speeds through a scsi 1 device
as shown in the mac quadra which skews some of the data of scsi 1 vs

was there and the editor killed it because the article was dealing with
scsi 1 not scsi 2 and he did not understand the effect of a scsi 1 device
with a scsi 2 controller chip.
scsi 1 chips are limited to 5 mb max. scsi 1 devices with scsi 2 chips
becoming common produce up to 10mb s in 8 bit mode and 20mb s in 16 bit
mode the fast version , scsi 1 ports cannot use wide scsi . of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that scsi 1 devices have scsi 2 chips
or more accurately the machine does . this allows the best of both
worlds high scsi 2 speeds and cheeper scsi 1 costs full scsi 2 hardware
(port , electronic controller , etc) is very expensive. it also creates
a logistic nightmare as to how fast scsi 1 goes.

when one knows the facts behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about even if it does not tell how the
figures came about while dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that do n't tell squat since he ignores scsi 1 devices with
scsi 2 chips his ranges tell even less then intended.

referring to the manual of my motherboard with ami bios , 10 beeps are a

hello. i hope somebody out here can help me. i am currently working
on a project where i am trying to communicate from an ibm 386 with
phoenix bios , using c , to a board that i made with an intel 8085 cpu
with uart chip. the board works fine with the transmit command and
terminal emulation mode of kermit , but there seems to be something wrong
with the initialization or protocol used when i try c . i need to
access the unit i built using c , because i have a sizable chunk of c
code that i will be using to perform calculations and operations that
will be very difficult to code in assembly language for the 8085.

i have included the assembly code that i am running and the c code
that i am trying to use. if anyone can show me something that i
am doing blatantly incorrectly or that i am missing because of my lack
of knowledge about rs 232 serial communications , please e mail me.
i wrote the assembly language to wait for a character to be received and
then to check it against the 0x20 character , if a 0x20 is received ,
the leds will indicate this. two c programs that i have written do
nothing , but set up com port 2 and send the 0x20 character. one uses
the bioscom() function in bios.h the other uses the software interrupt
int86() function in dos.h. i have triple checked the baud rate ( 2400 )
the parity ( none ) the stop bits ( 1 ) the character length ( 8 bits )
and the interrupt calls for ( 0x14 ). currently , i am at a loss as
to what may be wrong. any hardware gurus out there want to comment \?

anonymous ,

i saw a posting about the choice between 80486dx 50 and a 80486dx2 50.
i was wondering although a dx 50 is faster because of the path to it 's
external cache , should n't the choice be the dx2 50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local bus \? i mean , cache speed is one thing ,
but all your speed will be blocked during video i o , so just get that
faster...
i'm willing to speculate that the dx2 50 with local bus will be 2 4 times
as fast as the dx 50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ) !

hi netters ,

as promised , here are the summary of opinions on doubledisk gold v.6.0.
people seem to be quite happy with the product. there is no much of
opinion on how good it is compared to the industry leader stacker 3.0.
(superstor pro is not considered since it is slower than stacker although
just as reliable byte magazine 's conclusion ) ) , so it 's hard to make
any decision to go with stacker or with doubledisk gold v6.0.
however , it seems that at 39.95 , it is quite a buy.

buddy christyono
buddy@optics.ece.wisc.edu

summary of replies

hello buddy ,

i do not have dd gold 6.0 experience. i just ordered it. i currently have
dd 2.3 (the last version). i am very pleased with its performance.

here is my suggestion...

1) if you do not have any compression software currently , i would go with
dos 6.0 's compression. all the discussion on the net indicates that
for 50 you get the compression (built into the os) , plus the other
utilities that you would pay way more than 50 for. besides , you
are now at dos6.0 (whatever that means...)

2) if you have doubledisk 2.3 already (like i do) , the cost is 29.95
for the upgrade. after thinking about it and asking the net , i
decided that i could not go wrong with the update cost !
i have never suffered from performance of dd. i have a 12ms hd with
large sw packages in both compressed and uncompressed format. it
works great. not delays. i think the a is better than b
arguements are a lot of bunk... they are all comparable in performance.
i am looking forward to being able to loadhigh the dd sw. that
has been an annoyance.

3) if you have stacker , et.al. currently , i would not see it worth the
effort to upgrade.

just my .02 ...

regards ,
mark bagdy

buddy ,

i got the same mailer. about 2 weeks ago i got ddg and installed it. the
documentation was , in my opinion , easy to follow. i used the automatic
installation (not the custom) and everything went smoothly.

there were some specific instructions on a readme file for dealing with 386max
qemm. ddg has an uninstall (unlike dos6.0) if you need it. my system has a
203mb hard drive. before installing ddg i had 5mb free. after ddg i had
197mb free. pretty good statistics considering that my 8mb permanent windows
swap file stayed on the uncompressed portion (along with other drivers and
such).

i have had no problems whatsoever. i have noticed no slowdown (other than it
takes a little longer to boot) either in windows or dos. so far i am a very
happy camper.

i have been using doubledisk gold for a little more than a month on
a 486dx 33mhz , 120mb seagate drive , running dos windows in 386 enhanced
mode.
i ran some tests and concluded that the speed of a doubledisk drive
with a drive read cache is about equal to the bare drive without a cache.
i have no complaints about reliability. it was very easy to install.
the only problem i had was with castle wolfenstein 3 d. i assumed the game
was trying to bypass dos disk access and moved the game to the non compressed
region of the disk. since then the game has never given me a problem.
there was never any damage to the doubledisk drive.
compression performance for the whole disk has held steady
around 1.8 1. this is lower than expected but about 20 (size) of my files
are compressed image files and some large zip files.

if you have any more specific questions let me know.
dan


i bought it an have been happy with it. i use it on both mfm and ide 40
mb drives. i was using doubledisk before gold came out. that is the
same product msdos 6.0 is shipping with. no problems with either
product.

windows 3.1 enhanced mode

the windows 3.1 install program should automatically configure dos
and windows for use with the adaptec 1542. however , just in case
something went wrong , i'm going to describe some of the changes needed
to get windows 3.1 working with the 1542. also , you may have noticed
that installing windows 3.1 makes your pc run much slower , even when
you 're not running windows methods of speeding it up are discussed in
the section called , windows 3.1 runs slowly .


msdos configuration

the windows install program adds the smartdrive disk cache to your
config.sys and autoexec.bat files. if you follow the instructions ,
you 'll notice that you 'll need to use double buffering with smartdrive
(this is the default setup). you 'll also notice that your system runs
much , much slower in both windows and msdos. see the section
called , windows 3.1 runs slowly , for some ways of speeding your system
up.


windows configuration

to get the adaptec 1542 to work with windows , make sure that the
388enh section of the system.ini file contains the entry

virtualhdirq off

i believe that the windows install program automatically adds this entry
to system.ini , but i'm not sure. if this does n't work for you , you
might want to try adding some more lines

virtualhdirq off
systemrombreakpoint false
emmexclude a000 cfff

(you probably do n't need the above lines , though.) the
systemrombreakpoint entry is used to enable support for memory
managers like qemm 386max (only needed if you use such programs).


windows 3.1 runs slowly

once you do get windows 3.1 running with the 1542 , chances are that
your system is running much slower than before. if it 's not , it 's
probably because

1. you happen to be using aspi4dos.sys version 3.1 in your
config.sys file. congratulations this appears to be a
winning solution.

2. you are very lucky. whether your luck will hold out remains to
be seen ....

if your system is running much slower than before , this is almost
definitely caused by smartdrive with double buffering. according to the
windows documentation , and the microsoft technical note q81808
( smartdrive double buffering required with aspi4dos.sys ) , you must use
smartdrive with double buffering enabled. while this works , it really
slows down your pc i once estimated that this slowed my pc down by a
factor of 5 (five). as i consider this unacceptable , i looked for other
solutions.

unfortunately , you cannot just disable double buffering. if you
do , windows 3.1 in enhanced mode will not work , and you might even
destroy the contents of your hard disk by trying to run windows 3.1.
what you can do is one of the following

1. use other drivers that provide double buffering. it is my
opinion that the unbelievable slowness in smartdrive is caused
either by horribly inefficient double buffering , or by a bug in
smartdrive.

2. use a driver that provides vds services ( vds stands for
virtual dma services ). this is a standard , which is supported
by windows 3.1 , that allows bus mastering disk controllers (like
the 1542) to work with windows.

after trashing my hard disk countless times , i found the following
solutions , none of which require using smartdrive (note , however , that i
am now getting occasional parity errors , which are probably not caused
by these solutions , but might be see below). while the following
does not require smartdrive , using some kind of disk cache utility is
strongly recommended , as this makes windows run much , much faster

1. if you do not have the aspi4dos.sys driver , or you do not need aspi
functions (for controlling a cdrom , tape drive , more than two
physical hard disks , etc.) , you can add the scsiha.sys driver to your
config.sys file , e.g.

driver c scsiha.sys v386

(windows needs the v386 option.) this driver must be loaded into
low memory (it cannot be loaded into high memory) , and it occupies
about 16 20k. as of november 1992 , the scsiha.sys driver could be
obtained from the adaptec bbs at (408) 945 7727 (hopefully , it 's
still there).

2. if you need aspi functions and have the aspi4dos.sys driver , version
3.0 or 3.0a , you can use both the aspi4dos.sys and scsiha.sys drivers
in your config.sys file , e.g.

driver c aspi4dos.sys
driver c scsiha.sys v386

amazingly enough , the scsiha.sys driver can also be loaded high
(assuming you have dos 5.0) i would have thought that this would
crash my system , but it does n't. i asked adaptec 's technical support
about this , and they said that loading scsiha.sys high should be fine
as long as aspi4dos.sys is loaded low.

on my system , not using scsiha.sys with aspi4dos 3.0a would
occasionally cause windows 3.1 to crash upon restarting or exiting
windows , with the additional result of a corrupted disk (some of my
c windows .grp files would be corrupted). for me , these crashes
usually occurred while making a different program from progman.exe
the default windows shell , and vice versa. this is the reason
scsiha.sys may be necessary.

i have absolutely no idea if scsiha.sys is necessary with versions of
aspi4dos earlier than 3.0.

note that many people can use aspi4dos 3.0 or 3.0a without
scsiha.sys they do not seem to have any problems at all. i consider
these people lucky. others , like me , have had all sorts of problems.

3. in my opinion , the best , but not necessarily the easiest , solution is
to upgrade to aspi4dos 3.1. the scsiha.sys driver is no longer
needed. unfortunately , while you could get previous aspi4dos
upgrades from the adaptec bbs , the aspi4dos 3.1 driver is not
available from the adaptec bbs. as far as i know , there are only
three ways to get a copy

you can buy the new (as of november 1992) adaptec ez scsi driver
kit , which supposedly includes aspi4dos 3.1 as well as other
drivers , such as cdrom drivers. i believe the list price is
around 75.

if you already have a copy of an older version of aspi4dos , you
can supposedly contact adaptec to upgrade it to ez scsi for
around 30.

a copy of aspi4dos 3.1 is included in central point pc tools 8.0
for msdos. note that the documentation and driver are stored in
different directories. note further that only aspi4dos is
included the cdrom drivers and drivers to support more than two
hard disks are not included. this is where i obtained my copy
of aspi4dos 3.1.

note , however , that i am now getting occasional parity errors with
windows. in all probability , defective hardware in my pc is causing
this , as i upgraded my motherboard just after i found the above
solutions. however , because these parity errors occur only during disk
accesses , there is a very small , but definite , possibility that the
parity errors are driver related (for example , changing the bus on off
timing for certain disk transfers might cause this). i 've run various
memory tests for hours at a time , and these tests have found no
problems. this problem is probably caused by memory with marginal
timing requirements , which cause parity errors during disk transfers
(this is why the memory tests did n't find any problems the problems
show up only under disk i o). however , i'm mentioning this just in case
it is n't a hardware problem.


floppy controller based tape backup devices

there are two possible problems with using the adaptec 1542 with a
floppy controller based tape backup device , such as the colorado memory
systems jumbo 250

1. tape backups restores can take a very long time. the tape drive
constantly starts , stops , starts , stops , etc.

2. tape operations may be erratic , or encounter too many tape errors.
(this problem might be caused by defective hardware on my 1542.
however , i 've heard of other people having similar problems , and so
i'm mentioning this just in case it is not a hardware problem on my
1542.)


tape backups restores take a long time

if you have a floppy controller based tape backup device , you may
have to adjust the adaptec 1540 1542 bus on off timing for best
results when using the tape drive. normally , while doing a tape backup
or restore , the tape drive motor should be continuously running , with
only an occasional pause. however , the default bus timing on the
adaptec 1540 1542 may cause the tape drive motor to start and stop ,
start and stop , every few seconds. this causes needless wear to the
tape and tape drive (however , note that a dirty tape head or a defective
tape drive can also cause this make sure your tape heads are clean).
this also causes the tape backup or restore to take much , much longer
than necessary.

the problem here is that these tape backups use the floppy dma to
transfer data in memory to from the tape drive , and the adaptec uses dma
to transfer data in memory to from the hard disk. the floppy dma needs
to feed data to the tape drive at a certain rate if the tape drive is
not fed data quickly enough by the floppy dma , the tape drive stops ,
rewinds a bit , and restarts (once enough data is eventually fed to it).
the default bus timing on the adaptec (which is really dma timing) is
too large . for example , when a backup is done , data has to be
transferred from a hard disk to memory , and then from memory to the
tape. because the default timing on the adaptec hogs the memory too
much (too much time is spent transferring data from a hard disk to
memory) , not enough time is spent transferring data from memory to the
tape drive. as a result , the tape drive constantly starts and stops ,
because data is not fed to it quickly enough.

the solution is to change the adaptec 's bus on off timing. the
default factory setting is 11 microseconds on , and 5 microseconds off.
the bus on timing needs to be lowered to 2 4 microseconds. this can
be done in one of two ways

if you have aspi4dos , you can use the n option. for example , i use
a bus on timing of 4 microseconds , which means that i use the
following line in my config.sys file

device c aspi4dos.sys n4

note that there is no space between the n and the 4 .

if you do n't have aspi4dos , your only recourse is to try to find a
program called setscsi.exe , which is very difficult to find. the
reason is that adaptec , for reasons of their own , does not seem to
want this widely distributed. i once asked someone who worked for
adaptec , and they asked me to not upload it anywhere. if you have
anonymous ftp access to the internet , you could try using archie to
hunt down a copy i believe that there are a couple of sites that have
it. if you do find a copy , you run it like so

setscsi n 4

this adjusts the bus on timing to 4 microseconds. running
setscsi.exe without any arguments resets the bus timing back to the
factory defaults.

note that it seems that you cannot use setscsi.exe if you use
aspi4dos setscsi.exe crashed my system if aspi4dos was loaded. i
could use setscsi.exe with scsiha.sys , however.

do not lower the bus on timing below 2 microseconds , or increase it
above 11 microseconds. if you lower it too low , the hard disk
throughput will suddenly drop your system will feel slower. for me , 4
microseconds works fine. this value may work fine for you , or you may
have to adjust it downwards a little.

once you 've lowered the bus on timing , tape backups and restores
should run faster.

also , do not experiment with the bus on off times (with the other
options that i have intentionally not described) , unless you know what
you are doing. bad combinations can cause parity errors and worse , by
starving memory refresh.

a program called bustifix.exe exists on the adaptec bbs. unless
this has been upgraded since i last checked (which has been a while) ,
this is a self extracting archive containing a batch file and a couple
of other files. this batch file was supposed to allow one to set the
bus on off times for the 1540 1542 and others. however , when i tried
running this program with my 1542a , my system crashed. at the time , i
was running scsiha.sys , and i did n't check to see if there was a
conflict with it. maybe this old program works only with the 1542b ,
although the docs say that it works with the 1542a \?


erratic tape operations or too many tape errors

this problem may or may not exist. although it existed on my
system , a hardware problem just on my particular 1542 could cause it.
however , i 've heard of other people having similar problems , and so i'm
mentioning this just in case it is n't a hardware problem just on my
1542.

symptoms of this problem , which persists even after cleaning the
tape head

1. backing up to tape encounters unusable sector detected errors ,
resulting in an aborted tape backup.

2. tape backup works , but the tape compare fails.

3. the tape drive starts , stops , starts , stops , etc. much too often.
unlike the above mentioned problem ( tape backups restores take a
long time ) , where the tape drive starts and stops every few seconds ,
this kind of starting stopping occurs every few 10 20 seconds or so.

4. fastback plus 3.1 does not find see any tape backup devices. other
programs , like central point backup and the cms jumbo software
(assuming that you have a cms jumbo 250 tape drive) can find see the
tape drive , but fastback plus 3.1 cannot.

5. too many tape read errors.

although i do not know what is causing this problem , i discovered
that using a different floppy controller solves it. a few months ago , i
upgraded my motherboard , which contained an integrated floppy
controller. as i already had a floppy controller on the 1542 , i
initially disabled the motherboard floppy controller. after a while , i
decided to try disabling the 1542 floppy controller and using the one on
the motherboard. when i did this , the tape drive (a cms jumbo 250)
reliability increased dramatically , and fastback plus 3.1 was suddenly
able to find and use the tape drive.

i do n't know if this was caused by a hardware problem on my 1542.
on the one hand , the floppy drives worked great when they were attached
to the 1542 , which seems to say that there was nothing wrong with the
1542. on the other hand , the tape drive did n't work well attached to
the 1542 floppy controller , but it did work when attached to a different
controller this could be an indication of a hardware problem on my
1542. i did change floppy drive cables , and so it is conceivable that
the problem was in the cables. i do n't know what the cause really is
however , if you 're having similar problems , you might want to consider
trying a new floppy controller.


sound cards

many popular sound cards can play or record digitized sound , and
this is typically done using dma. like the tape drive dma , the
adaptec 's dma can conflict with the sound card dma. unlike that of the
tape dma , this conflict usually manifests itself as a parity error
(your system crashes with a parity error message). what happens is
that , data is being transferred so quickly by the sound card and the
adaptec , memory refresh cannot occur quickly enough , which causes a
parity error. usually , getting a parity error means that there is a
hardware problem with your system in this case , however , the parity
error is not a symptom of bad hardware.

i 've found that such parity errors typically occur while recording
digitized sound , and the chances of such errors increase as you increase
the recording fidelity (e.g. , higher sampling rate , recording in stereo ,
recording using 16 bits instead of 8 , etc.).

like the tape drive solution , the solution here is to lower the
adaptec 's bus on timing. see the section on tape drives for
information on how this is done. note , however , that this may or may
not solve the problem it may only reduce the probability of a parity
error. the software used to record digitized sound can greatly affect
this problem (i.e. , some software is inefficient). disk caches , the
speed of your hard disk , and the amount of disk fragmentation can also
affect this.


miscellaneous info

this section contains miscellaneous hints , tips , and rumors. much
of it is merely information that i 've heard or read about , and have not
verified. i believe that the following information is correct , but i'm
not sure. use it at your own risk.

with qemm 6.00 , 6.01 , and 6.02 , you need to specify the db
parameter (e.g. , db 2 ) , unless you are using the aspi4dos driver.
if you do n't , qemm will crash hang at bootup. although the qemm
manual mentions this , the install program does not seem to detect that
a 1542 is present and automatically add this option to the qemm
command line (at least , this occurred with the qemm 6.00 install
program i have n't tested any other version). earlier versions of
qemm probably need this parameter , but i'm not sure (i 've never used a
version earlier than 6.00).

if you use aspi4dos , you do not need to give qemm the db parameter.

some or all versions of the 1542 do not support hard disks over one
gigabyte in size. to support hard disks with capacities over 1gb , you
need to get a new rom bios from adaptec. i'm not sure if this is
still true of the latest 1542bs being sold by adaptec.

to connect a cdrom drive to the 1542 , you need a scsi cdrom drive and
some drivers. note that some cdrom drives have proprietary interfaces
(non scsi) these drives cannot be used with the 1542. you have three
choices for cdrom drivers (i have no idea how well the following
solutions work , or even if they work the following is secondhand
information)

1. you can buy adaptec 's ez scsi driver package , which lists for
something like 75. if you already have older adaptec drivers ,
you can supposedly upgrade to ez scsi for around 30. contact
adaptec for details. the ez scsi package supposedly contains
everything that you need.

2. you can buy the corelscsi ! driver package , which is made by the
same people that make coreldraw ! this package contains cdrom
drivers , scsi tape drivers , worm drivers , etc. i do not know
the list price , but i 've seen this package sold for around
80 90. note that corelscsi ! does not come with the aspi4dos
driver , which is needed. if you do not already have aspi4dos ,
you may be better off getting adaptec 's ez scsi instead.

3. this method is obsolete , as the following drivers have been
obsoleted by adaptec 's ez scsi kit , but i'm mentioning it in
case someone already has these drivers. you can use the
drivers in the adaptec asw 1410 kit (aspi4dos) and the asw 410
kit (aspi cdrom drivers). you will have to get a copy of
mscdex.exe (a high level cdrom driver) , if it is not included in
the asw 410 kit , but this is available from several bulletin
boards.

to use a scsi tape drive with the 1542 , you need software that knows
how to talk to a scsi tape drive. software that i 've heard about are
(again , like the above section on cdrom drives , i have no idea how
well the following solutions work , or even if they work the
following is secondhand information)

1. central point pc tools 8.0 for msdos supposedly supports a large
number of scsi tape drives. it comes with scsi drivers
(aspi4dos 3.1) as well as central point backup.

2. the corelscsi ! driver package contains a scsi tape backup
program (see the above section on cdrom drives for more
details). however , note that corelscsi ! does not come with , but
requires , aspi4dos.

i 've seen advertisements that sell the 1542 in three configurations

1. 1542 scsi controller with hard disk rom bios.
2. 1542 scsi controller w bios and adaptec aspi drivers.
3. 1542 scsi controller w bios , adaptec aspi drivers , and
corelscsi ! drivers programs.

i imagine that adaptec now sells the 1542 in a fourth configuration

4. 1542 scsi controller w bios and ez scsi drivers (including aspi
drivers).

those people who use unix might be interested in a version of gnu tar
for msdos that talks to a scsi tape drive via the aspi4dos driver (you
need this driver before you can use this program). i 've never used
this version of gnu tar , but i 've heard that it works (i do n't know
how well , though). if you have anonymous ftp access to the internet ,
a copy can be found on wsmr simtel20.army.mil and mirror sites

pd1 msdos.dskutl
aspibin.zip 67841 920131 gnu tar for scsi tape drives , adaptec 154xx
aspipat.zip 21206 920131 patches for aspibin relative to gnu tar 1.10
aspisrc.zip 221370 920131 src for gnu tar for scsi tape , adaptec ctrlr

i have no idea if a copy can be found on compuserve unixforum might
have it , if any forum does.

as far as msdos is concerned , the 1542a and the 1542b controllers are
the same with msdos , the 1542a should work as well as the 1542b.
however , the hardware for these two boards is not 100 identical , and
there is at least one (non msdos) program that initially did not work
with a 1542a , but did work with a 1542b (bsd386 a 386 version of
bsd unix).

in case anyone 's curious , here 's an edited copy of my config.sys file

files 40
buffers 40
break on
stacks 10 , 256
device c sys dev aspi4dos.sys d n4
device c qemm qemm386.sys on ram rom dma 32 st m x f800 ffff
dos high , umb
devicehigh c sys dev nnansi.sys
devicehigh c dos setver.exe
shell c dos command.com p

note that i'm using qemm and aspi4dos 3.1. if i were using aspi4dos
3.0 or 3.0a , i 'd probably have to use a config.sys that looked like

files 40
buffers 40
break on
stacks 10 , 256
device c sys dev aspi4dos.sys d n4
device c qemm qemm386.sys on ram rom dma 32 st m x f800 ffff
dos high , umb
devicehigh c sys dev scsiha.sys v386
devicehigh c sys dev nnansi.sys
devicehigh c dos setver.exe
shell c dos command.com p

if i were n't using aspi4dos , i 'd probably use something that looked
like

files 40
buffers 40
break on
stacks 10 , 256
device c sys dev scsiha.sys v386
device c qemm qemm386.sys on ram rom db 32 dma 32 st m x f800 ffff
dos high , umb
devicehigh c sys dev nnansi.sys
devicehigh c dos setver.exe
shell c dos command.com p

however , if i used a floppy controller based tape drive , or if i
planned to record high quality sound from a sound card , i would still
need some way of changing the adaptec 's bus on off times. the first
two versions of config.sys take care of this , but this last version
does n't.

fine , only to compress c to have the thing choke , spit out an unintelligable

and config.sys. calls to microsoft only met with busy signals. after reformatting
the drive , i'm not sure if he had the guts to reinstall 6.0 or stay with a known

the other may have been a marginal drive , however , his upgrade failed ,
he had to format a floppy disk at 6.0 , format the drive , and then reinstall.

hi ,

can anyone tell me the difference between 30 pin and 72 pin simms \?
i wish to get detailed information about the origin of these two
different types of simms , preferably a magazine review aricle.

by the way , if there is a faq for this group which covers the simms
information , please also direct me to it.

any help information would be very much appreciated.

beta. support for the buslogic cards is not included with os 2 2.0 any longer.

why not \? this is rather disappointing...

if you wish to install the beta from the cd rom , you will need to rem out the
adaptec device drivers , as they have a nasty tendency to crash the buslogic
cards when os 2 attempts to use them. (thanks adaptec ! )

yep. that 's cause the latest(and presumably all future) adaptec drivers look

pc magazine just did another review of high end graphics accelerators. for all

windows the recent reviews have all shown that the p9000 cards are
significantly faster doing windows than the ati card.

vga the recent reviews have all shown that the p9000 cards they looked
at are significantly slower doing vga than the ati card. about
1 2 the speed , as i recall.

the big question for me is the orchid v9000 card. each of the
p9000 cards tested so far has had the w5186 to do vga. orchid
is the only one i know about (i do n't know about ami) that uses
the w5286 for vga. that is reportedly faster.

i would like to know whether the orchid card can do vga as fast as
the ati card. if so , it would appear to be a formidable competitor.
(advertised prices are about the same for the two cards.)

someone in this group posted a little while back that they were getting an
orchid v9000 card has that card arrived \? what do the benchmarks look

what exactly do the numbers mean \? (i.e. which is the mb , ns...)

the numbers 60 , 70 and 80 refers to nanoseconds. could someone explain
exactly what this numbers means \? (time spent bettwen processor 's request
and answer retrieved (in case of reading) \? )

it means the time required for the memory to refresh , i.e. a 1x9 60
needs 60ns before it is ready to be read again.

nope ! it 's the time taken to read data from memory. it 's the read time.
the memory will still have to be refreshed. the whole phase is called
a cycle , the cycle time being about twice the access time.

i'm sorry if i'm misunderstanding your post , but dram does not have to
be refreshed on each access cycle . so cycle time does not have to be
twice the access time because of refresh phase .

the access time usually means the delay time from falling edge of raw
address strobe (ras) to data bus driven.

dram access cycle timing chart can be roughly shown as following (some
signals are intentionally omitted)

addr ra ca ra ca ra raw address , ca column address
ras high , low , floating
cas .. driven either h or l
data valid valid


cycle time
access time (or ras access time)

yes , the cycle time is more than twice as the access time but not
because of the refresh phase. the refresh can be done either as a
trailing phase of normal access cycle or as an individual cycle.

there is a file out there (look for it with archie) that is called

but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.

a scsi controller that transfers data by dma allows the cpu to request data
from the hard drive and continue working while the controller gets the data
and moves it to memory.

ide also uses dma techniques. i believe floppy controller also uses dma ,
and most a d boards also use dma. dma is no big deal , and has nothing to
do directly with scsi.

for example , when rewinding or formatting a tape , the command is
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other
devices on the bus. this greatly increases productivity or , at least , do
something else while backing up your hard drive ). which happens to be
what i am doing while reading this group.

you can thank your software for that. if dos had a few more brains , it
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else. the
hardware will support it , but dos (at least) wo n't. again , this has
nothing to do with scsi.

its a long story , but i still use ide on my 486 except for the cdrom which ,
thanks to scsi , i can move between both machines. if , and when , scsi is
better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines , i plan to
completely get rid of ide.

and if you stick with dos you 'll wonder why you ca n't multitask.

again i ask why ca n't a unix or os 2 type os do all the miraculous things
with an ide harddrive that it can with a (single) scsi hard drive.

anything you did n't know when you woke up today...
depeche mode nothing music for the masses
stephen r. husak husak@ux1.cso.uiuc.edu univerisity of illinois

does it do it to all tapes \? were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch \? the reason i ask is that i bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole. it was only on a few tapes of a set.

did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels \?

if you have not yet , open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base.
as you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more
than you have to. as you are doing it , look for a couple of little holes in
the tape. these are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is
at the end of the tape. the holes are spaced a couple of inches apart. my best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker \?

anyhow , if the tape has the holes , then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean. the function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes. the
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out. when the hole goes by , the pickup detects the
light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop. if the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment (unlikely since it is made into the case) you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape.

if the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good , then either
the pickup or the led of the sensor system has failed or is dirty. if you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r w head
assembly. if it looks clean and nothing is in its way , then the drive may
need to be serviced. it is possible that the led is burned out or the sensor
is out.

if it is still in warranty , you might be able to send it back to cms for
repair.

nice of you to delete both your responce and the item that prompted it.
to whit
i just bought at quantum 240 for my mac at home. i paid 369 for it. i

have n't seen ide drives cheaper.
to which you responded
a friend of mine just got a maxtor 245 meg ide drive for 320. (that 's 245
million bytes , or 234 mega bytes). with the basic 20 interface , he gets
close to 1 meg sec transfer on his 286 20. does your figure include a few
hundred for scsi drivers \?
to which i correctly pointed out the following
since the mac uses only scsi 1 for hard drives yes the figure includes a
hundred for scsi drivers this is sloppy people and dumb.
as i said this is sloppy and dumb you should resounded by discounting the mac
not giving maxtor 245 meg ide drive for 320 example. by giving an
example you give the implied consent that for mac info to be included
in the scsi discusion.

ok once again with the scsi spec list
why the spec list again \? we are talking scsi on a pc , not on a mac or
a unix box. and we are talking isa bus , or possibly eisa or vlb.
ok i will do this v e r y s l o w l y so you can understand
reguardless of whether it is a mac or a pc scsi 1 and scsi 2 are different
from each other as is asynchronous and synchronous scsi 1. all of these
have different speeds and costs. lumping them all together as 'scsi' is
dumb and sloppy. take again the quote later on as an example of the problem
in the pc world the spec list was so that you knew where the numbers were
coming from in the article. it shows the article is correct in it
staments about scsi but not consitant .

this isi n't comp.periphs.scsi.
with the way this thread has gone how do you tell ).
tell me what the performance figures are with a single scsi drive on a pc
with an isa (or eisa or vlb) bus.
already gave them. you keep deleting them ! so here are the specs
on everybody again with some added info

scsi 1 scsi 1 controler chip asynchronous range 0 3mb s
synchronous range 0 5mb s both common to the pc world difference is
mainly in software not hardware.

scsi 1 scsi 2 controller chip also called scsi 2 (8 bit) 4 6mb s with
10mb s burst. this is advertised as scsi 2 in byte 4 93 159 for the
pc and at these speeds. not the mac , the pc.

i have not seen the following for either the mac or the pc
scsi 2 16 bit wide or fast mode 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst
scsi 2 32 bit wide and fast 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst

on the other interfaces let dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu speak
ide ranges from 0 8.3mb s.
asynchronous range 0 5mb s infered from byte 4 93 159
synchronous range 0 8.3mb s.
esdi is always 1.25mb s (although there are some non standard versions)

theoretical performance figures are not relevant to this group or this
debate. i'm sure that there are some platforms out there that can
handle the 40 megs sec of scsi xyz wide'n'fast , but the pc isi n't one of
them.
note that i also give the average through put for scsi 2 which holds true
a mac or ibm pc clone with the correct hardware and software.
and since pc adversizements are using theoretical performance figures why
cannot we \?

if we are to continue this thread state clearly which scsi you are talking
about scsi 1 or scsi 2 or scsi over all scsi 1 and scsi 2
it does make a difference.

well maybe if the scsi design people had their act together than maybe
all pc 's would have built in scsi ports by now.
with pc articles like the following it is obvious that the problem is not with
scsi but with the people who report it ! like you.
look at the inconsitant use of scsi in the below quote
(my comments in )
although scsi is twice as fast as esdi , this is asynchronous scsi 1 with
a scsi 1 chip 20 faster than ide... this is both asynchronous scsi 1 with
a scsi 2 chip and 8 bit scsi 2 pc magazine april 27 , 1993 29
the article is confused , not scsi. the term is a mess from inconsitant use
not because the interface itself is a mess.

scsi means the set of scsi interfaces composed of scsi 1 and scsi 2
not 'scsi 1' as some people want to use it.

to read consitantly the quote should read
asynchronous scsi 1 with a scsi 1 chip
although asynchronous scsi 1 is twice as fast as esdi , one third the
speed of ide...
or asynchronous scsi 1 with a scsi 2 chip or 8 bit scsi 2
although scsi 1 with a scsi 2 chip and 8 bit scsi 2 are eight times as fast as
esdi , 20 faster than ide...

note the nonuse of 'scsi' by itself. this eliminates ambaguity.

if we are to continue this thread state clearly which scsi you are talking
about scsi 1 or scsi 2 or scsi over all scsi 1 and scsi 2 . lumping
everything into scsi as scsi 1 is sloppy , wrong , and dumb. inconsitant
scsi 1 and scsi 2 usage is also a problem. clean it up now or have
a mess like svga was several years ago because everybody and his uncle
slapped 'scsa' an their own monitor inteface scsi is standarized unlike
svga was years ago except in terminaology.

there are designs with 50mhz and 2 vlb slots.

50mhz and 2 slots are realy difficult to design.

hello all ,

you , the net , are my last resort , or i 'll just change my job )
this might be a faq (e.g. mixing controllers) but have n't seen any.

sys 486 33 , ami bios , and your run of the mill multi i o card with
serials paral floppies and
ide controller clone gw2760 ex
there are no jumpers affecting the hd or ctrller (

and bios addr cc00 c800 , and other floppy format stuff)

goal have the wd esdi as a secondary controller and have both disks
simultaneously working. being able to boot from the esdi too would be
a nice bonus but is not expected.

ultimate goal have room for linux et al.
ex of scheme i have in mind boot from ide (hd or floppy) and mount
the esdi as root. not booting from esdi , or even from hd , is acceptable.

i have tried numerous (all ! ! ) combinations to no avail. they work alone ,
or can coexist witout hang ups but ca n't access the esdi or the ide ,
depending on setup jumpers.

useful suggestions might be
how do i tell the bios setup about two ctrllers (i guess the 2nd hd
is expected to hang off the same ctrller as the 1st).
do i need some driver to make it work \?
some new bios chip for any of these cards \?
do i have to buy another controller to make them hds happy \? ide
is cheaper esdi is hard to find and rather costly. i'm not
rich or i wouldnt' try to scavenge around , so soft slns are preferred.
adapters of some sort i can hold a soldering iron , and can change
a chip or put a jumper !

the assembly number is 4008 00 rev 2 and it is a 16 bit card , circa
1985. it has an aui port as well as a bnc coax connection. it has
selectable address for the bios , io , dma , and irq locations via berg

presumably for buffering.

the ethernet chip appears to be an intel 82586 , a 48 pin dip package. is
this chip an equivalent to the 8390 used in some cards \? there is also

howdy ,

sorry if this has been covered before

one of my pc illiterate friends asked me to help him install drdos 6.0 on his
nec powermate sx (386sx 16). of course , i said no problem and went to work.
unfortunately , the drdos refuses to recognize the hard drive during
installation , even though i am still able to boot off of the hard drive using
the old dos. after openning it up i discovered it was using an 8 bit
seagate scsi controller on a st 157n scsi 40mbtye drive. i then booted
with drdos 6.0 off of the floppy a second time and ran fdisk to see if
i could access the drive. lo and behold the primary 46.5 mbyte partition
was intact (created by dos 3.1 no less , i did n't think you could go over a
32mbyte partition in the older doses. i could be wrong...). i then tried
to remove the primary partition , which it would n't allow me to do. i am
unaware of anything special that has to be done with a scsi drive (i
kinda expected it to work just like an ide mfm rll drive for dos
installations). any suggestions would be greatly appreciated (except for
throw it in the garbage and buy a new pc )...

we had the same issue plague us for months on our gateway. i finally

the a drive. i order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3 1 2 and
the number of stupid install programs that ca n't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time the ones i had are now upgraded. and
as for the bootable 5 1 4 's i just cut 3 1 2 replacements.

if switching the drives is not an option , you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis. i have n't tried it but i think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully.

hello ,

i have a 486sx25 isa machine with pheonix bios. currently i have
8 megabytes of ram installed via eight 1 mg simms on the motherboard ie.
both banks are full , and there is no space for more simms. i am thinking
of running os2 on my machine and possibly linux with x windows , and i know
that more ram would be helpful. however with simms , the only solution i
can see is to sell my 8 megs for about 180 , and by 4 4mg simms for about
400 used. apart from the fact that i ca n't afford the price right now ,
the entire process of selling ram and buying it used probably means that
the machine might be down for a number of days which i would rather
avoid...

so my question is , do the at ram boards that plug into a free slot work
well with a 486 isa machine. i have seen some being sold used for about
90 with 4 mg with space for another 4mg 's. if these boards do work , how
do they do it \? is a device driver needed , or will the bios pickup the
extra ram as it does with the simms on the mother board \? i know that the
isa expansions slots are 16 bits and 486 simm memory is 32 bits , so
probably all of this is just wishful thinking... however any help is truly
appreciated.

x reader netnews pc version 2c

they do n't have a conflict because technically lpt1 does not use
irq7 ! .
the parallel printer processor (the actual number escapes
me) contains a printer control register which enables the chip
to transmit an interrupt to the interrupt controller as irq7 ,
then onto the main processor as int 0x0f. by default the parallel
printer processor does not enable it 's interrupt line therefore
no int 0x0f 's will be sourced from the printer controller chip ,
thus enabling other devices to use the actual irq7.

note , this applies to com ports also which by default do not
route interrupts to the system bus , although com 's software
usually enable this feature as it make monitoring com port
activity easier than polling the serial uart , thus probably
getting the sound card slighty confused ! .

windows may be a different story....

my solution was to switch the interrupt to irq 5 , which is
unreserved in contemporary computers (using irq 5 for the
drives went out with the xt architechture ... )

not completly true. for at class and later machines , irq5 is
reserved for lpt2. since it 's rare to have a second parallel
port in a pc , it 's usually a good safe choice if you need an
interrupt.

on the other hand , we just ran into a problem with that here
at work on a gateway computer (4dx 33v). it has a modem on com1 ,
a mouse on com2 , and the other serial port was set to com3 (which
normally uses the same interrupt as com1). we had a real fight
with a board when trying to use irq5 , and discoverd the problem
was that gateway had set it up such that com3 used irq5. as soon
as we disabled com3 , our problems went away. grumble ... after
several days of trying to figure out why the interrupt did n't work.

facts

a netware server 286a was roughly moved to a new location and left powered
down for three months.
from memory it has an 80 mb hard drive.
manuals and original disks are for sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a
when powered up , the cmos was wiped. a technician examined it and
pronounced the disk drive unusable.

my investigations indicate that drive c is a type 27 (1024 cylinders , 9 sides).
when cmos set this way , compsurf runs happily , with 13 bad blocks.

i use prepare to hotfix the one internal drive.

install will proceed successfully , but when i try to boot the server , it
reports that the software is not serialised for this hardware.

internal examination indicates that the keycard is present , and there is one
disk drive (or at least one large single unit).

attempts to configure a second drive in cmos result in drive not ready
errors.

questions

the software is netware 286 level ii and i can see burnt on to the screen
sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a. however , to configure netware for level ii
(mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk , yes \?

so how is the novell server 286a normally configured \?

1. can i install sft netware 286 level ii v2.0a as level i , or is this what
is causing my serialisation error \?
2. is the novell server 286a normally equipped with two hard drives , one of
which has failed \?
3. would this mean i can not install the network software because it will not
be serialised for this hardware with a failed drive \?
4. what else can cause a serialisation error \?
5. what happens if the keycard fails \?

how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus \?

by initiating a dma xfer. )

seriously , busmastering adapter have their own dma ability , they do n't use
the motherboards on board dma(which is much slower).

isa has no bus arbitration , so if two busmastering cards in 1 isa system
try to do dma xfers on the same dma channel the system will lock or
crash.(i forget)

their are 8 dma channels in an isa system. 0 7. 0 3 are 8 bit 4 7 are
16 bit.

the system uses dma 0 , a soundblaster uses dma 1.

i could buy a busmastering xga 2 video card a busmastering scsi ha.

in order for them to work properly , i would have to find out what dma
channel the xga 2 card uses and then simply configure the scsi ha to
use a different dma channel for its dma xfers.

i do n't know if multiple dma xfers can go on at the same time on isa.
i'm not sure if they can on eisa systems either.

i do know that on eisa mca systems , you can allow bm cards to use the
same dma channel.

thanks.

i just installed a dx2 66 cpu in a clone motherboard , and tried mounting a cpu
cooler on the chip. after about 1 2 hour , the weight of the cooler was enough
to dislodge the cpu from its mount. it ended up bending a few pins
on the cpu , but luckily the power was not on yet. i ended up
pressing the cpu deeply into its socket and then putting the cpu
cooler back on. so far so good.

have others had this problem \? how do you ensure that the weight of
the cpu fan and heatsink do not eventually work the cpu out of its
socket when mounting the motherboard in a vertical case \?

this does n't answer the original question. is os 2 a multi user os \?
and no mention was made of an ether card either. but from a disk data
point of view , why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi
tasking \? data is data , and it could be anywhere on the drive. can
scsi find it faster \? can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster \? does it have a better cache system \? i thought scsi was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached. if we are
only talking about a single drive , explain why scsi is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive.
you are making the same mistake i did you are confusing the drive
interface to the data throughput interface. again from my mac ibm info
sheet available by ftp on sumex aim.stanford.edu (36.44.0.6) in the
info mac report as mac ibm compare173.txt
expansion
both mac ibm
scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm.
allows the use of any device hard drive , printer , scanner , nubus card
expansion mac plus only , some monitors , and cd rom. apple developed some
specifications for scsi controlers while ibm has no exact controller
specifications which results in added incompatibilities on ibm machines .
main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal
terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port
a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and at the
end. any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm .
scsi 1 7 devices per scsi controller. 8 bit asynchronous 1.5mb s ave
and synchronous 5mb s max transfer base. 16 bit scsi 1 requires a
scsi 2 controler chip and can provide only fast scsi 2 not wide scsi 2
which are both 16 bit interfaces see scsi 2 .
scsi 2 10 devices per scsi controller in scsi 2 mode. scsi 2 is fully
scsi 1 complient and tends to be implimented as a very fast scsi 1 since it
needs a different controller interface in both hardware which tends to be
very expendsive and software. transfer speeds are 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst
8 bit , 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit , and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst
32 bit wide and fast . scsi 2 in scsi 1 mode is limited to 7 devices and
reduced 8 bit or 16 bit fast only throughput due to the difference between
scsi 1 and wide scsi 2 ports.

ibm
hd interfaces limited to hard drives by design or lack of development
...
ide integrated device electronics
currently the most common standard , and is mainly used for medium sized
drives. can have more than one hard drive. asynchronous transfer 5mb s max.

so at its lowest setting scsi 2 interface in asynchronous scsi 1 mode averages
the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode. in full scsi 2 mode
it blows poor ide out the window , down the street , and into the garbage can.
the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi 2 comes from. not
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
scsi 2 through put. the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling
prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc , which
in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its
cost is unwarented , and so scsi is expencive. that is the effect of the
rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost

scsi 2 allows a drive mechanisims through put to be limited by the drive while
ide itself limits the through put.

i believe that any vl eisa isa motherboard that uses the hint chipset
is limited to 24 bit eisa dma (where 'real' eisa dma is 32 bit). the
hint eisa dma has the 16 mb ram addressing limitation of isa. for this
reason i would pass. i own one of these (hawk vl eisa isa) and am look
ing to replace it for exactly this reason.

please double check me on this. in other words , call the motherboard
manufacturer and ask them if the motherboard supports true 32 bit eisa
dma.

other than this limitation , the motherboard works quite well (i am using
mine with dos 5 , windows 3.1 , and unix s5r3.2). also with adaptec 1742a

this is no system disk , you can
1) replace disk with another ,

any way in particular \?

also , it 's using v.42bis and v.42 (and mnp5) when connecting

1) what is a 16550 uart \?

i do n't know the exact meaning of uart , but i think it is something like
universal arithmetic receiver transmitter. normally , the older boards have
a 8250 or 16450 uart on board. those chips generate an irq for every char
they received. the 16550 uart has an internal 16 byte buffer , so with the
right software installed it generates an irq every 16 chars.

2) what does it do for high speed modems \?
3) is it necessary for 14.4k or higher throughput \?

if you ran dos , you do n't need a 16550 , because dos runs only one task at a
time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer. but if you are
running a multitasking os such as os 2 , unix , etc. ( windows \? ) ) , the
cpu cannot work the whole time with one task.

the result are lost characters or broken transmissions because of timeouts.

4) is it only for internal modems \?

no. the only diffrence is that internal modems have the uart on board ,
whereas external modems are connected to the computer over a serial port
which has the uart on board.

if you have any experience with 9600 or higher speed modems , please
let me know what you think. also , any particular brand name reccomended ,
or will a cheapo clone do just a well \?

i use a zyxel1496b with a 16550uart under coherent 4.0. i'm very satisfied
with it but i think that nearly everyone is satisfied with his own modem.

well maybe if the scsi design people had their act together than maybe
all pc 's would have built in scsi ports by now.

in pc magazine april 27 , 1993 29 although scsi is twice as fasst as esdi ,
20 faster than ide , and support up to 7 devices its acceptance ...has
long been stalled by incompatability problems and installation headaches.
note what it does not site as a factor price.
int eh same article the pc would will get plug and play scsi from the
article it seems you get plug and play scsi 1 only since scsi 2 in full
implimentation has ten not 7 devices.
scsi 1 intergration is sited as another part of the microsoft plug and play
program.

hi !

i recently switched my 3.5 drive to a . the problem is , while i can read and
write to both the new a and b correctly , i ca n't boot from a floppy in a .
i 've checked the cmos settings it is set for floppy seek at boot and boot
order a , c .

once , i had a floppy that did not have the systems files on it in a . i got a
message telling me to put a disk systems disk in the drive. it did n't work.
when i do have a systems disk in the a drive , this is what happens
1) power on and memory test
2) a light comes on
3) b light comes on , followed by a short beep
4) hd light comes on for an instant
5) b light comes on again , then nothing happens

the light goes off , there is no disk activity of any kind , and the screen
blanks. i ca n't even use ctrl alt del.

any suggestions.

have you checked 1 the setting of drive a to 1.44 m floppy.
2 the setting of drive b to 1.2 m foppy.
3 the cable connecting the two drives to
the controller card (i ca n't remember which
two wires are swapped , but they determine
which is drive a b ).

i hope this is of some help )

ctx 15 proscan not as good as some other makes however , cheap.
main problem seems poor quality control. some reported pincushioning
(the problem i had) , others poor focus , etc , etc.

i complained about mine and it was 're tuned' (i dod n't even pay
shipping) and returned to me in 2 days.

it 's now clear , well focussed and has no pincushioning or barrel
distortion at all. i'm very happy with it , and the digital
controls and mode memory are nice. certainly , a trinitron
(say) would be much nicer , but that 's well out of my price range.

conclusion if you 're on a budget , get one and be prepared to
send it back if it 's not perfect. it probably wo n't be when you get it ,

we had the same issue plague us for months on our gateway. i finally
got tired of it so i permanently interchanged the drives. the only
reason i did n't do it in the first place was because i had several
bootable 5 1 4 's and some 5 1 4 based install disks which expected
the a drive. i order all new software (and upgrades) to be 3 1 2 and
the number of stupid install programs that ca n't handle an alternate
drive are declining with time the ones i had are now upgraded. and
as for the bootable 5 1 4 's i just cut 3 1 2 replacements.

if switching the drives is not an option , you might be able to wire up
a drive switch to your computer chasis. i have n't tried it but i think
it would work as long as it is wired carefully.

i did this. i use a relay (radio shack 4pdt) instead of a huge
switch. this way , if the relay breaks , my drives will still work.

it works fine , but you may still need to change the cmos before the
drive switch will work correctly for some programs.

what does a 200 400 meg 5 megs sec scsi drive cost \?
since the quadra is the only mac able to deal with 5mb s and hard drives start
at 160mb i have no idea.
for the mac i have the following these are all external
20mb 299 15 mb
52mb 379 7.3 mb
80mb 449 5.63 mb
120mb 569 639 4.75 5.33 mb

320mb 1499 1549 4.68 4.84 mb
510mb 1999 2119 ( 3.92 4.31 mb
etc

so scsi 1 scsi 2 for the mac goes down in price mb as hard drive size goes
up and i assume the same for the pc world.

i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good , well implimented
data highway , but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.
well scsi is also a floppy drive interface. in the mac since scsi is the
inteface for any non card , non modem , not keyboard device the id 7 is used
for the floppy drive called cpu in all identifiers. this allows cross
drive interfacing as fast as the os , program , cpu , scsi , and drive can handle
it this shows up best in the quatra line .
in the ibm that uses scsi for the floppy drive this should happen as well.
also scsi is not just drives but printers , scanners , expandsion cards
this showed up for the plus as the nubus 'cage' , cd rom , etc.
ide seems to be mainly hard drives. as for specs nobody has given me any
and i ca n't find any. besides the advertizments call ide the at interface
make of that what you will
scsi is a jack of all trades and ide is a master of one.
this alone puts scsi above ide. scsi 2 blows ide out of the water.
remember scsi was used in high priced machines until about 18 months ago
when the mac prices came down to earth so the rule of scale still played
and scsi remained high cost cheap seems to mean chezzy in the high end
computer world at times and this more than anything else proably kept scsi
off into the statosphere price wise
scsi came from the high end computer world with multitasking os were the
standard for the most part. of all the interface next could have used it
choose scsi. in 16 bit and 32 bit mode scsi is a multi tasking os desined
interface while ide and 8 bit scsi are braindead run one program interfaces
at least the way mac use 8 bit scsi.ugh

devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership , eg. disk
controller (i6) and keyboard (i1). there are also devices that
does not require exclusive ownership , ie. it will share an
interrupt with another device , eg. lpt1

no. in a standard isa bus , the one that almost all non laptop pcs use ,
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt. this is due to
a screwup in the bus design. for example , if your soundblaster wants
to drive interrupt number 7 , then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0
or 1 at all times , depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt.
this precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7.

when two or more devices in an isa bus pc share an interrupt , it 's
because they 're implemented by a single card.

i have a logitech 2s 2f (or 2f 2s) 2 button mouse that i want to
interface to a serial port of a different (non ibm compatible) system.
the mouse is xt at ps2 compatible , with a db25 connector. i tried
to reverse engineer the mouse , but it has a micro controller inside
it.

if i could get the db25 pin out , and perhaps a copy of the bios routines
that support it , i could map all this into my target system \?

anyone know where i might get the pin out or the bios routines \?
are the routines published someplace convenient \?

thanks !

i would like to hear the net.wisdom and net.opinions on ide controllers.
i would liek to get a ide controller card for my vlb dx2 66 motherboard.
what are good options for this (preferably under 200). it must also work
under os 2 and be compatible with stacker (and other disk compression s w).

i have a maxtor 212mb on an isa ide controller , although my machine is
dx2 66 vlb. i has the save transfer rate of 0.647 mb s regardless of
the variations of the isa bus speed. i tested it with speed between
5.5mhz and 8.33mhz. not any difference. the problem is not the
interface between the controller and the memory.

my advice buy 4megs of ram , save 70 and enjoy performance.

computer 286 25 mhz
bus isa (12.5 mhz)
drive maxtor 7213a (213 mb)

config.sys autoexec.bat

ms dos 5 no win 3.1
smartdrv.sys cache smartdrv.exe

core (v 2.7) 6950 k sec 1390 k sec 1395 k sec
norton si (v 5.0) 730 k sec 980 k sec 982 k sec

i 'd still like to here from people with vlb ide.
i still want to know what vlb bus speed is used with ide drives.
i still want to know if some (most \? ) ide drives can handle bus speeds 8 mhz.

ps a friend with a 286 20 and a new maxtor 7245 (245 meg ide) drive gets
between 800 1000 k sec (ca n't remember exactly). i think the bus is running
at 8 mhz in this case.

i never thought i 'd contribute to a gateway thread , either pro or con , but
my spleen could use a little venting. the scenario

1 ordered a dx2 50 w ultrastor 34f local bus hd controller
2 receive system 10 days after ordering (happy)
3 discover ultrastor 14f isa hd controller inside (unhappy)
4 call gateway , receive the correct controller in 5 days
(getting happier)
5 new controller does n't work (unhappy again)
6 call gateway again , get another controller in 5 more days
(cooling off , the end is in sight)
7 this controller does n't work either , motherboard is bad
(very unhappy)

gateway 's solution they will order me a new motherboard (5 more days)
and have on site service install it for me.
but , i have to take a day off of work because the service people
only work 9 5 m f. i say , no way i 've already blown about 20 hours
with this , about 10 of them on hold and i do n't have the time or
to take a day off work. also , my 30 day return period is almost over and
i 've only been able to use the thin for about 10 minutes. so , the whole
thing is going back.
i was extremely upset when i began this post because the support rep told me
that i would have to pay shipping not only for the returned system , but also
the two hard drive controllers they had sent me. fortunately , i just spoke
to customer service and they are going to have ups come and pick everything
up gratis. the only downside is that now i have to order another computer.

i would really like to try gateway again , i'm just very turned off by the
prospect of having to try and get through to customer service or tech support
again... i think their products are great for the most part , but i'm
beginning to wonder if the savings are worth the potential aggravation.
are other mail order companies as difficult to contact \? i know gateway is
booming , and for good reason , but i do n't know if i can take it again.
oh well , i feel better now...

i am just about to post the results of my big computer purchase. one

read the fine print between double warranty policies of amex and citibank

has a maximum claim of 250.00. could you imagine trying to get your

remember , if you use amex , you must either send a copy of the warranty info
to them in 30 days from purchase , or you must call them to pre register and
then send them the paperwork within 90 days of purchase (my pre register
pak arrived today). citibank visa requires no pre registration.

i just talked to a rep for my at t mastercard regarding this there is no
maximum claim , and you only have to notify them of the warranty when the
item needs repair. if it ca n't be repaired , you get the amount you paid
for it.
curiously though , the at t gold mastercard has a limit of 1000 on claims.
definitely not upgrading to that card... )

for those of you who might be familiar with insight distribution
network , inc. and their multimedia kits

i'm seriously considering buying the insight talon ta 2000 mm kit , which
is bundled with the cd rom drive with 265 280ms access time , 300kb dtr ,
multispin , multi session photo cd capability , etc. , and with the pas 16
sound card , etc.... (if you are familiar with insight , you know the kit
i mean). i believe the drive is either a texel (265ms) or an nec
(280ms) , but it is not clear to me which one is actually a part of the
bundle (at least two of their sales people could n't give me a straight
answer as to which one ah , yes , one of the drawbacks of oem ! ).

other questions

excuse my ignorance , but is texel a reputable maker in the cd rom
market \? or do you think nec is the better drive \?

bottom line is this kit worth the money \? (currently , 449 for the
ta 1000 , and 699 for the ta 2000)

alternatively , i was thinking that the ta 2000 might be overkill for my
uses (however , i do want full multimedia capabilities , photo cd stuff ,
educational programs for my kids , etc.) , and considered the lower end
ta 1000 kit and using the difference (around 250.00) to get something
else useful , like a tape back up drive unit.

basically , i would just like to hear from those who have actually used
these kits , and whatever pros cons you might advise , preferably
directly to the email address below.

thanks ,

scsi find it faster \? can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster \? does it have a better cache system \? i thought scsi was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached. if we are
only talking about a single drive , explain why scsi is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive.

ide integrated device electronics
currently the most common standard , and is mainly used for medium sized
drives. can have more than one hard drive. asynchronous transfer 5mb s max.

why do n't you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first \?
you can quote scsi specs till you 're blue in the face , but if they
exceed the isa bus capability , then what 's the point \?

who said isa was necessary \? eisa or vlb are the only interfaces worth
investing thousands of dollars (e.g. a new pc 's worth of money ) in .

who says ide is limited to 5 megs sec \? what about vlb ide \? does anyone
know how they perform \?

you did n't read to carefully. vlb ide uses the same connection mechanism
as standard ide. if transfer rate is limited by ide , whether it 's
interfaced to isa , eisa or vlb matters not.

so at its lowest setting scsi 2 interface in asynchronous scsi 1 mode averages
the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode. in full scsi 2 mode
it blows poor ide out the window , down the street , and into the garbage can.
as implimented on what system \?

on mine , for one thing. scsi blows ide out of the water , hands down. if
ide has better throughput , why is n't it used on workstations and file
servers \?

the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi 2 comes from. not
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
scsi 2 through put.

given the original question (scsi used only as a single hard drive
controller) , is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do
at least 5 , maybe 10 megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence \?
what does a 200 400 meg 5 megs sec scsi drive cost \?

no , that 's the nice thing on a multitasking os , scsi can use both drives
at once. i 've got unix loaded on one of my pcs (along with windogs) and the os can only use one of the two ide drives at one time. it 's pretty ugly.

i just bought at quantum 240 for my mac at home. i paid 369 for it. i
have n't seen ide drives cheaper.

the original cga cart back in '84 was 300. i think the original ega card
(or pga \? ) was 800. scsi has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price , mainly because we 're talking about pc 's and not sun 's or sparc
or sgi or (name your favorite unix workstation). that is , after millions
of pc buying decisions over the years , scsi has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

no , actually , we 're talking about scsi being expensive simply because
nobody did a common interface for the pc. if they had a common (read
easily implemented) method of adding scsi to a pc (like as in a sun or
mac) , then you 'd find scsi the connection medium of choice.

i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good , well implimented
data highway , but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.

on a single drive , scsi is more expensive. but , you bought your pc for
expandibility , so , you 'd want to add more drives or whatever. the
following are why i find scsi intrinsically better than ide

a (partial \? ) list
1. you can add many different types of devices and access them
concurrently.
2. a scsi device works on many different machines (i have a mac
and a pc at home and moving hard drives between them is very nice
with scsi hook them up and away they go)
3. scsi devices work together better than ide devices. for
instance , recently , i added an older connor 100 meg ide to a maxtor
212 meg ide. the connor must be setup as the slave. it will
work no other way. on scsi , you set the address , check the
termination , plug it in , and away it goes.
4. i have a problem with ide 's mutual exclusion i notice that
the time it takes to switch from accessing drive c to drive d is
quite long as compared to the time it takes to switch from drive c
to d on a scsi system. under a multitasking os , this is very
noticable , as many things can be going on at once.

one neat thing that i 've noticed lately (a fringe benefit) has been the
ability to add older (almost dead) drives as storage on a scsi system with
little problem we 've got a bunch of almost dead 20 meg drives that i 've
added to my pc. i 've now got the interface full , but , it does allow me to
have 4 20 meg drives , 1 240 meg drive , 1 tape drive , and 1 105 meg drive
all on the same card.

simply put , scsi is handier than ide. no mysterious jumpers to figure out.

to check for bad memory chips

1. create a boot disk with emm386 himem.sys and ramdrive.sys in the
config autoexec.bat.

2. boot the pc to create a ram drive as large as possible.

3. use a disk repair utility ( i use ndd ). run it on the ram
drive , yes it will run , its only a device driver

4. run 1000 or so passes , they go very quick

5. if your machine fails , there is a definate bad memory chip

6. if your machine passes , there is a conflict with programs you
are loading in memory.
...

it 's an interesting idea , but the worst case data patterns developed to
test magnetic media are totally different than the patterns used to detect
common faults in memory chips.

hi fellow netters ,

i have a question for you... i am gonna buy a 486dx2 66 mhz
with vesa local bus. is the speed benefit that great \?
would it be wise to spend on a local bus system (hd controller
and graphic card) for normal use ( i mean i wo n't use it for a
server ! ! ) \?

also , i read an article from someone ( sorry , i ca n't remember your
name ) and he said that even though you have a local bus hard disk
controller , your performances wo n't be that much greater because
of the disk 's throughtput ! ! !
so what is the use of having a fast bus if the peripherals ca n't
cope with it \? \? \?

something to bear in mind is what the v in vlb stands for !

v for video the origional intention of the bus was to speed up
the bus so that large memory to memory transfers would be faster.
this is espically useful in transfering data from main memory to
video memory.

since there are usually 3 vlb slots card makers have been making
cards to fit in the other two.

how about an vlb ethernet card \? move the data into the card at
130 odd mb s and then wait for it to tickle onto the net at
just over 1mb s.

do do however free the local bus for other cards

some times you need fast busses and sometimes you do n't !

a friend of mine just got a maxtor 245 meg ide drive for 320. (that 's 245
million bytes , or 234 mega bytes). with the basic 20 interface , he gets
close to 1 meg sec transfer on his 286 20. does your figure include a few
hundred for scsi drivers \?
since the mac uses only scsi 1 for hard drives yes the figure includes a
hundred for scsi drivers this is sloppy people and dumb.

but on that point , is it faster \? this is what all this is about. do you
get more performance for the money.
ok once again with the scsi spec list
scsi 1 with a scsi 1 controler chip synchronous range is indeed 0 5mb s
asynchronous range is slower at 0 3mb s.
scsi 1 with a scsi 2 controller chip 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit
note the increase in speed , the mac quadra uses this version of scsi 1
so it does exist. some pcs use this set up too.

scsi 2 8 bit scsi 1 mode 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst
for those who want scsi 2 but do n't want to pay for the 16 bit or 32 bit
hardware or mess with the scsi 2 software controllers. usable by scsi 1
devices with close to 8 bit scsi 2 speeds
scsi 2 16 bit wide or fast mode 8 12mb s with 20mb s burst
scsi 2 32 bit wide and fast 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst

on the other interfaces let dxb132@psuvm.psu.edu speak
ide ranges from 0 8.3mb s.
again synchronous and asynchronous modes with asynchronous much slower
range 0 5mb s
esdi is always 1.25mb s (although there are some non standard versions)

one problem is the inconsitant use of the term 'scsi' in articles and by
people. its proper meaning is the set of scsi interfaces composed of
scsi 1 and scsi 2
look at the inconsitant use of scsi in the below quote
(my comments in )

pc magazine april 27 , 1993 29 although scsi is twice as fast as esdi ,
this is asynchronous scsi 1 with a scsi 1 chip 20 faster than ide...
this is both asynchronous scsi 1 with a scsi 2 chip and 8 bit scsi 2
to read consitantly the quote should read
asynchronous scsi 1 with a scsi 1 chip
although asynchronous scsi 1 is twice as fast as esdi , one third the
speed of ide...
or asynchronous scsi 1 with a scsi 2 chip or 8 bit scsi 2
although scsi 1 with a scsi 2 chip and 8 bit scsi 2 are eight times as fast as
esdi , 20 faster than ide...

note the nonuse of 'scsi' by itself. this eliminates ambaguity.

scsi 1 drivers are somewhat reasonable while 16 bit and 32 bit scsi 2 drivers
are very expansive 8 bit scsi 2 can use scsi 1 drivers with little speed
degridation(the mac quadra does exactly this.)

if we are to continue this thread state clearly which scsi you are talking
about scsi 1 or scsi 2 or scsi over all scsi 1 and scsi 2
it does make a difference.

first , then i get about 2 3 screens of garbage. in both cases the

i am using default settings (at f) and getting this problem. i
am using the autoconfigure settings that gateway has supplied with
my copy of qmodem (atw1 c1 d2s95 44 w0) and getting this problem.
(they have refused to help me beyond this , claiming it must be

hai ,

in a few days i'm going to buy a new motherboard with local bus(ses).
it comes with a cirrus logic vlb card which has 2mb ram onboard.
it can do true color but i do n't know what type of card it is.
i read that cirrus logic cards are n't exactly the fastes around.

my old system had a tseng 4000. i was pretty pleased with it , so i
consider buying a w32 tseng card. i 'd like to know a few things

how is the speed performance in dos windows unix os 2
graphics text (also compared to s3 cards for example)
what resolutions (including no. of colors) does it
support (text graphics)
how many ram can be installed and what type of ram
compatibility with old tseng 4000
support in software

if anyone has any experience with this card (good or bad) i 'd like
to know. if you have a better alternative than the w32 please tell
me about it.


for the people in holland
kan iemand me misschien vertellen waar de w32 in nederland te verkrijg
is \? het liefst in de omgeving van amsterdam !


thanks in advance , erik stel (estel@cs.vu.nl)

i have a 486sx25 computer with a 105 mg seagate ide drive and a controler
built into the motherboard. i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum prodrive
425f 425 mg formatted). i have no documentation at all and i need your
help !

as i understand it , here is the process of adding such a drive. could you
please tell me if i'm right..

1 buy a scsi contoler. which one \? i know adaptec is good , but they are
kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the 100 region \? i want
it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also , i have seen on
the net that there are scsi and scsi2 drives. is this true \? does the
adapter need to be the same as the drive \? what type of drive is the
quantum \?

2 connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable.
do i have to worry about the power supply \? i think i have 200 watts and
all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive.

3 setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive. what type
of drive is this \? i do n't have the numbers for this drive.

4 format and create partitions on the drive. do i use format or fdisk \? i
think that ide drives ca n't be low level formatted. is it the same with
scsi \? how exactly does fdisk work \? i have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual
(clone obliges) and there is no mention of fdisk. ideally , i would want
the drive partitioned in to two partitions d and e how do i do this \?

well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting \?
any help is really appreciated , i'm lost...

heck , if ide used dma , then you 'd hear all kinds of complaints about
isa bus systems with more than 16m ram not working with their ide
drives. 16m is the dma addressing limit of the isa bus , and if ide
did dma there would be trouble.

there would be no problems as long as the os did n't set up a dma transfer
to an area above the 16 mb area (the dma controller probably ca n't be
programmed that way anyways , so there probably isi n't a problem with this)

besides , like i said before , the fdd controller uses dma channel 2.
and i do n't yet believe that the hdd controllers (any of them , mfm , rll ,
etc) do n't also use dma.

acifuent@isluga.puc.cl

these questions can be answered by any dealer of ibm value points , but , i will
provide some unsolicited advice the most amusing kind of advice.

today (tueday 4 6 93) ibm is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the vesa local bus value point systems. these systems still have on board
video and disk which are far better than the prior value point systems , and
you get vesa local bus for (future \? ) upgrades. we are going to buy three of
them with 17 monitors (also a newly available) , and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to ultrastor 34f caching scsi disk controller and
either the ati gup or the viper graphics board.

do not buy a 486sx sytem.

my personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss free. when
you earn money you pay taxes , when you spend money you pay taxes. (i.e. they
get you coming and going). translated this means take infrequent but large
steps. you are far better off short term and long term if you avoid the sx
models and go straight to the dx or dx 2 models.

to sum up , when an accelerated board with 4mb vram (true colour 1280x1024)
and a fast vga side is available under 500 , i will buy one.

me too !

what 's funny is , when we really can buy such a product , it probably wo n't
seem as mouth watering as it does today. what \? no holograms \? get outta
here !

i can wait 'cos i 've already got an accelerated card. it does 1280x1024 but
only 16 colour. you may mock me , but such cards will be here quickly enough.

one of the odd things about the computer industry is that , since you can
always wait and get something better , some people wait forever. i know
people who have deferred updating their original ibm pc for a decade ,
because every time they look at what 's available , they see something better
coming down the road. i know people who 've dumped their pcs into the
garage , but have n't replaced them , because they 're afraid it is n't the
right time to buy. they just gave up using computers.

i only wait when the difference between my current system and the new stuff
is big enough to warrant changing. for instance , i 'll be upgrading my 486 33
to a 486dx 2 66 eisa , vlb board rsn. the performance difference (under linux)
is great enough to be worthwhile. at the same time i 'll be buying a new
graphic card and new scsi controller. i 'll be buying an s3 card 'cos they 're
fast enough , i have x11 drivers for them and it 'll have 2mb vram just like
a weitek 9000 card. it will also be much cheaper. when affordable 4mb cards
arrive , i 'll buy one.

personally , my system at home needs a new disk subsystem , a much
larger monitor , a super fast graphics board by you know who , a new
cpu board i probably wo n't keep much more than the case and the
mouse. come to think of it , i do n't like that mouse very much. so
when will i buy \? when my dream products hit the market \? no way ! i'm
gonna buy as soon as i have the money !

over the last year i 've done much the same. but now i need a 19 monitor , more
memory (20mb just ai n't enough) , a gb disk (1.2gb and no space left...). oh
well , stay single , do n't smoke and you may afford it this year )

another (albeit strange) option is using a program like 800 ii

(also available via anonymous ftp) , that allows you to format
5.25hd disks to 1.44meg , or 3.5 hd disks to 1.2meg (along with

also make the weird format disks , provided you have 800 ii

i would doubt that you would be able to use the hard drive. xt drives
usually came in mfm or rll flavors. i bet your 386sx has ide drives. the
two are not compatible on the same controller. however , you might be
able to use the drive with its controller in your 386sx. you should be
able to plug your 360k drive into your existing 386sx controller (i
think). you might have to use the floppy controller that was used in the
xt.

there is a simple answer. if my memory serves me the scsi bios will only
work as the first or second drive. any built in drives e.g. ide are
installed first and then when the scsi bios runs it will try to install
as the next drive. but if there are already two drives , then no can do.

the solution is simple use the aspi4dos device driver and disable the
scsi bios (as it is useless in your case). it works like a champ ! i
have seen a similar situation before.

good luck

subject orchid p9000 vs fahrenheit (mini review)
organization adobe systems incorporated
x newsreader tin version 1.1 pl9
lines 79


i just purchased a viewsonic 17 and and orchid p9000. in short , i am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card. i have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card , so that is what i am going to write about. the monitor
is pretty. the moires i had under simcity on my 17 magnavox went away. it
is n't as heavy as i thought it would be (45 lbs , i think). so much for the
monitor. on to the bitch session and test results.

in going with the modern trend , the orchid p9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver. of course , this breaks any dos program
which uses svga modes (like most of my cd roms). the compudyne whiplash vga ,
orchid fahrenheit 1280 , and orchid f. vlb all share this limitation. those
are all s3 cards , which means it is an s3 problem for them (the p9000 uses
a weitek vga chip which also does n't support them). the hercules graphite
card does seem to have these modes , but i did n't run the same test cases as
i did on the other boards during the brief time i had it. it was able to
print the splash screen for the grolier 's encyclopedia , though , which the s3
cards just printed as hash , which is why i suspect the svga modes are supported.

the supported resolutions really annoy me. you can do 1280x1024 at 75hz if
you tell the driver you have an nec 5fg (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'generic' , and if you choose generic you ca n't get any high
refreshes at all). but at 1024x768 you are limited to 70hz. seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024 ! ). higher vertical resolution
was the main reason i bought the card over the orchid f. vlb i currently have ,
and it will do 1024x768x70 hz as well.

the higher graphics modes all crash hp dashboard. i just got off the phone
with orchid , and with the 1.1 drivers (i do n't know what i have) he was unable
to recreate the problem. on the plus side , their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he did n't have
the problem. he did n't know why they limited the refresh to 70 hz either.

the board is faster that the ofvlb for most things according to the hercules
speedy program. this program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels second. i do n't have the numbers for the graphite card , but they
were close to half of the ofvlb (ie , slower) but that was running in a 20mhz
386 , isa , so the numbers are n't really comparable. the following numbers
were all obtained using a 486 , 33 mhz , air motherboard (umc chipset) , with
8 mb memory. i give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them , and these tend to jump around a bit.


k means thousand (not 1024) , m means million , pixels per second

orchid fahrenheit vlb orchid p9000
chip s3 805 weitek 9000
dib to screen 182k 190k 228k 240k
memory to screen 5.9m 6.2m 8.4m 8.9m
screen to screen 14m 14.8m 29m 30.8m
vector , solid 2.4m 2.8m 2.9m
vector , styled 55k 58k 449k 473k
polygon , shaded 1.8m 2.1m 1.6m 1.9m
polygon , hatched 6.9m 7.9m 1.3m 1.7m
ternary rops 1.9m 2.4m 477k 520k
font 130k 160k 46k 55k 1.2m

the dib to screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen. i have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go. the memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen , my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display. the screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen. awesome ! interestingly , the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement , and hatched polygons (ie ,
filled with cross hatching) and ternary rops (whatever they are. graphics
operations like xors maybe \? \? \? \? ) are a dead loss on the 9000. i give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts , because i think they are caching.
when the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly
1 3 the speed of the ofvlb. then the speed increases dramatically. sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

i make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all. its just what
i saw when i ran them on my computer. i normally do n't write disclaimers ,
but this time maybe i 'd better. my testing is totally unconnected with my
work (i program under unix on decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge , blessing , or equipment of my company.

a hard drive with xt type controller can be added , but i recommend not trying
a
full height 5 1 4 hard drive , as i have run into trouble with the 63.5w
supply not having the oomph to spool up those big heavy platters.

one way to get the system going with one floppy drive and one hard
disk on a 63 watt power supply is to first disconnect the power from
the floppy drive than turn on the pc , you will notice the hard drive
having a real difficult time getting up to speed , but it manages.
when booting is finished , plug in your floppy drive , now it will work.

(ok i know this is not very user friendly , maybe you are better off
buying a 486 66 with 300 watt power supply or something like that)

willem

the newer the drive , the less problem you will have. the old ten and fifteen
meg full heights were power hogs , but i have over twenty units that i set up
running flawlessly with half height drives and or hard cards.

item \? are there utilites to determine whether or not the hard drive is properly
aligned etc \? as might be expected , i would greatly appreciate any help on this

also , can someone give me an opinion on dos 6.0 \? are the compression and

when i changed my motherboard i had a lot of trouble getting

reconnected. for example turbo switch had three wires and
the motherboard connection only two pins... and so on.

does anyone know a solution to this. do i need to rewire the
connectors or what is the best way to approach this.
it is somewhat frustrating. i got it to work somehow but my turbo
switch does n't work at all.


i just put replaced the motherboard in a system and had similar questions.
my 2 cents worth

the speaker connector should have two wires going to the speaker.
a speaker being a coil , it 's bidirectional and makes no difference
which way you attach.

turbo switch. there are three wires to control how you want turbo
to become active with the switch pushed in or the switch out. i think
the middle wire is common. use an ohm meter to figure out which wire
connects with the common wire when the switch is pushed in , and which two
wires are connected when the switch is out. place the appropriate
two wires on the turbo berg connector of the motherboard.

led 's (turbo and hd) led 's are uni directional. depending which
way the wires are attached the led will not light. on my ami motherboard ,
if the turbo switch wires are not attached to the berg connector on the
board , the board will power up in default in turbo mode. if your motherboard
is like that... just attace the led wires to the board. if the led does n't
light , power off , reverse the connectors and try again. it should work.

if it does , then attach the turbo switch to the board.

hope this helps.

i believe that any vl eisa isa motherboard that uses the hint chipset

please double check me on this. in other words , call the motherboard

other than this limitation , the motherboard works quite well (i am using

until i upgraded by cd rom drive from a sony cdu 541 to a sony cdu 641. i now
find that the audio mode will not work. i assume it is not being handled
correctly by the asw 410 driver.

so , should i chase adaptec for an upgrade \? if so does anyone know their

richard randall ez033672@hamlet.ucdavis.edu

there is a way in which a multi tasking computer actually gives you
more cpu power then you had before , and that is with i o overlap.
with i o overlap , your cpu can continue to think while disk
operations are underway , whereas without overlap , your cpu sits idly
waiting for each disk operation to finish and disk operations take
an eternity , compared to a fast cpu.

so , when you 've got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by
increasing the amount of overlapping you do.

one way is with dma or bus mastering. either of these make it
possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory
without interrupting the cpu. the alternative is for the cpu to move
the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and
bus mastering. ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface
created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data
bytes , with no dma.

i recently bought a used seagate st 251 hard drive. the guy told me that
it had been fully tested and that it was good. i took it home to install
in my compaq portable (ok , i'm a little behind in technology). i already
had an mfm controller.

i installed the drive and powered up the system. i got a post error , 1701 .

my controller is a western digital wd1002s wx2 rev. c.
as i said above , the drive is a seagate st 251.
the system is a compaq portable (circa 1985).

ah , finally a question i can answer. i mess with this older
stuff alot. kinda fun. 8)

first problem i can forsee is that the st 251 will not be
compadible with that wd card unless it has the right bios rom.

check the numbers on it. it should be the only non smt chip on
the board. slightly below center , and left. the bios should read
either 62 000042 015 or
62 000094 0x2

if the last 3 digits are 013 , you got problems.


controller jumpers are set as follows ( represents jumper)
w1 1 2 3
w2 1 2 3
w3 1 2
w4 1 2 3
w5 1 2 3
w6 1 2 3
w7 1 2 3

looks right. w5 and w7 are factory jumped (with a trace) between
pins 1 and 2 to select the primary controller address.

the drive jumpers are as follows ( 8 represents jumper)

looks right.

art deleted

here are my questions

1.) are the drive and controller compatible w each other \?

i notice you left out the s1 jumper table settings. those are
what control what drive the controller thinks it has. if you have
the 62 000042 015 rom , set it like this

5 open
6 open
7 open
8 open
4 closed
3 closed
2 open
1 open

note those are how wd runs the numbers on the jumper block.
top to bottom. 's represent the jumper pins. pins 3 , 4 , and 8
select the first drive setting (drive 0) and pins 1 , 2 and 7 select the
second drive (drive 1).

if you have the 62 000094 rom , it 's a auto config , and i 'll have
to look up how to do it... i do n't have the big book right here.

2.) are the jumpers on the card drive set correctly \?

see above. you might have problems if the s1 jumpers are not
right. also , at the risk of being insulting , make sure the cables
are on right and good. 8). on the jumper on the 251 , try moving it
to the opposite side of the drive. it 's one or the other.
the narrow data cable goes to j2. i 've thrown it on j3 a few
times and banged my head for a day.....

3.) is my system 's bios in need of an upgrade \?

dunno. ibm roms had to be later than 10 27 82. a quick way
to check is to boot dos and run debug. enter

d f000 fff5 fffc (the is the debug prompt)

this will return the rom date , if it 's of any use.

if i oversimplified any of the above , i appologize. it 's
just hard to know what caliber of person i'm talking to. 8).

if you are using a twisted 34 way cable then move the jumper
on your drive to the neighbouring pins 8 . make sure that
the twisted cable is for a hard disk (and not a floppy disk) the
coloured stripe (pin 1) should be furthest from the twist.

note 2 tandy 1000 systems the wd1002a wx1 , wd1004a wx1 ,
wdxt gen2 and the wd1004 27x can be modified to operate in
tandy 1000 series computers , models sx , tx and the original or
a version. these computers utilize an interrupt of 2 (irq2)
instead of irq5 , the ibm standard. to modify the wd1002a wx1 or
the wd1002 27x to operate in these systems , you must cut the
etch between pin 1 and pin 2 at jumper position w 7. then
solder pin 2 and pin 3 at the position (w 7). to complete the
modification , a jumper must be added to position 7 of switch s 1
(2 rows of 8 pins). please note that any physical modification
to your western digital hard disk controller voids the warranty
on your board. to modify the wd1004a wx1 , wdxt gen2 or the
wd1004 27x for your tandy 1000 system , a zero ohm resister must
be soldered to jumper position w 27. this will change the
interrupt from irq5 to irq2.

with a sound card on interrupt 5 , two serial ports (one for modem on i4 ,

in article 1qk7kvinnndk@dns1.nmsu.edu bgrubb@dante.nmsu.edu (grubb) writes
point of view , why does scsi have an advantage when it comes to multi
tasking \? data is data , and it could be anywhere on the drive. can
scsi find it faster \? can it get it off the drive and into the computer
faster \? does it have a better cache system \? i thought scsi was good at
managing a data bus when multiple devices are attached. if we are
only talking about a single drive , explain why scsi is inherently
faster at managing data from a hard drive.

ide integrated device electronics
currently the most common standard , and is mainly used for medium sized
drives. can have more than one hard drive. asynchronous transfer 5mb s max.

why do n't you start with the spec sheet of the isa bus first \?
you can quote scsi specs till you 're blue in the face , but if they
exceed the isa bus capability , then what 's the point \?

who says ide is limited to 5 megs sec \? what about vlb ide \? does anyone
know how they perform \?

so at its lowest setting scsi 2 interface in asynchronous scsi 1 mode averages
the through put maximum of ide in asynchronous mode. in full scsi 2 mode
it blows poor ide out the window , down the street , and into the garbage can.

as implimented on what system \?

the problem becomes can the drive mechanisim keep up with those through put
rates and that is where the bottleneck and cost of scsi 2 comes from. not
the interface itself but more and more from drive mechanisims to use the
scsi 2 through put.

given the original question (scsi used only as a single hard drive
controller) , is it then necessary to get a scsi drive that will do
at least 5 , maybe 10 megs sec for the scsi choice to make any sence \?
what does a 200 400 meg 5 megs sec scsi drive cost \?

the cost of scsi interface is a self fulliling
prophisy few people buy scsi because it is so expencive for the pc , which
in turn convices makes that mass producing scsi which would reduce its
cost is unwarented , and so scsi is expencive. that is the effect of the
rule of scale the more items sold the less each item has to bare the brunt
the cost of manufacture and so the less each item has to cost

the original cga cart back in '84 was 300. i think the original ega card
(or pga \? ) was 800. scsi has stood relatively alone in not coming down
in price , mainly because we 're talking about pc 's and not sun 's or sparc
or sgi or (name your favorite unix workstation). that is , after millions
of pc buying decisions over the years , scsi has had plenty of time to
come down in price.

i wo n't argue that the scsi standard makes for a good , well implimented
data highway , but i still want to know why it intrinsically better
(than ide , on an isa bus) when it comes to multi tasking os 's when
managing data from a single scsi hard drive.

i would like to get two vesa local bus. one for video , not sure
what am i going to do with the other.
it must be able to run unix.

what are other questions that i should ask to ensure getting a
quality stuff \? what are other important features \?


monitor
i want a 14 non interlaced svga , but not sure about what brand
to get. i ca n't afford nec or sony. what brands should i consider \?
acer \? touch \?

what else should i ask \?

video card
i would like to run framemaker. so i need a fast video card. is western

given the choise of desktop and minitower , which one is better \?
what is the adequate power supply \?
is cooling a general problem or a non issue \?

1) is there a 486 motherboard at this dimension that i could use the case \?
2) the original owener has the controller for floppy drive and hard disk
removed. can i use them to control these devices under 486 \? how much do i
have to pay for a new controllers if the old ones wo n't work \?
3) how can i make syquest (scsi) and cd rom (scsi) work on this station \?
i heard that there is a cheap sound board that has scsi controller built in \?
what 's quality of this board \? how much usually does a scsi control cost \?
is there any ftp sites that has syquest driver or cd rom driver for the pc if
i can have everything hooked up ok \? 4) what i want is a 486 motherboard , a sound board to make it a mpc
quality station. how much would it cost to do that \? is it worth the hussle
than just buy a new 486 station \? btw , i need to buy a keyboard for it too.

any input is welcome.

thank you.

b( i am interested in getting the pulse of this group regarding
b( extended operation of my g2k 486 33v with the cover removed
b( from the enclosure. there are a of reasons i am considering
b( this , including quick access to jumpers during complex i o card
b( setups.

b( my concern is that without a complete enclosure to direct the
b( cooling flow of air from the fan , hot spots may develop on my
b( motherboard or elsewhere.

if you have an adequate supply of air moving over the system (most
offices or homes have positive ventilation) you can generally run a
system without the cover for extended periods without a problem. (i'm
talking about completely removing the cover not just leaving the slots
uncovered.) however , the biggest reason you have a cover to begin with
is rf sheilding. operating a system without the full cover may create
problems with other equipment such as your neighbor 's tv or ham radio
station very much a no no in the eyes of the law.

stable or not \? please give me some advice.

in addition , i heard a news from local distributor that a new

year. after replaced the old rom by this 28800 rom , this spirit ii can
transfer data at 28800baud without any hardware alternation. is this
new true and possible \? would the telephone line really able to transfer
at such high speed \? please give me some advice.

at last , can anyone tell me how to contact with the central

(the card is revision 5a)

my detective work has shown that this jumper simply
connects disconnects the bale line on the 64 pin part
of the isa bus.

the question i have is simple
to those people who own this revision of the speedstar 24x ,
what does the manual claim that this jumper does \?

to anyone with an isa reference , what is the function of the
bale line \?

on a related note
are there any ftp sites which contain a descriptive reference to
the isa bus \? my motherboard manual has a simple pin to signal name
chart , but that is it.

i'm kind of new at the pc stuff. my machine has 4 serial ports. com 1 and3

no , but some os 's ( coherent , etc ) are able to drive one of the ports in
polled mode without using the irq. in your example , after accessing the
modem , the mouse wo n't work until you reboot , because the irq is used by
the modem.

if answer is no , should i change irq 's for com ports to be different \? and ,
does it really matter which irq i set the ports too \?

yes , you can change the irq 's for com3 4 , but it depends on your other
hardware. com1 uses irq4 , com2 irq3. if you have only one printerport
( irq7 ) , you can change com3 to irq5 ( normally 2nd printer ). for com4 ,
you can assign irq2 , if its free. as far as i know , no other irq can be
used until your i o card is 16bit and caould access irq 's 8.

organization strategic software , redford , michigan

i need some help with a multi port serial board of unknown origin. i'm
hoping someone knows what this board is , or , even better , what the various
switches and jumbers are used for.

anyway , here 's description of the card it is a 16 bit card , although
i noticed that none of the contacts in the 16 bit extension are connected
to anything. it has 4 ns16550an chips in sockets , and 4 corresponding
connecters labeled com1 com4. there is also an external female connector
with 37 pins. there are 8 banks of 8 switches , 2 banks of 4 switches , and
7 jumpers. i believe that i have determined , by following traces , that
sw5 and sw6 (12 switches in all) control the interrupt level for each of
the com ports. sw5 1 4 are for irq3 , sw5 5 8 are for irq4 , and sw6 1 4
are for irq5. the other switches are beyond my meager ability to follow.

the only identification printed on the board is multi serial port board
across the bottom. there is a box for serial number , but it is blank.
immediately below the words serial no , but not in the box left for
the s n , are the numbers 1990 2 8 .

anyone have any clues \? your help is greatly appreciated.

anonymous ,

i saw a posting about the choice between 80486dx 50 and a 80486dx2 50.
i was wondering although a dx 50 is faster because of the path to it 's
external cache , should n't the choice be the dx2 50 as that one can be
made to work properly with a local bus \? i mean , cache speed is one thing ,
but all your speed will be blocked during video i o , so just get that
faster...
i'm willing to speculate that the dx2 50 with local bus will be 2 4 times
as fast as the dx 50 and probably as expensive (or cheap ) !

technically there is no reason why a chip set cannot support a 486dx50 and
a 25mhz local bus.

i'm waiting for the mezzianine (sp \? ) vl bus that will be decoupled from
the main cpu clock and allow for many more slots due to the user of buffers.

this will allow the use of ever faster cpus with the same standard i o
cards. until the next buss spec...

hi ,

i have a few enquiries about pc 's and compatibles in general.. some software
others hardware orientated.. (probably the wrong newsgroup .... as everyone
claims..)

anyway..

1) does any one happen to have the board jumper details for a trident 8900
svga graphics card (1mb) or even what the dip switches do on the end.. mine
already works fine (albeit slow) and after having blown up a monitor i found
out which switch controlled the interlace non interlace facility..

but i'm curious as to why there are 8 dip switches on the card with apparantly
little use..

2) secondly , does anyone know why commodore had to be so crazed in their design
of the pc 40 motherboard with respect to the ram.. (ie 512 512 or 640 0k) \? \?

3) can anyone supply pin details for the expansion ports for a pc (8 or 16 bit
) .. or even a sample circuit to cause an irq when a button is pressed...
(yeah i know its a piece of cake.. i'm lazy 8)

4) software wise.. anyone care to divulge some tips on accessing expanded ram
on a pc (from a program written in turbo c )....

for instance , using farcoreleft() and coreleft() return only memory available
from the base 640k regardless of combinations of emm386 etc etc...
what i want is to be able to use the ram above and beyond the 1mb boundary...

i'm not certain whether farmalloc new actually uses it anyway but i 'll
suspect not ..

5) also.. what half brained wit created dos so as not to be re entrant \? \? \? \? \? \?
as a follow on , does anyone have any comments about the use of dos calls
0 to 0c from within a dos interrupt \? ie will changing the stack size on
entry be of use.. two articles i 've read on the subject have given
conflicting views... does anyone have any views on writing direct to
screen memory in terms of portability \?

many thanks..
gotta go , bars closing soon 8)
cheers

i almost got a hernia laughing at this one.
if anything , scsi (on a pc) will be obsolete killed off by vesa local
bus ide. it must be real nice to get shafted by 20 100 bucks for the
extra cost of a scsi drive , then pay another 200 300 for a scsi controller.

first off , with all these huge software packages and files that
they produce , ide may no longer be sufficient for me (510 mb limit).
second , (rumor is) microsoft recognizes the the importance of scsi
and will support it soon. i'm just not sure if it 's on dos , win , or nt.
at any rate , the deal is with corel who makes (i hear) a good
cohesive set of scsi drivers.
