this was no move fuck up. a was thermal imaging the compound 
that afternoon and detected three fires erupting almost simultaneously .  . 

did anyone notice any helicopters equipped with thermal imaging 
equipment they usually manifest themselves in a in the front 
of the , or a sphere on top of the rotor with optical elements. 

i did n't notice any uh 1s or other equipped as such. did they 
use handheld military thermal scanners if so , there is no recording 
capability , and hence the credibility of the report is subject to

now i suppose the post is within its rights to refuse such ads. however 

the second sentence is so noxious , i feel compelled to bring it to the

i called the post classified number  ( 825 2525 ) and expressed my

according to the supervisor i spoke to , the post was reacting to public 
complaints regarding the running of assult weapon ads. however , she 

the paper was keeping track of the reaction to the change in policy. i 
strongly encourage denver post readers to call and make their feelings k

intermediary for such sales. the right to bear arms is one of the most 
rights in our constitution , and assault weapons go way beyond 
what is , or rather should be (imho) , a natural right in america .  . just 
ask the family of that boy shot back in september the papers are full of 
stories about a child with an assult weapon with a angelic face  ( post ) 
who committed the murder without ever thinking. 

this has all got to get under control. i applaud the post for their bravery

in article , writes .  .  .  . 
from a.p. according to numerous accounts by those in the compound , 
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane 
tank , and turning over numerous gas lanterns .  . 

if there was a large propane tank , and it was breached , do n't 
you think that there would be an identifiable explosion 

there was at least one blast consistent with petroleum products that i 
saw , however propane is interesting stuff. it does n't explode on contact with 
air. it is possible for a tank to without exploding .  . far more 
likely , however , is that the compound was equipped with ng outlets running to 
the tank. damage from the 's could have ruptured the gas lines , allowing 
the gas to spread , unnoticed in the cs fumes and general excitement  ( propane 
typically has a distinctive odor added to it for just this reason to smell 
leaks ) , until reaching a flame or spark , and then ! fire everywhere , 
and maybe an explosion .  . use of ng is pretty common in texas , especially 
semi rural areas. 

further , the bd members have as much reason to lie as the 
gov't .  . 

this is true , but so far the fbi batf track record on this incident is very 
bad. 

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept 
the governments story , despite much evidence to the contrary .  . 

the only evidence that exists right now (at least what we know 
about) is various claims and counter claims .  . i'm waiting until 
the hard evidence is released. what about you 

i think it would have disarmed many people if the fbi followed this same 
policy. they have not. they are making claims without evidence , and what 
evidence we have so far tends to refute their story.

i have heard many opinions on this subject and would like to hear more from 
the people on the net. 

say you 're in a situation where you have to pull a gun on somebody .  . you 
give them a chance to get away but they decided to continue in their 
action anyway and you end up shooting and killing them. my question is 
what do you do should you stay and wait for the cops or should you 
collect your brass  ( if you 're using a semi auto ) and get out of there 
 ( provided of course you do n't think that you have been seen) what kind 
of laws are on the books regarding this type of situation what would 
be the most likely thing to happen to you if you stayed and waited and 
it was a first offense what would happen if you took off but someone 
saw you and you were caught 

anyone 


jason 


if in said situation. i would , reviewing other cases i 've seen reported 
on in the articles i 've read etc .  .  . , suggest the safest legal course of action 
is as follows .  . warn your assailant loudly and in clear tones that you have a 
 ( weapon(yes ! even though it 's blatantly obvious now that you have it out ! ) 
and that you will shoot him if he advances does not cease whatever hostile 
action he is currently involved in . ( . ie drop the knife or i 'll shoot ! ) 
repeat this process three times , if you can ! (not if he 's pointing a freaking 
gun at you himself ! that 's kinda impractical . ) .  ( there are variables here and 
i will try to address them in turn ) after said warning  ( considering it 's 
ignored ) aim center mass and fire until he drops ! this is not , it 's 
practicality . if . he has n't gone down he 's still a threat !  ( why i support  . 45) . 
if he turns and runs do not pursue or fire at his back ! shot s fired in anger 
will burn you later !  ( though in some cases the i can see where that might not 
bother me all that much ! ) if you do drop him ! remain where you are ! have a 
bystander or  ( witness(or create one by yelling at the top of your lungs ! ) 
call the police , and wait ! your weapon visibly ! or place it on 
the ground nearby .  . do not attempt to your brass . the . police will 
use it 's location to piece together the scene along with your testimony and 
that of any witnesses .  . mentally mark witnesses ! if the police say that none 
came forward let them know who you saw ! attempt to keep your weapon loaded 
with the minimum  ( required(how the hell can i phrase this ) try to avoid special 
purpose ammunition .  . hollow points and rounds give the opposing 
lawyer the type of loaded phrasing he will need to the jury that you 
fully intended to kill someone ! the only special purpose rounds that i can 
think of that would actually help your case  ( as it has in several ) is the 
glaser safety slug  ( oh what a lovely name safety slug ) the stated purpose 
and stated design parameters of the round are life in court. 
(ie .  . attempting to create a bullet which will not , not 
, and which is designed to stop (not kill  ( gee , to bad the two often 
cross , damn i'm real sorry that rapist is dead ! not ! ) an assailant with 
one shot. this , again , can be a real life saver in a hostile court. 
be as cooperative with the police as possible ! show them where you were. 
repeat your information as often as requested .  . they will often ask you the 
same questions over and over to verify facts , and , unfortunately , to see 
if your lying .  . fill out all statements and show all required identification 
and weapon permits  ( booo ! down with registered citizens ! register your 
politicians as deadly tax weapons needing to be confiscated ! ) if they are 
required in your state. contact a lawyer immediately if they decide to 
hold you or that further questioning is needed. if you cannot afford one , 
contact the nra .  . they have a legal assistance fund . at least they used to) 
i do hope your a member ! (not my business either way though .  . ) . if i was 
vague on anything , or i left some questions unanswered , you can e mail 
me or post here.  ( preferebly e mail. i do n't have a load of time to review

the reason the fire department could n't fight the fire is that bullets were

dangerous had a different fire broken out in waco 

so , how come the fire department had been at the compound area for 
49 days , only to be sent away two days before the fbi attack 

 ( whatever the above comment has to do with the hazards of fighting a 
fire in the midst of ammo cooking off .  .  . ) . 
maybe the fire department was loudly complaining the whole time about 
being diverted from their other duties , and the fbi said fine. go home

the lies of texas 

okay , what have we learned 

for reasons still being kept secret , a federal agency already known 
well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative 
committees over the years for a longstanding , violent disregard 
of the law , invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and 
personal habits they , violating his rights under the 
first , second , fourth , fifth , ninth , and fourteenth amendments to 
the constitution .  . 

the man and his followers fight back , killing four of the outlaw 
agency 's , wounding many more , and suffering their own 
losses in the process. the agency responds by cutting off his 
electricity , water , and especially his contact with the outside 
world. they are then free to say anything at all about him in 
pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency 
finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit 
eager to gain credit for straightening out the mess and , more 
importantly , to script his side of the subsequent negotiations 
any way they please. 

the impasse lasts almost two months , ironically , at the same time 
four l.a. cops are being given a second trial for a 
single individual , sparking one of the ugliest riots in history. 
armored vehicles surround the house , already with snipers 
using , high powered rifles .  . loudspeakers playing obnoxious 
records at the highest possible volume , and , deprive 
those in the house of sleep  ( in the aftermath , nobody in authority 
will mention the effect this technique , originated by north korean 
communists as a battle tactic , may have had on their  . 

finally another irony on the 50th anniversary of the rising 
of the warsaw ghetto , some of the armor punches holes in the house 
and gas of some kind is injected .  . the house bursts into flame and 
is reduced to ashes in less than an hour. at least 80 lives , 
including those of more than a dozen children , are snuffed out. 

for the outlaw agencies , the attorney general , and the 
president all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme 
blame the victim .  . 

he had illegal weapons as soon as they can be prepared in a 
secret government workshop and planted among the being 
examined by the agency that created them. he was abusing children 
the tapes will be stored with the data on the jfk assassination .  . 
he set the fire our snipers saw him doing it. film at 11 in 
3000 a.d. he shot his followers who tried to escape or was that 
jim jones best of all , he 's dead he ca n't say a damn thing to 
embarrass us , any more than when his contact with the world was 
severed at the start of the whole travesty .  . 

a leading national paper claims 93 of the american people believe 
that a man who resisted a savage attack on his home is somehow 
responsible for everything that resulted .  . but when did you ever 
know 93 of americans to agree on anything does n't this sound 
more like the outcome of a soviet election than an opinion poll 

very well , what can we infer from the above for starters , never 
forget that , although democratic careers are on the line  ( and 
rightfully so) over this fiasco , by the outlaw agency 's admission , 
it was planned and rehearsed by a republican administration. which 
may explain why paul harvey , who evidently used up all his courage 
and integrity changing his mind (at about the same time i did) 
about the war in viet nam has been acting as little more than a 
mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the bill of rights. 

more importantly , when rush limbaugh , who 's been a quivering tower 
of during the whole thing , takes essentially the same stance 
as bill clinton , it 's time for fundamental changes , if not in the 
system , then at least within yourself. 

on march 5 , back at the beginning , mary , national chair of 
the libertarian party , issued a press release condemning the outlaw 
agency and calling for its abolition .  . in fact , the lp has promised 
in its platform since 1977 , for at least 16 years , to abolish both 
agencies involved in waco .  . i'm proud to say i was there and helped 
to write that plank .  . 

true , the lp is tiny and insignificant  ( although less so than in 
1977 ask the democrats in georgia if you doubt it) .  . but , alone 
in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their 
with phony polls and big lies , the lp is right about what 
happened in waco .  . and if their advice had been followed in 1977 , 
waco never would have happened. 

think about it. and think about the fact that , if you 've had enough 
of political parties more interested in collecting and holding 
power at whatever cost to the bill of rights , let alone human 
life than in defending and expanding individual liberty , maybe 
the change it 's time for within yourself is to make the lp less 
tiny and insignificant by a single voice and a single vote. 

think about it.

flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires .  . a fire will 
start small and in one location and heat the air. the temperature in 
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches 
fire at once. 

this may have occurred in the bd compound , i have heard reports that 
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed 
by those outside the compound .  . when the fire got big enough , and 
broke through the walls , it appeared to be started in two places but 
was really one big fire. 

the houston chronicle last thursday  ( maybe wednesday ) said that 
the interior of walls had been covered with hay bales to help 
protect against bullets .  . many of you know how fast dry hay 
burns .  . 

because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building 
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free 
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. 
when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them 
to escape .  . they were trapped by the flames in their safe room. 

in addition , the gas is specifically designed to force eyes 
closed and the victim to vomit .  . how fast could you leave your 
burning office or home if your eyes were closed and you were 
retching violently 

i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final 
assault .  . i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show 
their agents of the the fbi overcoming the forces of evil , aka 
the branch davidians .  . the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove 
that they were not using excessive force.

what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf .  . if they would of 
had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the 
compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened. 

they did have the proper equipment. the problem is that they went about 
things the wrong way. the atf should have served the warrant in a 
manner instead of going in there like a bunch of with 
guns blazing .  . i'm not trying to excuse what david koresh did. i'm 
just saying that the atf  ( henceforth to be known as the cigarette cops ) 
went about the raid in an improper manner. 

the batf needs more people , better weapons and more armored 
transports .  . when they meet hostile fire they should be able to use 
more force instead of retreating to a stand off. if you are going to 
do a job then do it right. the batf is there to protect us and they 
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job. 

let the fbi , customs , and local police officers do the atf 's job. we 
don't need them anymore ! ! ! the cigarette cops are just leftovers 
from prohibition days. they are an anachronism ! 

with the wod and the increased crime in the streets the batf is needed 
more now then ever. if they blast away a few good fokes then that is 
the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country. look 
at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country 
of ours. 

including you what if the cigarette cops kicked down your door and 
cut you in half with a machine gun this could actually happen. 
maybe they get the wrong address and then raid your home , for example. 
it 's happened before and it can happen again . i have heard of more 
than one instance of a no knock raid going sour .  . just recently i 
heard about a case in which police raided this guy 's home because they 
thought he had dope or something. the guy blew both of the officers 
away and he did n't go to jail for it. the judge hearing the case 
ruled that the man was acting in self defense .  . 

with the arms build up in waco they needed to hit that compound with 
mega fire power. they could of gone in there blasting and killed a few 
women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn 
to death 51 days later. 

are you sure that that would have been the way to go surely the fbi 
and atf could have handled this fiasco better. they did n't have to 
massacre all those people. as stimpy said in fake dad , shame , shame , 
double shame ! the fbi and atf should be ashamed of  .

about waco 
it looks to me as the batf and fbi ca n't handle situations like this. 

it looks that way to me , too. but you have to understand that it 's not 
the first time they have instigated raids like these. the most recent 
one also ended up in a long standoff , but it was n't quite as public 
as this one , and they did n't kill quite as many people. maybe this 
screwup will make them think long and hard about raiding any more 
residences in this manner. but probably not. 

the way it went reminds me of  stun  bomb beeing dropped on a house

i do n't remember the figures exactly , but there were about 3500 deaths in texas 
in 1991 that was caused by guns .  .  .  .  .  . 

that includes suicides .  . since it has been shown in other countries that 
suicide rates are pretty much independent of the means available for 
doing oneself in  ( studies include some done published in japan , canada , 
austria , norway ) , suicides ought not be included in the count. 

if this is done , the number of vehicle related deaths greatly exceeds that 
of firearms related deaths in texas .  . 

i should not suffer because of others .  .  .  .  . 

certainly not. 

we all agree on this one , but we also live in a sociaty and therefor 
we 'll have to give up some of our  freedom   ( note the '') .  . 

why unless it 's doing something that directly hurts someone else , what 's 
the point  ( otherwise , you 'd better stop operating all motor vehicles , since 
the price of operating them greatly exceeds the cost in lives of firearms .  . 

one state  ( do n't remember which , texas ) tried to impose a rule that you could 
only buy one gun each month. think you all know what happened .  .  .  .  .  . 

well , it 's been done at least twice. south  ( north ) carolina did it a few 
years back .  .  . and . watched its crime rate relative to the rest of the country 
rise quite a bit. 

virginia just passed the law .  .  . no . word yet on what the results will be , but 
i 'd be willing ot bet that a reduction in crime rates wo n't be one of them. 

i respect the right to defend yourself , but that right should not inflict on 
other people. 

self defense does n't inflict on other people (except perhaps the criminal

why if you 're not a threat , you 're not affected at all. 


aha .  . that 's the part that makes me nervous too. who gets to decide if 
i am a threat 

when i might possibly be on the receiving end of a violent gesture , 
then i get to decide for myself. if someone does not like it , too 
bad. i would be doing exactly what you or any other living creature 
would do in terms of evaluation .  . what 's the big deal 

based on appearance 

sometimes. 

would someone feel more threatened when approached by a very dirty , , 
slightly maniacal looking person with a slight to the eyes , muttering 
to himself 

i might .  . 

does n't this describe most after they 've been out more than a 
couple of days 

not in my experience. and let us not forget that context is often an 
important factor in evaluating a situation. seeing persons 
on a hiking trail is not likely to be evaluated equally with meeting 
a sort , as described above , on a lonely city street at 3 am. 
anyone that cannot properly discriminate between these two different 
situations is legitimate fodder for the old survival of the 
principle .  . 

or based on something else proximity no room to pass on the trail 
without getting real close to someone. an inner sense now i'm really 
getting nervous. 

sounds like you doubt your own abilities .  . you sound pretty 
typical in this respect. you also seem to think that you 'll 
be safe or safer if others are unarmed .  . this is dangerous 
fantasy .  . 

twice when i was hiking the a.t. i came up on a shelter that i was planning 
on staying at and saw someone sitting there cleaning his gun. softly i backed 
away , and hiked another 5 miles to get out of there . i 'll freely admit it here 
i'm not afraid of guns i'm afraid of people that bring them into the backcountry .  . 

then you are in need of some form of therapy. not necessarily that 
of an analyst , but maybe you should learn about guns. your fear is 
seems to be based in ignorance and false knowledge. you see a person 
with a gun and you feel threatened .  . why is this so have you any 
legitimate basis for this any first hand experience that lends 
validity to your fears or are your fears based on mediated experience , 
i.e. the anecdotes of others such as network news i trust you can 
see the lack of legitimacy in such mediated inputs 

and why are you afraid of the people as mentioned above forgive me , 
but you sound afraid to the point of paranoia .  . perhaps you should talk 
to someone about this. i am not saying this to be rude or , 
but i think anyone with fear as deep and baseless as yours seems to 
be needs some sort of help. living in fear really sucks , even if it 
is only when around people with guns in the back country. 

tell me would you be as fearful of a park ranger who was right in 
front of you with their side arm in clear view why or why not

oh then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places 
in particular , three different places where there were no 's 

the crushed remains of a pressurized propane tank were found in the ruins 
of the bd compound .  . the key word is pressurized .  . when that baby was 
crushed , the gas would have gone all over the place. and when ignited , 
would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the tv 
news. ammo does n't go up all at once kind of like fireworks going off. 
propane gas goes off in a big  . gee , that 's kind of consistent 
with what the history shows. hmmmmm .  .  .  . 

and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying 
to get out of the compound 

remember , pressurized gas. people all over the building. 
conflagration in less than a minute. huge explosion .  . gas masks being 
worn by the inhabitants .  . makes a lot of sense that very few of those 
on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged .  . if they 
thought it was just a normal fire , they would probably be trying to 
put it out. then boom the  . after that explosion and 
concussion , i doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable 
of moving. 

and besides .  .  .  . oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering .  . 

good question. take an objective look at what happened , listen to the 
things that the fbi said ( the bd 's started the fire. the bd 's bodies 
were found with gunshot wounds .  . ) that are now being refuted by the 
evidence being recovered .  . seems that the fbi is deliberately making 
statements that have no rational basis in fact , and trying to make 
them sound like fact. 

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe 
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the 
contrary .  . thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under 
the bush administration. what would your answer be then would you still 
prefer to believe the cultists 

yes , i would still believe that the fbi and the batf were on a non stop 
string of lies and half truths .  . this is consistent with their operations 
on numerous occasions .  . 

and as for the bd 's being murderous , they did not cause any problems until 
they were assaulted by the batf .  . so now a thought experiment for you if 
the batf had never stormed that farm , would four agents and 90 bd 's be 
dead today 

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge . ) . 

but then 
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that 
his campaign would be respected by him once he got into office. 

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected 

yes. that is how politicians are elected .  . kind of scary , is n't it. now 
if we as a people actually held mr. clinton to his promises instead of 
apologizing and denying that he ever made them , and actually expected 
accountability by our government , i doubt that like waco would 
happen as often as they do. 

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty 
people are they , like , just plain evil , or what did they just wake up 
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states 
to figure out who to oppress that day i'm eager to know. 

acutally , no. the batf has a rather checkered history of staging raids of 
this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review. 
oddly enough , their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after 
the initial raid on the bd 's .  . coincidence i think not ! 

and as for the fire , what happened was caused by the act of knocking over 
walls with an armored vehicle of destruction .  . the fbi tried to convince 
the world it was suicide , but all of the facts that are coming out by 
the investigation of the texas rangers and medical point to 
a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the 
building. sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to 
cover its ass. 

and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader how is he 
on diabolical laughter does he look good in a cape these things must be 
investigated .  . you first. 

oh , please. if you want to argue , argue .  . if you merely want to demean those 
who see this differently than you , then please go somewhere else.

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children 
ages 14 and under .  . 

from the rkba archive , rkba . 004 . 

total firearm deaths for children ( 1 through 14) at 587 (1988) is 
one of the smallest causes of deaths in children. cars , falls , 
burns , drowning , food ingestion are all much larger cause of 
deaths (7 ,  . 

so , firearms are the 6th leading cause , after drowning and choking on 
food (at least for 1988) .  . 

sorry charles .  .  . according . to the national safety council , accident facts , 1991 
in 1990 , gun accidents were the fifth leading cause of accidental death 
for children ages 14 and under .  . 

i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental 
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents .  . 
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths 

the difference is that a rational person would address the leading 
cause first , and address the lesser causes later. 

that thinking is so screwed up , i do n't even know how to respond to it. 
a rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths , and not attempt 
to affect childhood falls , , gunshot injuries , etc. 
so this so called rational person ,  ( using your definition) , if he or she 
were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged 25 
through 64 would only worry about cancer , and would not try to decrease 
lesser causes such as heart disease , injuries , stroke , suicide , liver disease , 
chronic lung disease , homicide , hiv infection , or diabetes .  . oh , okay charles , 
that makes a lot of sense. i tell you what charles , i 'll call the heart 
foundation and suicide and tell them that they are not acting rational 
and that they can all go home because they are addressing the lesser causes 
of death. and you call your local police homicide department , liver foundation 
and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes .  . 
please , quit wasting my time with this silly shit charles .  . 

i 've got an idea charles , why do n't you start a talk . politics . 
group or talk . politics . fall . group this is talk . politics . guns .  . do n't 
confuse the issue. just because a social problem may not claim as many 
victims as another , we should not try to address it i do n't agree. 
i'm not posting to t . p . g . to debate the supposed severity of causes of 
childhood deaths .  . i am really getting frigging sick of having to respond 
to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who 
wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths 
is trying to make a political issue out of it. 


i assumed that any humane 
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents 
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. 

a humane person who keeps a firearm in the house with a 10 year old 
would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm 
ignorance is our greatest enemy .  . 

again charles , you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context 
for your own purposes. the statement that you responded to above is actually 
in reference to a previous post by another person who , like you , expressed 
concern over making youth gun violence a priority .  . i guess , maybe humane 
person and rational person could be interchangeable huh both would be defined 
as a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest 
number of childhood deaths .  . if that is the case , i'm extremely glad that i 
am inhumane and irrational .  . 

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence 

what other sources of information do you have which confirms their 
data these folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts. 
perhaps you can verify their data with the uniform crime report .  .  .  . 

sorry charles , the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepresenting 
the facts. but if you insist , according to the 1990 ucr , firearm murders 
of youngsters 19 and under increased 125 percent between 1984 and 1990 

is the national center for health statistics good enough for you they state 
that every day , 12 american children ages 19 and under are killed in gun 
accidents , suicides , and homicides .  . many more are wounded . 

or how about the national pediatric trauma registry they say gunshot 
wounds to children ages 16 and under nearly doubled in major urban areas 
between 1987 and 1990. 

do you also doubt the american academy of pediatrics charles they state 
that gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased 300 from 
1986 to 1988. 

charles , i hope you do n't need to be convinced that youth are increasingly 
victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns. if you do n't 
realize this fact , (i do n't care if you go by cdc or fbi data , or if you go 
into the homes , schools , and streets where these kids are and take a poll 
by yourself) , i'm not going to bother to try to convince you. its obvious 
that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion 
and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political 
discussion. i really do n't want to do that. 

or the centers for disease control. 

they have firearm statistics are firearms a disease 

charles , it 's obvious that you know nothing about the cdc .  . 
they do n't just study cancer and heart disease. i 've got news for you , 
interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic .  . in 1984 , surgeon general 
c. everett koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health 
problem as cancer , heart disease , or auto accidents .  . 

that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths .  . 

in the lives of youths or in their schools i know a number of 
youths who have firearms present in their lives . is is quite 
appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms  ( this is a 
presence , right ) .  . what are you trying to say this 
reminds me of listening to bill clinton .  . 

who the f k said anything about teaching children to safely handle 
firearm charles in the future , if you are going to post to t . p . g . and jump 
into a previous discussion , please read the entire posting , not just 1 
sentence that you decide to respond to. what the hell are you saying here 
you 're wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control 
issue out of a discussion that is n't .  . 

the reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that 
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. 

i would n't trust their statistics without independent verification .  . 

the cdc estimates 
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once 
in 1990. 

based on statistics based on ucr ... based on what 

the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key 
children  ( kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access 
to guns in their home. 

therefore ... what is the purpose of this claim 

charles buddy , i'm getting really tired of this. do you live on the planet 
mars as a physicist , i realize that you probably do n't come into contact 
with many youth , but i really think you need to make a trip to your local 
urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools. in addition 
spend a few minutes talking to these kids. ask them if they have ever heard 
gunshots in their neighborhoods , whether they know anyone who has been shot , 
whether they know anyone who has a gun , whether they have ever held a gun , and 
whether they themselves have ever been shot. 

believe me charles , that will be your independent verification .  .

folks , 

it 's time to start building some precise questions to send to our 
federal elected officials and to investigative reporters in our 
local tv , radio and media. ideally , these questions could be 
asked at any investigation into the batf 's and fbi 's participation 
at the waco fiasco in hopes of being resolved and , hopefully , wake 
up the local news media that they are not getting the entire truth 
from the batf and fbi .  . my list is up to 13 that are really nagging 
at my gut .  . the list will probably grow .  . 

1. what were the contents of the original warrant , now sealed , that 
the batf obtained 

2. it is reasonable to believe that illegal firearms and or ammunition 
could not be flushed down the toilet. therefore , a no knock 
raid could be ruled out. prior to the initial assault on the 
complex , did a single batf agent and accompanying witness  ( without 
a contingent of assault and news media personnel) attempt to knock 
on the door of the branch davidian 's complex and serve the warrant 
in a manner prescribed by law 

3. on the day of the initial assault on the complex , batf agents 
were aware that several small children were inside the buildings. 
in the gun battle , batf agents fired into a building 
known to contain children , killing at least one two year old child. 
knowing children were present , why did n't the batf have an 
alternate plan and immediately retreat from the area close to 
the complex and implement the alternate plan rather than opening 
fire and the lives of the children in the building 

4. the fbi spokesman states that paper evidence indicates that 
david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over 
200 , 000 in firearms and ammunition .  . did david koresh and the 
members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms 
license , were they actively participating in the legal business 
of selling buying firearms and ammunition , and were any of the 
weapons they had illegally possessed does this paper evidence 
consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally 
weapons .  . 

5. after the original assault on the compound tragically failed , 
a batf spokeswoman stated we were outgunned ! . yet , tv newscasts 
of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents 
armed with mp 5 and ar 15 m16 rifles .  . although unclear on the 
video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent 's 
bodies , they also may have had ak 47 and sks rifles .  . what  ( type(s ) 
of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the 
scene of the original assault on the complex 

6. since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the 
complex involuntarily , why did the fbi treat it as a hostage 
situation 

7. along the same lines , why did the fbi use psychological warfare 
techniques , including sensory overload , sleep deprivation , and 
other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any 
normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the 
complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind 

8. reports indicate several of the children inside the complex 
were accompanied by their mothers .  . since it is reasonable 
to expect these mothers would have their children taken away 
from them if they came out , why did the fbi expect the mothers 
to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities 

9. agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch 
davidians setting fire to the complex .  . branch davidian members 
who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an 
armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a 
lantern which was setting on a table. video tape of the incident 
does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the 
fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location. 
was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle 
penetrated 

10. fbi are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and 
the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide .  . yet , 
bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas 
within the building complex .  . this seems to be counter to any 
known mass suicides through history. what evidence does the fbi 
have that a mass suicide pact existed 

11. fbi director sessions stated that the massive shown on 
the video tape was caused by the branch davidian 's ammunition 
and or powder cache exploding .  . yet , the seems to be 
more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas 
or other highly volatile fuel source explodes .  . was any evidence 
found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition 
and or powder cache which exploded to create this if so , 
and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were 
engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms , was the 
amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect 
for someone engaged in such a legal business 

12. it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical 
news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to 
crush a reporter 's car which had been left at the compound .  . is 
there any factual basis to this rumor and , if so , what charges will 
be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act 

13. fbi director sessions states that , during the final assault on the 
complex , over 80 shots were fired at the vehicles .  . on the video 
tape of the incident , you can hear the of the armored vehicles 
engines. yet , there is no sound of the sharp reports that one 
would expect to hear if shots were fired .  . also , there are no 
indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows , 
buildings or other structures in the video. surely , these should be 
evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles .  . 
finally , the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter , 
sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be 
apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles .  . do 
any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas 
into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by 
shots from high power rifles 

14. cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent .  . the united 
states has signed international treaties which prevent the use 
of cs gas in warfare .  . if the united states could not morally use 
cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops , why is it morally 
acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land 

15. on april 21 , fbi state that at least 3 bodies discovered 
in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had 
been murdered or had committed suicide .  . on april 22 , the county 
coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet 
wounds to the head. were any of the victims bodies found within 
the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the 
burning building 

assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about 
by the tanks pushing on the walls  ( would shake a building pretty good) 
perhaps they did n't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the 
fire from the other side like they were surrounded by the fire , and 
rubble , which finally  ( combined with , and combustion gasses ) 
overcame and them 

in other words they were trapped by the flames , heat , fumes and rubble

i have never spoken for a ban against guns in america ! 
what i 've said is that there seems to be to many of them , and especially

now if you would like to reduce the number , how would you do it without affecting 
good gun owners 


i do believe in a persons freedom .  . 
what i do n't believe is that you can have it all and do n't pay for it. 

most europeans believe in a society of individuals , and that you have 
to give  a little  to make that society work. 

cars and guns should really not be mixed , i just tried to make a point. 
like america , norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b , 
so a car is essential in most parts .  .  .  .  . 

guns on the other hand are not essential in norway , so we do n't

quoting hatcher 's notebook 
the sporting arms and ammunition manufactures  institute reported 
a demonstration made by taking a large quantity of metallic

of the fire without being injured in any way .  .  .  .  .  . the material 
of which the cartridge and shells are composed will usually not 
fly more than a few feet. 
in tests conducted by the national rifle association , both rifle 
and pistol cartridges were exploded by heat under an ordinary

cartridge cases nor bullets penetrated the cardboard .  .

more than a few years back  ( if you were born that year , you can legally drink ) , 
we tried it out. we found an 8 ft. deep that we lined with some 10 ft.

stuffed with oily rags and scraps of wood in the bottom. after lighting the 
fire , we lowered a box of .38 spc .  . into the can. we heard pops , one solid 
bang and several . after we thought the was over , we 
boldly climbed down to find that none of the bullets had left the can , several 
of the shells were around the bottom of the well and the boards had all 
died of smoke inhalation .  . and 5 or 6 of the shells still had live primers !

note that texas is n't unique in this more with gun deaths than

just a general note , i have seen several polls lately and they 
show a large majority (a) thinks that this incident was handled ok and 
(b) thinks that the fbi and batf gave them more than enough time  ( 51 days) 
to come out. 

i take it that when something happens that is wrong it 's okay if 
a bunch of people say it is for instance , if some people go on a 
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which 
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then 
does this mean that what these people have done is n't bad this is an 
example of mob rule not a democracy a democracy in which people 's 
rights are protected .  . i hope that i 've made myself clear on this. 

make the following points 

1) your outrage over todays behaviour .  . 

and what if i'm not outraged 

fine .  .  . you . have the right to hold any opinion that you want to. but , 
let me ask you this are you outraged over this tragedy i hope 
that you are , your opinions of david koresh and his followers not 
withstanding .  . i know i am. 

2) since batf chief and janet reno were the 2 who signed off 
on this plan , demand that they be fired ! 

actually , they should both be commended .  .  .  . 

why i 'd be interested in hearing your reasons. 

5) point out that even if the fire was set by someone inside of the 
building , it came as a direct result of the actions of the fbi batf .  . 
and the people inside  ( including 17 children) deserved a trial , instead 
of this. 

what i want to know is what exactly did you expect them to do i 
can see it now .  .  . the . 11 o'clock news .  .  .  . fbi and batf agents still 
surround the waco compound after 451 days .  .  .  . i do n't think so. they gave 
them every chance. they had 51 days to surrender to proper authorities .  . 
they had representing them , etc. koresh lied time and time again. 
i do n't wish them dead but you ca n't let it stalemate forever. it was time 
to do something and the fbi and batf did. what happened was unfortunate 
but acceptable  ( as long as the fbi did n't set the fire  .

relay of coverage seen 

there was a press conference by authorities at the compound on cnn earlier 
today  . it was explained that two news were found 
on the compound earlier this morning without permission. it was explained 
to the press corps .  . that this is dangerous and that an unknown photographer 
turning around with a long lens camera could be mistaken for someone dangerous 
by a texas ranger surveying the site. ( ! ) 

the two were said to be currently in jail and 
the press were warned to follow the authorities  guidelines .  . 
it was also emphasized that the survey of the crime scene at this 
point was crucial and that the press could not be allowed to interfere .  . 
the press will not be allowed in until the bodies are removed and the 
site has been completely surveyed for evidence for a court case. 

that is the gist of the beginning of the conference to the best of my 
memory. i bring this up because i have n't seen anyone else note it 
and i have n't seen the regular newscasts mention it. it will 
probably be mentioned in the papers tomorrow. 

my opinions 

i find this disturbing .  . while i believe that koresh is largely 
responsible for not ending this standoff in a manner during the 
last 51 days of patient opportunity , i find the secrecy surrounding the 
aftermath more damaging to the authorities  position than they realize .  . 

since the vast majority of potential defendents in a court case are 
already dead , the emphasis on the importance of building the court 
case seems overblown to me. 

it will be interesting to see the hearings on this affair .  . i have also 
heard congressional calls for a review and possible overhaul of government 
enforcement agencies which you will recall i have stated would be a good 
idea in previous months. 

please also note that i by no means endorse or agree with the many 
conspiracy type theories i have read here and in other groups. as usual , 
i am basing my opinions on info gathered from various media and filtered 
by my own common sense and consideration of plausibility , imho .  . as such , 
my opinion is subject to change as more information is made available.

what i would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident .  . i 
believe the moves made were right and proper , but i still have some problems 
with some of the tactics .  . after watching the abc special on it tonight , as 
well as cnn and nightline , i question some of the atf and fbi actions .  . 

my god , a sane person ! somebody asking intelligent questions rather 
than spouting of unsubstantiated drivel and making comparisons to nazi 
germany .  . i question , along with others , the initial raid by the atf .  . 
there are some definite questions needing answers. 

1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at 
some time before the feb. 28th raid 

probably. which is why there are so many people angry at the 
initial confrontation .  . why attack a compound with as many people in that 
compound who are willing to die for their leader further , they attacked 
in the daylight hours without proper backup , medical support , etc. that 
was rather stupid .  .  .  . 

2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome .  . 

this i doubt. while i question the atf 's initial raid , i believe 
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single 
exception of the psychological warfare by blaring music , etc. i think 
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome .  . 

3) were fbi actions  ( blaring loudspeakers , etc . ) . the right course of action 

see above .  .  .  . 

and a few other questions. like i said , i believe the actions taken , in 
general , were proper .  . but i still have some reservations .  . 

agreed. 

one other point , i'm no fan of janet reno , but i do like the way she had the 
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility .  . seems like the waffle boy 
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue. 

which is actually rather refreshing nowadays. most of the time , the 
higher ups claim i do n't remember .  .  .  . or i had no involvement .  .  .  . )

i am bothered by the suggestion of child abuse that janet reno 
used several times last night , both on and off nightline as a de facto 
justification for approving the raid .  . if that is to be used as a 
justification of potentially lethal force attack on the compound , and 
doing structural damage can fairly be called that , then that evidence 
had better be quite strong. that seemed to be on ted 's mind 
last night. 

reno stated that they had evidence of child abuse .  . she would 
not say what it was. koresh 's now ex lawyer was inside the compound 
repeatedly and told her to her face last night that he saw plenty of 
happy children playing with their mothers and no signs of child abuse 
whatsoever. no silent children , no apparent , and so 
on. her reply to this was that child abuse is not always as evident 
as that. true , but what better evidence could the fbi have had at 
this point it seems difficult to see how the fbi could have had better 
evidence than that seen by koresh 's lawyer who was an eye witness .  . 

having lived in la and seen the media and authority feeding 
frenzy that accompanied the debacle , i have seen 
just how hot a button a child abuse charge can be. child abuse has 
been used before by authorities as a justification to discard prudence .  . 

i find janet reno 's repeated assertions of evidence of child 
abuse rather curious. was n't the warrant issued for a supposed 
weapons violation that certainly had nothing to do with child abuse .  . 
are we to assume therefore that new evidence of child abuse arose 
after the issuance of that warrant and the initial assault if so , i 
fail to see now how that new evidence was gathered , and how it could 
be better that on site eye witness evidence.

does that include the right to murder little children how about killing 
atf officers i do not know much about the gun laws in texas , but 
koresh 's folks claimed to have grenades , grenade launchers , and rocket 
launchers .  . i am not sure that the nra feels that this falls under 
right to bear arms. 

if the waco wackos truly had grenade launchers and rocket launchers , why 
were n't they used against the armored vehicles that attacked their house 
all the media stated was that small arms (ie , ineffective ) fire was used 
against them. 

i noticed that too. special agent  ( asshole actually) ricks stated that 
david koresh had explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40 
feet into the air. it looked like to me that the bds had plenty of 
opportunity to use these explosives provided that they had them in the 
first place. for example , when one of the tanks was injecting cs gas 
into the ranch house (yes ranch house the bds were n't living in a 
fortress ) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because 
it was idling there for a considerable length of time. so , why did n't 
they do this could it be that they did n't have any explosives or 
similar munitions i just do n't buy what the atf and fbi have been 
saying. hopefully , the truth will come out. 

here 's something noteworthy after the fire had been burning for some 
time an explosion occurred just one explosion .  . the media said that 
this was some of the explosives that the bds posessed going off. i 
do n't think this was the case. my brother and i noticed that this 
so called explosion resembled a of propane gas being ignited .  . 
we figure that this is what it was because of how the explosion 
looked and sounded .  . obviously , it was n't due to something like tnt , 
dynamite , or c4 .  . i have seen a propane explosion before .  .  . the . explosion 
in the ranch house greatly resembled this. also , i noticed something 
that looked like a propane tank in the ruble the next day. 

is n't it curious that the atf was n't very forthcoming about how the four 
officers got killed many weeks had gone by before they stated that 
some of the officers had been killed and or wounded by grenades thrown 
by the bds .  . earlier , when someone asked one of the about 
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents , they 
said that an autopsy had been done but they t ready to release 
the findings .  . now why is this does the atf have something to hide 
perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire. what is the 
cause of death exactly no one has ever said what it is. 

what is certain is this atf agents did throw grenades into the 
compound .  . as a matter of fact , mr. koresh handed his lawyer a grenade 
body during one of the lawyer 's visits to the compound .  . later on 
the lawyer gave the grenade body (i do n't know if it was a dud or a 
spent one btw) to the atf .  . how much do you want to bet that this 
grenade will mysteriously disappear at this point in time the only 
people we know who had grenades was the atf agents .  . would n't it be 
a if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades , rockets , 
or explosives in the rubble the atf would sure have egg on their 
face then. note that the atf is doing the initial sweep of the 
rubble .  . the fbi and the texas rangers wo n't investigate until the 
atf is done. this looks like a perfect opportunity for the atf to 
make sure that others find what they want for them to find if 
you know what i mean. i'm probably being a little paranoid here 
but if i am i have could reason to be. recall that several weeks 
had gone by before anyone said that the bds had used grenades .  . 
also recall that early on the atf had denied that their agents 
used grenades on the bds .  . someone is lying here.

this was posted by bates to the firearms politics mailing list 

i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk 
at the law school about the waco situation.  ( of course , this was 
all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy 
conclusion . ) . so , yesterday i went to hear him. what follows is a rough 
summary of what i think i heard him say , which should not be taken as 
exactly what he actually said .  .  .  . 

kates started by saying that since he did n't know any more about the fire 
than the audience did (it had just happened the day before) , he would not 
discuss that , but would concentrate on the original raid .  . 

koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck .  . but so what this 
is n't the first time that the leader of a new , small religious group has 
been ridiculed by the public. extreme religious views nearly always fuel 
hatred and mistrust .  . the first amendment applies , maybe especially , to 
people like koresh .  . 

lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us. 
there were none until about 1830 , when they began in metropolitan areas. 
police originally were not armed if they found a crime in progress , they 
called local armed citizens to help. many began to carry arms for 
protection despite regulations against them , eventually the laws were 
changed to allow them to carry guns. the original intent was to have many 
small police departments , jealous of one another and competitive , but not 
large enough to be a threat to liberty , hence the plethora of 
organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard. when the 
fbi was started , agents did not have the authority oto carry guns  ( they 
were to be , after all , a bureau of investigation , not a police  . 
all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that 
power. 

the batf started as a tax collection agency , whose primary job was to raid 
illegal stills .  . when the price of sugar went up so high that 
no longer found their trade no longer profitable , many illegal stills 
disappeared , and the batf needed something else to do to justify its 
existence , so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores. 
around the time when the batf 's annual budget is under review , the media 
is alerted by the batf to come to such and such a place , where at a 
pre arranged time , a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door 
and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a 
gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly. the media is n't 
invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork , but 
if any irregularities are found , the media gets to cover the agents 
removing of guns from the premises , and the ffl in 
chains .  . 

the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf 's budget was up for 
review. 

kates  opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad , and 
that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot 
at , or they would have planned the raid differently (not sending 100 
agents over open ground with no cover , for example) , and would have had 
some medical personnel on hand. 

he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh 's arrest 
in connection with a murder charge , and the local sheriff called him on 
the phone and explained about it. koresh sais , ok , come pick me up , and 
the sheriff did , temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could 
be tested .  . koresh was later cleared , release , and presumably got his guns 
back. at least at that time , he was rational enough to be approached 
rationally , and behaved in a reasonable manner. 

the batf did n't take into account that , unlike most of the ffl 's they 
audit , koresh was actually paranoid , and paranoia in his 
followers. thus the stunt looked like a real attack to them , and 
they reacted accordingly. 

with respect to the original warrant , it had not been unsealed when kates 
was giving his talk , so he could not comment on it , except to mention that 
the batf has been known to not double check the of their 
informants , if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant .  . he had 
more to say about the way the warrant was served , which may have been 
completely illegal .  . apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to 
knock on the door and announce that you 're an officer with a warrant for 
thus and so if they do n't open the door and the evidence is , 
then it is ok to break in the door. but since it is hard to flush guns 
down the toilet , there may have been no justification for the batf 
breaking in the way they did. if the constitutional rights of the 
davidians were violated by an invalid warrant , or by an improperly served 
warrant , then the davidians may have been justified in their  . a 
close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent may 
have shot himself by accident when entering the building if so , this was 
the first shot fired ! 

the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse. after an initial 
position on the side of the batf , the media began to come around to the 
view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held 
off a bad , possibly illegal attack. a real cynic might say that the fbi 
went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was 
beginning to change sides , and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the 
public 's sympathy .  . 

should the batf be abolished no. police agencies should be numerous , 
diverse , inefficient , , etc. better a few inept accidents 
like this , than a move toward a single , large , well organized , 
well trained , powerful , domestic police force , which would eventually have 
even more tragic results.

okay , here is the result of my efforts. i'm just getting started with this 
type of activity , so please set your flame on low. 

comments , corrections , suggestions , welcomed .  . 



editor , 

i would like to ask you and your readers a few questions that are related to 
the right to keep and bear arms , and to a greater degree , the many other 
rights that we take for granted on a daily basis. 

1. you 're sleeping at night , when you hear someone in your house. you 
call the police .  . how will you defend yourself , should the need arise , while 
you are waiting for the police to 

2. you are driving your family home when your car breaks down. a good 
samaritan stops to help , when you find you and your family at gun point or 
knife point. how will you defend yourself and your family 

3. you are a woman walking alone to your car or home. a man appears 
suddenly with the intent to rape you. how will you defend yourself are you 
strong enough to fight off your attacker are you willing to let this man rape 
you in order to survive the attack 

if the house and senate have their way , we will soon not have the right to keep 
and bear arms , as provided by the second amendment to the constitution .  . a gun 
may not be the answer to each and every dangerous situation , but are you going 
to let the politicians decide what sort of force or weapon you may use to 
defend yourself and your family 

many times a situation may be by just brandishing your handgun .  . if 
certain members of the house and senate have their way , .25 , .32 , and 9mm 
ammunition will be banned for sale to anyone other than the military and law 
enforcement departments .  . very soon , you may not be able to purchase ammunition 
for use in your handgun .  . 

there is already a 15 day waiting period in california .  . do you really feel 
that any law abiding citizen should be required to wait this amount of time for 
the purchase of a handgun when his life or family members have been threatened 

our local police do an excellent job , but they can not be there all the time , 
or in a moments notice. you should have the right to protect yourself while 
waiting for help to arrive. 

there is currently legislation circulating in washington that would prohibit 
the sale of certain types of , handguns , rifles , and shot guns. one 
elected official even wants to repeal the second amendment ! 

i want to ask the readers of this paper what they would do if their elected 
officials decided that they should only belong to a certain church , or go to 
church on a day what if you were told that you could only read 
certain books write about certain subjects what if you no longer had the 
right to a jury of your peers how about the right to assemble in a peaceful 
manner 

these are all rights that are provided by our constitution and the amendments .  . 
if we give up one right , we may as well give them all up. if you do not fight 
for the right to keep and bear arms , what will you fight for when your life 
is affected write your law makers now ! protect all of your rights by 
defending your second amendment rights.

 .  .  . gun . buyback programs will hopefully 
have an impact on accidental shootings  ( especially youths ) , domestic 
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and 
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level 
crime .  . 

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on 
any of these things evidence , please 

please do n't what i was saying joe .  . i was making the point tha 
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if 
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types 
of common incidents .  . 

if you 're a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps 
you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the 
rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps 
with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners 
spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death 
among children in the u.s. is a serious problem. 

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children 
ages 14 and under .  . i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental 
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents .  . 
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths 
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a 
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental 
gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane 
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents 
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. 

more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the 
community. in that sense , i think they might do a little good. 

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good. 

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police 
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by 
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond 
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i 
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were 
useful. 


i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or 
brought to school by youths on a daily basis  ( about 135 , 000 youths ) are 
obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often 
borrowed from a parent without their knowledge. 

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i 
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of 
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun) 
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students 
who carry a gun to school daily. 

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence 
or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see 
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths .  . 
the reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that 
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates 
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once 
in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key 
children  ( kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access 
to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200 increase in 
student gun between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between 
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in 
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 .  . these are the statistics . 



thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah  ( got news 
for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours 
presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they 
were in  . 

holding kids time for a reality check , son. these kids were the 
children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were 
outside waiting to kill them. would you send your children out the door 
if you believed as they did 

okay , maybe i worded it wrong .  .  . dad .  . i meant that to put children in a 
situation  ( fortified compound ) where harm could come to them is not the 
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over 
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is 
would not let innocent children die. 
if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why 
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them 
burn alive thanks for the reality check joe , its been real.

flash over is a frequent occurrence with indoor fires .  . a fire will 
start small and in one location and heat the air. the temperature in 
the room builds up and then everything inflammable in the room catches 
fire at once. 

this may have occurred in the bd compound , i have heard reports that 
the windows were covered which would permit a fire to start unnoticed 
by those outside the compound .  . when the fire got big enough , and 
broke through the walls , it appeared to be started in two places but 
was really one big fire. 

because of the large quantities of tear gas inserted into the building 
it is possible that many of the women and children were in a room free 
of tear gas they would try to seal the door to keep out the tear gas. 
when they learned that a fire had broken out it was too late for them 
to escape .  . they were trapped by the flames in their safe room. 

i find it hard to believe that the fbi was not recording the final 
assault .  . i think that they would have wanted to have tapes to show 
their agents of the the fbi overcoming the forces of evil , aka 
the branch davidians .  . the tapes would also allow the fbi to prove 
that they were not using excessive force.

sure , people can kill people without guns. but easy access to guns makes it

guns kill people . 

no , that 's not right either. people who have both easy access and the

if you do n't affect the desire , you 're wasting your time , not to

jim , i'm just saying how it is. i'm not saying if that is a good thing 
or not. from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun 
buyback programs , i get the impression that they really think they are 
having an impact on the community. 

good for them. i note that the tm folks make the same argument. if 
you 'll pay their ( 21 million for a reasonable size city ) , 
they promise to meditate away all crime , disease , etc. at least 
they 're not promising to jail me if i do n't go along with their little 
plan they 're going to just sit in a room and fly , leaving me alone. 

gun violence whether its effective or not. look , if you ca n't measure 
the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test 
evaluation , what is the point it must be symbolic in nature. 

ah , but we have evaluated gun control using before after and it 
does n't work to reduce crime .  . what is the point we ca n't claim that 
it is symbolic , as people do get jailed .  . 

the police are 
essentially saying look , if you have a gun lying around and you do n't 
want it , we 'll give you 50 for it .  .  . because . we care about the community . 

no , they 're essentially saying we hope this will keep you from 
noticing that we 're not doing anything useful . pissing away 
resources is n't caring . 

if you , i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or 
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous .  . 

nope , you 'll merely be ignored , as wright , rossi , and were after 
finishing under the gun . they were supposed to prove that gun 
control worked , so .... 

jim , listen to me , i said i'm not religious whatsoever , do you understand 

religion has nothing to do with this. i could care less what religion 
they were okay to put children in that situation is wrong , pure and 
simple. difference is good jim , i am the most progressive and diverse

indeed. larry king had the two attorneys  ( whose clients are now

not necessarily .  . if the body had been  ( cooked ) or dehydrated due

in fire , bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of 
meat with little effort. medical tend not to like cleaning up 
such scenes. 

as such , if the body had been suitably cooked , a bullet comming from a 
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and 
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the 
time of death , or much later , unless you were trained to look for the 
evidence. texas rangers are not  .

this is quite corect , but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy 
will show virtually no deformation , ie a hollow point probably would not

talk . politics . guns .  . there you can dredge the of minds so hung 
up on power and ego trips that they bend reality arround their own 
particular set of  . 

just what the hell do you base that ludicrous claim on there are 
plenty of fine , decent people people who read post to t . p . g .  . if 
any of these people are paranoid it is because of people like you. 

hey dude you are making me paranoid ! what an argument ! ! ! 


i long ago gave up arguing the case for arms control directly .  . instead 
i invite people to ask themselves , would you want to be in a room full 
of the occupants of talk.politics.guns , their personal and 
attempt to enter a discussion with them 

i 'd have a spot of tea with them. ) you probably gave up on arguing the 
case for arms control directly long ago because posters who know 
what they are talking about (e . g .  . , frank crary ) disproved all your 
arguments for why more gun control is needed. so , you gave up because 
you know they are right and you could n't refute their answers. 

no , frank crary 's arguments are based on the assumption that most people 
are sane , normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. usenet as a whole 
disproves it of humanity as a whole .  . 

we now have proof positive that guns do n't make you safer .  . buy a lot of 
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the fbi to burn 
down your house. see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons 
to support gun control.

where did you hear about the thermal imaging i have n't heard this yet 
(not that i doubt it , i'm just looking for sources .  .  . ) . 

this was reported in canadian papers thursday , 22 april i think the 
source was upi , but do n't recall for certain .  . 

it seems to me that if they did have this kind of info , they could 
broadcast it and it would resolve  ( or at least help to resolve ) alot 
of doubt in people 's minds. 

personally , the way the (fbi batf reno etc) is claiming all sorts of 
things without offering one shred of proof  ( other than their good word ) 
is very suspicious to me. a picture is worth a thousand words .  .  .  . 

i understand that at least two goverment investigations have been ordered , 
so we may learn more during their hearings .  . 

i sincerely hope you are right and it turns out  ( with indisputable 
proof broadcast across our land ) that the government groups had nothing 
to do with the fire. but until i see such proof , i think it is just as 
likely that a tank did knock over a lantern as koresh torching the place. 
the only evidence i have seen is a tank crashing through the front 
wall , withdrawing , and seconds later flames are seen (the first flames 
on the video ) erupting from this very same spot. coincidence perhaps. 

tough call without more investigation , but if the thermal imaging story 
holds up , i think the government will be more  .  .  . of course , 
paranoia fans wo n't believe their results anyway , will they 

if such proof exists , the government should publish it and put all this 
speculation to rest. 

hear , hear ! i 'd also like to see the autopsy reports confirm news reports 
that multiple victims were found shot  ( in the head) , and in positions 
inconsistent with fire victims .  . it is simply too early to draw conclusions 
either way about this nasty incident , but i tend to believe the government 
side.

that really depends upon where you draw the line while defining 
these weapons , 

this means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough. good. 

very narrow .  . very , very narrow .  . if you 'll recall , i was the 
nut that advocated the possibility of tactical nukes being militia 
weapons in certain situations. how can you possibly define what is a 
weapon and what is n't is only the start of this. 

and also on if you intend the law to be reflective of 
modern practice five months or five centuries down the road. 

i would hope so. let 's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon 
whose majority of energy comes from fission and or fusion of atomic 
nuclei .  . 

and you 've just described any civilian reactor because your 
definition fails to note what energy is being considered .  . reactors 
blow with a steam explosion , but the majority of energy still comes 
from fission or fusion because that is what heated the coolant .  . see 
what a can of worms this is last i heard , ft. station just 
north of omaha , nebraska was n't considered a weapon .  . given the 
sodium cooled breeder designs on the blocks now , i can easily envision 
reactors being household appliances in under twenty years. with the 
prism design , there is no operator input needed on the reactor 
itself , and it is not unreasonable to assume the secondary side can 
be made equally as automatic in the future. so your definition is 
flawed in a few respects already. 

let 's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
in such state , quantity , and with such a vector that they could cause 
death or serious disease further defined to a significant number of 
people if released in a city , similarly populated area , resevoir , or 
cropland .  . 

typhoid mary would likely fit this bill if she  . if 
you do n't mind , any hiv positive person also fits this 
bill if they interact with others in a way that stands any chance of 
spreading the virus .  . finally , that manure pile i mention below fits 
this definition , as does , say , releasing a pet to the wild .  . 

nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined .  . other poisonous 
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there 
is no use not related to weaponry .  . licenses should be available for 
research purposes on such chemicals .  . 

and i can show where any such gas has other uses .  . for example , 
perhaps we would like to rid the hay field of gophers .  . calcium carbide 
is a rock that dissolves in water to produce gas. it can 
be used for welding , in miners lamps , for gassing gophers , or for 
making carbide bombs and doing some illicit fishing .  . toss some in a 
toilet and leave a lighted cigarette on the seat and you 'll see that 
it can also be a weapon , just like any other flammable substance .  . 
so , now my miners lamps wo n't work , i ca n't do any welding , and i 
still have those pesky gophers .  . 

i am not a lawyer , but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions .  . 

the basis for , but i'm sure you see that the problem is not 
in writing a law , it is in writing a law that cannot be abused and 
extended beyond the point where it does any good. 

i 'll give 
you a little hint see that manure pile in the farmer 's field down the 
road in the usa , that is a weapon of mass destruction , 

nope .  . it is not considered a weapon .  . 

it is under your proposed law. so is a pit if there 
is run off. so are underground fuel tanks .  . 

biological in 
nature , because if it gets washed into an open well it will contaminate 
the aquifers that supply thousands of cities with drinking water. so , 
where do you draw the line in the usa , the epa has ruled that 
a pile of scrap iron is illegal .  . care to draw a thinner line this time 

it is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction .  . many things are 
banned for other reasons. 

it meets all the criterion of a weapon .  . it is an instrument that 
can be used for fighting , even though that is not its intended purpose , 
and despite there being better weapons around. given that the aquifers 
supply a significant part of the country with drinking water , mass 
destruction is rather a given. 

it 's not that certain weapons are n't something i 'd rather not 
see a lot of people having .  . the problem is that it is nearly 
impossible to write a law such that it cannot be abused upon some 
pretext or another. the looser your definition , the more ripe for 
abuse that law is. furthermore , if you get specific then the old 
standby is to insert a clause allowing the list of banned things to 
be added to , generally without going through the hassles of another 
vote and public reading of the law. again , ripe for abuse .  .

when one occurs by accident. 


it 's also what you say when you 're waiting for the end to come in a 
fiery apocalypse  .  .  . just . a thought. 

personally , if the fire was set (by either side) , i wonder about the 
timing. if koresh co. set the fires , why wait through six hours of 
wall bashing and tear gassing before starting was there anything new 
that happened just around that point similarly , if the fbi were going 
to torch the place  ( and fake it , of course) , why wait so long , would n't 
it be more reasonable to believe the bd 's would set the fire early 
after the assault began 

the most plausible  ( to me) explaination is that of an accidental starting 
of the fire by the tanks .  . among other things , i say that because i 
was listening to the radio when the fire started and the reporter 
 ( watching from a distance , of course) said that it looked like at least 
one of the tanks had penetrated farther into the building than previously .  . 
specifically , he said that one tank apparently was halfway  ( half of 
the tank 's lenght ) into the building where it previously had only been 
a few feet.

for the congress which contains a brady bill 7 day waiting period 
within it. i believe it just died and never came up for a vote in either 
house. 

it 'll probably pass the house again , and will probably pass the

with other things will be the question. 

they got four years of clinton 's support to pass it.

anybody got arlen spectre 's address i want to write to him and thank him 
for showing the leadership to demand a congressional investigation 
into the waco mess. 

if i had arlen 's address , i would go to his house  ( do weasels live 
in houses or in holes ) and personally tell him what a pathetic idiot 
he is. arlen is the personification of the word jerk . snip .  .  .  . 

i'm no fan of arlen spectre 's , but he did the right thing , and attacking his 
motives in this case is wrong. 

pardon me , here , but i do n't trust spectre 's motives here at all. spectre 
was a major part of the warren commission ,  ( remember the magic bullet theory ) 
and is not to be trusted if there 's even the chance the guv mint may 
have done something wrong. if he gets a chance i'm afraid he will satisfy 
the public outcry with another whitewash .  . 

unfortunately , if some of us get our wish and the batf is disbanded or folded 
into the fbi , etc. , we may end up with a more efficient agency than the 
bumbling and competition we have today. some agents should be fired .  . some 
should be prosecuted .  . but keep them as bumbling as possible we retain more 
of our liberties that way. 

right on the money here. we should certainly applaud the of the 
but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set 
up the assault on american citizens .  . 

we must not count on spectre , though , to get it done.

that 's the bd side of the story. the other is that d. koresh met

that koresh had spent 200 , 000 on assault weapons in the past year and 
now we know that the  bunker  adjacent to the house is thigh deep with 
a million rounds of ammunition .  . 



the news statement was that there was 200 , 000 worth of firearms 
and ammunition (no mention of assault weapons ) on the premises , 
not that koresh had purchased them  ( what would his crime be if he 
had ) .  . this averages to about 2000 per person , not an astronomical 
number. 

we do n't know that there is a thigh deep pile of a million rounds .  .  .  .

the branch davidians were not violent and were not planning to start 
violence .  . 

when the bd compound was assaulted by the atf the bd did fire back. 
but they agreed to a cease fire and they allowed the atf to care for 
their wounded .  . the bd even released the atf agents they captured .  . it 
is clear from the release of the agents and allowing the atf medical 
attention that the bd were not looking for trouble. 

if the bd were violent they would have held the atf agents as 
hostages .  . they would not have released them like they did. if they 
had kept the agents hostage they could have used them as 
chips for medical attention etc. 

a big thing is being made of the bd collection of weapons but no one 
has shown that they had any plans to use them. it is also apparent 
that the bd did not have any military training. if they had , they 
could have dug bunkers and trenches and increased their 
 . they could have shot out the lights and speakers. it 
appears that the bd were not violent , they shot back at the attacking 
atf agents out of panic .  . there were shots fired on the last day but 
they were in response to the fbi attack on the compound with armor .  . 

all the violence in waco was initiated by the federal agents , not the

waco , texas fierce gun battles erupted sunday as more than 100

were reported killed. ... 

the gun battles began when federal agents hidden in livestock 
stormed the sect 's head quarters sunday morning , 

witnesses said. the agents had warrants to search for guns and 
explosives and to arrest howell , said les stanford of the atf in 
washington .  . ... 

witnesses said the law officers stormed the compound 's main home , 
throwing concussion grenades and screaming come out , while three 

national guard helicopters approached .  . for a moment , there was no 
response. then the shooting began .  . 

i think storming the sect 's head and throwing concussion 
grenades qualifies as a no knock  ( or perhaps an illegal  . 

he was not just another guy minding his own business. hell , give them all 
the guns in the world if they do n't bother anyone. but he was a scary sort , 
do n't you think the sort of person you 'd want your daughter to date i 

probably not. but then again , neither are you. 

then he fired on the atf .  . that 's not just a little mistake , or some 
red white and blue american defending his home against big brother. that 
shit does n't fly. anyone with his background that will shoot and kill 

and just what is his background what prior crimes had he been

what happened in waco is not the fault of the batf .  . if they would of 
had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the 
compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened. 
the batf is a part of the dept. of treasury , not justice. if they needed 
to assault a place they could just do like the irs does .  .  . call . in the 
federal marshalls service , their fugitive collection teams do similar type 
assaults all the time. and they are very , very good about it , in both the 
tactical and legal parts of it. but i suspect that the marshalls would 
not have touched it , because the search warrant (which is still sealed i 
believe) was so bogus .  . 

besides the batf also could have swat teams from federal marshalls 
service fbi secret service national park service texas rangers nearby 
large city police forces the military .  . but they had to use their own 
guys , nobody elses swat team was good enough for the holy cause of gun 
control. 

i also find the timing of the raid to be extremely interesting. 
initial raid two days before the nj senate was going to overturn their 
assault weapon confiscation law a couple weeks before the batf 's budget 
was going to come up in congress for review shortly after reno got 
confirmed as ag (i do n't need to remind you about her anti gun line)

the armed criminal in america 
by james d. wright 

(1) legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct 
sources of handguns for adult felony offenders .  . 

only about one sixth of the gun owning felons obtained their most 
recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a 
licensed firearms dealer .  . the remainder five out of six 
obtained them via informal , off the record transactions involving 
friends and associates , family members , and various black market 
outlets .  . the means of acquisition from these informal sources 
included cash purchase , swaps and trades , borrowing and renting , and 
often theft .  . the criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated 
by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.

the study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous

the assault weapon panic 
political correctness takes aim 
at the constitution 

by eric morgan and david 

testimony before congress revealed that most assault weapons in the 
hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels .  . 97 the testimony 
is consistent with the national institute of justice 's research findings 
based on studies of felons in state prisons .  . the nu study , authored by 
sociologists james d. wright and peter rossi found that only sixteen percent 
of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (the 
figures included purchases by legal surrogates , rather than directly by the 
criminal . ) . wright and rossi , who had begun their research as firm proponents 
of gun control , concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases , and 
probably not even full scale gun prohibition , would reduce criminal use of 
guns. wright and rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime 
directly target the black market in criminal guns , and 
leave the legitimate retail market alone. 98 not surprisingly , wright 
believes that the consequences of current assault weapon legislation on 
street violence are likely to be ineffective .  . 99 he warns that gun 
controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of 
criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new 
business. 100

were hit by rounds exploding in the extreme heat. remember that kept 
the cops away for hours. i have only heard that bodies were found 
shot , not any coroner 's cause of death. 

so far , the medical examiner  ( according to the news) has found no evidence 
of gunshot wounds in bodies so far examined .  . if this continues to be 
the case , it will sort of shoot holes  ( pun intended) in the fbi story , 
would n't it and cartridges going off outside a firearm do not launch 
a bullet like they do when fired from a gun. the bullet hardly moves , 
it is the brass casing that goes flying , and then with less than lethal 
force. it will hurt , yes , but not kill you i doubt if it wil penetrate

how about an independent investigation , with full subpoena powers , and 
powers to prosecute on felony charges , to investigate for any possible 
illegal criminal activity on the part of both the batf and fbi i 
cannot see any reason why not to use the phrase they like to use

hits town 

with the chilling reality of crime at the hands of urban terrorists 
that were noted above (a high school student and gang article in the 
same column) , we welcome into the ranks of those dedicated to re 
moving criminals from the streets the national rifle association 's 
new project , engineered by arizona 's former chief assist 
ant attorney general steven j. twist. 

is working to reverse the disturbing trend of daily 
crime .  . it is promoting solutions that can be applied nationally , 
including tough and honest sentencing of the sort that arizona is 
applying with its truth in sentencing law funding construction and 
of appropriate prison space ensuring that the system is 
primed to punish serious youthful offenders strict attention to the 
rights of victims and citizen and community involvement .  . 

phoenix will be the home for this national organization. 

the gazette has vigorously opposed many nra policies on issues of gun 
control , and will be resolute in promoting prudent laws that seek 
reasonable regulation of firearms .  . 

but is an appropriate creation , a response to a clear 
need for more robust in holding legislators and judges ac 
when it comes to swiftly and surely punishing criminals .  . 

when an organization has an issue , it has an issue , and crime 
strike has it especially when it is willing to direct its dollars 
to getting criminals off the street. 

we say , welcome to town.

were british citizens .  . 

the b . b . c .  . are also reporting that bodies of b d members were found 
with bullet wounds in a manner that suggests they may have been shot 
attempting to leave the compound during the fire. 

there is a possibility that these are the bodies of people killed during 
the initial shootout .  . 

phill hallam baker 

can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes bullets go flying 
every 
where. imho , these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines 
went up. a texas ranger does not a pathologist make , so i 'll wait for an 
autopsy to determine if they were shot first. 


i would doubt bullets would go flying .  . there is no particular force to make 
the bullet leave the scene of a cartridge going off outside of a barrel .  . the 
brass shell would burst too soon to give the bullet any real velocity .  . i 
would n't want to be near it , but i do not think bullet wounds would result. 
shrapnel wounds would be more likely 

at least this is my understanding. 

not necessarily .  . if the body had been  ( cooked ) or dehydrated due 
to the heat , a projectile needs only a minimal kinetic force to penetrate .  . 
in fire , bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of 
meat with little effort. medical tend not to like cleaning up 
such scenes. 

as such , if the body had been suitably cooked , a bullet comming from a 
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and 
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the 
time of death , or much later , unless you were trained to look for the 
evidence. texas rangers are not  . 



either way , they 're all dead and the fbi atty. gen. are still 
responsable .  .

brought the whole thing on themselves. because as you say , they could

there was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his

you do n't see any evidence of the abuse therefore it must be taking place 
as you point out but here , it is irrelevant to this case. the

no one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any 
time. the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their

exactly. by their own choice.

out too and surrendered the alamo .  . after all , all they had to do was 
come out. they stayed as you say by their own choice . problem 
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of 
insurmountable odds .  . but as you point out , they certainly do have 
that right. 

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would 
have been no raid , no siege , and no deaths .  . instead , they chose courses 
of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not 
irrational .  . the first was to stockpile weapons .  . the second was to

a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a 
free state , the right of the people to keep and bear arms , 
shall not be infringed .  . 

now , notice , it says arms . not guns. arms. 

the zog wants you to think that it is the only legitimate 
possessor of nuclear weapons .  . unconstitutional ! you and i have just 
as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as 
any cruddy little pointy headed liberal los alamos pinkos .  .

oh then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places 
in particular , three different places where there were no 's 


well , i only saw it start in one place. a tank punched a hole in a wall , 
and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that 
a 30 mph wind was blowing .  . i saw a diagram in usa today yesterday , and 
fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made. a terrible , negligent 
accident. 


and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying 
to get out of the compound 


maybe they could n't .  . i 've often at how people could get burned alive 
in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire , but it happens all the time. 
what if they were in sealed rooms , trying to avoid the gas , and did n't know 
about the fire until it surrounded them remember the israelis hiding in 
sealed rooms during desert storm to avoid gas bearing scuds 

, mark , are you really a college student maybe you ought to stop 
worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head. 
ever heard of questioning authority 

and besides .  .  .  . oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering .  . 


ok , i 'll buy that. you do seem totally clueless .  .  .  . 


i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe 
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the 
contrary .  . 

 .  .  .  . they were n't murderous .  . they 'd never harmed or even threatened 
anybody until they were attacked by a force using military weapons 
and hardware. and as far as evidence , what are you talking about 
everything the feds have said they 've retracted practically as soon as they get 
questioned in detail about it. maybe you and your increased beverage 
access buddies , sitting around the bar stuff like they shoulda 
killed 'em all 51 days ago do n't feel that way , but then you 're probably 
one of those people still saying about give the guy a chance , we do n't 
even know what he 's gonna do !  ( burp ) 


thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under 
the bush administration. what would your answer be then would you still 
prefer to believe the cultists 

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge . ) . 

no problem , you do n't have any questions that scare any of us. most of our 
minds are apparently more developed than yours. 

the answer is yes ! in a f cking heartbeat ! 

thought experiment would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth 
open , blissfully sucking up anything the feds said if bush were the president 
what , no comeback  ( ok , go ahead , say it. read my lips , no new taxes p ) 


but then 
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that 
his campaign would be respected by him once he got into office. 

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected 

not in such a great degree. bush broke one promise , maybe two  ( taxes guns ) 
and we held him accountable for it. of course , it took him the better part of 
4 years to do it slick 's only been in office 101 days and he 's broken lots 
of them.  .  .  . i imagine he 'll also be held accountable for that. 

(i can just see the campaign buttons now abc anybody but clinton ) 

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty 
people are they , like , just plain evil , or what did they just wake up 
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states 
to figure out who to oppress that day i'm eager to know. 

hmmm .  .  .  .  . apparently you just got here. nobody 's claiming that it was anything 
but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally 
do n't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up. and as far as how they picked 
the davidians , who knows maybe they figured that nobody 'd care about such 
a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the texas prairie .  . 
maybe they figured they 'd just go in there and run roughshod over the bds 
during their religious services (which was the reason the feds gave for the 
timing of the raid ) rather than running into resistance. maybe they knew 
that the bds were n't anywhere near as violent as the feds  spin doctors are 
trying to tell the public. maybe they were afraid to try this kind of thing 
on the and  . maybe it was because the atf 's budget is up for 
approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is 
the case. of course , their reasoning does n't matter , only what they did , 
and this time , people are just paying more attention to it. 


and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader 

not if you mean that stupid do n't stop thinking about tomorrow ...

just like in a suit. i saw him in the rose garden the other day , and i

i 'd like to go on record as saying that i do n't think that it 's fair.

true , should n't the explosion have happened very soon after 
the fires started

later. it 's going to happen , and we 'll get to see for

cnn just reported the atf and the fbi have begun killing everyone in the

do something illegal .  . an atf spokesperson , just before he shot himself , stated 
that this would clean up things once and for all . 

for those of you still unsure whether this is satire , the jury is still out 

also yesterday , even though the compound no longer exists , the 
us attorney 's office here released formerly sealed documents , 
including a search warrant and related , that authorities 
planned to use when the siege was over. 

these documents did not include the original warrants the bureau of 
alcohol , tobacco , and firearms had in late february , which to this 
day have never been released. 

 .  .  . one . of the documents indicated the agency planned to seek 
samples of koresh 's handwriting not only to verify that he had 
signed for some gun purchases , but also that he espoused 
 certain doctrines hostile to law enforcement and particularly 
the atf . ' . 

so , one of the charges against koresh seems to be contempt of cop he 
expressed hostility to the batf .  . that feeling in your gonads is

seen any of the above behavior which trait  ( stocking food for more

in article , 
says 
from a.p. according to numerous accounts by those in the compound , 
the fire was started by an armoured vehicle crushing a large propane 
tank , and turning over numerous gas lanterns .  . 

oh then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places 
in particular , three different places where there were no 's 

this claim has n't been retracted or contradicted yet , as many earlier 
government claims have at least one clip showed a fire erupting 
after a tank busted in a wall. we have unsubstantiated claims by 
the government about the spotting simultaneous fires .  . 

and if the government did start the fire , then why were n't people trying 
to get out of the compound 

that 's easy. six hours of cs gas , heavy smoke from a rapidly spreading 
fire , confusion , panic .  . only 10 got out. the building was collapsing 
all around them and finding the way out was a matter of luck. 

and besides .  .  .  . oh , i do n't know why i'm even bothering .  . 

the davidians may have committed suicide , or some few zealots among 
them might have started the fires that is possible. but , given 
the government 's earlier inability to tell a straight story , i find 
my above scenario equally possible. i wait for some independent 
investigation to look into the whole thing. 

it would be one thing if the government had been 
consistent and forthright throughout. keeping the press far away 
and in pools was not conducive to building up trust .  . 
sealing the warrants was non optimal , as well. this operation 
was out of control from the git go. 

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem willing to accept 
the governments story , despite much evidence to the contrary .  . 

i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe 
a murderous , heavily armed religious cult , despite much evidence to the 
contrary .  . thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under 
the bush administration. what would your answer be then would you still 
prefer to believe the cultists 

speaking only for myself , i think bush and reagan should have been 
impeached over iran contra .  . 

in 1979 , i would probably have given the benefit of the doubt to 
the government. no more. like i said , i 'll wait to see the 
results of an independent investigation if there is one 
before i choose whom to believe. 

(no , i do n't really expect a response to that challenge . ) . 

but you got one , anyway. 

but then 
again , that is how mr. clinton was elected , by people who believe that 
his campaign would be respected by him once he got into office. 

um , is n't that how all politicians are elected 

i generally vote for the lesser of two evils .  . this last time , it 
was the least of three evils .  . 

if people will believe that of any , it is little wonder they 
will believe all of the being given out as fact by the 
clinton reno fbi batf confederation .  . 

so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty 
people are they , like , just plain evil , or what did they just wake up 
one day , stretch and yawn , and throw a dart at a map of the united states 
to figure out who to oppress that day i'm eager to know. 

it was a bureaucratic execution .  . out of control bureaucracies driven 
by percieved self interest and gross stupidity .  . 

and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader how is he 
on diabolical laughter does he look good in a cape these things must be 
investigated .  . you first. 

clinton is just another statist .  . my only problem with clinton on this 
is that he is apparently willing to blindly back the atf and fbi .  . 

 .  .  . so . i propose that we destroy the moon , neatly solving that problem.

oh , then , i guess that shooting those kind of babies is all right. 
you sick bastard. 

why thanks for your reply to my post. by the way , i never , never ever said 
that it was right to shoot those kind of babies. 

let 's go to the videotape .  . here 's exactly what you posted 

this is murder ! 
atf murderers ! butchers ! ! 

flame on ! ! 
is this guy serious 
if he would ever really pay attention to the news (oops i forgot that the media 
for the most part loves to jump right on top of a story before all the facts 
are known , as well as to manipulate what we see and thus what we believe) .  . 
any ways one of koresh 's devoted followers that did i repeat did survive this 
genocidal mass slaughter of innocent people . besides there are nine 
survivors in the burn unit of the local hospital and was reported that david 
was in one of the towers when the shit hit the fan. besides , a majority of 
these children were children that he was supposed to have been the father of , 
this then makes them bastard children to a (sp) .  . also 
someone should have told david and his followers that if they ca n't the heat 
then they should stay out of the kitchen ! !  ( pun intended) 

so if you were n't saying that the deaths of bastard children of a 
zealot was no big thing  ( and i know i am not the only one who read it that 
way) , just what the hell were you saying 

however it was the branch 
davidian people in there that insisted on staying there with their savior 
 ( yeah right budy boy ) because he had brain washed them into believing that 
what ever he says is the truth , even if means that they are to give up their 
lives for his cause. therefore it is davids fault and not the atf 's 
who gave them 50 to 51 days to get out , this was 50 days to many for me and 
for many of the rest of the u.s. 

so who brainwashed you into believing that whatever the government says it 
the truth or that koresh was any actual threat to you and the rest of the 
us have n't you ever stopped to wonder why the government raided this farm 
this raid was not about religion , sex , or child abuse .  . to the best available 
evidence at the moment , this raid , psychological torture , and group death was 
about koresh 's failure to pay a 200 tax on one grenade launcher that he may 
or may not even have had ! that 's why it was the batf doing the raiding in the 
first place. 

do you think a 200 tax evasion justifies an armed assault by the government 
with 100 armed men in , orchestrated character assassination , noise 
torture , and a holocaust 

i am however sad to hear of the death of any 
child unlike the sick bastard i supposedly am.

charge you with murder , and are further your name , while claiming that 
you can safely surrender at any time. then they start using psychological

surrender to agents of the federal government after another federal agency 
committed an armed assault of their home on the basis of a 
search warrant .  . 

look at how the texas rangers view the batf .  . look at the fbi statements 
regarding the batf actions .  . from all apparent sources , the fbi 
trying to clean up the mess made by the batf , resulting in an accidental fire 
which killed most of the bd 's who were still in the compound , and are now 
playing cya .  . the batf committed an illegal assault , obtained the use of 
texas ng resources with fabricated allegations , and compounded their abuses 
by accusing the bd 's of crimes outside their jurisdiction once they had been 
held off in their assault .  .

i'm sure such weapons have been developed .  . our society does not , 
however , condone their possession or use. 

actually , joe , i wrote the above. peter was responding to my article. 

i'm actually rather confused by your post. i suppose i did n't 
make myself clear , cause you seem to have gotten exactly the 
opposite impression from what i intended. i suppose the authorities 
might have been a better term than society . carry and use a firearm 
in many parts of the country  ( certainly the parts i live in) , and expect , 
at the very least , to have an awful lot of explaining to do. 
and there is also appears to be a trend in society at large that 
actively opposes what many see as their right to defend themselves. 

in a few other parts of our society , handguns are banned or 
so restricted as to be practically unavailable to the law 
abiding citizen for self defense outside the home. funny , 
though , how the criminals in such places continue to have a 
supply of guns and no about using them. 
imho , you do n't need to be either a political philosopher or 
a crime victim to realize that there 's a flaw in the gun 
grabbers  logic .  . 

agreed. 

you 're welcome to your ho , too , the first amendment being as 
important as the second , but please do n't let your obvious 
good intentions be by generalities 
about something as big and diverse as us society. 

my only intention was to comment that the existence of suitable 
weapons of self defense does n't mean you 'll escape a whole 
of trouble should you be forced to use them. 

or by the 
naive hope that making gun possession a crime will give pause 
to someone who would be a criminal anyway. 

i made no such statements , nor do i have such a naive hope or outlook .  . 

wishing you peace and the wherewithal to defend yourself 
if others  thoughts are not that kindly , 

that 's all i want the opportunity to leave in peace , or to 
have the means to defend myself when that in not possible. 

i think we agree on this issue. i guess my position did n't 
survive the transition from cognition to ascii .  .

no firearms were ever ever shot at the national guard at kent state. 

at the time of the shooting , no rocks were being thrown at all. the squad was 
slowly proceeding up a knoll , away from the body of students. some students 
were taunting them , and photographs of the incident show at most one or two 
students who were following and taunting .  . 

the series of photographs show the squad slowly proceeding up the hill , while 
occasionally their , .45 in hand turned back to look at where they came from. 
all at once , as if on command , the entire squad turned and fired their m1 
, firing 30 . 06 . rounds into the crowd (the can be shown with this 
45 at full  . at least two of the students shot had nothing to do with 
the  .  .  . they were only passing through , and were not participants in 
the confrontation .  . 

there is some dispute whether the guard was even legally on campus .  .  .  . apparently 
they had not been invited onto the state school by the president , who had 
conveniently flown the , so as not to be around. the governor of ohio , 
james rhodes , had just embarked on a senate campaign , and wanted it to be known 
that he was tough on , so had ordered the guard in. 

the matter was quickly covered up. some years later , wounded survivors launched 
a civil lawsuit against those responsible .  .  .  . a settlement was made , and under the 
terms , the plaintiffs could not discuss much , and guilty individuals were not 
identified  ( in fact , those shooters in the squad have been identified) .  . 

it was a tragic incident , but it was not provoked by the students , or apparently 
by general or any of his command. from studying the incident the 
photos , imo it looks like it was an independent action by a small squad of soldiers .  .

is up to the officers of the state of texas , who are probably getting a per

you people are rather amusing in a perverse sort of way. you take 
a tragic unpleasant situation that you feel is a terrible , and 
assign blame to anybody and everybody with or without a link to the 
incident 
simply because they do n't fit your extremely narrow definition of good. 

how is clinton responsible it was a law enforcement action. 
granted , it was a nationally covered incident but clinton had no more to 
do with the outcome than fred flintstone .  . 

perhaps you 've been under a rock the last few days the batf and the fbi 
are both federal agencies .  . clinton has admitted in front of news cameras 
that janet reno (the once and future attorney general) gave him a full 
briefing of what was planned before they did it , and he gave her the 
go ahead. 

maybe , just possibly , that makes him a bit responsible 


the fbi , cia , batf , etc. are federal agencies , you are correct. but to 
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the prez , and 
that these agencies inform reno who informs clinton , etc. is naive .  . these 
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have 
ultimate accountability to the prez , they make their own moves , and then 
tell the prez , who says , i knew all along . while this may not seem right , 
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command 
leading to the white house , thats the way it is. are not , after 
all , composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis , have lunch , and 
maybe golf together. i do agree , the fbi , batf messed up. i'm not sure if 
they should have stormed the compound or not. by the way , witnesses 
are a religious minority in this country. protestantism is a minority 
religion in the world. bds were a cult by all definitions and history of 
cults .  . to say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave .  . 
koresh said he was the messiah .  . i was raised a baptist , although i do 
not practice the religion and do not think that the big guy upstairs is 
digging the divisiveness , , and right wing morons that are 
associated with the religion. anyway , the messiah that i was taught about 
would not be carrying a gun , let alone stockpiling weapons .  . you can doubt 
batf reports all you want , david koresh was not a poor soul who was 
persecuted .  . while some of the information coming from the u.s 
government is being so as keep public opinion on their side , i 
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said 
are true. anyway , this is just another excuse to try and blame president 
clinton for something. people who attempt to do this for political motives 
should be ashamed .  . they are the ones who are keeping this country from 
reaching its full potential. 



you seem to make two points. no one ultimately the federal agencies 
you mention , and since koresh apparently has a different view point from your 
baptist upbringing , then he is not worthy of protection from religious 
persecution .  . as to being the messiah , is not christ within us all 

must be comforting to belong to a government approved religion. 

baptists are a cult , two , btw , under most of the definitions in the dictionary 
of cult .

small arms rounds set off outside of a firearm pose little risk except 
possibly eye injuries and minor wounds .  . 

true. 

large concentrations of ammo , 
or  magazines  (not the type you insert into your semi auto ) probably 
pose a larger risk , but mostly from heat and flame .  .  ( this is also 
covered in the above reference . ) . 

no more risk than smaller unless the stash is somehow confined so 
the heat from early ignitions could somehow bulk heat the remainder .  . 

two years ago this month my house and office burned .  . in my office was my 
reloading bench .  . on the top shelf next to the wooden ceiling was 
about 100 lbs of smokeless powder , 5 lbs of black powder , several thousand 
primers and a couple thousand loaded rounds , primarily in  . , .30 20 
and  . 308 .  . the fire was extinguished before the area containing the 
reloading supplies were fully involved. there was about 1 2 of char on 
the joists , subsequently removed by  . lots of heat in other 
words. 

none of the powder kegs ignited .  . one can of pistol powder ignited .  . 
no explosion , as the can opened at the seam as it was designed to do. 
the black powder cans were and got so hot the plastic 
completely melted and ran down inside. the smokless powder was 
contained mostly in 8 lb cardboard or metal kegs .  . the kegs were 
badly enough that the paper labels burned completely off and in the case 
of the metal cans , the plastic melted completely away. 

many of the rounds cooked off. they were in close proximity to wood 
on all sides so the effects were easy to observe .  . in most cases with the 
rifle ammo , the cartridge cases ruptured in the middle. many bullets were 
found still in the neck .  . small shards of brass were lightly stuck into 
the wood .  . lightly enough that them with a fingertip would usually 
dislodge them. primers generally popped out of the primer pockets. 
the  . rounds that cooked off left empty cases and bullets laying around. 
no dents were observed above the storage area , indicating the bullets 
left the cases slowly enough not to be a hazard .  . 

ordinary small arms ammo is not a hazard when cooking off regardless 
of what the fbi says.

 ( begin included text) 

i took a course called the madness of crowds , ... the course included 
cults and briefly mentioned analyzed jonestown .  .  ( did some external 
reading too) .  . 

william ... edited a series of books on the psychology of 
evil mass movements .  .  .  . starting with the authoritarian personality , 
university of chicago press , 1948 ... an attempt to figure out what 
would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in wwii , 
and by extension in other wars , in racial lynchings ... i do n't think 
the books are perfect , and the study of has advanced 
... , but you can elicit koresh types from even the first volume. so i 
think they 're onto something. 


how cult psychology works .  .  .  . 
i'm an amateur .  . hope i'm not hopelessly naive .  . 

so long as koresh could own his people , he made sure they did n't 
believe there was any life out there for them , away from him. 
otherwise , he 'd  ( koresh ) be nothing. during the siege , ex davidians 
recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived 
only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless souls .  . 
absolutely classic brainwashing technique. ... as long as they 
believed him , they 'd ignore batf fbi child protective services or even 
the red cross asking them to come out. after all , if they ever left 
him , god would them straight to hell , and the combined forces 
of the us gummint , with all the goodwill in the world  ( doubtful ) 
could n't save them for a second. if i believed it , i 'd stay and die 
too , like the folks in jonestown .  . 

for a prosaic analogy , replace a cult leader with an wife 
 ( or husband ) , and notice how many folks show up , kill the ex and then 
themselves. that 's the consequence of shattered  . it really 
does happen all the time. by the way , the treasured ideal in such 
cases , without which life is meaningless , is the relationship , no 
matter how abusive , rather than the individual 's partner. 

... 


why no news , do n't the feds owe the world an explanation 

i agree that official explanations are in order. i can also see good 
( ) reasons for news  . 

the only fact available is that had the fbi not acted 
yesterday , those people would be alive today. 

... that no matter what , those people would have died , because koresh 
made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence .  . 
hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi acted .  . he 
held them hostage , as his trump against going to jail , but nothing 
would really stop him from offing them. even if the fbi went away ! 

look at history. rep leo ryan  ( and some staffers ) visited jonestown , 
at the request of constituents who had relatives there. once 
jonestown was discovered , and even though they killed ryan and his 
... they all killed themselves , because jim jones knew he 'd 
be busted .  . internal arguments asking to spare the children , brought 
up by some of the women in the cult , were shouted down. there are 
tapes .  .  .  . the logic of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is , it 
would n't kill the kids , was shouted down as blasphemy , and the people 
who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by 
their own avowal would be dead within the hour. i suspect it 's the 
same with the branch davidians .  . 
 ( there 's a book on jonestown by james reston jr. , titled our father 
who art in hell. i do n't know whether it 's good never read it . ) . 

... 
the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate 
reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment , or organizations buying 
full auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups , on the 
off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves. ... 

so , the only way the batf fbi could save those people , and future 
cults , is by ignoring such signs. 

i suppose there 's another way koresh and tricking him 
into letting them go , or somehow influencing his people to abandon 
him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world. 
... a mighty tough row to hoe .  . ... i suspect the fbi tried to do that

for those who did n't figure it out , the below message was a reply to another 
in sci.crypt , for which the poster put t . p . g .  . in the followup to line. i 
did n't notice that. apologies to those who were confused. 

the substance makes little sense unless one reads the prior messages. 

however , i do n't wish to enter into this discussion here , as it will be yet 
another of a long tired set of arguments .  . suffice it to say that i 
disagree both with the interpretation of well regulated in the second 
amendment offered by gun lovers , and what i think to be their distortion of 
the same phrase in the associated federalist papers. my webster and my 
reading of the language convinces me that the word meant both under control , 
and disciplined , and not  of good  . i think the latter a 
special interest pleading .  . no one has yet shown a reference 
in which well regulated unambiguously meant  of good marksmanship  , and 
not under control disciplined , etc. 

thus i continue to believe the second amendment is a militia clause and not 
an  arming everyone  clause .  . others are welcome to disagree  ( as i know many 
do) and little would be served by rehashing this topic in this particular 
forum. 

to avoid flames , or unproductive , i note that i 've come in here 
to post this one message , just to clarify the one below. i'm now outta here 
again though i'm available via e mail.

massive dan blather mercifully deleted. 

his last sentence says it all. who the hell are we  ( or the government) 
to judge their religion as wrong. this event , i hope , will be recorded 
in history as the american holocaust .  . these people were murdered 
by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis .  . 
i hang my head in shame for what i 've allowed my government to become .  . 

i have never judged them by their religion , but by their actions .  . 

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would 
have been no raid , no siege , and no deaths .  . instead , they chose courses 
of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not 
irrational .  . the first was to stockpile weapons .  . the second was to 
shoot federal agents .  . the third was to stay inside. 

last time i checked , an arsenal and practicing any kind of 
religion were mentioned in passing in the bill of rights. guess it 's 
ok with you if we just brush 'em aside in order to justify killing 
a bunch of religious , eh 

of all the idiots i run into in daily life , dan , your type scare me the 
most. you 'll accept expediency and a coward 's safety over any belief 
just as long as the government tells you to. you assume that anyone who 
does n't to your beliefs and ways of thinking are wrong and 
therefore bad. worse , you seem to accept without question what the 
government says is wrong to be wrong. 

david koresh 's religion was not mine but then again , neither are the baptists , 
methodists , catholics or any of the rest of the corporate religions .  . but 
even though koresh 's , the baptists , the methodists , etc , do n't believe 
the same way i do , i recognize that their religions are equally valid 
to mine and more importantly are equally protected under the 1st amendment .  . 
you see , i'm not that much different than koresh and i suspect many others 
fit the same catagory .  . i read the bible many times and as i learned 
from it , i discovered that a lot of what corporate religions practice 
just is n't justified by my interpretation of the bible .  . therefore i go 
my own way. so did koresh .  . and neither you nor i nor anyone else , 
either individually or collectively as the great socialist we has any 
right whatsoever to tell me or you or koresh that our religions are wrong. 

you seem to think that it would have been oh so easy for the davidians to 
just forsake everything they believed in and walk out of their compound 
in order to save themselves . think  ( if you 're capable ) for a moment 
about some belief you hold dearest .  . would you abandon that belief if 
suddenly told to do so by the government if you would do so you are 
beneath contempt .  . let 's assume you have a belief that you hold dear 
enough to commit your life to. do you think it would be the correct 
course of action for your government to initiate actions specifically 
designed to force you to make that forsake or die decision 

the forsake or die option is exactly what the government forced on the 
davidians the day the first wave of black clad stormtroopers fired that 
first shot and tossed that first grenade .  . the fbi it on day 51 
when they sent in heavy armor against 80 some odd men , women and 
children holed up in a rickety old building and armed with small arms. the 
people who stayed , who held to their beliefs over personal safety , whose 
individual personal honors demanded they die rather than submit , who 
believed that the bill of rights meant exactly what it says , to those 
people go my deepest respect , regardless of their religion. people like 
you who blithely blow off the murder of 80 people with well they could 
have come out get my most scornful contempt .  . i 'd spit in your face 
were there not a network between us. you 're not worth the ashes of 
those people who burned .  .

 ( frank brown 726 0415 ) writes 
this is the ap story from fri morning. 

as the walls came down and tear gas filled the air , cult leader 
david koresh sprang into action. he left his third floor bedroom and began 
looking around the house , making sure women and children were secure and 
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. within hours , the 
compound became an inferno .  . nine branch davidians  . 
this is their story , gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them 
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder .  . that day the 
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world 
since koresh 's right hand man , steve schneider , ripped out the compounds 's 
phone line after fbi agents called before dawn monday saying this was the 
cults last chance come out or prepare to get forced out. 

aw , gee , and whose fault is that 

they kept their word. by dawn , tanks were the mount carmel 
compound , punching for hours to holes for tear gas to enter. the bd 
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines .  . strapped into gas masks , the 
women did laundry .  . others read bibles in their rooms. the 17 children , all 
under 10 , remained by their mothers  sides. still , it was hard to ignore 
what was happening around them. each time a tank rammed the 
poorly constructed building it shook violently .  . cult members 
falling and doors. 

dear , dear. they could have come out. 

hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling 
the air with noxious fumes .  . the flying canisters were more frightening than 
the tanks .  . at least one man was hit in the face. 

dear , dear. they could have come out. 

the gas began filling the air , 
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks 
made. 

it could n't have gotten too heavy with all that wind blowing through. 

scattered throughout the house , the cult members made no efforts to 
gather .  . then the fbi sent in its biggest weapon a massive armored vehicle 
headed for a chamber , lined with cinder blocks , where authorities hoped to 
find koresh and schneider and fire tear gas directly at them. 
here the cult members  story from the government 's version. the 
fbi says cult members set fires in three places. but each of the six cult 
members , in separate discussions with lawyers , consistently gave versions 
at odds with the fbi 's account. they say the tank flattened a barrel of 
propane , spilling its contents .  . and as the tank through the house , 
it tipped over lit lanterns , spitting flames that ignited the propane and 
other  . the home of used lumber , plywood , and tacked 
together with tar paper was vulnerable .  . the building erupted .  . nine bd 's 
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other  . others 
died groping in the  . 

sad , but they could have come out.

the facts as reported by the press and impartial government

as david veal points out , this sort of promotion would be used 
against gun owners by the mass media. 

however , here is my proposal offer gun safety classes in your area , 
free , as a community service. such a class would normally cost 40 
or 50 , so offering it free is a good promotion .  . 

our gun club has organized several of these  ( we just finished 
teaching another one last night , in fact ) and they have been 
very well received. we get a lot of people who are novices 
interested in guns. we even get a few who are anti gun , but 
feel they should know something about gun safety since members 
of their family keep guns at home. 

teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits 

(1) we have the chance to teach gun safety rules this increases 
firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats. 

(2) a gun safety class is politically correct , and likely to 
be viewed positively by the public and the media. 

(3) most of the students are  normal people' (not gun enthusiasts ) 
and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a 
gentle introduction to firearms .  . 

(4) some of the students are enthusiastic , and will purchase a gun 
and become more involved in shooting or personal defense .  . 

(5) it improves the public perception of our club and gun owners 
in general. our students see that we are all reasonable , 
non aggressive , soft spoken people , which helps to mitigate 
the standard image of a hardcore gun owner. even anti gun 
students sometimes tell us they have something new to think 
about with regards to personal gun ownership .  . 

(6) sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun. 

our course is the standard nra certified home firearm safety 
class , and our students pay only 5 for materials. we also 
teach the nra 's personal protection class , although the cost 
is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time. 

i think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to 
gun buy backs .  .

the problem is , the devil is in the details. you know , the brady bill 
sounds like a good idea too , until you discover that there is no check , 
and that the police don't have to allow your purchase even if you check 
out , and that you have no recourse if they do n't .  . 

are there any loopholes here i'm no lawyer , i ca n't be sure. i 
would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the brady 
bill , for example. 

the more words involved , the more details. what was that saying about 
abraham lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves , and the modern 
congress requiring 3 , 000 , 000 words to describe price controls on rice 

if there 's a good enough show of support for hr 1276 , maybe for a change 
we could be the ones saying it 's a reasonable first step ... 

that only works with bad laws .  . good laws are like good computer programs. 
quality has to be written in from the start , not added on later.

subject batf fbi do right thing in waco 
lines 44 

everyone is complaining about the debacle in waco .  . it is hard to 
understand all this angst .  . what happend there is nothing less than 
what we wanted to happen. why all the sour grapes 

batf was looking for a propaganda event to counteract their impending 
budget cuts ... the attendance of the press at the initial big 
commando raid is proof. it would have been ever so easier to grab 
koresh and his central followers as they shopped in waco .  . alas , no 
propaganda value there. 

the fbi screwed up big time , all the time. they should have never allowed 
the situation to drag out like that. a quick second assault , before the 
bds could decide on a strategy , would have been the better plan. 

the bds themselves were the biggest screw ups though. they imagined 
that us law and us law enforcement had no jurisdiction within their 
little  . wrong ! they had no right whatsoever to fire on 
the batf , and if they mistook their identity initially , they should 
have surrendered at once when they did realize who they were. if the 
bds had a problem with the warrants , they take it to court , just like 
the rest of us. if they wanted full auto weapons , they could have 
obtained the proper permits , just like the rest of us would need to 
do. what they may not do is decide for themselves what us law applies 
to themselves and which does not. they get their chance like the rest 
of us at the voting booth .  . 

if the batf and fbi have become latter day gestapo , then they have 
become that way because we have desired them to be so. we get to 
vote on laws , and on the lawmakers .  . by our choices over the years , 
we have approved the creation and form of the batf and fbi .  . when 
the fbi was out chasing  pinkos  , the general public did n't seem 
to mind a bit of extra constitutional activity. when the batf is 
raiding militant black organizations , we do n't mind the heavy hand. 
when the fbi is around with the rights of , the 
public does n't mind. suddenly , when we see a bit of ourselves in 
the current  enemy  by these agencies , we get all bent out 
of shape. suprise ! you reap what you sow .  . 

waco was an encapsulation of the all american experience religious 
fanaticism , militaristic thinking and overwhelming violence .  . do n't 
blame it on  them  , the fbi and batf .  . they were just acting within 
the parameters we have set over the years. we made  . we are  .

in a previous article ,  ( dave bernard ) says 

just heard on the network radio news a spokesman from the 
army saying that the type of cs gas used in waco had been 
banned from military use. its use is also banned by a 
draft international agreement on the use of chemical 
weapons in warfare .  . 

the reason given was that the use causes extreme nausea , 
blindness , , total irrationality , raging paranoia .  . 

i do n't know about the paranoia and irrationality , but the rest is 
pretty close , all though you left out the inability to breath. of 
course you can make a claim that people will do some fairly deranged 
things to get away from it. i 've seen teenagers flatten  . drill 
sergeants to get out of tents full of it. which raises another 
issue .  .  .  .  . 

children would be all the more susceptible , and show the results all the 
earlier. 

this is the stuff janet reno was told would be safe for children. 

what they did n't mention is that in the open , it probably would n't do 
too much harm to children , although i would n't use it in close proximity 
to infants .  . on the other hand , in confined spaces , the effects are 
greatly intensified , to the point of lethality , since a sufficient 
quantity of cs will displace oxygen .  . when running a cs chamber careful 
attention is paid to ventilation .  . i wonder if they checked to see if 
any of the bds were or suffered from other respiratory 
diseases .  . i doubt it. 



if you were smarter , you 'd have these opinions .  .  .  .  .

this press conference considering the number of people killed , this 
seems very inappropriate to me. 


or , did anyone notice that when clinton referred to the davidians as 
 religious fanatics  that a round of spontaneous applause burst forth from 
the reporters

was the fact that they were wielded by people who believed that they 
ate breakfast every morning with jesus christ .  . now i was n't there in

just what the hell do you base that ludicrous claim on there are 
plenty of fine , decent people people who read post to t . p . g .  . if 
any of these people are paranoid it is because of people like you. 

hey dude you are making me paranoid ! what an argument ! ! ! 


while i would n't be too terribly impressed with anybody who got 
to be paranoid based on either usenet in general or phill hallam baker 's 
comments in general , you 'd be surprised. 

for most people , if you accuse them of something long enough and 
loud enough , to enough people , they start to ask why they 're bothering 
to fight it. 

if nothing you do will be considered right , why bother to do right 
it 's pretty basic human nature. 

i 'd have a spot of tea with them. ) you probably gave up on arguing the 
case for arms control directly long ago because posters who know 
what they are talking about (e . g .  . , frank crary ) disproved all your 
arguments for why more gun control is needed. so , you gave up because 
you know they are right and you could n't refute their answers. 

no , frank crary 's arguments are based on the assumption that most people 
are sane , normal people. tpg disproves this of gun owners. 

what an amazing thing. i did n't realize that over a hundred million 
gun owners all posted to tpg .  . 

even if all the posts in talk.politics.guns illustrated what 
you say they illustrate , it would still only reflect the written 
(which is often different from face to face ) of a very , very 
small and select group. 

anybody who seriously generalizes any attitudes or positions on 
usenet to the general population of any country either does n't care 
about accuracy or needs to have a few realities explained to them. 

usenet as a whole 
disproves it of humanity as a whole .  . 

speaking of which .  .  .  . 

most of the readership posts i 've seen put the most read 
newsgroups at about 160 , 000 readers , a number i have a feeling is 
fairly inflated .  . the posters , rare and regular , are a 
very tiny minority of that group. and the whole of usenet readers 
are themselves a very distorted sample of humanity .  . 

if anything , the only real thing you can get out of the relative 
sample of usenet readers is that we 've got too much equipment and too 
much time available to us. 

we now have proof positive that guns do n't make you safer .  . buy a lot of 
guns and you either get shot in the no knock raid or get the fbi to burn 
down your house. 

proof that guns do n't make you safer is that if you buy one the 
government will show up and kill you 

tell me , if the government took away the voting rights of 
everybody who exercised their free speech , would that then be proof 
that free speech political activity 

you are equating two things with each other that do n't .  . 

see even in the paranoid mindset of tpg there are good reasons 
to support gun control. 

phill , if you really believe that the various posts on 
computer nets represents either most of the poster 's in person 
personalities or the general public 's general opinions , then 
i have some serious reservations about your grasp on reality. 

but do n't expect you really do believe that. it 's simply 
a convenient way to make your point , and hopefully make those 
people you do n't like look bad.

bills at their local government. dozens of pro gun speakers 
show up and few if any do , but they often win anyway.

so , the only way the batf fbi could save those people , and future

the paucity of this line of argument is that it is provably false .  . 

texas state officials could and did investigate child abuse charges .  . 
they could and did apprehend koresh peaceably .  . the could and did

note that child abuse and similar accusations are state matters , not

read the constitution sometime , it is supposed to protect the citizens

some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an 
nism that is out of place in the 20th century. i'm not sure the swiss 
would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia , both 
organized and unorganized , fits into the defense plans of my state , 
mississippi .  . please do not assume that this describes something peculiar 
to one southern state. for instance , the commonwealth of massachusetts 
has a well organized militia which , members report , maintains stocks 
of both riot guns and machine guns. the laws of other states will vary 
but are probably similar. 

it appears it is time that this article  ( originally posted by larry 
cipriani last year , and which i saved ) gets posted again. it offers 
as good an analysis of the meaning of the second amendment , especially 
regarding the militia clause , as i have seen. i have not seen any 
with similar bone fides .  .  .  .

the unabridged second amendment 

by j. neil schulman 

if you wanted to know all about the big bang , you 'd ring up carl sagan , 
right and if you wanted to know about desert warfare , the man to call 
would be norman schwarzkopf , no question about it. but who would you call 
if you wanted the top expert on american usage , to tell you the meaning 
of the second amendment to the united states constitution 

that was the question i asked a.c. , editorial coordinator of the los 
angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton 
mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the 
foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system. mr. 
told me to get in touch with roy , a retired professor 
journalism at the university of southern california and the author of 
american usage and style the consensus .  . 

a little research lent support to 's opinion of professor 's 
expertise .  . 

roy was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades 
before embarking on a a distinguished 17 year career teaching journalism at 
usc .  . since 1952 , has been writing a column dealing with the 
professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher , a weekly 
magazine focusing on the journalism field. 

he 's on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary , and merriam 
webster 's usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert .  . 's 
fifth book on usage , american usage and style the consensus , has been in 
continuous print from van reinhold since 1981 , and is the winner 
of the association of american publisher 's humanities award. 

that sounds like an expert to me. 

after a brief telephone call to professor in which i introduced 
myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested , i sent 
the following letter 

i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in 
english usage , to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united 
states constitution , and extract the intent from the text. 

the text of the second amendment is ,  a well regulated militia , being 
necessary for the security of a free state , the right of the people to keep 
and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ' . 

the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the 
sentence ,  a well regulated militia , being necessary to the security of a 
free state  , is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause , with respect 
to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence , 'the 
right of the people to keep and bear arms , shall not be infringed . ' . 

i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into 
consideration issues of political impact or public policy , but be restricted 
entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent .  . further , 
since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation 
regarding the consequences of the second amendment , i ask that whatever 
analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to 
stand behind with your reputation , and even be willing to testify under 
oath to support , if necessary. 

my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment , 
then concluded 

i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task 
with this letter. i am doing so because , as a citizen , i believe it is 
vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment .  . 
while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of 
its results , i ask that you do this because of that importance .  . 

after several more letters and phone calls , in which we discussed terms for 
his doing such an analysis , but in which we never discussed either of our 
opinions regarding the second amendment , gun control , or any other political 
subject , professor sent me the follow analysis  ( into which i have 
inserted my questions for the sake of clarity ) 

the words  a well regulated militia , being necessary to the 
security of a free state , ' contrary to the interpretation cited in your 
letter of july 26 , 1991 , constitutes a present participle , rather than a 
clause .  . it is used as an adjective , modifying  militia , ' which is 
followed by the main clause of the sentence  ( subject 'the right' , verb 
'shall') .  . the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for 
maintaining a militia .  . 

in reply to your numbered questions 

schulman (1) can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep 
and bear arms solely to  a well regulated militia  

(1) the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear 
arms , nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by 
others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect 
to a right of the people. 

schulman (2) is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms  granted 
by the words of the second amendment , or does the second amendment assume a 
preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms , and merely state 
that such right  shall not be infringed  

(2) the right is not granted by the amendment its existence 
is assumed .  . the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be 
preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia .  . 

schulman (3) is the right of the people to keep and bear arms 
conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia , is , in fact 
necessary to the security of a free state , and if that condition is not 
existing , is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms , 
shall not be infringed  null and void 

(3) no such condition is expressed or implied .  . the right to 
keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence 
of a militia .  . no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the 
right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated 
militia as a requisite to the security of a free state. the right to keep 
and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence. 

schulman (4) does the clause  a well regulated militia , being necessary 
to the security of a free state , ' grant a right to the government to place 
conditions on the  right of the people to keep and bear arms , ' or is such 
right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence 

(4) the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional , as 
previously stated .  . it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the 
militia .  . 

schulman (5) which of the following does the phrase  well regulated 
militia  mean  well equipped  ,  well organized , '  well drilled , ' 
 well educated , ' or  subject to regulations of a superior authority  

(5) the phrase means  subject to regulations of a superior 
authority ' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian 
control over the military .  . 

schulman (6)  ( if at all possible , i would ask you to take account the 
changed meanings of words , or usage , since that sentence was written 200 
years ago , but not take into account historical interpretations of the 
intents of the authors , unless those issues can be clearly separated .  . 

to the best of my knowledge , there has been no change in the 
meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the 
amendment .  . if it were written today , it might be put since a 
well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state , the 
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged . ' . 

schulman as a  scientific control  on this analysis , i would also 
appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second 
amendment to the following sentence , 

a well schooled electorate , being necessary to the security of a free 
state , the right of the people to keep and read books , shall not be 
infringed . ' . 

my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be , 

(1) is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way 
the words modify each other , identical to the second amendment 's sentence 
and 

(2) could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people 
to keep and read books  only to  a well educated electorate  for 
example , registered voters with a high school diploma 

(1) your  scientific control  sentence precisely parallels the 
amendment in grammatical structure. 

(2) there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the 
possibility of a restricted interpretation .  . 

professor had only one additional comment , which he placed in his 
cover letter with well known human curiosity , i made some speculative 
efforts to decide how the material might be used , but was unable to reach 
any conclusion .  . 

so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what 
many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally 
protects the people 's right to keep and bear arms , forbidding all 
governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right. 

as i write this , the attempted coup against constitutional government in the 
soviet union has failed , apparently because the will of the people in that 
part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the 
old guard 's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power. 

and here in the united states , elected lawmakers , judges , and appointed 
officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states 
ignore , marginalize , or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely .  . 
american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms , owning 
arms of forbidden sorts , or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements 
regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an 
abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms , 
guaranteed by the constitution .  . 

and even the american civil liberties union  ( aclu ) , staunch defender of the 
rest of the bill of rights , stands by and does nothing. 

it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to 
preserve that right. no one else will. no one else can. will we beg our 
elected representatives not to take away our rights , and continue regarding 
them as representing us if they do will we continue obeying judges who 
decide that the second amendment does n't mean what it says it means but 
means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak 

or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice , as the constitution 
of the united states promises us we can , and pledge that we will defend 
that promise with our lives , our fortuned , and our sacred honor

hello , 

i just want to make 2 points 

1) the fbi is not stupid. these people are chosen for their intelligence , 
education , loyalty to the government , etc. they are given much intensive 
training. so , to all of you who refuse to believe there could be any 
conspiracy here , and say that the fbi was just stupid , i say i do n't 
believe it. 

2) the fbi has acces to the latest in audio and video technology the 
latest digital systems. the fbi can manufacture evidence. need a tape of 
koresh saying , light the fire , and you can have one. need a thermal 
imaging video of three people lighting fires , and through the magic of 
computer graphics , you can have one. the thing is , manufacturing these 
pieces of evidence takes time. so it may be a few more days before we 
get to see them. or maybe we just have n't heard any tapes or seen any 
fbi video is because it is 
1) classified 
2) too gruesome for our eyes 
3) lost got coffee spilled on it

knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan. 

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the 
burning building 

in this case , it was unimportant as to who set the fire. the davidians 
would have burned no matter what , especially if the batf fbi set the 
fire as this would make the martyrs to vernon howell and 
therefore rocket to heaven. a few comments from the remaining 
davidians scattered throughout the country seemed to confirm this 
theory  ( one cult member said that she wished that she had been there , 
and that now she would have to wait for vernon to return for them. she 
actually seemed upset that she did not burn with them) .  . 

while i think that vernon started the fire  ( his followers anyway) , 
it is incidental to their reaction.

judgment at waco 

now the scientific and political scrutiny of the 
horror show in waco begins , though nothing can 
undo the tragedy that might have been prevented 
there. 
forensic experts will study the rubble and 
ashes of the branch davidian compound , where at 
least 85 people , including 24 children , perished in 
smoke and fire caused by visions of 
a manipulative madman and a stunning lapse in 
judgment by federal law enforcement officials .  . 
emphasis added by me 
investigators will re create conditions at the 
compound and identify and other fac 
the inferno .  . that is their strong suit. 
but the public must question why agents of the 
federal bureau of investigation lacked the oper 
skill and teh behavioral insight to resolve 
the 51 day standoff free of flames and fury .  . 
the loss of life most clearly reflects the 
tia of cult leader david koresh , whose personal 
are now on the public conscious 
ness .  . his assembly of davidians had stockpiles of 
arms and had used them. little in the way of 
rationality could be expected from koresh , a self 
sinner without equal .  . 
what continues to are th of 
federal agents , who bungled the case from the 
start. the misadventure began on feb. 28 when 
100 agents of the federal bureau of alcohol , to 
and firearms the compound , intent 
on seizing koresh and a cache of automatic 
ons .  . four agents and an estimated six cult mem 
died ensuing gun battle. earlier 
to isolate and arrest koresh outside the 
complex had not been adequately explored .  . 
authorities prepared a siege and resolved that 
those deaths would be the last. fifty one days into 
the siege there was no public outcry to storm the 
compound .  . 
it had been correctly perceived that the 
inside apocalypse were essentially 
hostages .  . with their lives at stake , there was no 
reason for the government to be impatient .  . the 
government 's superior firepower , control of water 
and utilities and freedom of movement created the 
conditions for a belated but bloodless resolution. 
neither attorney general janet reno nor the 
fbi has provided a sigle compelling reason for 
the course of patience. 
if intelligence was accurate and koresh was 
growing increasingly violent and bizarre , it is 
cult to see how a tear gas attack launched by an 
m 60 combat vehicle would clear his mind. if re 
ports of escalating child abuse were accurate , they 
would have to be weighted against the potential for 
eve  . 


etc etc tec .  .  .  .  . 
paragraphs , 2.5 paragraphs deleted 

but some of the responsibility rests with clinton , 
and inexperienced president who did not pay 
enough attention to the life and death decisions 
being made on waco .  . 
if reno is to be faulted for anything , ti would 
be for her on the judgment of law en 
officers a common problem among 
prosecutors .  . 
full investigations into th tragedy must 
be conducted by both the executive and legislative 
branches .  . the first step is to verify how the blaze 
started. though blame will play a 
role , it is of greater to find strategies 
to elude the fire next time.

good. keep thinking critically .  . 

while i believe that koresh is largely 
responsible for not ending this standoff in a manner during the 
last 51 days of patient opportunity , i find the secrecy surrounding the 
aftermath more damaging to the authorities  position than they realize .  . 

what if the secrecy is actually less damaging than the alternative

tha 
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if 
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types 
of common incidents .  . 

if you 're a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps 
you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the 
rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps 
with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners 
spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death 
among children in the u.s. is a serious problem. 

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children 
ages 14 and under .  . i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental 
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents .  . 
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths 
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a 
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental 
gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane 
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents 
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. 


any death is serious. wanna discuss match control firearms related 
unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or 
more negligent persons , not the gun. 

more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the 
community. in that sense , i think they might do a little good. 

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good. 

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police 
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by 
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond 
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i 
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were 
useful. 


providing false hope , then , is the intent 


i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or 
brought to school by youths on a daily basis  ( about 135 , 000 youths ) are 
obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often 
borrowed from a parent without their knowledge. 

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i 
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of 
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun) 
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students 
who carry a gun to school daily. 

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence 
or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see 
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths .  . 
the reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that 
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates 
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once 
in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key 
children  ( kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access 
to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200 increase in 
student gun between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between 
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in 
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 .  . these are the statistics . 


200 increase in california schools , eh gun control is working fine , there ! 


thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah  ( got news 
for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours 
presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they 
were in  . 

holding kids time for a reality check , son. these kids were the 
children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were 
outside waiting to kill them. would you send your children out the door 
if you believed as they did 

okay , maybe i worded it wrong .  .  . dad .  . i meant that to put children in a 
situation  ( fortified compound ) where harm could come to them is not the 
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over 
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is 
would not let innocent children die. 
if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why 
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them 
burn alive thanks for the reality check joe , its been real. 

so your religion is different. does that make it his wrong even assuming 
koresh actually made that decision , and the verdict is still out on that.

no surrender ! 
delivered by lenda jackson at the rkba rally in denver , april 18 , 1993 

it is a fact of modern life that urban residents , particularly women , feel 
threatened .  . a certain number of them actually are threatened .  . there are 
immediate threats , the things that women will tell you they 're afraid 
of. the noise downstairs at night. the lonely walk to the car. the 
stranger at the door. the abusive husband , finally kicked out of the 
house as he threatens to hurt her and their children. the  .  .  . the 
mugger .  .  . the . rapist .  . 

and what are we told is the solution move. get a dog. keep the door 
locked .  . call the police .  . as a next to last resort , learn martial arts .  . and 
always , there 's the implied question what 's a pretty little thing like 
you doing without a husband around to protect you 

but what if you do n't like dogs like living alone do n't have 10 
years to devote learning judo 

what if , after examining the facts , a woman learns that rape victims 
using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed 
and were less likely to be  ( injured(kleck , 124 ) than those using any 
other form of resistance  ( kleck , 126 )  ( also true for 
robbery  ( assault)(kleck ) , 123 ) 

what if , to our horror and despair , we find that citizens cannot depend 
on the police for effective protection they usually respond after a 
crime has been committed .  . in truth , the supreme court has held that 
the police are not responsible for protecting any individual , only the 
whole community. 

as a society , are we going to ask women , once again , to sacrifice 
themselves are we going to continue to deny women the ability to 
help themselves 

here 's a thought. neil smith , in his book the probability broach , says 
no 220 pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a 110 
pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out. but if 
a woman decides to protect herself , with the easiest , most efficient 
means possible , people especially other women are horrified .  . 
, how could you i 'd be terrified ! they ask. how could you 
hurt someone they 'll repeat the lie it 'll just get taken away from 
you. in truth , 1 of defensive gun uses result in the offender taking 
the gun away from the victim . , kleck ) 

well , despite the lies , and the social pressure , some of us have already 
made that hard choice. we 've decided that we are not going to be 
victimized by the muggers , burglars or rapists .  . we 're buying more 
guns than every before. we 're learning how to use them and teaching 
others , women and men , how to use them. most importantly , we are 
preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense .  . 
we 're taking our own security , literally , into our own hands. we 're 
going to stop begging and pleading and marching and what we 
intend is to really take back the night. 

but there 's another threat , more than any mugger , more 
secretive than any , more soul destroying than any rapist .  . 

that menace is government , and it threatens us all. we know that 
governments , throughout time , have suppressed rights and oppressed 
people. it 's the way they survive. 

in our names and with our money , it interferes with innocent people 
both at home and abroad .  . it lies to us , cheats us , steals from us and 
threatens us with violence .  . no one knows exactly what it 'll do next 
what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides 
it 's for your own safety or we know best . any person who acted 
like government does would be within an inch of his 
life and locked up as a habitual offender .  . 

but this monster called government persists , and grows .  . and we , who 
should be its masters , have become its unwilling slaves .  . do you doubt 
me then why did you file your income tax 

like any reasonable person , i believe that being afraid of something 
that can hurt you is smart , and that paranoia is n't crazy if someone 's 
really after you. and make no mistake , they 're after you and they 're 
after me. their names are familiar brady and reynolds , , 
, moynihan , and clinton .  . if we 're lucky , they 'll settle for 
our assault rifles , our shotguns , our handguns and our ammunition .  . 

as citizens , we have only two choices. they are the same two choices 
given to women to surrender or to fight. 

surrender leads to the gulag , to the genocide of pol pot , to the 
, to  . i do not intend to surrender .  . 

a battle can be philosophical or political in the main , the people keep 
the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office. but if 
they have to , they will keep in mind the words of thomas jefferson 
the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots .  . 

as a patriot , i will point out the error in the government 's ways. i will 
do my best to vote the villains out of office. i will protest , and write , 
and speak , and teach our children justice , honor and truth. and always 
remember that rebellion can lead to bunker hill and saratoga .  .  .  .  .  . or . it 
can lead to tiananmen square .  . 

when the time comes to stand up , if i have to give my life to keep 
them from going too far , if there is a tiananmen square in our future , 
i intend to be there. and no matter what lies they tell and no matter 
what laws they pass , i intend to meet them with something more 
substantial in my hand than a brick .  . 

my opinions are , of course , my own.

original article 

the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal 's article 
on paxton quigley , including the nefarious little paragraph the journal 
tacked onto the end. after recieving much assistance from various t . p . g .  . 
type folks , i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph , 
and surprise , surprise , surprise , they published it. the text follows .  . 
the colorado daily , btw , is the university of colorado  ( boulder ) student 
(i think) newspaper .  .  .  . not exactly a big coup , but every little bit , i guess .  .  .  . 

(the title was the only thing they changed added) 

gun stats 

the daily recently reprinted an article from the 
wall street journal , primarily concerned with paxton 
quigley , author of armed and female. the article , 
in turn , cites a misleading statistic that was originally 
reported in the new england journal of medicine. the 
article states , a study .  .  .  . found that a gun in the home 
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner , 
spouse , a friend , or child than to kill an intruder .  . this 
is an often quoted statistic , and it is misleading for 
reasons , outlined below 

the study gives the impression that , if you own a 
gun , the likelihood that you will successfully use it to 
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned 
against you. the study , however , fails to take into 
account cases where a law abiding citizen uses a gun 
to thwart a crime , without actually killing the 
 . 

the study actually refers to  acquaintances  rather 
than  . this would include the friendly 
thug who shows up like , every 
month , the second your grandmother her social 
security check. possibly an acquaintance , but hardly a 
friend. 

the nejm study is based on the immediate dis 
position of cases and fails to take into account cases 
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be 
self defense .  . especially considering the small sample 
size  ( 396 ) , taking these events into account has a sub 
effect on the 43 1 ratio quoted .  . 

criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif 
statistic a gun is 33 times more likely to be 
used , successfully , by a private citizen against an 
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further , per 
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a 
gun fare better than those who resist by 
some other means , or who offer no resistance at all. 
statistics available from the fbi and other agencies 
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be 
used by a non criminal to defend against criminal threat 
than to be used to commit criminal homicide , 535 times 
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal 
threat than to accidentally kill anybody , and 50 times 
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be 
used to commit suicide .  . 

it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can 
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has 
to consider carefully what questions were asked by 
those gathering the data before one can draw an 
rate conclusion from them.

according to an ap report (from texas , written by aron ) this morning , 
in to the gas pumped in by from cs generators , canisters of 
tear gas were thrown into the building from armored vehicles , one of the 
canisters hitting a man inside in the face. 

this was in the part of the article before going into differences in

nothing could at this point. what would have gone a long way toward 
convincing me would have been media video , particularly from diverse 
sources. imho , if the government did n't have anything to hide , they 
would have allowed cameras near the compound from the beginning. 

i agree , i saw no reason they could not have had close in pool 
cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever. 

points made by dick , koresh 's lawyer 
the tanks were not pumping cs gas but were ejecting exploding 
canisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls 
before exploding .  . 

okay , their word against the fbi 's at this point. see ya in court ! 

the tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people 
at great risk. 

dear , dear. they could have come out. 

the construction of the used almost all used materials that 
were very dry and of hay were stacked against the walls as 
shields against the government 's bullets .  . 

okay , they were living in a fire hazard .  . that they built .  . 

said that previous to the invasion there were no military drills 
and that the supplies they had on hand were for survival .  . 

no crime , irrelevant either way. 

their gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible 
study and some were sleeping when the fire was set. 

ah yes , that is exactly what i would do. hold bible study. take a nap .  . 
always a wise course of action when you 're being gassed .  . 

there was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his 
aids after the tank invasion  ( referring to any kind of suicide 
pact or counter assault efforts . ) . 

i do n't believe there was a suicide pact . i believe that koresh 
wanted a fiery conflagration ... which he may not have told his followers. 
in fact , this hypothesis is confirmed by the survivors  stories. 

everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape 
the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set. 

yes , that 's right. and once the whole compound was demolished , where 
did they expect to go 

women and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from 
the tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the 
building and distorting the frames .  . 

the building is being rammed and they are going upstairs that 's almost 
as bad as running into a fire. 

ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for 
the fire and trapped almost everyone in place. his experts have told 
him that this chimney effect is what made the fire appear 
to have started at several places at once. 

hm , an interesting notion .  . we 'll see. 

koresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to 
be in his 4th floor room with some of his children. 

more bible study , no doubt. hey , it 's a priority . 

the texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies 
recovered so far had bullet wounds , directly contradicting the fbi 's 
lies .  . 

actually , on friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and 
he could not flatly contradict the federal agents  claims .  . we 'll know 
more later. in any event , it 's irrelevant .  . 

the survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten 
out they would have , that they were trapped by the tank destroyed 
building and the speed of the fire. 

for six hours they were trapped the building was not destroyed 
immediately. they could have left at any time. 

the underground bunker cited by the fbi as the place koresh could have 
put the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked 
by the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door. 

six hours to move it away. or come out. 

dick said that he had sat in koresh 's bedroom talking to him and 
had observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without 
air condition or other luxuries , directly contradicting the fbi 's claim 
that he lived in splendor .  . 

irrelevant , anyway. pr one way or the other , but no crime or innocence 
indicated .  . 

dick saw bullet holes in koresh 's room made from the outside in 
which indicates the batf was indiscriminately shooting down through 
the roof. 

no word on whether they were being fired back at , which is an operative 
question here. 

the fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over coleman lanterns 
that were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted 
through , though none of the survivors saw the fire start. 

right. for six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at 
any point , and you leave a coleman lantern burning .  . near bales of hay .  . 

every one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the 
fbi about starting the fire , hearing someone say the fire was lit 
or any of the other stuff attributed to them by the fbi .  . 

it 's ultimately irrelevant who lit the fire. they had ample opportunity 
to leave. 

he said when he first met koresh in the compound he expected to find 
a raving lunatic but instead found a rational , charming and intelligent 
young man and was very surprised by that fact. 

most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent , actually. they tend 
to be excellent actors and skilled  . (ex .  . ted bundy . ) . 

koresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain. 

medical assistance was jsut a phone call away. gee , all he had to do 
was come out. 

women with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids 
that were appointed as nicely as koresh 's .  . 

not relevant to any crimes .  . 

dick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time 
did he ever see any signs of abuse .  . 

while he was there. anyway , outsiders rarely see abuse .  . it 's a secretive 
thing. all we have to go on are the court documents in the case 
and the mistrial in california .  . 

no one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any 
time. the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their 
own choices. 

exactly. by their own choice. 

he called for an independent prosecutor .  . if ever there were a need 
for one , this is it. 

looks like there will be several investigations , starting with congressional 
committee hearings next week .  .  .  .  . 

his closing comments were they do n't look upon themselves as a cult .  . 
they view themselves as highly religious people. they sincerely believe 
what they believe. and who am you or i to judge that as wrong 

his last sentence says it all. who the hell are we  ( or the government) 
to judge their religion as wrong. this event , i hope , will be recorded 
in history as the american holocaust .  . these people were murdered 
by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis .  . 
i hang my head in shame for what i 've allowed my government to become .  . 

i have never judged them by their religion , but by their actions .  . 

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would 
have been no raid , no siege , and no deaths .  . instead , they chose courses 
of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not 
irrational .  . the first was to stockpile weapons .  . the second was to 
shoot federal agents .  . the third was to stay inside. 

just as we do n't blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy 
weapon at him , i do n't think the fbi deserves blame in this case.

jason i 've heard the people who are talking about this dismissed as 
conspiracy nuts , but nobody seems to be talking about a conspiracy , at 
least at the beginning. there were a lot of bad decisions that went into 
this tragedy , and some people may now be taking some serious evasive 
action to avoid being held responsible for the unexpected results of 
those bad decisions. actually , the only ones i see that are tied into 
a conspiracy theory are the ones raving about deranged cultists with 
stockpiles of weapons and suicide  . 


admittedly mistakes were made but why attribute them to rather 
than stupidity 

i think there are a lot of us that have been following this pretty closely 
from the beginning , and we woud probably agree that this tragedy was more 
the result of stupidity than  .

for me , though , the black soot billowing outside the compound added with 
how fast the fire spread to someone dousing large parts of the 
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire starter .  . 
lots of house fires give off black smoke. and as far as 
the speed of the fire the winds were to 30mph at least 
that day. i guess you 're forgetting the way oakland and berkeley

people like you our constitution by using it to defend 
who are n't deserved of it. get a life and chill on the paranoia .  . 


i do n't care about cults . there 's no language problem here. my problem is 
with religious fanatics  ( claiming to be god is just a little bit 
unsettling ) stockpiling several years' supply of canned foods and enough 
weapons to hold off a company (not to mention the atf , which ed up in 
the first place) and talking about how they 're going to take care of all 
of the unbelievers .  . but granted , up to that moment , he 'd done nothing 
wrong. i recognize and respect that. 

then the atf discovers he does n't have proper permits for some of his 
purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them. 


a batf offense , if true. 

then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child 
abuse be  . there have been interviews with some parents whose 
children were in the compound at some point. these parents claimed 
psychological and sexual abuse .  . the childrens  statements supported these 
charges .  . 

a local offense , if true. totally outside the batf 's domain .  . 


was it a  no knock ' i really have n't heard anything on that. but clearly 
he was not just another guy minding his own business. hell , give them all 
the guns in the world if they do n't bother anyone. but he was a scary sort , 
do n't you think 

i did n't know the man. just what the tv chose to tell me. 

the sort of person you 'd want your daughter to date 

i thought there were prejudicial here. i would trust my daughter 's 
judgement .  . 

i 
did n't think so. reason number one to doubt the legal statements made by 
some of the survivors .  .  ( note that some of them were made by his  guard , ' 
well hesitate to say trained  . 

i do n't believe either side blindly .  . 

then he fired on the atf .  . that 's not just a little mistake , or some 
red white and blue american defending his home against big brother. 

if they fired first , without announcing in a way who they were ( i 
can pound on your door and claim to be the police , will you just lay down and 
take it if i do ) , then he could be justified in firing on the atf in 
self defense .  . 

that 
shit does n't fly. anyone with his background that will shoot and kill 
federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade 
enjoys our support. he 's a loose cannon .  . just my opinion .  .  .  .

then post what the press has said , not what you wished they said. 
the medical examiner has refuted the fbi facts and if you do n't 
believe someone who has a lot more reason to be impartial then 
what do you have to say for yourself. 

in the interest of accuracy  ( seems a late to start 
that , i know) the medical examiner has not contradicted 
the fbi .  . 

the fbi said they found some folks who had been shot in 
the head , and the medical examiner said we have not seen 
evidence of this . 

at the time the medical examiner said that , they were dealing 
with bodies in the compound this sounds like 
typical medical examiner not releasing details until 
a thorough investigation .  . the medical examiner saying 
he has n't seen something is not the same thing as saying 
that it is n't there.

falsely , it is n't clear yet that they have.

no , you were right the first time. law enforcement agencies should keep 
his opinions in mind before breaking into or assaulting anybody s house. 

ok , let me correct my unfortunate choice of words i just hope that the 
law enforcement agencies keep your attitude in mind the next time your 
wife is gang raped by a bunch of juvenile , drug dealing thugs while she 
was jogging in the park. no , strike that .  .  .  . ) . 

the batf came out with horse , 100 men , ninja uniforms , machine 
guns , and stun grenades , and used them before koresh could even look 
at the warrant .  . koresh fought back , and people died. 

the key part of this is koresh fought back. this was his big 
mistake. when the police decide to exert their authority over you , you 
do n't fight back unless you want people to get hurt. you cease all 
resistance and signal your submission to their authority .  . the cops 

they are the boss. you are the subject. the concept of defense against 
illegal action under color of law is kaput .  . no longer is it government 
of the people by the people , its government of the people by the biggest 
guns. the idea of  sorting it out in court later  is fine , but one 
has to get to court in one piece to do that. had good reason 
to think that he was not going to get that chance.  ( see below) .  . 

are n't in it to beat up and kill people , in spite of the actions of a 
few bad apples .  . if you quit resisting , they quit hitting .  . perhaps the 
batf did over react to the threat posed by koresh .  . perhaps they did use 
too much force. ok , fine. i'm willing to concede to that point if 
sufficient proof is produced  ( and i admit that there is some evidence to 
indicate this) .  . however , resisting the batf is the worst thing koresh 
could have done. if they had n't resisted , there is a good chance that 
no one would have been hurt. remeber , they were using stun grenades , 
not anti personnel grenades .  . if the bds were not in violation of any 

rember , did n't get to sort this all out , serenely typing at his 
keyboard. he heard some kind of explosives go off , he saw he was being 
attacked with no overt action from him (yet) .  . he could no more say  oh , 
its ok , its only stun grenades  anymore than i could. he slammed the door at 
that point and proceeded to repel the attackers .  . he felt in genuine fear 
of his life i know i would be in fear of my life at that point. have 
you ever been shot at how clear and logically could you think , under 
that pressure , when you might have all of 1 or 2 seconds to evaluate 
what is going on and , it would not be the first time that  law 
 intended to bring in their suspect horizontally .  . for 
all we know , he was informed by someone saying something like hey , 
guy , the batf is coming like , and they mean to waste you .  .  .  . 

according to the latest news , the released warrant (so we are told ) said 
the reason for this ww iii raid was that 's group had spent around 
200 , 000.00 on firearms and related stuff  ( over an undetermined  . 
now , even assuming that the figure is n't calculated like the feds do a 
drug , for 90 people , that is n't really all that much  ( you priced 
decent guns lately ) .  . hell , i can think of a person right now that probably 
has that much for one individual , mostly machineguns ! ! ! sure , he is 
an avid collector , but unless a new law has been passed , it is not illegal , 
nor an indication of anything illegal , to have a lot of guns. also note 
that the warrant had nothing to say about machine guns. so , what 
is the justification of this cowboy raid , other than a gone bad 
for some anti gun media hype , to support clinton 's push for disarming 
the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons 
this administration has only one thing in mind. control. people control. 
whether it is gun control , clinton cripple chip , national smart id cards , 
it all boils down to people control. can you say 1984 , only 10 years late 
i knew you could .  .  .  . ) 

laws , they would have been released as they had been before. if this 
had happened and it turned out that the batf had used too much force , 
then the bds would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges 
of civil rights violations  ( sounds a lot like la , huh do n't take that 
wrong , i'm not commenting one way or the other about the rodney king 
case) .  . but that 's not what they wanted. they got tipped off that the 
batf was on the way in , and rather than adopting a non violent , 
non threatening posture to greet the batf , they decided to fight. 

and batf knew the bds were expecting them  ( via 60 minutes  . but 
they decided they were so big , so bad , they would have a cakewalk at 
the bds expense , for a nice media show anyway. but it all turned to 
shit , and the fbi taking over to manage things , we see it all turned to 
shit , too. clinton says  i am taking full  .  .  .  . 
responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong. bet 
you nobody pays any serious repercussions .  .  responsibility  only has 
meaning as media pr , or as a means to corner the average joe schmoe .  . 
figure it out .  .  .  . clinton , reno , the fbi and batf , will all be immune .  . 
can you say whitewash 

i 've said enough of this issue. i'm probably not going to convince any 
of you folks and you 're certainly not going to convince me. i 've got 
work to do. 

don 

be very afraid of our government. in the land of the free .  .  .  . 
and if you decide all this is acceptable , get even more afraid .  .  .  . especially 
when it is you they decide , for some reason , they dislike .  .  .  .

good now let 's look at those sections .  . they 'll prove my point. 

(a) a person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he

(4) carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person

any pistol , revolver , stun gun or taser or other firearm 

note that this does n't affect all concealed carry .  .  ( look after the

thomas parsli writes 

remember me , tom i hope you 'll respond , and i seem to 
be a voice of reason or some such (i 've been recieving fan mail , 
so naturally my ego is inflated of late) , and hope to 
make a few points here. 

i have never spoken for a ban against guns in america ! 
what i 've said is that there seems to be to many of them , and especially 
to many in wrong hands .  .  .  .  . 

and our argument is that you cannot remove them from the people 
who need restricting and not remove them from the people who do n't .  . a 
fairly simple problem , given our size and numbers. do you agree we 
all believe criminals , particularly violent criminals , should not have 
firearms .  . the problem is making a law that does this without 
upon the rights of the vast majority .  . nobody here seems to be able to 
do it , and i doubt anybody in norway can either. thus , we are left with 
a philosophical difference does the safety of a few justify restricting 
the many we say no , while others say yes. 

now if you would like to reduce the number , how would you do it without 
affecting good gun owners 

can you provide a method that cannot be abused i doubt it. 

i do believe in a persons freedom .  . 
what i do n't believe is that you can have it all and do n't pay for it. 

of course. this is not in contention .  . what is in contention 
is how much one has to pay. 

most europeans believe in a society of individuals , and that you have 
to give  a little  to make that society work. 

it is this giving a little that makes americans wary .  .  .  . 
we have seen this argument before. you might remember how a 
chamberlain gave a little to a particular fascist short asshole , 
and how such appeasement worked. while it might work in some 
instances , it does n't work in others , and since we cannot predict 
the future we must be cautious in using actions that have a 
history of failure. 

cars and guns should really not be mixed , i just tried to make a point. 
like america , norway has some spaces you have to cross to get from a to b , 
so a car is essential in most parts .  .  .  .  . 
guns on the other hand are not essential in norway , so we do n't 
argue that if we  banned  guns we have to ban cars .  .  .  .  .  . 

cars are not essential in norway any more than they are in 
the usa .  . i'm willing to bet that you have neighbors that would be 
willing to drive you anywhere you wanted to go for a price. thus , 
cars are not essential for your transportation .  . however , the 
arguments presented show that , since cars are used to kill far more 
people than guns in the usa , it makes much more sense to restrict 
cars than it does guns. how one defines essential often depends 
upon what one is willing to go through for that service. when we 
look at the raw data , such comparisons are not individually weighed .  . 

everyone who believe that hitler and ww2 could be avoided if there were 
more guns in germany in the 30 's please read some history ! 

this depends upon what the populace was willing to do. as 
desert storm proved , even an armed populace wo n't just revolt even 
when given a chance. still , would hitler have done all that he did 
with an armed populace we have to wonder , as some of his first 
acts were to confiscate firearms .  . other points in history show 
that dictators were overthrown by arms in the hands of the populace .  . 
thus , we 're left wondering if hitler would have been overthrown 
or if king george was just unlucky in keeping the usa as a colony .  . 
one can argue both sides one also has to live with each action. 

is this discussion about 
1. banning weapons for all americans 
or 
2. making it harder for criminals to get one 

it is about 2 , but so far all proposals to curtail 2 have 
wound up enforcing 1 as well. i only wish that or was so logical .  . 

change of name .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . 

that was , on my part , purely in jest .  . i merely pointed out 
how we were from similar backgrounds racially , but of wholly different 
backgrounds politically .  . i thought this would underscore my point on 
how our cultures were so different despite similar heritage .  . 

did the batf get the warrant for a gun search only or was there other reasons. 
 ( child abuse for instance) 

batf can only enforce gun alcohol violations .  . child 
abuse is a matter for the individual states and local authorities .  . 

does n't the people reading this newsgroup have access to the clari . news .  . 
(some seems rather mis uninformed ) 

that hierarchy is a paid for feed at many sites. most people do 
not get it for this reason , and i suspect money , not censorship , is the 
main reason. do you get alt.sex at your site i ca n't read it here 
because of censorship and legal fears , so again our differences show. 
you have topless sunbathing , and in the usa we can watch a murder every

i wrote a letter the other day to america the organization 
which claims to be conservative issues , esp. in the wake 
of the republican defeat last fall. 

some might consider them just a an organization to create a network of 
support among conservatives for some individuals in prep .  . for '96 run. 

you 'd be close to the truth. 

their two leading are bill bennett , former  drug czar  who heartily 
supported bush 's semi auto import ban , and wondered if it went far enough 
who helped put the big lie about  sporting use  into the public 's eye and 
jack kemp who recently came out in support of semi auto bans .  . 

these are conservatives 

anyway i thought it interesting that when i ran word perfect 's spell check 
against my letter it came up with the following corrections for  bennett  

1. banned 
2. bayonet 


needless to say , i found these choices rather amusing. 



it vs individualism is an ancient conflict .  . men have come 
close to the truth , but it was destroyed each time and one civilization fell

unsettling ) stockpiling several years' supply of canned foods

no crime here. 

(not to mention the atf , which ed up in

of the unbelievers .  . 

no crime here. 
also no substantiation of your claim that koresh said this. i for one have 
never heard this mentioned before. where did you hear it 

but granted , up to that moment , he 'd done nothing 
wrong. i recognize and respect that. 

up to which moment the one where you decided that anyone who claims to be 
god no longer has the protection of the constitution 
what happened to the separation of church and state 

then the atf discovers he does n't have proper permits for some of his 
purchases and failed to pay some taxes on them. 

i have yet to see any evidence of this , either. from what i hear the 
original warrant (the reason for the feb. raid ) is still sealed .  . what are 
unsealed seem to be warrants taken out after the initial raid .  . 

then several parents come forward and demand that previous charges of child 
abuse be  . there have been interviews with some parents whose 
children were in the compound at some point. 

funny , i have n't seen any of these interviews .  . 
interesting that when the social services agencies investigated koresh on 
these previous charges , they found absolutely no evidence of abuse .  . 

these parents claimed 
psychological and sexual abuse .  . the childrens  statements supported these 
charges .  . 

funny , i do n't remember hearing anything about childrens  statements , 
either. where did you say you heard all this 

what i heard was that none of the children who left the compound early in 
the seige exhibited any signs typical of abuse , physical or mental .  . this 
from the newspaper and national tv news. 

did you also hear that it 's the job of the batf and the fbi to lay siege to 
homes where child abuse is suspected i thought you did. 

was it a  no knock ' i really have n't heard anything on that. but clearly 
he was not just another guy minding his own business. 

clearly please tell us what koresh was doing that can be construed as 
other than minding his own business before the batf raided the place. 

hell , give them all 
the guns in the world if they do n't bother anyone. but he was a scary sort , 
do n't you think the sort of person you 'd want your daughter to date i 
did n't think so. reason number one to doubt the legal statements made by 
some of the survivors .  . 

your logic just amazes me. i think your grandparents who died in 
auschwitz would be turning over in their graves if they could hear how 
you throw away people 's protection of law because you think 
they 're scary and not the sort of person you 'd want your daughter to 
date. what sort of people do you suppose the nazis thought your 
grandparents were probably not the sort they 'd want their little 
dating .  .  .  . 

 ( note that some of them were made by his  guard , ' 
well hesitate to say trained  . 

and next i suppose you 'll tell us exactly who these well trained killers 
have killed 

then he fired on the atf .  . that 's not just a little mistake , or some 
red white and blue american defending his home against big brother. that 
shit does n't fly. 

because you said so , right right. 

anyone with his background that will shoot and kill 
federal law enforcement officials is not some good citizen whose crusade 
enjoys our support. 

so someone with a different background , say someone who did n't claim to be 
the messiah , in your book could shoot and kill federal law enforcement 
officials would be a good citizen whose crusade enjoys our support 

he 's a loose cannon .  . just my opinion .  .  .  .

the colorado daily recently reprinted the wall street journal 's article 
on paxton quigley , including the nefarious little paragraph the journal 
tacked onto the end. after recieving much assistance from various t . p . g .  . 
type folks , i wrote a letter to the editor criticizing this last paragraph , 
and surprise , surprise , surprise , they published it. the text follows .  . 
the colorado daily , btw , is the university of colorado  ( boulder ) student 
(i think) newspaper .  .  .  . not exactly a big coup , but every little bit , i guess .  .  .  . 

(the title was the only thing they changed added) 

gun stats 

the daily recently reprinted an article from the 
wall street journal , primarily concerned with paxton 
quigley , author of armed and female. the article , 
in turn , cites a misleading statistic that was originally 
reported in the new england journal of medicine. the 
article states , a study .  .  .  . found that a gun in the home 
was 43 times more likely to be used to kill its owner , 
spouse , a friend , or child than to kill an intruder .  . this 
is an often quoted statistic , and it is misleading for 
reasons , outlined below 

the study gives the impression that , if you own a 
gun , the likelihood that you will successfully use it to 
defend yourself is less than that of the gun being turned 
against you. the study , however , fails to take into 
account cases where a law abiding citizen uses a gun 
to thwart a crime , without actually killing the 
 . 

the study actually refers to  acquaintances  rather 
than  . this would include the friendly 
thug who shows up like , every 
month , the second your grandmother her social 
security check. possibly an acquaintance , but hardly a 
friend. 

the nejm study is based on the immediate dis 
position of cases and fails to take into account cases 
originally filed as homicides that were later ruled to be 
self defense .  . especially considering the small sample 
size  ( 396 ) , taking these events into account has a sub 
effect on the 43 1 ratio quoted .  . 

criminologist gary kleck gives us a slightly dif 
statistic a gun is 33 times more likely to be 
used , successfully , by a private citizen against an 
aggressor than it is to kill anyone at all. further , per 
sons defending themselves from aggression by using a 
gun fare better than those who resist by 
some other means , or who offer no resistance at all. 
statistics available from the fbi and other agencies 
also show that a gun is 245 times more likely to be 
used by a non criminal to defend against criminal threat 
than to be used to commit criminal homicide , 535 times 
more likely to be used to defend against a criminal 
threat than to accidentally kill anybody , and 50 times 
more likely to defend against criminal threat than to be 
used to commit suicide .  . 

it is well to keep in mind that nearly anything can 
be proved by uncritical quotation of statistics. one has 
to consider carefully what questions were asked by 
those gathering the data before one can draw an 
rate conclusion from them.

i agree that koresh was as much of a victim as a perpetrator this because 
he grew up inside the cult , and engaged in a power struggle where his 
supporters helped inflate his ego .  . 

that does n't change the fact that he was a loose fucking cannon with a

david koresh 's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out 
peacefully sooner or later. the fbi and atf had nothing but time on 
their hands ! why did they have to escalate the situation and cause 
this senseless tragedy their job is to protect the public and save 
lives not kill people for crying out loud .  . 

koresh had lied and lied and lied about coming out of the 
compound .  . to the fbi .  . to his lawyer .  . to just about everyone. 

i keep hearing this , but every assertion of this form has come from 
government sources except two. as far as i am concerned , i am not 
ready to that koresh ever promised to come out except for 
his first promise and his last promise. 

the first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
national exposure .  . well , it never was it was broadcast locally , 
in a chopped up fashion , and that 's all. and even then , they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded national exposure , 
but not so cleverly that we did n't hear it. 

the last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript .  . 
we 'll never know if he would have kept that one. 

the fbi etc. ca n't wait forever for koresh to come out. as 
long as they thought that koresh 's intended to surrender 
peacefully .  . when they lost hope in that , they decided to go 
in. 

strangely enough , the previous day they said they were prepared to 
wait as long as it takes .  . 

further , while the tactics were silly and clumsy , 
they were obviously intended to drive the davidians out of the 
compound , not to kill koresh and his followers. 

quite possible. but arguments of intent do not mark the dividing 
line between guilt and innocence only the line between murder and 
negligent manslaughter .  . 

if it is true. i read in the paper that the government 
listening devices inside the compound picked up orders to 
burn the joint down shortly before the fire was started. i'm 
waiting to see what the tapes really hold .  . 

this would be an interesting development. 

the davidian may be telling the truth , or he may be lying 
to save his skin from possible murder charges resulting from 
the blaze .  . koresh 's lawyer , being the attorney for at least 
one surviving davidian , has an interest in claiming that 
the gov't caused the fire , at least as much as the gov't 
has an interest in blaming koresh for the fire. it 's the 
physical evidence that will decide who 's telling what. 

it 's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to go state 's 
evidence , parrot the fbi story , hang the whole suicide on koresh , 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint , etc. if any of them do this 
in the next few weeks , it does n't prove much but if none of them 
do , it would be a strong indication to me that the fbi story is 
dead wrong.

in article jason kratz writes 
people are getting killed by gang violence every day every single day i hear 
about more people getting killed by gang violence and see some of the s 
that are being confiscated .  . 

is kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an m 16 
from an ar 15 that he can see the difference between a semi auto and 
a full auto uzi that he can see the difference between the various 
versions (some full auto , some semi auto only) of the m 11 9 

well , let me see. uzi , no. m 11 9 , no. 

i see that i my question. i should have asked which 
full autos kratz can accurately distinguish from semi auto 
look  . i should have also included some semi auto only guns in 
my list to see if he 'd ask how to distinguish them from their 
non existent full auto relatives . 

let 's do the former now. kratz has claimed that he can visually 
distinguish full autos from semi autos .  . for which full autos is he 
making that claim how does he do it let 's get specific , and as 
exhaustive as possible. 

m 16 ar 15 , maybe. i remember there 
being a selector swtich on the ar 15. if i remember correctly (please correct 
me if i'm wrong) the switch would set to an off position or an on position 
because the gun  ( ar 15) is semi automatic .  . would n't the m 16 have a position 
for semi auto fire and full auto fire  ( or maybe 3 round bursts) 

maybe why is kratz asking about what he told us that he knows 

is kratz certain that he can distinguish a three position switch from 
a two position switch via tv inspection  ( does he even get to see the 
switch in the typical police display of guns ) note that one might 
well be able to see this sort of thing in a hands on visual inspection 
even though it wo n't be seen on tv. and to think that kratz was 
telling us that seeing it on tv was just as accurate as being 
there .  .  .  .  . 

how about the other guns do they also have selector switch to switch between 
semi auto and fully auto fire 

why all the questions kratz assured us that he could make this distinction 
and now he 's asking us how he did it .  .  .  .  . 

well , what about what i said above if that is correct i guess tv would be 
acceptable  ( if you had a good enough picture and a picture of the lower 
receiver of the ar 15 m 16) .  . 

what about it it only demonstrates that , as i predicted , kratz 
was blowing smoke on this. 

andy gave kratz a chance to back down on this in private 

jason kratz did n't take andy 's offer to back down in private 

andy wonders what kratz is learning from this

well , maybe i am overreacting .  . but i see on the tv as i am typing where 
govt (the new attorney general , known to be almost rabid 
about private ownership of guns wants to ban  assault guns  and just 
about everything else) , is saying the fbi had amazing restraint , then 
falls back into the official goverenment line about how the bd were 
guity of child abuse , and were into it in an on going basis , and so on. 
... 
am i having a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on this 
thing or will it simply be whitewashed under the rug , and business 
as usual will continue to be the order of the day in the new order 
who will be given the official title of thought police , i wonder .  .  .  . 

what a load of crap ! the bds had absolutely no right to fire 
upon the batf agents .  . if they did n't know who they were at 
first , then they should have surrendered immediately when they 
did realize who they were dealing with. little groups of loonies 
do not get to decide just what laws they will obey or disobey 
or what sorts of warrants are justified .  . like the rest of us , 
they get their say at the voting booth and if their personal 
wants are not backed by the majority of voters , then too bad. 
if they wanted to keep automatic weapons , then they could apply 
for the proper permits .  . if they had a problem with the warrant 
then they get to argue that in court. in no event do they get 
to establish their own little nation inside our own and pretend 
that our laws and law enforcement personel have no jurisdiction 
within their borders .  . you live on us territory , you live by 
us laws period.  ( unless you are a congressman ) 

sure , the situation was handled badly by both the batf and 
the fbi .  . it would have been all so easy to detain koresh and 
his core members while they were out in the streets of waco .  . 
the batf , threatened with budget cuts , was trying for a 
propaganda coup ... and dragging the press along for the big 
commando style assault is proof of that. they should be 
roasted for both their and their mindset .  . on the 
other hand , they did have the legal right to do what they did. 
once the attack was begun , they should have pressed on and 
finished it rather than let an situation like that 
take root .  . 

the fbi also used poor judgement in a number of ways but again , 
the laws we voters have approved , or the lawmakers who created 
them , gave them the right to do what they did. if batf and 
the fbi are latter day gestapo , it is because the voters have 
allowed them to become that way. waco was pure 
mentality , religious fanaticism and unadulterated 
violence all rolled into one experience. we get what we pay 
for , or vote for , and this was the result of many choices 
we have made over the years. do n't blame  them  blame 
ourselves. we made  them  , we are  .

in article , thomas parsli writes 

not saying you should ban guns , or that you should take them away 
from responsible owners. 

but this is all gun control laws end up doing. politicians can never 
manage to get a handle on those who obtain arms illegally , so all their 
laws can ever do is further restrict people who obtain them legally .  . 

karen , a local attorney , states that there are about two million 
licensed gun owners in massachusetts .  . in the past year , the number of 
licensed gun owners involved in gun crimes was something like six .  . 
yet , there were a large number of gun crimes in the state last year. 

does passing laws that will further restricting only those people already 
obeying laws pay any 

all saing is that guns should be treated with respect from owners , sellers 
and legislators .  . 

so far , i 've seen them treated with the least respect by legislators .  . 

i believe guns are a problem in many countries and that crime rates 
would fell if they were more restricted .  . 

see , this is what i call the argument from religion i believe. do n't 
believe it 's not necessary to take this on faith. go look at the history 
of countries that passed gun restrictions .  . pay particular attention to 
whether or not violent crime was higher before the restrictions and lower 
after.  ( do n't look at violent gun crimes , that 's begging the question . ) . 
you may be very surprised. 

if all crimes done with guns stopped and all accidents also stopped or 
was reduced to a minimum then i would consider lifting all gun control. 

you have this absolutely backwards. if crime stopped in the presence of 
strict gun control , there is no way i would consider lifting any of it. 
however , if gun control made absolutely no improvement in the violent 
crime rate , that s when i would have it lifted .  . think about it. 

so far , none of the stats show any improvement .  .  .  . 

if car accidents fell to a minimum in europe , i  ( and probably 
most people i know) would demand easier drivers tests. 
(ca .  . 20 hours and more than 2500 today .  .  .  . ) . 

do you really think driver 's tests are any indication of your propensity 
for having accidents 

i 've never known anybody stupid enough to take a driving test while 
drunk after having been up all night with two fighting kids in the 
back seat with a hot cup of coffee on their lap or while putting on 
makeup , reading the newspaper , or talking on their cellular phone. 
but that 's what they 're doing when they have those accidents .  . 

in other words we should have legislation because ! ! 

how can anything that has no positive effect at all ever be necessary

how is clinton responsible it was a law enforcement action. 
granted , it was a nationally covered incident but clinton had no more to 
do with the outcome than fred flintstone .  . 

perhaps you 've been under a rock the last few days the batf and the fbi 
are both federal agencies .  . clinton has admitted in front of news cameras 
that janet reno (the once and future attorney general) gave him a full 
briefing of what was planned before they did it , and he gave her the 
go ahead. 

maybe , just possibly , that makes him a bit responsible 


the fbi , cia , batf , etc. are federal agencies , you are correct. but to 
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the prez , and 
that these agencies inform reno who informs clinton , etc. is naive .  . these 
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have 
ultimate accountability to the prez , they make their own moves , and then 
tell the prez , who says , i knew all along . while this may not seem right , 
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command 
leading to the white house , thats the way it is. are not , after 
all , composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis , have lunch , and 
maybe golf together. i do agree , the fbi , batf messed up. i'm not sure if 
they should have stormed the compound or not. by the way , witnesses 
are a religious minority in this country. protestantism is a minority 
religion in the world. bds were a cult by all definitions and history of 
cults .  . to say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave .  . 
koresh said he was the messiah .  . i was raised a baptist , although i do 
not practice the religion and do not think that the big guy upstairs is 
digging the divisiveness , , and right wing morons that are 
associated with the religion. anyway , the messiah that i was taught about 
would not be carrying a gun , let alone stockpiling weapons .  . you can doubt 
batf reports all you want , david koresh was not a poor soul who was 
persecuted .  . while some of the information coming from the u.s 
government is being so as keep public opinion on their side , i 
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said 
are true. anyway , this is just another excuse to try and blame president 
clinton for something. people who attempt to do this for political motives 
should be ashamed .  . they are the ones who are keeping this country from

note the following was released by the white house today in 
conjunction with the announcement of the clipper chip 
encryption technology. 

fact sheet 

public encryption management 

the president has approved a directive on public encryption 
management. the directive provides for the following 

advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption 
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. 
encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of 
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access. 
advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to 
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications .  . 
these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the 
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the 
information age. 

despite its benefits , new communications technology can also 
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance .  . sophisticated 
encryption can have this effect in the united states. when 
exported abroad , it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence 
activities critical to our national interests .  . in the past , it has 
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct 
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law 
enforcement and national security interests , while at the same time 
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens .  . as 
encryption technology improves , doing so will require new , 
innovative approaches .  . 

in the area of communications encryption , the u. s. government has 
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through 
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current 
government standard , but also permits escrowing of the keys needed 
to unlock the encryption .  . the system for the escrowing of keys 
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information 
only with appropriate legal authorization .  . 

to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect 
and decrypt , under legal authority , electronically transmitted 
information , i hereby direct the following action to be taken 

installation of government developed microcircuits 

the attorney general of the united states , or her representative , 
shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which 
incorporates encryption to install the u.s. government developed 
key escrow microcircuits in their products. the fact of law 
enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from 
the american public. all appropriate steps shall be taken to 
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key escrow 
microcircuit are made widely available to u.s. communications 
hardware manufacturers , consistent with the need to ensure the 
security of the key escrow system. in making this decision , i do 
not intend to prevent the private sector from developing , or the 
government from approving , other microcircuits or algorithms that 
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key 
escrow system. 

key escrow 

the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate 
entities to hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits 
installed in communications equipment. in each case , the key 
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent 
unauthorized release of the keys. the keys shall be released only 
to government agencies that have established their authority to 
acquire the content of those communications that have been 
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits .  . the attorney 
general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which 
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such 
communications .  . 

procurement and use of encryption devices 

the secretary of commerce , in consultation with other appropriate 
u.s. agencies , shall initiate a process to write standards to 
facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted 
with key escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems 
that process sensitive but unclassified information. i expect this 
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of 
a final standard within six months of this directive .  . 

the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to 
the extent needed to preserve the government 's ability to conduct 
lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure 
law enforcement communications .  . further , the attorney general 
shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture 
super surplus fund to effect this purchase.

in fire , bodies tend to fall apart or loose large chunks of 
meat with little effort. medical tend not to like cleaning up 
such scenes. 

as such , if the body had been suitably cooked , a bullet comming from a 
magazine explosion would more than likely have enough force to enter and 
thus it would be difficult to determine whether a bullet entered at the 
time of death , or much later , unless you were trained to look for the 
evidence. texas rangers are not  .

this is quite corect , but a bullet hitting a burned body with little energy 
will show virtually no deformation , ie a hollow point probably would not 
expand , an would be . also the bullets will not be marked 
with the lands of a barrel , because they did n't come out of

been to waco , texas lately yes , the government takes care of us 
all , does n't it as long as you belong to a government sanctioned

excuse me , but did n't these gun cult members threaten , shoot and kill 
some people 

they threatened no one. their neighbours thought they were a little 
strange but all in all the kind of people you would want to live 
next door to. 

one version has the batf serving a search warrant by jumping out 
of a horse trailer with guns and tossing concussion grenades .  . if 
this is the true order of events then the  cult  could not know 
that a search warrant was being served and since there was no proof 
that these guys were police , the  cult  had every right to defend 
themselves. 

torching themselves shows tactics , and convinces me 
they realy belong in society ... 

if you watch actual footage of the fire from start to finish it 
is not at all clear that fire was n't started by the tanks .  . the 
people who survived are claiming that the fire was started by 
the tanks knocking over some kerosene lanterns .  . the fbi is 
claiming that the  cult  started the fire. 

 they realy belong in society  is a catchy phrase but 
i'm personally waiting to see what the texas rangers have to say 
about it all before i pass judgment .  . why do n't you do the same. 

some more interesting facts about the waco incident 

1) the original assault was conducted by batf officers wearing 
an assorted types of camouflage .  . i saw , on cnn , at least 
three different types. i would be hard pressed to identify 
a bunch of guys in  bring your own  battle fatigues as 
uniformed officers of the law even if they were claiming to 
be police .  . 

2) the batf has been lying from the beginning 
we only had handguns the original footage showed 4 batf 
officers on a roof top getting shot at , one had an mp 5 
assault sub machine gun. 
we were out gunned sub machine guns and shotguns are the 
best in quarters weapon , you ca n't be out gunned when you 
have the best guns available for the job. 
we did n't know they had guns that would shoot through doors ! 
this one is the best , there are very few guns that wo n't shoot 
through a household door , or through a house wall for that 
matter. since officers from the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and 
firearms should know that , they are either lying or incredibly 
incompetent .  . not to mention criminally negligent if they are

mass suicide .  . now they are claiming that that 's what he did

yeah , as information trickles in .  .  .  . funny how that works .  .  .  . 

funny , yeah , funny how you did n't wait for the fbi 
latest reversal of facts before proclaiming the bd 's burned 
themselves to death. 

if you wo n't believe anything the government says , and the press 
is not reliable according to the same logic , then what do you base 
your statements on wild speculation with a healthy dose 
of paranoia 

funny , brent , but so far we have heard two versions of the facts 

1) what the government says. this includes what the government says that 
two survivors have said. 

2) what koresh 's lawyer  ( who was actually inside the compound ) says , 
including what he says that most of the survivors have said. 

strange , but they seem to disagree in most important particulars .  . 

if anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors 
speaking first hand , feel free ot pitch in. i may have missed it. 
but my money is that their story will sound a hell of a lot like 
case 2 , and not at all like case 1. 

since neither side would be particularly interested in telling the truth , 
you have to weigh the  facts  given by each yourself , and weigh it with 
the if you care. 

many cult members will probably side with the attorney , and if he 
is lying , change their stories to match his. and if the feds also 
lie , the cult members who become disillusioned will change their 
stories to match the feds .  . 

neither sides are interested in the truth. the media is more interested , 
but usually either do n't have the time to get it straight or tie themselves 
to the ratings and deliberately distort .  . 

for me , though , the black soot billowing outside the compound added with 
how fast the fire spread to someone dousing large parts of the 
compound with some sort of gasoline or fire starter .  . i doubt the feds 
did that as they were more interested in arresting vernon .  . the real 
unbalanced one (at least the one that lost his cool ) was vernon , so 
i figured that he was more likely to do it  ( after all he was jesus 
being persecuted by the authorities , and had followers to hold onto , 
so made the decision. he and his followers also probably felt that they 
were to heaven by doing this stuff) .  . conclusion , i came 
to after umpteen million hours of listening to npr and other radio

the b . b . c .  . are also reporting that bodies of b d members were found 
with bullet wounds in a manner that suggests they may have been shot 
attempting to leave the compound during the fire. 

can you imagine what happens when a magazine explodes bullets go flying every 
where. imho , these gunshot wounds were actually caused when the magazines 
went up. 

unlikely .  . ammunition is not as dangerous when simply burned as it 
is when fired from a gun. the brass case is not capable of holding 
the pressure generated by burning powder , and will  ( unless supported 
by the walls of a gun barrel or chamber ) simply split open. while 
this may cause small pieces of brass to fly around , it will not 
the bullet with any significant velocity .  . 

in fact , it was not uncommon in years past to dispose of old loaded 
cartridges by burning them. as long as you were not close enough 
to take a piece of flying brass in the eye , you were reasonably safe. 

thus , the detonation of loaded magazines or loose rounds might cause 
slight injury but would be unlikely to cause fatal bullet wounds .  .

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the 
burning building 

assuming the fire was caused by lanterns and stoves being knocked about 
by the tanks pushing on the walls  ( would shake a building pretty good) 
perhaps they did n't flee because fleeing would have meant entering the 
fire from the other side like they were surrounded by the fire , and 
rubble , which finally  ( combined with , and combustion gasses ) 
overcame and them 

in other words they were trapped by the flames , heat , fumes and rubble 

wait a minute. the story being pushed here is that the fire started 
in one place. this is not consistent with the story that they were 
trapped by the fire  ( particularly in a building that all of a sudden 
had many more exits) .  . 

choose one , please. 

does that sound plausable not as dramatic as forcing them to 
stay , or shooting them (no shot victims found yet) , but plausable .  .  .  . 

well , for everyone besides koresh and his blood children , we can 
assume independent choice ah , they chose to stay in the face of

lives , and if she confirmed that the plan for the raid was a safe as 
could be , then he did his job. the president should not involve 
himself in the minor details of these kinds of operations .  . this sort 
of only leads to disaster , as was demonstrated so well 
in vietnam .  . 

but the raid went bad over 80 civilians have been killed in a 
with u.s. authorities .  . 

now clinton enters the picture in a big way. will clinton start an 
investigation or will he try to squash any attempt to investigate 
is he a responsible leader or is he only interested in protecting 
the image of his administration 

we 'll all find out as this unfolds .  . 


excellent point , mark. we should all remember that if nixon 
had n't tried to cover up the misguided actions of some of his 
subordinates in the watergate burglary , the scandal would 
never have brought down his presidency .  . so far , seems 
to be stonewalling this the same way tricky dick did. his whole 
case seems to be we did n't do anything wrong . however , if 
in the course of the investigation it turns out that the 
gov't did do something wrong , and he tried to cover it up , 
then that 's an crime , i believe .  .  .  . 

perhaps he is inadvertently cooking up his own scandal .  .  .  . can you 
say , little neighbor ... ) 




ya know , this being part of the loyal opposition is kinda fun for

just to shed some light on the fire , it was widely reported  ( ap , etc . ) . that 
there were several witnesses to bd folks starting the fires .  . it has also 
been reported that the fires broke out in several places at once , which 
rules out a bradley knocking over a lamp , etc. as the cause. 

what i would like to see is some serious discussion of this incident .  . i 
believe the moves made were right and proper , but i still have some problems 
with some of the tactics .  . after watching the abc special on it tonight , as 
well as cnn and nightline , i question some of the atf and fbi actions .  . 

1) could it have been possible to have taken koresh outside the compound at 
some time before the feb. 28th raid 

i think it was he went into town fairly often , and was known to go 
jogging .  . this was even during the 9 month period when he was being 
watched .  . one wonders why the batf went ahead , when they had been warned 
according to an interview with a batf agent , that the bd were expecting 
them , and why they had the media in tow .  . almost looks like they wanted 
to have a and a nice show for the media , and it all went to hell .  .  .  . 

he was also never known to act violently .  . he has always surrendered 
peacefully before  ( but of course , the warrants were served  . 
he has been tried on the allegations before and found not guilty .  . 

the justification for this mess was he was alleged to have purchased 
200 , 000.00 worth of guns and stuff  ( over an undetermined time  . 
last i heard this is not a crime , or indication of one. i know of an 
individual with that much value in guns. should he get a fly thru the door 
shoot first talk later raid  ( grenades are shooting first , nobody i 
know of can say  oh , thats only a stun grenade , thats ok .  .  .  . can you 
i sure cannot .  . also , one cannot be sure that 200k figure is not calculated 
like the feds calculate the value of a drug  .  .  . even so , it 
is a 'so what  issue .  .  .  . he was n't bothering anyone  ( besides the 
batf who does n't like folks other than themselves or other govt 
people having any effective  .  .  . and having an unapproved 
religeous group. are we required to not offend the batf these 
days i sure hope it has n't come to that .  .  .  . 

my point is , it does not add up. we need an independent investigation , 
and now. assuming other than fbi batf are preserving the evidence. 

2) could a further wait have resulted in a different outcome .  . 

they had the bugged .  . i am inclined to think a further wait 
would have saved lives. one wonders why they did n't have emergency 
gear on hand when they moved , and why they did n't turn on the water 
when a fire was observed , instead of saying aw , gee , there is no water . 

why so long before the fire gear even showed up like after the building 
had pretty much finished burning fireman safety is n't that a decision 
the should be allowed to make no water why did n't 
the feds turn it back on they sure could cut it off quickly enough .  .  .  . 

one does wonder about the possibility of  settling  .  .  . 

3) were fbi actions  ( blaring loudspeakers , etc . ) . the right course of action 

and a few other questions. like i said , i believe the actions taken , in 
general , were proper .  . but i still have some reservations .  . 

one other point , i'm no fan of janet reno , but i do like the way she had the 
balls to go ahead and take full responsibility .  . seems like the waffle boy 
had problems figuring out just where he stood on the issue. 

what does  taking responsibility  mean you think she is going to be 
facing jail time if the acts were found to be criminal you think 
she is going to face any repercussions if the fbi batf are found to 
have acted wrongly i do n't .  . it is a nice pr gimmick , though. 

i am not assured there will even be a serious independent investigation 
for possible wrongdoing or criminal acts on the part of the batf or fbi .  . 
i expect to hear they are our best law enforcement .  . they would n't do 
anything like that no way. out of the question. end of issue . 

i want to see an independent investigation , with full prosecuting and 
subpoena powers .  . with felony prosecution where felony acts are found. 
fat chance , i bet. i bet the justice dept will have an internal 
investigation which will turn up at most  poor  . 

i hope i am wrong , that this is gone over with a fine tooth comb .  .

two notes of interest from texas 

the tarrant me  ( who is doing the autopsies ) is well known for rendering 
judgements that are contrary to the police view. he presented evidence a few 
years ago that a man who police said was pointing a gun at them actually had 
his hands in the air. this does not bode well for the boys in black. 

the texas dept. of public saftey and the texas rangers have no great love for 
the atf .  . i have heard them referred to as those fucking cowboys . the dps 
was totally squeezed out of the bd operation and resented being left as 
traffic cops . atf now has two strikes against them. 

finally (i guess that makes three notes ) , rumour from waco is that four atf 
agents were stopped by four waco police cars and a dps trooper after one of the 
flashed an automatic weapon at a cop .  . lots of pissed of cops .  . and you

 .  .  . gun . buyback programs will hopefully 
have an impact on accidental shootings  ( especially youths ) , domestic 
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and 
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level 
crime .  . 

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on 
any of these things evidence , please 

please do n't what i was saying joe .  . i was making the point 
tha 
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if 
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types 
of common incidents .  . 

if you 're a research associate in urban child research , then perhaps 
you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the 
rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps 
with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners 
spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death 
among children in the u.s. is a serious problem. 

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children 
ages 14 and under .  . i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental 
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents .  . 
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths 
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a 
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental 
gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane 
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents 
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. 


any death is serious. wanna discuss match control firearms related 
unintentional deaths among children ages 14 and under are the fault of one or 
more negligent persons , not the gun. 

did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent 
no. i hate to repeat myself jim , but like i told joe , i was not attempting 
in any way to justify gun control. you 're right , any death is serious. 
that was my point to joe who said that anti gunners try to 
the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious 
problem. i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem. 
no , i do n't want to discuss match control. i do n't equate a book of matches 
to a loaded 9 millimeter either. do n't confuse the issue. and please do n't 
say that tired old nra line guns do n't kill people , people kill people . 
sure , people can kill people without guns. but easy access to guns makes it 
a lot more convenient .  . guns do n't kill people , people with easy access to 
guns kill people . 

more than anything , gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the 
community. in that sense , i think they might do a little good. 

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good. 

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police 
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by 
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond 
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i 
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were 
useful. 


providing false hope , then , is the intent 

jim , i'm just saying how it is. i'm not saying if that is a good thing 
or not. from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun 
buyback programs , i get the impression that they really think they are 
having an impact on the community. when i ask them if they have an 
component to the program , they say well no .  .  .  . so , in answer to your 
question , no , false hope is not the intent .  . i think the intent is to 
show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal 
gun violence whether its effective or not. look , if you ca n't measure 
the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test 
evaluation , what is the point it must be symbolic in nature. the police are 
essentially saying look , if you have a gun lying around and you do n't 
want it , we 'll give you 50 for it .  .  . because . we care about the community . 
if you , i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or 
ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous .  . 


i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or 
brought to school by youths on a daily basis  ( about 135 , 000 youths ) are 
obtained easily and quickly , through a personal friend , or more often 
borrowed from a parent without their knowledge. 

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i 
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of 
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun) 
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students 
who carry a gun to school daily. 

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence 
or the centers for disease control. if you look carefully you will see 
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths .  . 
the reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that 
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates 
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once 
in 1990. the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key 
children  ( kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access 
to guns in their home. california schools reported a 200 increase in 
student gun between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between 
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in 
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 .  . these are the statistics . 


200 increase in california schools , eh gun control is working fine , there ! 

i did n't anything about gun control , what are you talking about 

thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah  ( got news 
for you folks , if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours 
presently , he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they 
were in  . 

holding kids time for a reality check , son. these kids were the 
children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were 
outside waiting to kill them. would you send your children out the door 
if you believed as they did 

okay , maybe i worded it wrong .  .  . dad .  . i meant that to put children in a 
situation  ( fortified compound ) where harm could come to them is not the 
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over 
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is 
would not let innocent children die. 
if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why 
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them 
burn alive thanks for the reality check joe , its been real. 

so your religion is different. does that make it his wrong even assuming 
koresh actually made that decision , and the verdict is still out on that. 

jim , listen to me , i said i'm not religious whatsoever , do you understand 
religion has nothing to do with this. i could care less what religion 
they were okay to put children in that situation is wrong , pure and 
simple. difference is good jim , i am the most progressive and diverse 
person in the world. but , if different is allowing kids to be exposed 
to tanks and tear gas , then yes jim , different is wrong.

well , the question of why fire equipment took so long to reach the 
compound has been answered. abc aired a report including the 911 tapes 
from monday .  . the fbi called 911 within 4 minutes of the fire 's breakout .  . 
unfortunately , dispatch of vehicles outside the waco city limits 
required approval of a deputy chief , who was not available (literally 
out to lunch ) the 911 operator desperately called around to local 
community volunteer fire departments to get something out there. by 
the time trucks arrived 27 minutes later , the whole complex was aflame 
and it was clearly too little , too late there were just two 
and no water supply. the fbi made another call requesting a tank truck , 
but the waco department apparently depended on and did not 
have one. though clearly unwilling to risk firemen 's lives in the 
line of fire , it seems they might have done so had there been sufficient 
equipment and water to make a difference. 

they even aired a tape of a woman who called waco 911 from georgia 
asking if anything was being done. civic minded , but probably 
irresponsible if everyone watching television did that , no local 
calls could get through. 

abc also aired the comments of an independent fire investigator who 
viewed tapes from more than one side of the compound (not just the 
standard pool shot ) , and agreed that the fire a) must have been 
started in at least 3 places , and b) must have had an 
to spread so fast. 

neither of these is conclusive proof that the koresh crowd offed 
themselves more than the fbi offed them , but it 's a heck of a lot 
stronger proof than some of the theories floating around the net.

i had hoped to be making a very different statement this evening. 
after very careful planning and extensive preparation we all thought 
that today 's efforts by the fbi to bring the branch davidians out of 
their compound would result in the peaceful resolution of the 
stand off or at least meaningful negotiation .  . 
instead , we are faced with devastation and death. however , i 
have no question that our plan was correct and was conducted with 
extreme professionalism and care. i applaud the restraint shown by 
agents in the face of life threatening gunfire , and i thank them for 
risking their lives to try to end this peacefully .  . i have only the 
greatest admiration for the courage and professionalism of all 
involved. 

i have no question that our plan was correct months to 
get ready , unlimited funds , knowledge of a threatened mass suicide by fire , 
and no fire trucks on hand this is extreme professionalism and care 

i can understand the first screwed up raid by the batf .  . they 
underestimated the opposition , which happens. but not this one. 
the fbi had their first team in place , massive resources , ample time 
for planning and bringing up any specialized equipment or people necessary. 
they still botched it. 

the fbi director and the fbi sac in overall charge should resign , 
or be fired for incompetence .  . 

i do n't blame reno or clinton .  . they gave the fbi clear orders 
do n't go in unless you can do it without casualties if you ca n't do that , 
wait it out. those were reasonable orders. the fbi said they could 
pull off a tactical solution , and they could n't .  .

what exactly are you trying to say and why were there no fire engines within 
a mile of the compound 

because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with 50mm that 
has a range of 3000 meters .  . 

they were using 50 caliber ammunition not 50mm ammo .  . 50mm would be 5cm a 
shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells .  . 

snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire. besides , 
the ranch house (not fort apocalypse it was just a house despite what 
the fbi and atf says ) was on fire . the gun loonies could n't hardly 
have been shooting at fire men while there house was in flames .  . 
the fbi and atf do n't have any excuse for not having fire engines there 
to put out the blaze .  . the bastards waited until the fire was well 
under way before they called the fire department in waco .  . they did n't 
even tell the fire department to be on standby .  . i sincerely hope that 
the fbi , atf , attorney general janet reno , and all others involved in 
this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve .  . 
someone should pay for this needless , tragic waste of human life. 

sadly , these evil sobs will probably never face justice. the media 
and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it 
up as being solely david koresh 's fault. sadder still , the american 
people will probably believe them. 

next question. 


the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving 
to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place. 

this is not the problem .  .  . the . problem is that we have a government that 
is becoming more tyrannical every day. if people decide to own guns 
and live in one place together then that is their prerogative .  . on 
the other hand , if the bds were in posession of explosives and illegal 
guns then the government did have the right to search their compound .  . 
but , the allegations that the bds were in posession of illegal weapons 
has n't been proven yet , so i'm not going to conclude that the bds broke 
any laws .  . david koresh was accused of abusing children , but if this 
is his only crime then the presence of the atf ca n't be justified .  . 
the atf is only supposed to deal with firearms , tobacco , and alcohol 
violations .  . atf agents are basically cigarette cops .  .  . they . should 
stay out of other kinds of law enforcement actions that are out of 
their jurisdiction .  . better yet , they should be s imo. 

the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to 
attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention .  . if the fbi had 
had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type 
raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults. 

sounds like something the ss would do. human life children and adults 
alike should be treated with respect even if they are heavily armed 
religious wackos . 

david koresh 's lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out 
peacefully sooner or later. the fbi and atf had nothing but time on 
their hands ! why did they have to escalate the situation and cause 
this senseless tragedy their job is to protect the public and save 
lives not kill people for crying out loud .  . 

it really was a no win situation. koresh had plenty of opportunity 
to give up and stand trial for the murder of the 4 atf officers .  . instead 
he ordered the murder of the children. 

do n't be so sure about that. i read in a newspaper today that one of the 
cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that 
it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on 
fire. this cult member also said that david koresh had no intentions 
of committing mass suicide .  . david koresh 's lawyer also confirms this. 
therefore , if this is true then this means that the fbi and atf murdered 
everyone in that house ! even if this is not true , the fbi and atf still 
do n't get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the 
waco fire department. perhaps they wanted all these people to die. 

in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive 
the words of a man who has just murdered 17 children and ordered the 
suicide murder of his other 80 followers. according to the account given 
the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met 
by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them. the koresh gun supporter 
claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up. if the 
aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier 
grade weaponry than standard issue handguns .  . for all practical purposes 
they were unarmed , the b d followers had automatic weapons .  . 

you 're wrong on several accounts. atf agents were adequately armed .  . they 
had , ar 15s , and shotguns .  . some agents were armed with automatic 
pistols but not all were. the atf 's initial claim which they later 
retracted that agents were is simply ludicrous .  . 

the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely .  . the b d were 
quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any 
time. a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have 
achieved that objective , that would have been very risky , orders of 
harder than or the iranian embassy seige .  . airplanes 
and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch 
apocalypse was. 6 terrorists are far easier to without casualties 
than 80 .  . 

allowing the siege to go on was not an option either , besides the serious 
risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the 
question of the difficulties of keeping the team on standby over 
a prolonged period. the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared 
koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege .  . rather than go 
in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon. 


can you think of a better way of getting the children out 

a 100 certain way 


the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire 
government story. this is simply rationalisation .  . it is not enough for 
them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent .  . that would require 
them to come up with a solution themselves. instead they have to come 
up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to 
set out to murder 80 people just to set up some sort of scare to them 
to get gun control legislation through. 

gun control is n't the only issue here. if the sick little monkeys in 
washington try to use the waco incident as a reason to ban guns then 
they will have demonstrated just how f ed up they are. what concerns 
me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government 
seems to be able to get away with s t like they did in waco .  .  . they . are 
becoming more and more about people 's rights and the law. this 
greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well. 

this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got 4 of its 
agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the 
middle of texas being shot at by religious  . 

still the conspiracy theory is comforting , it allows them to pretend that 
waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in 
resolving a hostage crisis .  . no govt in the world has ever faced a 
comparable situation , quite probably there was no manner in which it 
could be peacefully resolved .  . the blame does not rest on the fbi , it 
rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far , in particular 
the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of 4 atf 
agents and 17 children on his or her conscience .  . 


there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society 
preach salvation through armed security. the fact is that these are the 
very people who pose the threat to society in the first place. the next waco 
may not be religious but a political movement. a splinter group 
of the klu klux klan taking over a in a black area for example 
and holding several hundred children hostage .  . 

the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent 
them arising .  . no other government in the world has faced such a situation. 
this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power 
weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be messiah 
to set themselves up as dictator in their own little empire .  .

they wrote the bill in such a way as to make the law subject to a

this is actually unconstitutional under the texas constitution , which

if they had lived a quiet , religious life as they claimed , there would

of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid , if not

if they had been quiet there would have been no deaths i thought thier

if they had n't been stockpiling weapons , then the atf would n't have felt

as quoted from by  ( nathan engle ) 

what did those people do wrong in the first place that is what i ca n't 
figure out. 

they assembled a frightening arsenal of weapons by laws 
which were intended to prevent such a buildup .  . then later they used some 
of those weapons to kill representatives of the federal government. i'm 
sure they were frightened when they saw all those batf officers closing 
in , but in retrospect i ca n't see how their subsequent could be 
expected to improve the situation. 

what laws did they circumvent being frightening is n't a crime .  . some people 
are afraid of young black males .  . that does n't make the mere status of being a 
young black male a crime .  . 

the batf itself admitted leading off by throwing handgrenades .  . there is no 
evidence that they properly identified themselves as law enforcement 
personnel .  . under those circumstances , other persons have been found to be 
acting within their legal rights to exercise self defense against unidentified 
armed intruders .  . 

at this point i place little or no credibility on any of the charges 
of child abuse or molestation , but i would remind you that the branch 
davidians are n't the only ones burying their dead. 

the charges are anyway , since the batf has absolutely no jurisdiction 
in such matters anyway. of course that has n't stopped them from making other 
such spurious charges , such as the existence of mythical meth labs . of 
course they whole cult thing indicates the level of contempt that they have 
for the 1st amendment .  . 

sure they were crazy , no about it , but what did they do wrong 

they attempted to stage an armed resistance to federal authorities 
under conditions that placed dozens of unarmed and innocent people in the 
line of fire. 

that armed resistance , at least initially , may well have been legal .  .

 .  .  . gun . buyback programs will hopefully 
have an impact on accidental shootings  ( especially youths ) , domestic 
disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger , and 
maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level 
crime .  . 

what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on 
any of these things evidence , please 

please do n't what i was saying joe .  . i was making the point tha 
there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if 
there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types 
of common incidents .  . 

saying hopefully the effect of policy x will be y is much different 
from saying hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y. 
here you 've made both statements .  . 
if the former describes a reasonably likely outcome of policy x , then 
perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration but the latter statement 
is not something to base policy decisions on ! 

firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children 
ages 14 and under .  . 

according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence  ( formerly 
the national coalition to ban handguns interesting name change , do n't you 
think ) who include murder and suicide by firearms in the leading causes of 
unintentional death) figures but do n't include murder and suicide by other 
means as causes of unintentional death. ca n't you see past the bullshit 

i do n't understand how the ratio to other accidental 
deaths is important. so guns do n't kill as many children as car accidents .  . 
what is the difference in severity between 1 , 000 deaths and 10 , 000 deaths 
i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a 
justification for gun control. who needs to be convinced that accidental 
gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane 
person would be concerned when any 10 year old got hold of their parents 
gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends. 

certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things but the 
anti gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by 
firearms is a serious problem , and even if you do n't use 
these deaths as a justification for gun control , these groups do. i'm 
sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning 
accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern , 
but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun 
control measures , i think the conclusion was a reasonable one. 
the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may 
be , they are not a serious problem statistically speaking .  . 

please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good. 

my point was , gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police 
departments might (i stress might) do a little (i stress little) good by 
giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond 
to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way. overall , i thought that i 
had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were 
useful. 

sorry if it was n't clear to me. i thought you were on your view 
of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully 
preventing accidents and heat of passion shootings .  . i have to disagree on 
all these counts i ca n't understand how a buying guns from people who 
are n't intending to misuse them  ( obviously those who want to use guns to 
commit crimes are n't going to turn them in) could be construed as a 
positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence .  . 

i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i 
suspect you 'll find if you look carefully that 135 , 000 is the number of 
students estimated to have carried a weapon (not necessarily a gun) 
to school at least once in the past year , and not the number of students 
who carry a gun to school daily. 

well joe , i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence 

what , the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit 
suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all 
methods per year who do you think i should believe the people who call 
everyone up to age 24 children when they 're screaming about the carnage 
of our nation 's children being caused by handguns 

or the centers for disease control. 

ah , yes , the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be 
such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people 
2000 document is to enact laws in 50 states requiring manufacturers of 
handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire , minimizing the 
likelihood of accidental or intentional by children the 
agency that funded the study of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban 
had saved x lives (yes , they actually gave us a number) on the basis of 
a look at the number of shootings rather than the rate of shootings 
it was n't their fault that the population of dc dropped in their post law 
period .  .  .  . 


if you look carefully you will see 
that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths .  . 
the reports that 135 , 000 youth bring guns to school daily and that 
400 , 000 bring guns to school at least once a year. the cdc estimates 
that 1 out 0f 25 high school students carried a gun to school at least once 
in 1990. 

okay , i 'll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these. i 'll 
retract my dispute of your numbers. however , i would be greatly interested 
in seeing how and cdc came up with these numbers. 

the cdc also says that 1.2 million elementary aged , latch key 
children  ( kids who come home from school to an empty house) , have access 
to guns in their home. 

what 's this got to do with anything hell , when i was in elementary 
school i came home to an empty house with guns in it. why is this a 
problem i did n't touch the guns i had been taught not to. i had also 
been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage , the fuse box , the 
car , the knives , the oven , and the tools. the problem is not the guns , 
it 's the parents ! ! ! 

california schools reported a 200 increase in 
student gun between 1986 and 1990 , and a 40 increase between 
1988 and 1990. florida reported a 61 percent increase in gun incidents in 
schools between 1986 87 amd 1987 88 .  . these are the statistics . 

and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns 
nothing. no criminal prosecution , no expulsion , in most cases not even 
suspension .  . they take the gun , slap the kids on the wrist , say ai n't it 
awful , and go on as if everything 's back to normal. what 's wrong with 
this picture 

okay , maybe i worded it wrong .  .  . dad .  . i meant that to put children in a 
situation  ( fortified compound ) where harm could come to them is not the 
act of a messiah in my opinion. i'm not saying that koresh had control over 
these children directly , but i would hope that whatever messiah there is 
would not let innocent children die. 

i do n't think koresh was the messiah , either .  .  .  . but is n't it obvious that 
if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him , then he 
believed the children were much safer inside the compound i did n't say 
he was sane .  .  .  . just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what 
he thought was going on. he thought he had them in the one place where 
harm would n't come to them. 

if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such , why 
did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them 
burn alive 

let 's see you try to find the exits , them , and flee a fire 
when you 've been kept awake for most of 50 days by loudspeakers and subjected 
to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault .  .

this i doubt. while i question the atf 's initial raid , i believe 
that the remainder of the standoff was handled fairly well with the single 
exception of the psychological warfare by blaring music , etc. i think 
that was uncalled for and probably hindered the outcome .  . 

but .  .  .  . suppose they had waited .  . the worst outcome would have been the 
one that actually did. but with the fbi atf just standing there watching

 ( andy freeman ) says 

this is where freeman 's love of accuracy becomes really ridiculous. 

good now let 's look at those sections .  . they 'll prove my point. 

his point was that it is possible under certain circumstances for many people 
to carry concealed in illinois 

(a) a person commits the offense of unlawful use of weapons when he 
knowingly 

(4) carries or possesses in any vehicle or concealed on or about his person 
except when on his land or in his own abode or fixed place of business 
any pistol , revolver , stun gun or taser or other firearm 

note that this does n't affect all concealed carry .  .  ( look after the 
word except  . ) . it always helps to read the law before commenting on 
it. 

i did read the law before i commented on it. judging from replies i received 
about my semantics on t . p . g . post many  ( if not most ) people here on t . p . g . 
assume that when ccw laws are asked about the person is asking about the 
possibility of an ordinary citizen getting one. it would also follow that said 
person would get the ccw to carry on his her person away from their home and or 
business. 



would a prudent carry concealed how about someone at 
home note that both are legal , and a lot of common people qualify 
for one or the other. 

andy 


maybe freeman did prove his point but his point is not relevant .  . the thing 
that most people seem to care about when they ask questions about carrying 
a concealed weapon is whether or not they can carry it concealed on their 
person when they are out on the street somewhere. i'm sure that not many 
people are concerned with whether or not they can carry concealed at home. 
speaking as someone who lives in illinois (the only place where the above 
quoted law is relevant )) i know that it is legal to own a handgun here (i 
am not taking into account city  . i could care less about whether 
or not i can carry concealed at home. i only care about the fact that 
i ca n't carry concealed in the place where it really counts out on the street. 
freeman loves to be accurate and i can understand that  ( especially not) but he 
seems to be forgetting that accurate facts do n't always replace common sense. 
i am not going to followup to this thread anymore because i believe that it is 
useless to argue these points anymore. the only thing that is happening now 
is that freeman and i are running around in circles trying to prove each 
other wrong and i do not have the time to be playing games anymore. of course 
now freeman will attack me about my use of common sense in some of my earlier 
posts but what can i do. my only advice for freeman quit being so picky 
about accuracy sometimes and use your common sense it really does work some 
times.

1) what the government says. this includes what the government says that 
two survivors have said. 

2) what koresh 's lawyer  ( who was actually inside the compound ) says , 
including what he says that most of the survivors have said. 

strange , but they seem to disagree in most important particulars .  . 

if anyone has actually seen news reports of any of the survivors

the most tiresome thing about this group is that so many people

them as independent thinkers whenever they find something the government

people are sucking up to the government when they decide that only the 
things the government says are plausible .  . especially if they refuse to 
consider reasonable alternatives .  . 

however , from what i saw all over the tv news last night , it 's 
no longer necessary to be an independent thinker to depart from the 
government 's party line. it looks like our independent press may 
actually be starting to be earn its clothes allowance .  . this , to me , is 
a good sign. i hope it continues .  . 

here 's a clue. independent thinkers are able to come to either conclusion 
depending on the circumstances .  . non critical thinkers are the ones who would 
always come to the same type of conclusion regardless of the circumstances .  . 

independent thinkers question authority .  . in a situation where only one 
set of facts are being presented , coming to a conclusion is not the 
hallmark of an independent thinker unless it 's coupled with the ability 
to challenge those facts critically .  . the scientific method consists 
of more than choosing the popular hypothesis it 's even more than choosing 
between two hypotheses that other people have proposed .  .

interview ) one of the two british survivors .  . he claimed that the fire 
started when the tanks caused an internal wooden wall roof to collapse 
knocking over kerosene lamps and that they had no suicide plan. 

if the fbi started the fire , why didn`t people flee the 
burning building 

i do n't know , why 

this is the ap story from fri morning. 

as the walls came down and tear gas filled the air , cult leader 
david koresh sprang into action. he left his third floor bedroom and began 
looking around the house , making sure women and children were secure and 
checking that everyone had their gas masks on properly. within hours , the 
compound became an inferno .  . nine branch davidians  . 
this is their story , gleaned from lawyers who spoke with six of them 
who are jailed on charges that include conspiracy and murder .  . that day the 
six said a portable radio offered the only contact with the outside world 
since koresh 's right hand man , steve schneider , ripped out the compounds 's 
phone line after fbi agents called before dawn monday saying this was the 
cults last chance come out or prepare to get forced out. 
they kept their word. by dawn , tanks were the mount carmel 
compound , punching for hours to holes for tear gas to enter. the bd 
meanwhile proceeded with their daily routines .  . strapped into gas masks , the 
women did laundry .  . others read bibles in their rooms. the 17 children , all 
under 10 , remained by their mothers  sides. still , it was hard to ignore what 
was happening around them. each time a tank rammed the poorly constructed building 
it shook violently .  . cult members falling and doors. 
hundreds of gas canisters hurled in from the armored vehicles were filling 
the air with noxious fumes .  . the flying canisters were more frightening than 
the tanks .  . at least one man was hit in the face. the gas began filling the air , 
driven by heavy gusts of wind coming through windows and the holes the tanks 
made. scattered throughout the house , the cult members made no efforts to 
gather .  . then the fbi sent in its biggest weapon a massive armored vehicle 
headed for a chamber , lined with cinder blocks , where authorities hoped to 
find koresh and schneider and fire tear gas directly at them. 
here the cult members  story from the government 's version. the 
fbi says cult members set fires in three places. but each of the six cult 
members , in separate discussions with lawyers , consistently gave versions 
at odds with the fbi 's account. they say the tank flattened a barrel of 
propane , spilling its contents .  . and as the tank through the house , 
it tipped over lit lanterns , spitting flames that ignited the propane and 
other  . the home of used lumber , plywood , and tacked 
together with tar paper was vulnerable .  . the building erupted .  . nine bd 's 
escaped jumping through windows and dashing through other  . others 
died groping in the  .
