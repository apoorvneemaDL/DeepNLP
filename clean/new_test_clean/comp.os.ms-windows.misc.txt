is there a utility out there that will let me use filenames longer than 
the standard 8.3 format. 

yep , it 's called os2 ! 

yep , you can use any type of unix , or maybe vms , or buy a mac or something .  .  .  . 
if you want longer filenames for your documents , i heard of a wordprocessor for 
windows which let you assign long names to files. those long filenames could only be 
seen from that programs open save dialogs though .  .  .  . maybe someone knows more about 
this wordprocessor than i do 


if i rember correctly , lotus notes gives u this possiblity , among other things .  .  .  .

i have been posting monthly how to setup a slip client on a pc posts for a 
few months. lots of work , and imminent graduation have come in the way of 
posting one of these for march or earlier this month for which i apologize .  . 

this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota 
phone , and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with 
phone. 

for additions , modifications and corrections , i can be reached at 


best wishes , 
ashok 

begin slip . txt . 
based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows , here 
are my comments on setting up slip in this environment. i thank the 
trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments. 


configuring your modem 

a) turn off dtr (at d0 w) 
i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use 
to dial my slip server  ( qmodem ) drops dtr when i exit the program 
and therefore hangs up the line. if you use a program like kermit 
or to establish the slip connection , then this need not be done. 
these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit .  . 

note if you use univ. of minn. phone to dial and establish a 
slip connection , you do not need to turn off dtr .  . 

b) dial and establish the slip connection first. this can be done 
automatically if you use a program like phone (from the university of 
minnesota ) which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the 
slip packet driver. the phone scripting language is simple and 
phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with 
other slip server. in addition , while the only packet driver 
that phone works with is  ( currently ) , it is easy to write a 
batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers. 
there is a section on phone in the document with both script and 
batch file examples .  . 


configuring the slip drivers 

there are five slip packet drivers commonly available 
exe . peter tattam 's compressed slip driver 
exe . peter tattam 's slip driver 
com . driver (i like phil burn 's modified driver ) 
com . driver  ( ethernet simulation over slip ) 
com . univ. of minnesota driver  ( based on slip8250 ) 

of these four , i vastly prefer c exe . over com . or 
com . for the following reasons 

a) it is much faster even though my modem has just a 16450 uart 
b) while using , myself and several others 
have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a 
long ftp transfer .  . 
c) it supports when used in ethernet simulation mode 
d ) when used in ethernet simulation mode c seem to work with 
every tcp ip application that i have tested it with. 

instructions for c exe .  ( and you do not use phone) 
a) load in your autoexec.bat file according to instructions 
for instance if you have a v . 32bis . modem on com1 
com1 vec 62 baud 
b) if you use dos tcp ip applications in win 3.1 dos boxes , then use the 
double ended packet driver shim com . this creates a virtual 
packet driver at  . dos applications in native mode , dos 
applications in windows 3.1 dos boxes and windows applications can all 
use this virtual driver at  . 
com . 
c) if you use net , load com . next. net is configured in 
qvtnet . ini . to use the interrupt at  . 
com . 

instructions for com . 
a) try getting a version 10 slip driver. philip burns of northwestern 
university has a modified com . driver that is better at hardware 
handshaking .  . this driver is distributed along with  . 
b) load the driver after establishing the slip connection. my modem is a 
v . 32bis . modem on com1 , so here is how i would load the driver. 
w h 4 slip 
c) as discussed above if you use dos tcp ip applications in windows 3 . x . 
dos boxes , you probably want to use com . 
com . 
d ) if you use winqvt net , load com . 
com . 

instructions for com . 
if you choose to use com . instead of com . , the 
instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference. you 
will have to delete the line device vcd from the section 
of system . ini .  . this will interfere with running regular windows comm 
applications  ( such as crosstalk ) , and you will get lots of dropped 
characters etc. in these applications. this is therefore not 
recommended. would be loaded as 
w h 4 

configuring windows 3.1 

a) make the following modifications to the system.ini file 
section. 
i) list all your com ports , with their addresses and interrupts .  . 

4 

3 

5 
this can also be done from within windows control panel , 
but double clicking on the ports icon. 
ii ) give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer 
10000 
iii) change the com port value for the com port that you wish 
to use for your modem to zero .  . this is the amount of time that 
windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to 
another application. if you use winqvt net and then want to switch 
from one session to another , and this value is at the default value 
of 2 seconds , you are will get a gpf and windows will crash. 
0 
this can also be done from within windows control panel. 
double click on 386 enhanced , and under device contention , set 
the device contention for the com port your modem is on to 
never warn 

additional notes 

what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each 
slip session 

i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user 
a permanent ip address , so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet . ini . 
each time that i establish a slip connection. 

if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in , 
please try to use aware software , and let do the 
configuration for you. however , qvtnet is not aware and 
will not work over a slip connection. to get qvtnet working in a 
situation such as this , you must do the following 

edit the qvtnet . ini . file. let the net section look like this 

net 
name 
ip 
netmask 255.255.255.0  ( or whatever is appropriate for you) 
20 
packet vector 60  ( or whatever is appropriate ) 

save the changes , and then write protect this file 
r qvtnet . ini . 

start your slip connection , and remember the name and ip address 
that you are assigned .  . each time you start net 3 . 1x . , the 
general configuration dialog box will open. enter the name and 
ip address and you were assigned for that session , click on ok , 
and you should be up and running. the changes you make will not 
be saved , as qvtnet . ini . is write protected .  . 

a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address 
assignment is provided by victor 
victor uses the program to semi automate qvtnet preparation .  . 
is used to inquire the assigned ip , which is then saved to a 
file called . another file is essentially a complete 
qvtnet . ini . file that lacks the ip address. in the final step 
and are copied into a single qvtnet . ini . file. an example of 
victor 's batch file is provided below 

com2 
com . 
i ip s 
i my ip is s 
copy q net e com qvtnet qvtnet . ini . 
del q 
@echo off 
echo . 
echo ready to run 

for questions and more details about , please contact victor 


software is attempting to add capability to winqvt net. 

how do you use over slip 

will not work over the com . packet driver , and crashes 
immediately if used with com . 

will work with c exe . , when c is used in ethernet 
simulation mode. an example of this configuration is shown below 

the latest release of is 1 . 2c . and it is important that you 
use this version , if you want to use virtual packet drivers with 
applications like trumpet for windows  ( to be released very  . 

from autoexec.bat 

lh c com1 vec 65 baud ether  ( packet driver ) 
lh 5 65 5  ( pktmux loaded for 5 virtual packet drivers) 
lh 7f 65  ( first virtual packet driver used for net) 
lh com .  ( qvt net com) . 
63 65  ( pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet ) 

additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within 
windows 3.1 dos boxes. for example , my pif file to load is 
directed to the file bat . . this is what bat . reads 
like 

60 65 loads a virtual packet driver at 
cd 

cd 
60 u the packet driver at 
exit causes the dos window to close 

i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp ip applications 
like pc gopher .  . it is my experience that works fine 
even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos 
sessions , are loaded at the same software interrupt .  . for example 
within two different dos boxes one for and the other for 
gopher , the virtual packet driver  ( pktdrv ) is loaded at in each 
instance .  . 

how much does degrade the performance of c 

i have a v . 32bis . v . 42bis . modem in a 386 33 running windows 3.1 with 
a reasonably fast video card  ( ati graphics  . under these 
conditions , when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and 
being used as follows 
a) driver at qvtnet ftp client session 
b) driver at in one dos window tn3270 session 
c) driver at in another dos window trumpet for dos 

i get ftp transfer rates of 0.8 1.0 kb sec while transferring 
compressed files. this rate is comparable to that which i get with 
loaded as a packet driver , and where a single tcp ip session 
is active. if is used a packet driver and a single session 
is active , i get transfer rates of 1.3 1.4 kb sec on the same 
files. 

while there is about 40 degradation in the performance of , 
for me the benefits of being able to use outweigh the 
performance hit. 

c and ethernet simulation mode 

in ethernet simulation mode , c ver 1.3 works with all the 
applications that i have tested it with. one or two applications 
that required ethernet simulation balked at c 1.2 , but even 
these rare problems have been resolved with ver 1.3 

when is used in ethernet simulation mode , and used with , 
i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads 
ip incorrect packet type or ip bad version number . this does not 
seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning , although i cannot comment on 
loss of performance. 

what can you do if your dos tcp ip application does not work with 
c in ethernet simulation mode 

in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with 
c in ethernet simulation mode , first contact the author 
peter tattam , and let him 
know. chances are that he can fix it. 

in the meanwhile , you can try the following. i do not know if it is 
kosher , but it worked when i had problems with c ver 1.2 

(c is loaded at as described above under the section) 

i load com . at , run the application and then terminate 
com . 

this also works within windows 3.1 virtual dos boxes. however a 
packet driver like can be used in only one virtual dos box 
at a time. 

so for example , here is my batch file to run grateful med (a 
medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library 
of  . 

w h 4 loads 
cd 
search 
cd 
terminates 
exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows 

if you use this method , be cautious about one thing do n't have 
any active dos sessions open at the same time. after closing 
the window , you can run your dos sessions with no 
problem. btw , the example above grateful med , works with no 
problems with c ver 1.3 

phone script files 

the documentation that accompany phone , provide good instructions on 
writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than 
the university of minnesota server. for example here is a script 
that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend .  . 

background to start a slip connection , i dial our terminal server , 
and login with a username and password. after doing so , i start a slip 
session with the following command slip username slip . dialin . cwru . edu . , 
followed by my password again. 

here then is the relevant portion of the phone . cmd . script file

how to use packet drivers other than with phone 

the quick answer there is no clean way. below is a batch file 
hack that i wrote to use phone with other packet drivers. in this 
example , the packet driver is peter tattam 's  . to use a 
batch file like this , you must know the parameters with which you 
plan to use the packet driver i.e interrupt vector , baud rate , 
port address , and irq .  . this batch file requires com . , 
exe . , and com . to be in the same directory 
or in your path ... 

all that the batch file does is to let you dial the slip connection 
using phone , load the appropriate packet driver , hangup the 
connection , and unload the driver when you are done ...

lots of stuff deleted because i felt like it 

this ms bashing has definitely lost all its humor value. 

i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users 
of ms products do not even know about internet , and unix is that 
very unfriendly place where bizzare replace the rather 
comfortable they know. and the have subtle 
differences between the different vendors .  . while pc users tend to 
customize any windowing setup , they can not do much with their 
command line. 

so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize 
quality. ms has made their life easier , and more productive and to them 
that is quality. they do not care about what innovative things ms has 
done , other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot 
easier. you may know better than most computer users in this world 
but that will not change their perception .  . 

face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to 
all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream 
of computer users. we here on the net are not mainstream computer users.

after hearing endless debate  ( read name calling ) over which os is better , dos

of different operating systems , i have decided to put the two products to a 
head to head test , as so many fellow have suggested .  . i have , 
however , no desire whatsoever to use a version of os 2 which wont really 
do what it says (i . e .  . run windows apps) os 2 2.0 2.1 will not run windows 
apps in 386 mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but 
os 2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to. i have heard 
that os 2 2.2 beta is available via ftp , and i was wondering if anyone knew 
where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information , as i would like , 
once and for all , to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs. 

i do n't think the question is 
will os 2 x . x . run windows y . y . apps now 

a more important question is 
will subsequent os 2 versions continue to run apps 
from subsequent windows versions in the future 

can it keep up will a future os 2 3.0 run windows 4 apps 
is very complex and is the sign of things to come. 
after this fall , i believe ibm no longer has any rights to 
view microsoft code. after that , the only way to maintain 
some sort of compatibility is to reverse engineer .  . would

guide to creation of dib images

copyright march 15 , 1991 



abstract 

the format of images created for use by ms windows 3.0 3.1 
applications is documented in the ms windows programmer 's 
reference guide. this guide is intended as a clearify some 
wording of the specifications , and to put forth a 
recommendation among the various alternatives .  . 

please send updates corrections suggestions and revisions to 
me. please thank me for writing this on my own time by 
keeping my name with the document .  . thank you for your 
respect. 

this document copyright , 1991 , by thomas b. kinsman .  . 
if desired , a postscript version of this document is 
available. 

this information is free. you get more than what you pay for. 
do n't sue me if i'm wrong. 


overview 

the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent bitmap 
file format.  ( what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to 
me . ) . four pixel resolutions are supported 1 bit , 4 bit , 8 bit , and 24 bit 
pixels .  . 

these images were intended for use on dos  ( ibm , or little endian ) systems. 
if you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte 
swap all short and long integer values .  . 

by convention , dib images end in the extension  . bmp . . this is because 



march 15 , 1991

they are a super set of earlier bitmap image files . consequently you 
will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files. 

since dib images files are a super set , there are three flavors of dib 
images 
o dos dib images. these are the recommended convention , and the 
form which i will describe how to create .  . they are intended for 
applications running under ms windows 3.0 in a dos environment. 
o os 2 dib images. my understanding is that these are the flavor 
of dib images that were used by the presentation manager. 
o old style bitmap images. 








































march 15 , 1991

differences between flavors 

the dos dib images consist of 
1. a file header which identifies the file as a 
dib file. this header also gives the total size of the image 
file , and the offset to the image data. 
2. a image header which specifies the image 
attributes .  . 
3. an optional palette of colors used by the image. if it exists , 
this may contain 2 , 16 , or 256 entries. each entry is a windows 
structure. 
4. the image data itself. 


the os 2 dib images consist of 
1. the same file header which identifies the file 
as a dib file. this header also gives the total size of the 
image file , and the offset to the image data. 
2. a image header which specifies the image 
attributes .  . 
3. an optional palette of colors used by the image. again , if this 
exists it may contain 2 , 16 , or 256 entries. each entry is a 
windows structure. 
4. the image data itself. 


the old style image bitmap consists of 
1. either a or a  . which header 
type is determined by the first long integer  ( dword ) value. 
2. an optional color palette .  . this palette may be composed of 
either windows structures  ( if the header was a 
bitmapinfoheader ) or windows structures  ( if the header 
was a  . 
3. the image data itself. 


creating dib image files. 

creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forward steps. 
the headers need to be created and then written to the file. these header 
structures are defined in the ms windows 3.0 windows . h . include file. 
palette information needs to be stored for images that are not 24 bit 
images. the five general steps are 
1. filling in the and the 
structures the basic image information. 
2. if the image is a 1 bit , 4 bit , or an 8 bit image , creating the 
color palette of  . 
3. calculating the total file size and putting this information in

the field of the  . 
4. calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the 
file , and putting this in the field of the 
 . 
5. writing to the file the , the , 
the color palette , and the image data  ( in that order) .  . 

the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft c type 
defined keywords .  . the following table describes these keywords for those 
not familiar with microsoft c.

the field is the two ascii characters  b  and  . this serves 
to identify the file as a dib image file. on an intel byte ordered 
machine  ( ibm or a compatible) , this constant can be formed in c as the 
quantity  ( 'm' 8 'b' ) on an intel system. 

the field is the total size of the file. for our purposes this 
field is equal to the size of the , plus the size of the 
, plus the number of entries in the color palette times 
the size of a , plus the number of bytes of image data. if the 
image data is being written out in an uncompressed form , this value can be 
calculated ahead of time. otherwise , this field needs to be filled in 
later. 

both the and the fields are always set to 
zero .  . 

the field is set to the offset to the start of the image data 
from the start of the file. for our purposes , this field should be set 
to the size of the , plus the size of the 
, plus the number of entries in the color palette times 
the size of a  . this works out because the image data is written 
write after the color palette if one exists.

the 

this structure is defined in windows . h . as 
typedef struct

the field is set to the size of the structure 
itself. when reading the image file , this value is what is used to 
determine that the image contains a and not a 
 . 

the field is the width of the image in image pixels .  . 

the field is the height of the image in image lines. 

the field should always be set to 1. this data is written out 
as if there was one color plane. 

the field is the bit depth of the image. this must be either 
1 , 4 , 8 , or 24 , depending on the bit depth of the image data. 

the field tells how the image data is compressed if it is 
compressed .  . dib images support two forms of run length encoding .  . 
however , i have never seen any images which use it , and do n't know yet how 
it works. set this field to zero  ( long zero , or 0l ) , to indicate that the 
data is not compressed .  . 

all subsequent fields of the structure may be set to 
zero .  . a requirement of the software that it be able to 
compute these fields as necessary from the previous information. 

the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be . 
for 4 bit and 8 bit images this field indicates that not all of the 
possible color entries are used and that the image contains 
colors. if you are using only 32 colors with an 8 bit image , then you may 
only want to save 32 of the possible 256 palette entries. generally , set 
this field to zero .  . 



march 15 , 1991

color palettes 

each entry of a color palette is a structure. the 
structure is defined in the windows . h . include file as 
typedef struct 
byte 
byte 
byte 
byte 

the field is always zero .  . for each color used , the amount 
of blue , green , and red are filled into the structure and the structure is 
written to the file. a value of zero in the , , or 
fields indicates that that particular component does not 
contribute to the color composition .  . a value of 255 in any of these 
fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color 
composition .  . 



image data 

there are three surprises about the ordering of image data in dib image 
file. the creator of this format was determined to be creative , and 
certainly was. 

within the image data , each line written out is padded to the next four 
byte quantity .  . so , if you had an 8 bit image which was only one pixel 
wide , you still have to write out four bytes for every image line. the 
number of bytes per line can be calculated as 

bytes per line  ( width in pix bit depth 31 ) 32 4 

or , in terms of the fields of the structure 

bytes per line  ( biwidth 31 ) 32 4 


when writing out your image data , you must write it out bottom line first. 
the bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the 
first line of image data in the file. 

for 1 bit , 4 bit , and 8 bit images , information is written as you would 
expect. one bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte .  . four bit 
images are padded two pixels to a byte .  . eight bit images are written one 
pixel per byte .  . twenty four bit images are written three bytes per pixel .  . 
however , for 24 bit images the information must be written out in the 
order blue , green , red. while most image file formats write data out in 



march 15 , 1991

an rgb ordering , a dib image file writes the data out in an 
ordering .  . 

summary 

this should provide enough information to create dib images from 
applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines .  . if you 
find out any more about dib images , please pass the information on to me 
so that i can modify this document accordingly.

by night i'm an amiga user. by day i work with windows. i 'd be much more 
comfortable in windows if i had two things. 

1. a good personal information manager. you know a calendar , address book , 
reminder list etc .  .  .  . rolled into one clean interface. 

i prefer myself , but it is a strange kind of pim .  . 

2. a good file manager. is very poor by my standards. how 
about one that has a left and right window and allows file operations 
between them. being able to launch programs from the same interface 
would be nice. as well as text reading and graphics viewing .  . those 
who are familiar with directory opus on the amiga know what i'm 
looking for. 


well , a few things might help you like the 3.1 file manager better. 

1) to get more than one window simply double click on a drive icon. 
that it only gives you one window to work with is a fallacy .  . you 
can drag files between windows , to any icon on the tree on the left 
side of the window , and to any drive icon. this beats your left 
and right window as you can have as many open as you wish instead 
of just two. 

2) you can launch any app from within file manager by double clicking 
on the executable 's icon. 

3) you can launch any application and open a document file by double 
clicking on the document file 's icon , provided you have 
associations set correctly. this is easily done with the menus .  . the 
browse capability adds a lot of functionality to 3 . 1 .  . so if you 
name all your text files with  . txt . and point all gif , tiff , etc. 
files towards paintshop or wingif , this takes care of your 
requirement for text reading and graphics viewing . 

i know someone who prefers using file manager as his shell .  . setting up 
all the associations you need is the way to do it. 

if directory opus is half as good as file manager then it must be 
pretty good indeed ! file manager just needs you to understand how 
some things are done.

should i use emm386 or should i remove it from my config.sys

emm386 enables the system to use the upper memory between 640 and

here is the latest on your help files to a server. 
the  ( winhelp( ) function , as i am told by ms , does search your path so 
ms windows wo n't be a problem as long as you include 
the path to where you move them to , however , if an application has 
hardcoded the path into their code so that when winhelp is invoked it 
searches the given path (i . e .  .  ( winhelp(hwnd , c amipro ) for example) then 
winhelp does not search your path and instead looks only to that directory 
where you have installed your software. 

i tested this out on a variety of software packages. i moved all my

on a recently acquired gateway 2000 machine , when starting windows , 
three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the ms logo 
disappears and before takes over. this does not happen 
on any other of our machines , and i am wondering whether this is a 
feature or whether this is related to several problems we are having 
with the machine. 

the system is a gateway 2000 , 4dx 33 machine.

well , i got from cica  ( do n't know which version , but i think 
it 's the latest , as this is not long ago) , and i was initially  . 
but here 's the low down 

is a great , as long as you only . it lets you 
files , only selected files , and even puts the files in a 
checkout directory , and creates a checkout  . grp . and group if you want 
to check the program out. it even prompts for deletion of these on 
exit , if you t like the program. 

however  ( big however over here) .  . i have problems zipping .  . i do n't 
specifics on this , or ammount of consistency , but sometimes when i 
zip a few files , or add a file to a  . zip . , dos will violate something 
or other , and i 'll be asked  ( in a kind , micro oft kind of way) to quit 
all applications , quit windows , and restart my computer. i do n't know 
 ( as i said ) how consistent this is , as i  zip much  ( and when i do , 
now i just go to dos and use it from there , or just use the run cmd ) 
but i do know it 's happened when i added files to an existing  . zip . 
file , and when i created a new  . zip . file , using selected files only. 
i do n't know if it 's happened when i zip an entire dir. 

still , it has a rather nice interface , and quite useful ing 
functions. if the above is fixed , i 'll be the first to register the new

i am working with visual basic v2 . 0 . for windows. 
specifically , i am working on an application that generates formatted reports. 
since , some of these reports can be rather large , my first question is 

1. is there a way to increase the size of a list box or text box in 
visual basic windows beyond the 64k limit 

as i have not  ( as yet being optimistic ) come across a way to get 
around the above problem , i am working on the following approach 

i am trying to create my own defined template in ms word , using the 
macros so that i can open up word from visual  ( basic(vb ) and load 
this template of mine , which will work in the following way 

it will first open ini . file  ( created in vb at the time when the 
user selected the kind of report he weanted ) and read the section from the 
 . ini . file and jump to the appropriate code in template which will then 
open and read a file pertaining to the section it read from the  . ini . file. 

1. when using the function in , is there a way 
to specify change the default  . ini . file (which is win . ini) . to ini . file 

2. when using the file input function in is there a way to 
read more than the 32k at one time 


any help will be appreciated.

keywords eisa , video , performance 
organization the world public access unix , brookline , ma 
lines 25 

i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most 
eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa 
counterparts .  . for instance , the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is 
only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus , which is n't 
what i would call fast. 

i do n't understand why eisa video cards are n't , as a group , on the 
same level of performance as local bus cards , given that eisa video 
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around , instead of isa 's 8 bits. 

since they are not , why would anyone  ( me included) pay a higher 
cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than 
and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board , such as a 
diamond speedstar 24x from pc magazine 's (i think) recent report , 
i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card , but it 's 
around 500 , which is just about double what my wallet will allow 
me to spend .  . and , for 500 , i could get a diamond viper and still 
have 100 left over  ( of course , i 'd have to get a local bus mother 
board too .  .  . ) . 

can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration

i had this problem when i initially installed my sound blaster pro and here 's 
what the tech support told me. 

they told me to look for the files that are stated in the readme file from 
the win31 subdirectory of the directory. now look in the system.ini 
file and if any of them say device 386 . than change it to

thats should work. was your system.ini file erased for some reason that would

upon getting animated desktop for windows as a gift from my boyfriend , i 
could n't wait to install it. i had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of  i wants . ' . after installing the software , it did n't load. 
no part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well. 

i called with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system .  .  . concluded that i had one of 
the 
systems that the software was  incompatible  . of course they 're 
willing to 
give me my back .  .  . what a waste of time and energy. the folks on their 
support line , although nice , are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
windows 3 . 1 .  . 
after my experience with the installation of the sb 16 , i learned 
some of the function of windows dll files. before sending back desktop 
animator , decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

 . dll . files i had. i had 2 versions of dll . one dated 8 92 and 
100k the 
other dated 1 93 and smaller (the 1 93 smaller version was the one supplied 

with desktop  . i moved the bigger , older version of dll . 
to a 
directory outside my path.  ( for some reason , i had the older dll . 
in my 
windows directory and the newer in my windows system directory . ) . 
when i did this , the animator 's editor loaded .  .  . and so did 2 other of the 
applications in the package .  .  . the main application still did n't load. does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions

this is the part that usually gets me. while i am set to make money , there usually 
are other things to be considered and debated .  . that is the purpose of life. 

like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product are measures 
of success. they can be measures of short term or long term success. i think 
in ms case they are a good measure of their long term success. the original 
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number 
of people attacking ms and not willing to accept anything positive about ms. 
i was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to 
look at the sales of ms products they definitely tell a different story. 

i also think a large number of the attackers or as you call 
them are highly technical .  . look around in the real world people do n't want 
to grep and auck and ls l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. like it or not ms and the 
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under windows does 
this and does it well. we are running 150 pc 's loaded with a complete 
suite of mostly ms windows applications in an administrative business 
function on a novell network running all software off the server. 
it does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick 
windows again. 
again i repeat to ms keep doing what you are doing. you are doing a great 
job.

hello , 

recently i noticed there is a directory named in my disk .  . i did n't 
notice it before and i wonder if while installing an application an image of 
the disk was created , or if win3 . 1 . automatically created a backup of its files. 
i could n't find any documentation on the utility having an image of 
the disk is taking a lot of disk space. does anybody know if this is just 
something the people who installed win3 . 1 . did or it is a backup mechanism 

thanks ,

subject observation floppy copy works under pgm mgr , but not dos shell .  . 
organization motorola  ( austin , tx ) 
lines 51 
nntp posting host ome . sps . mot . com . 

has anyone observed this if i copy a large , say 800k file (a large pkzip 
file for instance) to my floppy drive (3 . 5 . ) under ms windows 3.1 via either 
program manager or a dos shell , the file copied under the dos shell 
has errors whereas the file copied from within program manager does not. 

the corruption is detected by executing pkunzip t b file . zip . after 
both copies .  . the file copied via the dos shell always shows corruption .  . 


now here 's the kicker 


i have many windows open while doing this both dos and windows apps. 
supposedly all windows  apps share the same time slice , whereas the 
dos apps get their own equal time slice  ( unless  . 


so , as an example , i have 5 windows  apps open , 2 multitasking dos sessions running , 
and one execution dos shell iconized  . under this 
scenario , cpu time is divided into two major slices one for all the windows 
apps and one slice for the running dos app. 

when copying under windows pgm mgr , i 'll assume the other windows and dos tasks 
are essentially inactive .  . thus pgm mgr gets , say , 80 of the windows slice and 
95 of the execution background dos shell 's slices .  . thus it gets ( . 95) . 2 
 . 72 . or 72 of the total available cpu time. 

when copying in a dos shell , i activate the execute exclusive mode dos shell 
(no other dos background tasks allowed) , full screen , under the windows task 
manager. the cpu time available to this shell would be 80 of the windows slice 
 ( assumming inactive windows applications ) and 100 of the dos slice 
(1 . 8) . .8 or 80 of the total available cpu time. 

so why do i get copy errors under dos if it has the greater amount of cpu 
time is program manager working in a pre emptive mode during the floppy 
copy it must be !

it could also be that your shell is hogging the resources. for example , 
open the apps with data files that cause resulting low system resources

then do the same with program manager , and see if it 's the shell or the

i'm currently using and i'm about to burn it and the disks it rode

me crazy. tonight it decided that for any graphic it writes out as a 
tiff file that 's under a certain arbitrary size , it will swap the left 
and right sides of the picture ! . usually it confines itself to not 
copying things to the clipboard (so i have to save and load pix for 
editing in paintbrush ) or crashing every hour or so. 

the one nice thing it has , though , is it 's dither option. you 'd think 
that this would turn colors into dots , which it does if you go from , say , 
256 colors to 16 colors. but if you go from 256 or 16 colors to b w , 
you can set a threshold level for which colors turn to black and which 
turn to white. for me , this is useful because i can turn light grays on 
buttons to white , and the dark grays to black , and thereby preserve the 
3d effect on buttons and other parts of the window. 

if you understood my description ) can you tell me if another  ( less 
buggy ! ) program can do this as well

subject local windows  . vs .  . shared windows  ( discussion ) 
organization the ohio state university , department of physics 
lines 110 

i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows 
from a novell administrator 's point of view. 

i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they 
 ( microsoft ) has decided to implement , as a standard for software support , 
the local setup  ( described below) as the most advantageous installation . 
if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation 
then i will comply but i 'd like to hear it from administrators first. 

the local windows installation 

windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive  ( assuming the 
resources are available) .  . from a network administrator 's implementation , 
he she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup a. 
then install windows on a per machine bases by running setup off the network 
to install the complete system on the local drives .  . in this way , all drivers 
are available to the setup procedure w o the need to change disks .  . 

advantages 
reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to 
the local access of main windows files. 
network independence if the network fails  ( and they all do at one point 
or another) , the local installation would allow users to keep producing 
and reduce the cost of down time. 
faster windows theoretically , windows will run faster from a local hard 
drive than over a network. this may be a hard point to prove if the network 
has an optical backbone and or the network drives are significantly faster 
access than local ones. 
a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about 
varying setups  ( monochrome , color , types of mouse , etc .  .  . ) . since the 
windows installation is assigned to the workstation .  . 

disadvantages 
cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk 
space. workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can 
increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent. 
administration local windows installations are very difficult to 
administer .  . 
new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available , each of 
which would have to be individually installed on each workstation .  . 
security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system 
files from simple ignorance .  . this could result in quite a headache for 
administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations .  . 
backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks .  . the backup 
sets  ( if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly. 
backup individually  ( to floppy ) may not happen at all. this may be 
eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable 
applications and not user data. 

the shared windows installation 

windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup a procedure 
described above. users  ( or administrators ) then install a minimal set of 
files to individual user directories. these directories may be on a 
local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory. the bulk of the 
windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory 
(some 400 files) and are accessed  ( shared ) as needed by users throughout 
their windows session. the user 's files consist of a small set of files 
that the user has updated during his her windows session. these include 
group files ,  . ini . files and other regularly updated files. 

advantages 
a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy. as 
an updated driver becomes available , it only needs to be installed in this 
single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it. 
assuming that the users  files are maintained in network  ( home ) directories , 
the administrator can easily edit any  . ini . file as needed to correct 
problems that may arise .  . this includes win.ini and system . ini .  . 
backup of all pertinent files is done easily. even if the users  files 
are on a local hard disk , the bulk of the windows system is backed up with 
all driver updates. 

disadvantages 
network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network 
directory , traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the 
speed of windows. 
if the network crashes , all production comes to a stop since window 's 
is upon the network for its files. loss of data usually occurs 
as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will 
usually not be able to save their work. 
although minimal , disk space is still a consideration .  . if the users  files 
are maintained on the network , a large number of users can cause a 
significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows 
files alone. 
users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation 
hardware are similar. this is due to the windows installation being 
tied to a particular username  ( in the case of network user files) .  . 

the discussion 

i would like to know , from other administrators with a large windows 
, how they prefer setting up windows. personally , i have 
setup numerous installations using the shared setup. all windows and 
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of 
local hard disks .  . in fact , i sold a network on the fact that the 
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations 
and thus save that much more money. 

i would also like to see recommendations for applications. should 
apps such as word and or excel be installed locally regardless of how 
windows is installed again , i keep all files on the network for easy 
backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket 
if the network crashes , work comes to a halt .  . 

now i am sure microsoft  ( and i know your out there) has their own 
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to 
hear from people with actual working experience with users and network 
administration.

my original post 
subject re why is my mouse so jumpy  ( ms mouse ) 
i have a microsoft serial mouse and am using mouse . com . 8.00  ( was using 8.20 
i think , but switched to 8.00 to see if it was any better) .  . vertical motion 
is nice and smooth , but horizontal motion is so bad i sometimes ca n't click 
on something because my mouse jumps around. i can be moving the mouse to 
the right with relatively uniform motion and the mouse will move smoothly 
for a bit , then jump to the right , then move smoothly for a bit then jump 
again  ( maybe this time to the left about .5 inch ! ) .  . this is crazy ! i have 
never had so much trouble with a mouse before. anyone have any solutions 

aha , i think i found the problem and it is n't dirt ! another guy here was 
using a different kind of mouse and was using video driver (the 
default vga for windows) .  . he has an s3 card like i do and when i 
loaded the s3 video driver in windows for him , his mouse became jumpy too. 
seems like it is the s3 driver ! is there any newer one than version 1.4 
that would solve this problem it is really bad. i have to use the 
keyboard instead sometimes ! the s3 zip . on cica is version 1.4 (which is 
the same version that came with my card) .  .

news software vax vms 1.41 


this may be an faq  ( if so , please direct me to the known answer) but i 
am getting frustrated and looking for help. 

i am running win 3.1 with ndw 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 
6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my 
applications are not giving back system resources when i close them. 

when i load windows i start with about 83 resources available but many 
of the application programs i run regularly  ( wpwin 5.2 , vb 2.0 , winqvt 
2.8 , lotus organizer , etc . ) . seem to not return all their resources when 
i exit them. after a day or two of work i often find myself down under 
50 of available resources even when i have no applications other than 
my shell running. 

i am aware this is a known problem what i am looking for are some 
suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it. 

1. what software is the culprit win 3.1 , ndw , my applications are 
some modes of win 3.1  ( standard , real , enhanced ) better than others at 
plugging this leak 

2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak 

3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with 
this seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a 
great market for a third party memory company like qemm .  . 

4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak (i was 
hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this , but it seems no different 
than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources . ) . 

5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less 
likely my code will eat resources 

6. any other suggestions that i do n't know enough to ask for 
specifically 

thanks for your help. as this is a common problem and i have seen only 
a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who 
would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending 
me email.

if you are planning on using this on a regular basis , the printer

thanks , 

the format for word for windows doc files is available from microsoft .  . 
call their developer support services number (sorry , do n't have it handy) 
and ask for the word for windows binary file format spec. 

warning it is not terribly useful , and you will need to do a lot of 
looking before you can figure out how the stuff is stored .  . 

general primer 

word for windows stores its data in two chunks .  . the first chunk is the 
actual text in the file. this is all stored together and has nothing 
but text and graphics. the second chunk is the formatting information. 

for general use , to read a word for windows file , skip the first 384 bytes 
of the file  ( its a general header) .  . then read the remaining text until you 
hit binary data.

subject tcp ip through windows 3.1 
lines 52 

i do n't know much about computers , so please bear with me. here 's my question 

context i use a package called slip on my home computer to connect to the 
university mainframe  ( an ibm 3090 running vms mvs ) , and log on to my 
account. when i installed slip on my computer , i had to configure it 
for my modem (14 . 4 . internal) and had to supply the phone 
number to dial to reach the mainframe .  . the way it works now is that 
i type telnet uicvm or tn3270 uicvm  ( either will work) at the dos 
prompt .  . uicvm is the node name of the mainframe .  . the program then 
the mainframe , establishes a protocol , and gives me the 
screen. telnet and tn3270 are the names of batch files in my slip 
directory. i have been told that a kermit protocol is used for the 
session. 

problem i would like to be able to do all this under windows 3.1 because i 
hardly ever use dos directly .  . slip will not run under windows. i 
talked to the people at our computer center , and they suggested that 
i use a packet driver called com . with slip .  . they gave me 
instructions on how to load it before i start windows , and how to 
modify the and batch files  ( in the slip directory) 
to ensure that it would work. i did all that and i could run slip 
from windows , but there were other problems. for one thing , slip 
would not hang up the phone when i exited .  . i had to run my communi 
cations program to hang up the phone or reboot the computer when 
that did n't work. for another , there were too many errors. it often 
took me 3 4 tries to connect to the mainframe .  . our computer center 
does not support slip under windows , so i ca n't keep going back to 
them with more questions. 

question is there some other shareware package that will run under windows 
and do what slip is supposed to do i need a package that is not too 
expensive , which is why i am looking for shareware .  . i have heard that 
there are regular commercial packages that do all this , but they cost 
hundreds of dollars. these are the main requirements 

1. must be able to run under windows 3.1 
2. must allow vt100 and ibm tn3270 terminal emulation 
3. must allow ftp file transfers , since that 's the only kind the 
mainframe allows .  . no y modem or z modem etc. i believe the ftp 
transfers are made through a kermit protocol , but i'm hazy about 
that. 

a subsidiary feature  ( that would be nice to have) if it 's a true 
windows program  ( rather than a dos program modified to run under 
windows) is the ability to run the session in a window concurrently 
with other applications and to cut and paste between the telnet 
session and other applications. 

any information received is appreciated.

of the differences in how the interrupts are handled , as well as 
the fact that the mouse data is received over the computer bus

(i have been having trouble posting this article from within tin for over 
a week. if you do get multiple copies , my apologies . ) . 

here is a challenge to microsoft or supporters to defend the 
pathetic state of dos 6 as an upgrade distribution it is a long story 
but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the 
potential pitfalls of upgrading to dos 6 that i have been able to 
notice after only about a week of playing around with it. 

my 


ti travelmate 4000  ( 486sx 25) 4m ram 120m disk 
system bios version 1.03 05 21 92 by texas instruments 
cl vga bios v 1.03 a1 by cirrus logic

smart drive cache 1 . dos6 ) parameters 2048 1024 a b 
windows benchmark  ( winbench(tm ) v 3.11 02 11 93 by labs 

after to dos 6 , i could not understand why certain things 
became so slow , especially after i decided to try  . in the 
process of finding out why , i discovered some interesting things. 


disk performance with double space and smart drive 


while most things did not appear to slow down most of the time , certain 
applications appeared to run very much slower .  . what was interesting is 
that commands like  chkdsk  and  defrag  were running far too slowly to 
consider them useful by any standards. i suspected double space  ( ds ) 
and decided to measure its impact on my system using  . 

the real disk winmark of for the original system  ( as shipped from 
factory with dos 5 and 3 . 1) . became when upgraded to 
dos 6 with ds .  . thus there is an effective performance degradation of 
more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because i knew 
that ds compression must cost something. 

specifically , for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes , ds actually 
improves transfer rates by about 10  ( because cpu being faster than 
i o , more cpu cycles needed for ds is more than compensated by savings 
in i o  . however , for all other cases , particularly large 
random writes , the transfers take up to three times as long. 

while the performance depends on the type of access (i . e . random or 
sequential , small or large transfer units) , on the average  ( based on 
winbench 's assumptions ) , the disk slows down to half its speed. 

the tests alone , done in  real mode   ( see winbench ) and with smartdrv 
on , do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective 
statements like  there is no noticable difference in performance  or 
even that  it will speed up disk access when you have a fast cpu and 
slow disk i o' .  . 

this explained why some applications ran markedly slower , but not why 
 chkdsk  and  defrag  (the latter especially) too so long. 


double space and windows 


dblspace will not run at all from within windows , not even if you 
wanted to only to get information , not modify anything , or for that 
matter even check on its usage try dblspace in a dos box 
within windows and you will see what i mean from the error message you 
get. how narrow minded can a programer get , i wonder. 

yes , this information can be obtained through the dd . add on to 
file manager , but this   dll does not understand a compressed 
floppy !  ( use the dos 6 supplement utility to create a compressed 
floppy if you dont know how to . ) . 


dos 6 defragmenter is incompatible with ti apm 


defragmentation seemed to take too much time. even so , i waited 
patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm .  . 
this confirmation  dblspace def  command for the 120m drive should take 
no more than 30 seconds  ( much faster on other i have used) 
but it took 12 minutes. 

i discovered that if i moved the mouse , defragmentation checking ran 
faster (the figure ticked more rapidly) .  . it dawned on me that this 
had to do with ti 's battery saver advanced power management  ( apm ) 
module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the cpu is idle , 
and it obviously thought ds defragmentation was an idle process ! after 
disabling the ti 's power saver , this operation took only 20 seconds. 


programmers think and gateway nomad users are idiots 


in the readme . txt . file , you can find the the following 

running microsoft backup with and gateway nomad computers 

to avoid a conflict between the turbo feature and microsoft backup 
for windows or ms dos , add a l0 switch to the device command in 
your config.sys that loads the battery . pro . file. or , before you 
run microsoft backup , type l0 at the command prompt .  . 

if you checked ti 's manual on the l0 option , you will realise that it 
means disable all power saving features of your notebook . why would 
anyone want to run a driver disabled ! as i have found out , not only 
does ti 's power management interfere with microsoft backup as the 
readme . txt . claims , but  chkdsk  and  dblspace   ( and who knows what 
else) are crippled by the ti 's power saver .  . 

it is obvious that there is not such thing as apm specifications .  . if 
there indeed is such a thing , then either microsoft programmers or ti 
programmers dont know how to read these specifications .  . you dont have 
to guess as to who are the idiots .  . 

by the way , if you run the advance power management utility , power . exe . 
in dos6 , when you check the status , it says 

power management status 

setting adv max 
cpu idle 60 of time. 

this figure of 60 seems to be the steady state value on my notebook 
when i am running nothing  ( windows with only program manager in 
 . does that mean that windows takes up 40 of my cpu all 
for itself , and that i have at best only 60 left for useful work is 
such an overhead justified  ( whether or not windows is an operating 
system or just another user interface)  ( in dos alone , it reports 99 
idle time . ) . looks like windows is a good example of busy waiting type 
of package that i like my students to study as the classical  negative  
example of our times ! 


microsoft programmers do not know batch programming 


i like to structure my startup script and thus have the equivalent of 
statements like this 

set path c dos 
... 
set path c etc bin path c bin 
... 
set path c etc windows path c windows 
... 
set path path c bcc bin 
... 
set path path mouse 

even though the new dos was installed in the same directory as the old 
one (i . e .  . c dos) , dos 6 installation program each and every 
path statement , and c dos to its value. as a result , my 
resultant path has so many dos 's .  . 

if the installation program wanted to remove the old dos path , and add 
the new dos path , clearly it has to only scan for the path statement 
the old dos directory and replace it by the new dos path. 
 ( even this should only be done if the new dos is installed in a 
directory different from the old one being ) . 

instead , the microsoft programmer  ( if you can call this person one) 
decided to meddle every path statement i had in the autoexec and 
dos to the value. i wonder if microsoft is so desparate that it 
would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process. 

i started a thread on this when dos 4 came up , and the microsoft 
representative in singapore called me about this poster. in fact he 
specifically said his us counterparts saw the poster and relayed the 
information to him as he did not have access to internet. 

now that has not changed one bit. in fact , if you have a path statement 
with path already in it , is it not obvious that the this statement 
should not be touched for any reason 

as another example of the inability of microsoft programmers to 
understand batch programming i had the mouse driver invoked as 

set mouse c etc mouse 
set path path mouse 
mouse mouse . com . 

guess what did it replaced the last statement with 

lh ... c etc mouse mouse . com . 

why is it so difficult just to replace with lh and its 
parameters , without touching the rest of the line , i do not understand. 


dos 6 software quality 


dos 6 is the only operating system i know , in which , under normal usage , 
you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the 
commands that come with it. 

i am deliberately being cryptic about this i challenge microsoft to 
use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it. if they dont 
within a week , i will post how you can create this ghost file. 

surely if i can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a 
particular command only twice , i am sure two dozen microsoft  ( idiot ) 
programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find 
it that is what i was told how microsoft tests the quality of 
their products. 

i think it is funny that microsoft has found ways to test quality 
when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested , but 
can only be built into the product. no wonder they cannot provide any 
form of guarantees on their products , not even a decent list of bugs 
that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond 
repair ! 

also , if you run  dblspace def  often enough , repeatedly when the disk 
is fully defragmented , you may get errors , that was created by the 
 . i got my io . sys . file size error and it got truncated 
when i did the chkdsk .  . this happend only after five successive 
defragmentation after the first one supposedly did its job and 
with no new file creation since. 

, dont you dare reply to this poster on the network until you 
admit that your ds has bugs , and are willing to let us know what we 
should watch out for if we have already used ds .  .

organization the world public access unix , brookline , ma 
lines 28 

i am having a really bothersome problem using the msdos prompt in windows 3.1 
to open a dos box. when i am done with the dos box , i cant get back to windows. 
if i do alt enter to shrink the box or use  exit  to close it , the screen goes 
black and i have to control alt delete until i kill windows. i get a couple 
of screens about app not responding .  . 

i think things are still alive under the black screen because if i alt tab 
to cycle through the running apps , i get flashes of text but then the 
black returns .  . 

this persists even if the machine is powered on and off. 

i am working with an app developed using borland 's 3.1 application frameworks 
and c . it seems to work fine. 

hardware is a 486 with ram not on a network. video is a tseng 
vga .  . dos 5 . 0 .  . 

i reinstalled windows a couple of time but the problem comes back. i am 
using temporary swapping for virtual memory. 

i would really really appreciate any hints anyone might offer. 

thanks , 

jim cant

this is the part that usually gets me. while i am set to make money , there usually

first version of anything from microsoft .  . this includes major version

these are perfectly valid points and i agree. i'm glad we  ( ms ) are starting 
to remedy this situation with dos 6  ( and it will get better in future 
 . you do need to be aware of some history , however. in the 
mid late 80 's , ms 's point of view was that os 2 was going to take over 
the world and dos would be phased out. as such , resources for dos 
 ( and windows , for that matter) development were mostly redirected to os 2. 
the theory was to keep just enough resources on dos to support people 
until they started using os 2 , so utilities and such for dos fell by the 
wayside .  . 

then windows 3.0 hit the market , os 2 (1 . x . , at least .  .  . 2 . x . seems to 
be doing a little better , but its future is still cloudy ) , and people either 
stayed with their dos (3 . x . and 4 . x) . apps or moved to windows. about that 
point in time , ms made its decision to drop os 2 for dos windows in the 
short term and windows nt in the long term. dos 5 , much improved over dos 
3 . x . and 4 . x . , was the first result of ms 's on dos and windows. 
version 6 takes things somewhat further and i suspect future versions will 
offer even more in terms of real os features (i work on nt and have no 
real clue about what my coworkers over in are doing , but i do 
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a 
few years ago) .  .

what appears to be happening is that the truetype fonts do n't get printed properly. my

ok. for windows happily prints gifs etc. ms notepad and ms write will 
print correctly providing the font 's in the text are printer fonts .  . 

when i print truetype fonts , some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. if i change 
the text font to a printer font , the problem is eliminated .  . 

i have tried using printer drivers for printers which the kx  ( snappy name) emulates ,

it has been done , but the other companies do n't have the marketing 
budgets that ms do. 4dos , for instance , is everything that 
command.com should have been  ( but never could be under  . those who 
use it usually find it more addictive than crack cocaine .  . but they 
have to rely on word of mouth for sales. it seems to have worked

is n't a fundamental human right , but they 've got a product that 's 
superior to the dos command interpreter in every way. they have a lot 
more to be proud of than ms does. if ms really gave a damn , they 
could duplicate it , buy it outright  ( they 've got the money) , or even 
use the old ruse of sending engineers out to help them with 
compatability issues and with the technology. 

dos is a mediocre product at a cheap price backed up by top notch 
marketing and vendor agreements .  . the mediocre was excusable in the 
early days when it was someone else 's hack , but they 've had ten years 
to play with it. 

an interesting thought on that most ms products that i'm aware of in 
the last few years allow you to access the names of the designers and 
programmers through easter egg screens , including windows , or at least 
have the names buried in the files. is there such a thing in dos 5.0

i do n't know the specifics of the compression algorithm , but i 've used the

please research carefully .  . just because a fax modem behaves like 
a printer on a local machine , does n't guarantee functionality 
when a local machine has fax software printing to a remotely 
installed fax card. i tried this with workgroups and the 
fax software did n't like it at all. could have been winfax 's 
but i do n't think so. a lot of special hardware 
interaction takes place internally .  . in my case , a fax manager 
program merely intercepts the print job and spools it to 
it 's own directory , not print manager 's spool directory. to 
software , it appears the job was printed . print manager 
plays no part in the handling of the actual process. 

pardon me if i 've incorrectly assumed this is what you were

subject re question on eisa video board performance 
organization texas instruments inc 
lines 42 

in  ( charles allen ) writes 

from article , by  ( christopher f wroten ) 
i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most 
eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa 
counterparts .  . for instance , the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is 
only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus , which is n't 
what i would call fast. 

i do n't understand why eisa video cards are n't , as a group , on the 
same level of performance as local bus cards , given that eisa video 
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around , instead of isa 's 8 bits. 

good question. 
answer the eisa bus does move 32 bits rather than isa 's 8 (16 ) 
but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus. 
i think that 's either 8 or 10 mhz .  . 
the local bus designs also move 32 bits like the eisa , but 
they move the data at the cpu speed , up to 40 mhz .  . 
so , on a 33mhz cpu , the local bus is moving 32bit data at 
33 mhz , and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz .  . 
so the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than eisa on 
a 33 mhz cpu .  . eisa should be about two  ( maybe 3) times as 
fast as isa .  . 

i would expect the eisa board to be more than twice as fast as the isa 
board. not only are you moving data on a path twice as wide (at 
least) , but there is a difference in the number of clocks required for 
bus transactions between the two busses .  . most isa boards require 
multiple clocks per bus transaction typically this is around 3 4. 
eisa boards are suppose to be able to  burst  at a 1 1 rate , so i 
would expect performance to be 6x 8x that of an isa card. 

so i guess , for me , the question is unanswered still. i would expect 
him to be able to see a 6x speed difference , and he apparently does 
not.

yep , the os 2 apps are comming , the os 2 apps are comming .  . 

yet another micro hoping that if he says something long enough , 

hey , i remember the good old days running os 2 2.0 alpha with brief , 
excel , word , and a couple internal apps  ( product support database 
client , os 2 based email front end) .  . life was good. but it was also 
impractical 'cause the masses were using windows and my job was to help 
the masses .  . 

apparently you prefer os 2 to windows or at least did 

to windows 3.0 , yes. 

by you last comment 
do you mean that your knowledge of os 2 is dated (it must be) or argue 

it 's definitely dated i used os 2 1.21 , alpha 2.0  ( when was 
developing it .  .  . ) . 

i suspect that the masses were using windows because they could n't afford 
to use os 2 , can you say as much for nt 

i preferred windows 3.1 because it was more stable faster than 3.0 , 
but could still run more apps than os 2  ( again i made this choice 
before 2.0 was  . 

but getting back to the original question , do you have any data on the 
relative or windows applications versus os 2 applications 
or any evidence that stated support will be dropped by any of the above 

no , i 've seen no such data. 

grow up. other companies are supporting os 2. make points please. 

if you see life in terms of debating points , i think you need 
to grow up. 

ah yes i remember the days when we kids would engage in orderly debate , 
but our parents would usually find out and force us to act in the more 
mature manner of invective and casting rocks and dirt  . 

hee hee. good one 

it does n't help microsoft 
to have employees (i assume you are , due to the org , may be wrong) saying 
such trivial things on the net. 

so 
microsoft employs over 10 , 000 employees .  . walking into this place is 
not like walking into the 1984 commercial. there are individuals 
here. you think they 'll all talk the same way , say the same thing , 
and help microsoft all the time if so , why 

it appears to me that he is voicing his frustration to an attitude 
he has encountered before. 

 .  .  . and . one that i 've encountered as well .  .  .  . 

i on the other hand have had no such 
experience other than from reading this thread. you at microsoft 
are in a unique position to present facts , 

hmm .  . are you sure i'm speaking from my own experience as an 
os 2 user . certainly people in , say , the nt marketing group 
would be in a unique position to present the results of , say , 
research on upcoming nt and os 2 apps (vs windows and ms dos apps) .  . 
part of my point was that just cause one works at microsoft does 
not mean one has access to such data  ( if it  . 

but prefer to make baseless claims or attack to poster. i must 
make the same conclusion as he. 

i will confess to , at times , attacking the poster. 

usenet accounts are not restricted to the  . they 're

organization performance systems int l

lines 65 

i 'd like to appeal to the net 's nt wizards for a bit of advice. 

first a general description of the machine as follows 
motherboard 33 mhz opti chipset , 20 meg memory , 256kb cache 
(soon i hope to drop a dx2 chip into it) 
fahrenheit 1280 video (1 meg , 1024x768x256 ) 
spectrum 16 sound board 
primary disk connor on a caching ide controller 
secondary disk conner as slave on same controller 
tertiary disk fujitsu 650 meg on superstore esdi controller 
planned future disks include scsi hd and cd rom on scsi port 
tape drive is a colorado jumbo 250 on the floppy controller 
future tape drive may be a dat on the scsi interface. 
other hardware includes modem fax , serial ports , and a teletext board 
 ( ugly dos software drives the latter ) 

applications used include normal windows stuff  ( excel , word , quicken 
and turbo pascal windows) but the important stuff is my audio 
work environment which includes turtle beach wave for windows , mcs stereo , 
and other misc stuff for around with audio files. also i use 
stacker on the primary drive , hp  ( for my wife 's use , and she 
wo n't let me get rid of it ! ) , and a product called infinite disk from 
chili pepper software for hierarchical storage management of my seldom 
used offline files. 

i plan to upgrade to nt , when it becomes a released product. i was 
tempted to become a beta user early on , but i do n't have time to mess around 
with the hassles of beta software. i expect to buy it , tear off the 
shrink wrap , and use it without hassle (i know , unrealistic , but i can 
hope ca n't i , after all , i have work to do) .  . 

the advice i want concerns the state of nt regarding device drivers , and 
hardware specific stuff in general. how smoothly can i expect the 
upgrade to go can i expect support for all my stuff , or do i 
still need to scramble around downloading drivers  ( pas , orchid , colorado ) 
from some bbs , etc. what steps should i take to ensure the installation 
goes smoothly .  . note that i want to nuke dos totally from the system. i'm 
allergic to command lines ! i plan to run a pure nt system. also , will 
nt communicate with the workgroups lan what about stacker i currently 
have stacker on the first disk drive. without stacker , and the infinite 
disk product , i will have great difficulty fitting everything i have on the 
system (it 's cramped now) .  . 

i realize stacker will be incompatible with nt , but will there be an nt 
version or will nt support compression a la dos 6 i know infinite disk 
will be incompatible with nt , but will they offer  ( or does anybody else) 
a comparable product for nt and at what cost  ( perhaps i need to ask 
chili pepper that question) i can live without id if i have to , but i 'd 
rather not. will nt run my dos apps (the teletext board mainly ) without 
dos on the system what do i need to keep around 

any feedback or advice  ( including forget nt with good reasons) is much 
appreciated. my only significant reason for moving to nt is i need a better 
multitasking environment than windows  ( among other reasons , wave locks up 
the machine for hours and hours doing dsp processing on large audio files) , 
and i want better lan support than i now have  ( internet access , etc) .  . maybe 
there are better solutions than nt and if so , i would appreciate hearing 
about them  ( os 2 what 's it 's status these days ) 

pls respond by email and if there is interest i 'll summarize for the net. 

thanks ,

up to run windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. needless to say , 
i 'd like to upgrade it to windows 3.1 , and have it work with the network. 

basically , the windows files 'd be on the local hard drive , but 
several dos applications , like word perfect , will be on the network. i 'd 
mainly want windows to access the network drives , the network printers , and 
perhaps handle some network functions as well. if i could multitask the dos 
apps whose executables are on the network , that 'd be great , but i could live 
without it. 

eventually , i 'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working 
with the network and windows 3.1 as well.  ( however , most of the terminals 
are 286s , which leaves the network pretty much dos bound , and i guess that 
leaves out windows for workgroups . ) . and in the future , maybe there 'd be 
norton desktop , but that 's of myself. 

as you can guess , i 've never done anything like this before. i 've

hello , 

who can tell me where can i find the pd or shareware 
which can capture windows 3.1 's output of printer mananger 

i want to capture the output of hp laser jet iii. 

though the postscript can setup to print to file , but hp ca n't .  . 

i try dos 's redirect program , but they ca n't work in windows 3.1 

thankx for any help .  .  .  .  . 


you can print to a file from an hp  ( or any other printer) .  . just go into 
the printers section of your control panel. select the printer you want 
to re direct to a file , and click on connect .  . then choose file as the 
port to connect the printer to. 

when you print from any application to that printer , windows will prompt 
you for a file name for the file into which you want to capture the 
printout .  . 

it 's pretty easy. 

good luck !

hello all ! 

it is my understanding that all true type fonts in windows are loaded in 
prior to starting windows this makes getting into windows quite slow if you 
have hundreds of them as i do. first off , am i correct in this thinking 
secondly , if that is the case can you get windows to ignore them on boot and 
maybe make something like a pif file to load them only when you enter the 
applications that need fonts any ideas

paintshop pro for windows is a fantastic product. it can handle tiff , gif ,

them. there is a shareware version of the program i assume it 's available 
in the windows areas of the standard anonymous ftp locations (i 'd try 
ftp . cica . indiana . edu) .  . log in as ftp , use your username as a password , 
and look for a program called exe . or something like that. i have 
the registered version , and the only major difference i can detect is that 
the unregistered version pops up a message when you start the program 
asking you to please register it. 

once again , fantastic software. up to 24 bits , huge images , everything.

i think most of the people posting are forgetting that most users 
of ms products do not even know about internet , and unix is that 
very unfriendly place where bizzare replace the rather 
comfortable they know. and the have subtle 
differences between the different vendors .  . while pc users tend to 
customize any windowing setup , they can not do much with their 
command line. 

you ca n't customize a command line interface where have you been i 
can change the prompt , i can make aliases (so someone like me who is 
used to say , ls , can type it on my dos machine and still get a 
directory listing ) , and under unix , if i do n't like the command line 
interface , i throw it out and get a different one.  ( csh , bash , ksh , 
sh , etc .  .  . ) . 

so to most of the computer users in the world ms product symbolize 
quality. ms has made their life easier , and more productive and to them 
that is quality. they do not care about what innovative things ms has 
done , other than to make their life with a computer one heck of a lot 
easier. you may know better than most computer users in this world 
but that will not change their perception .  . 

this is true. 

face it until unix come up with a decent gui that is available to 
all variations of unix it just will not catch on with the mainstream 
of computer users. we here on the net are not mainstream computer users. 

a decent gui for all variations of unix lessee .  .  .  . what about motif 
or the stuff from mit  ( twm comes to mind .  .  . ) . those are pretty 
standard. heck , an xwindows program runs like it likes to all the 
end user has to really know is how to manipulate the actual windows 
with the mouse , and since it is a gui , it 's graphical and a bit 
easier to figure out.  ( something the windows people have been pressing 
down our throats for some time now .  .  . ) . 

the thing i fear is that there will be a gap between the normal users 
running windows  ( all flavors ) and the other power users running unix 
and other more advanced oses .  . at least right now , dos is still pretty

i think it is important to clear up your first reply. you gave the 
impression that you should not use smartdrive with stacker .  . you are 
correct re caching the compressed drive. however , as i understand it , 
you can cache the uncompressed drive. thus if you have compressed your 
disk c , you will have a c and probably a d drive under stacker .  . c being 
the compressed disk (which is just a large file on d ) and d being the 
uncompressed disk .  . you should only attempt to stack d . in fact , with 
win 3.1 and smartdrv . exe . , it seems smart enough to automatically default 
to stacking your a , b and d drives .  .

seagate 106 meg 875 . sec 14 . avg seek 3 . track to track 
quantum 400 meg scsi 991 . 2 . kb sec 12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track. 

first off all are these good results i do n't know what typical values 
are. 

those are pretty typical , i believe. 

what i'm wondering now is the following. my swap file is currently on the 
ide .  . i could move it to the scsi which is 13 faster , but then i would not 
be able to use 32 bit access which might make it slower .  . so on 
which drive should i put my swap file to get best results is there a swap 
file speed test program out there 

keep the swap file on the ide .  . 32 bit access is worth a fair amount more 
than 13 .

it depends on wether you are going to replace this with an icon that

well , if it is one of those that comes with windows , just highlight the

you should see a box which says  change  . click on it. you are going 
to be presented with some icons  ( sometimes just one) .  . if you do n't like

select it. browse through the icons presented , and just 
double click on your desired icon. 

if you want to replace it with an icon from some other icon manager , 
say for instance , open the icon manager at the bottom of your

when you have found your desired icon , click on it once , and while holding

foo . txt . is freed up for the next packet of mail , since my autoexec 
macro points to it. 

my main question is this 

how may one rename a file from within a macro to include a

no. it is technically inferior to the os guis that i listed. i have already

that 's where it causes most of my problems. ths machine 's 486dx33 ,

1) windows runs really , really slow most of the time. slower than 
on my old  . graphics draws fills are slow , boots are slow ,

 ( note some of my other non windows applications do funny things that 
appear to be related. several run slow , my  . mod . player crashes the 
system etc .  . ) . 

2) running borland c 3.0 before running windows  ( or any of the other 
programs) completely fixes the problem. windows will run as fast as 
i 've ever seen it run , easily 10 times faster for graphics than 
when i do n't run bc beforehand .  . 

3) i do n't have a memory manager installed in config . sys .  . installing 
emm386 . exe . does not fix the problem it makes it worse. after emm386 is 
installed , running bc will not fix the problem anymore.

i 've been using final from coda for some time , but suddenly it stopped using 
my fonts .  . i have a 386 pc with lots of disk space and memory , a postscript 
laser , win3 . 1 . , finale 2.0.1 and i recently installed atm 2 . 0 .  . i 've been 
fiddling around with the windows setup for some time , and when i needed to do 
some work with finale things did n't print properly. it might and it might 
not have anything to do with the installation of atm from 1 . something . to 
2.0 , but i do n't have the old atm lying around  . 

the most annoying problem was that the petrucci font did n't print , which is a 
rather important font ) 

i managed to get direct printing to work if i included 0 in the 
finale section of win.ini , but compile postscript listing still does n't 
work and it 's those  . eps . files i need. when i look at the  . eps . files 
generated the only font which appears there is courier .  . i found out that if i 
manually changed the courier 24 point to petrucci 24 point in the  . eps . file 
everything worked ok , but i 'd rather avoid that since i have a lot of songs 
to work with. 

and yes , in the special font font names dialog box all the fonts i need are 
listed , with the correct mapping between finale , screen and printer fonts .  . 
finale is obviously aware of the fonts since direct printing of a score works 
well  ( that is , after i included 0) , and all my other windows 
applications print petrucci and the other fonts well. 

has anyone encountered problems like this 

what is the current version of finale from coda music software i have 2.0.1

again , my point was that not all are here to sell

philosophy of  . nor do we necessarily have access to info 
that others have. 

it certainly smacks of that ! remember the poll that you quoted 
saying that you had seen a 95 of users being satisfied with dos 6.0 

it was 93 94 , and actually another msdos team member posted it. 
note that people not on the msdos team would not necessarily know 
about that , or .  .  .  . 

care to recall how unbiased the sample set was 

when i heard those numbers i wondered how they got them  ( having 
worked in product support and knowing that the typical support caller 
has very little positive to say about the product , i figured it was n't 
from there .  .  . ) . so i wandered over to the marketing folks and asked. 
and i was told it was from a survey of registered users. and i 
posted that on the net when people asked where the 93 figure came 
from. 

that post sure looked like fud .  .  .  . and . coming from a 
.... well , it sure seemed like something was not on level. 

hmm .  . i figured , if chuck posted the numbers , why not include where 
they came from (i also find it interesting that postitive info is 
fear , uncertainty doubt  . ) . 

advocacy is good but spreading fud to advocate your favorite os is very 
unethical especially when you have a vested interest in the success 
of that os .  . 

i think you 've got me confused with someone else. i do n't 
pretend that msdos provides what all people need , or that other 
oses  ( including unix os 2) do n't provide useful and or necessary 
features. i also do n't push people to use msdos i even posted in 
comp . os . msdos . misc . that i suggest waiting before installing a 
new os , esp if you have trouble  ( support is always overloaded 
during release , unless the sales are a total  . 

i also get tired of people assuming that are , like , 
members of the borg .  . 

that is because their actions seem to invite this opinion never seen more 
defensive people in my life. 

i ai n't saying some of us do n't get defensive sometimes. do you really 
think msdos gets any more respect within microsoft than outside it 

i just mean we all are n't cut out of the same dough with the same cookie 
cutter .  . we do n't all think alike. yeah , and i have some inside 
info on msdos does n't mean that everyone else does ) 

seriously speaking , it is a shame that ms techie employees get the heat for 
ms 's actions most of which are perpetrated by the management and marketing.

subject re question on eisa video board performance 
organization clemson university 
lines 44 

from article , by  ( christopher f wroten ) 
i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most 
eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa 
counterparts .  . for instance , the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is 
only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus , which is n't 
what i would call fast. 

i do n't understand why eisa video cards are n't , as a group , on the 
same level of performance as local bus cards , given that eisa video 
cards have a 32 bit bus to move data around , instead of isa 's 8 bits. 

good question. 
answer the eisa bus does move 32 bits rather than isa 's 8 (16 ) 
but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus. 
i think that 's either 8 or 10 mhz .  . 
the local bus designs also move 32 bits like the eisa , but 
they move the data at the cpu speed , up to 40 mhz .  . 
so , on a 33mhz cpu , the local bus is moving 32bit data at 
33 mhz , and the eisa is moving 32bit data at 8 or 10 mhz .  . 
so the local bus should be 3 to 4 times faster than eisa on 
a 33 mhz cpu .  . eisa should be about two  ( maybe 3) times as 
fast as isa .  . 

since they are not , why would anyone  ( me included) pay a higher 
cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than 
and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board , such as a 
diamond speedstar 24x from pc magazine 's (i think) recent report , 
i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card , but it 's 
around 500 , which is just about double what my wallet will allow 
me to spend .  . and , for 500 , i could get a diamond viper and still 
have 100 left over  ( of course , i 'd have to get a local bus mother 
board too .  .  . ) . 

that 's a very good question. the eisa bus does have more advantages 
over the isa bus than just it 's width .  . for example more better 
interrupts and bus mastering .  . but these other factors do not impact 
a video card very much. they have more impact on file servers with 
multiple hard drives , full throttle network cards , cd roms , etc. 

can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration 

thanks ! christopher ,

re irish gaelic truetype font wanted synopsis 

i wrote 
can anyone tell me where i can find an ms windows truetype font 
that will give me the characters used in writing irish gaelic 
in the old style 

for example , in this font the letter t would look something 
like a c with a horizontal bar sitting on the top , and the 
letter g would look something like an s with a horizontal 
bar sitting on the top. 

many thanks to those who responded to my question. unfortunately i have 
had no luck in actually getting such a font , and a lot of people interested 
in one , and so i have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description. this font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
dineen 's dictionary and is typical of that found in irish books from the 
early part of the century. this may take me some time to do  ( in my 
limited spare time) but i 'll make it available to anyone who is interested , 
when it is ready. 

the responses i received are below 

kevin donnelly mentioned that michael 
had developed some clo fonts 
for the macintosh and may be able to advise me. i contacted michael 
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the macintosh , and 
that he will eventually port them to the pc , but that he will be charging 
ir 100  ( about 160) for each one. 

mentioned that he uses two font that have a 
 nice irish gaelic look to  . these are and american 
normal . i do n't know where you can get these but i do n't 
think that they have the effects i am looking for. 

finally ,  ( rhia ) mentioned that the font 
included in the greene fluent laser fonts 2 package 
is very much like what i was describing .  . i faxed greene for 
info but got no reply. 

so that 's it. i 'll post these newsgroups when i make my font available.

your file has to fit vga size  ( 480 860 , or whatever standard vga size 
is . ) . if you use a non vga screen (e . g .  . cga , ega , svga , there is also a 
way to do it , but i thing instead of vgalogo . lgo . you use another file , 

not entirely true .  .  . 

also .  .  .  . your .  . bmp . has to be 16 colours or less. 

true 

finally , remember to save your current win . com . before , and put your 
new win . com . in the windows directory. also , do n't start windows from a 

unecessary ...

make a file using anything that has to be less than 30k , as michael said , 
and less than 16 colors .  .  .  . import it to wingif as gif , pcx or bmp and 
save it in you windows system subdir as vgalogo . rle . (not  .  . exit win , 
and run setup in the windows subdir .  . your current config .  . run

thanks to all those people who recommended workspace managers for 
windows 3 . 1 .  . i found 3 shareware workspace managers , from australia 's

sites in the u.s. the three i found were 

1. workspaces 1.10 (wspace . zip) .

2. workshift 1.6 (wrksft16 . zip) . 
review deleted 
3. 2.30 and (backdesk . zip) . 
review deleted 

i really appreciate this information. however , given that i do n't have 
direct internet access which means i do n't have archie access i must 
resort to using ftpmail .  . this means that i need the site name and the 
directory where these workspace managers are located .  . 

backdesk . zip . is on cica , but i'm not sure of the whole directory. 

another to throw into the running is topdesk .  . it is alsow on cica , but 
i'm not sure where. it is more complicated then backdesk , but i 've found 
it to be more stable and more usefull .  . i recomend it to people who 
have already used a virtual desktop. oh yeh , it 's free.

found there were actually two surveys .  . one of randomly selected

jen 

if jd power and associates did the survey , i would like an 
anonymous ftp site to pick it up at. only a sucker believes 
an ms released survey results about an ms product. ok assume 
that the results of the survey , whatever they are , are 100 
honest. if the results indicated extreme dissatisfaction with 
the product , is ms going to tell us to stop buying ms dos 6.0 
because it sux ) sure .  .  .  .  . 

would it not be fair to say that the relatively few people who have decided 
to purchase 6 would be inclined to like it. just as those of us who love os 2 , 
most of the people who but them know  ( more or less) what to expect and are not 
disappointed. i mean , it is nice to know that the people who bought it are 
happy  ( and important for ms to know) and i do n't dispute the accuracy .  . i just 
would hate to see people extrapolate from that population that dos 6 is the 
next computer revolution .  . 

well , these statistics are to shut people up and add some 
microscopic weight to ms  arguments .  . as i just said , you have 
seen what do. who is going to believe chrysler if 
they tell us , in a  random  chrysler conducted survey .  .  .  . 
my theory about certain people is that they are convinced that 
if a point is maintained long enough , it is true. after all , 
what is the focus of this company information. money and 
information. technology is , for some , an expedient toward 
these ends. why did bill gates drop out of college 
was it because he could n't afford it at the time was it 
because  ( as the wsj says ) he could n't wait to use what he 
knew to go out and make money bill gate 's answer to this 
question would be highly interesting. i await it. 
i ca n't stomach bill declaring himself a visionary and 
using every available opportunity to build up the cult 
around himself and then having ms sell dos and windoze 
as their main stays .  .

i have a 486 sx 25 and i recently added a scsi drive to my system using an

quantum 400 meg scsi 991 . 2 . kb sec 12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track. 

first off all are these good results i do n't know what typical values 
are. 

what i'm wondering now is the following. my swap file is currently on the 
ide .  . i could move it to the scsi which is 13 faster , but then i would not 
be able to use 32 bit access which might make it slower .  . so on 
which drive should i put my swap file to get best results is there a swap 
file speed test program out there 

finally , i also ran the above tests with the driver loaded and i 
got no difference whatsoever in performance. is there any reason at all 
why i should load this driver

the 68040 version. in fact , nextstep 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both intel and 
motorola hardware. 

nextstep 3.1 for intel processors will be demonstrated on an epson progression 
486 computer. nextstep is scheduled for release on may 25 at expo 
in san francisco .  .

windows sees 16 megs , uses 3 or 4  ( more like 5 if you count the

agree that segmentation unnecessarily complicates things. it 's annoying , too. 
but when just a windows user , i do n't think about it much. and , i doubt many 
other people think about it  ( or even care ) when just writing a document ,

just a neutral comment 
it 's funny , i think , how arguments about windows vs os 2 sound so very

why is win 3.1 sometimes so 
i have a new dell 486dx2 66mhz 8 megs ram .  . 
windows was working just great. i had a bus mouse and mother board problem. 
dell replaced the mouse , gave me a newer mouse driver for windows 
and replaced the motherboard .  . just prior to this problem windows would 
only load up every other time. i would get the logo and either it would 
go on into windows or lock up. this was very consistent every other time. 

now with the new motherboard and all , it still does the same thing. 
the computer is less than one month old. at first it worked fine ! 
i can get into windows each time now with the win s command. 
this forces standard mode. things seem to run slower .  . i mainly 
use windows apps , but in standard mode there is no virtual mem .  .  .  .  .  . 
plus it is slower .  . 

i re loaded windows , it still does the same thing. should i first delete 
everything in all windows dir 's i did not because i have so much 
added in sub dir 's etc. 

really puzzling why enhanced mode would not load each time but consistently 
every other time. standard mode each time .  .  .  .  .  .  .

however , no desire whatsoever to use a version of os 2 which wont really 
do what it says (i . e .  . run windows apps) os 2 2.0 2.1 will not run windows 
apps in 386 mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but 
os 2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to. i have heard 
that os 2 2.2 beta is available via ftp , and i was wondering if anyone knew

ftp 

cosy pak is available by anonymous  from 
cwru . edu .  ( internet no. 129 . 22 . 40 . 23) .  . a sample ftp session 
is given at the end of this file. 



changes in version 0.9  ( update from v0 . 81 . to v0 . 9) . 

in this version , we have revised cosy pak to take advantage of 
the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v2 . 1 .  . 
since mathematica 2.1 provides a better and working 
and functions than 
mathematica v2 . 0 . did , we adopted them. this has made cosy pak 
smaller. thus brian evans  signal processing packages that supported 
the and functions in the 
cosy pak v0 . 81 . are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v0 . 9 .  . for 
power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very 
fine brian evans package on signal processing  ( available at 
the anonymous ftp site gauss . gatech . edu . or ip 130 . 207 . 226 . 24) .  . on 
the downside , the disadvantage of this update 
can be that mathematica 2.1 requires more runtime resources than its 
previous version. 



for mathematica 2.0 users 

we have included the package from mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory 2 . 0' .  . please move all files and directory under for 2.0 into 
the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. 



introduction 

this is an unsupported release of cosy pak a control systems 
analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using 
mathematica 2 . 1 .  . classical control systems analysis and design methods and some 
modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package. 

this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a 
next (tm) computer (a unix based workstation) .  . they have been 
used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control 
engineering texts  ( ogata 1991 , phillips and harbor 1991 ) for 
undergraduate courses in engineering i' taught at the systems 
engineering department of cwru .  . in addition to the next , they have 
also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers (tm) , and , 
ibm pc 's (tm) running ms  . we would be very much interested 
to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on 
platforms not mentioned above. ibm users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics. 

once installed  ( see below for instructions ) , this collection of 
mathematica packages can be loaded by any user. bundled with the 
packages are many notebooks ( cosy notes ) which demonstrate 
the functionality of these packages. the notebooks follow a plan of 
many fine , standard , undergraduate control engineering text books 
listed in the references. examples used in these notebooks have 
been collected from the various references given at the end of this 
file. the contents of the notebooks in the cosy notes directory are

the notebook example ma . files) will be under the 
cosy notes directory. to use the notebooks , move the directory  to 
a 
directory that mathematica can recognize 

mathematica packages on a unix machine , 
my harddisk mathematica packages on an apple macintosh , 
c packages on an ibm pc. 

at the beginning of the initialization cell of each notebook 
in cosy notes directory , we list the example about how to make 
mathematica identify the directory 

( initialization of path ) 

( example for a unix machine  ( default ) ) 
( 
path join path , 
mathematica packages 
) 

( example for an apple macintosh ) 
( 
path join path , 
my harddisk mathematica packages 
) 

( example for ibm pc 
) 
( 
path join path , 
c packages 
) 

change the pathname according to your machine by removing the 
mathematica comment sign  ( ` ' and ` ) ' before and after ` path  
setting. 

this command makes mathematica recognize the directory 

mathematica packages on a unix machine 
my harddisk mathematica packages on a apple macintosh 
c packages on an ibm pc 


mathematica 2.0 users 

we include the package from mathematica 2.1 in 
the directory for 2 . 0 .  . please move all files and directory under for 2.0 
into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory. 


getting started 

after installation , start mathematica and open the notebooks in 
the cosy notes directory. all notebooks load their own packages. 
navigate in the notebooks and enjoy. ibm users however will have to 
evaluate the notebooks to visualize the graphics.

gorgeous .  . 
users may see the limit of possible different characters in 
a ps font as they may have better use of the unicode 
features of tt fonts  ( in windows  . 

i 've seen lots of really beautiful and in small size ps fonts 
i have n't seen those as tt fonts .  . most of them are rendering quite

has anyone else observed this behaviour and if so , what have you 
done to cure it 

one workstation in a wfw network goes deaf to any form of communication from 
other workstations until it goes out on the network itself. from then on other 
can interact with it until some time later when it goes deaf 
again. 

the workstation is set up to share its discs etc. the machine 
is a 33 , 8mb ram , with diamond stealth video. it behaves this 
way with a variety of 16 bit network adapters , including a smc elite .  . 
it also behaves the same way if i use the windows vga driver , rather 
than the diamond drivers.

due to the resolution and size it is in 14 parts. 

this is a uuencoded bitmap .  . 960x600 256 colors. 
the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background. 
the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a 1024x768 display 
because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons 
to fit in without being on top of the picture. reguarding image 
quality and resolution i have not seen much better. 

please do not do this ! 

i do n't know how the rest of you read news , but here 's how i do it i 
subscribe to an system which allows me to dial up via modem and 
download e mail and news articles automatically .  . when someone posts a 
huge attached binary file , i have no choice but to receive it along with 
all the other new articles in the groups i subscribe to. i also pay for 
the connect time , which is normally not a problem because i have a 14 . 4k . 
modem and each day 's upload download session takes only 5 minutes or so. 
today 's session , however , lasted about 25 minutes because of roman . bmp .  . 
consequently , it cost me about 3.00 extra just to receive a file that i 
did n't want in the first place. 

if you have cool bitmaps that you want to make available , there are other 
ways to do it either upload the file to an ftp site  ( like 
ftp . cica . indiana . edu . , which has a complete windows section) and tell 
people how to get to it , or use one of the newsgroups like 
alt . binaries . pictures .  ( or something like that) , which are file archives 
rather than discussion groups. do n't use discussion groups like this one 
to send out attached files , especially when they 're 600k in size.

in article ee  ( steve warner ) writes 

hi 
i am thinking of upgrading to the beta version of windows nt on a 486sx 
hard disc .  . can someone please give me there on such a setup for 
running nt and is the operating system likely to be better than windows or 
unix 's .  . 


steve 
ee 

i 've been using windows nt (tm) since the october release , and i have to 
say that the march release is really a big improvement. windows nt (tm) 
is becomming usable .  . 

there are a few things to consider before you make the leap though. 
first  ( for me at least) is that you cannot get a full speed dos box. 
what i mean is , i cannot  ( for instance) run falcon 3.0 or any other 
resourse intensive program in a dos box. it crawls .  . 
and my machine is a 486 33 with a hd and 16mb ram .  . if anyone 
knows how to get a fast dos box  ( or full screen for that matter) , 
please let me know. 

the second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff. 
for instance , my pas 16 has been demoted to running as a sound blaster 
(which is supported nice) , because has n't 
produced drivers yet. 

your disk should be large enough to keep an 80mb dos partition , and 
give the rest over to windows nt (tm) .  . the only thing is , whenever 
you wanted to run windows programs , you 'd have to reboot and log into 
windows nt (tm) , instead of just typing win. 

windows nt (tm) does seem to be much more stable than normal windows 
though. it 'd be a good choice if you have the resources. you should 
really have at least 8mb ram though. one last thing , modems work 
well enough , but i have yet to get my fax card to work , and i 've never 
heard of anyone else who did either. 

it 's only better than unix because it runs killer software out of the 
box , whereas with unix there is n't the same  . 

i guess it comes down to windows nt (tm) is not yet for the faint 
of heart , it 's still a beta. but it 's a very good beta.

i 'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare .  . 
windows itself almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by 
an errant application  ( my personal favorite any one of the corel 
3.0 programs) .  . on the other hand , i have had os 2 crash randomly 
a number of times , mostly just running it 's own applications. 

i do know that ibm systems , the ps 2 , in particular , have 
absolutely no problem with os 2 never had a random crash while 
running any of my programs under os 2. in fact , i do n't remember 
ever crashing .  . 

of course , i really do n't run any os 2 programs , just the same bunch 
of dos and windows stuff that i 've always been running. 

and when i had the  ( this is the system) running 
dos windows , i had only one crash , and it was consistent .  . ftp had a 
tendency to crash whenever i would get large files ( 1mb ) from 
particularly fast clients  ( dtr 's 150k 200k sec ) , i figured out the 
problem was with smartdrv 's write buffering if i turned off the write 
buffer , everything would work fine. 

ftp under os 2 has never locked , though. i can even format floppies 
 ( to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os 2 . ) . 

for instance , i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed 
wp 5.1  ( dos ) locks up my system. 

yeah , i guess i'm willing to admit that os 2 is somewhat sensitive to 
specific hardware. for dos works perfectly fine on my  .  .  . 

please explain. the only time i wait on anything under windows is 
when i'm copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing  ( and even 
then , not long i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the per 
minute , and can still go do things slowly while it 's doing 
this i 've downloaded with pp while  . 

well , i save all my personal files to floppy , and when i did that 
under windows , a floppy save of a large file hung up the system. 

i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the 
tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal 
computation in the background. 

and not being able to address your memory better than dos , 

not sure what you mean here. 

the idea is that os 2 's dos sessions can see more memory than windows 
dos sessions .  . i let xpl (a shareware calculus program) see around 
of free conventional memory , which lets me do bigger symbolic 
manipulations than is possible under straight dos (where it would see 
around of conventional ram . ) .  . i also found it really handy for 
my own dos based programs , which , without any re writing , could now 
handle larger data sets , simulate for more iterations , etc. of course , 
the point is now moot , since the os 2 programs i now write simply 
never run into memory limitations .  . i never programmed for windows , 
so i do n't have much of a comparison here , though .  .  .  .  .

hi everybody out there , 
i just got the third beta release disk  ( march 93) of 
and still am not able to boot up that system. the final step 
achieved is the display of io error  . but , since this is 
the beta release of the sdk for nt and not of nt , microsoft does 
not include a manual on the os itself , explaining what this 
error means of what i can do to get rid of. my configuration 
is 
mainboard 4860 25 , rev. a7 (a 486 with socket for i860 ) 
of memory  ( 512k 36 , 1m 36 , 2m 36) 
ami eisa scsi controller  ( 15series ) , latest bios , 16mb cache 
hard disk 
syquest 555 removable disk 
toshiba cd rom drive 
spectrum plus 16 
ethernet card  ( ne2000 comp . ) . 
et4000 graphics card , 1meg  ( colorimage5 ) 
the system is running fine under dos and windows 3.1 etc , but 
trying to do the setup for nt , 
automatic setup does not recognize controller  ( aha1542 compat . ) . 
when adding manually , nt complains not any cd rom drive 
the manual setup  ( winnt ) does not copy everything from cd to hd , 
does not recognize controller , but takes it manually .  . 
setup continues until it tries to boot. then it starts loading 
several stuff from disk  ( seems to fing the hd ) , but messing up 
with that damned io error 69 .  . 
i took away all io cards not essential , but that did not make any 
effect. 
anybody got any ideas help would be greatly appreciated.

the microsoft windows device driver kit  ( ddk ) documentation  ( blurb ) 
states that the user must separately acquire the microsoft windows 
software development kit  ( sdk ) , which contains the windows tools 
to build the drivers. if we are using borland c with application 
frameworks , is this necessary we also have a copy of the microsoft 
press programmer 's reference library  ( books ) which normally comes 
with the sdk , and microsoft macro assembler 6 . 0 .  . why is the sdk 
neccessary for development of virtual device drivers

this may work , but wo n't it involve invoking the applications , e.g. if you 
drag a  . bmp . or  . txt . file to the min. print manager icon , wo n't it run 
notepad and paintbrush before printing if you just want to drag a file

but the impressive performance of the graphite was 
not its winmark , it was its result (esp .  . the paint 
performance) .  . judging from the tests , i can hardly 
imagine that there is a cheat driver for it. 

i received my graphite vl on thursday , and i 've had a little bit of 
experience with it now. in general , it feels fast , although this 
is the first vlb card that i have tried. still , the results are 
impressive. 

with my 486dx2 66 w 16 mb , running at 1024x768 256 , i 've had the following 
1.0 results 


card wp cad spread paint overall 

ati graphics ultra 13.5 14.5 19 . 1 . 25.0 18.0 
ati ultra (no aperture ) 11.2 13 . 8 . 10.7 20.9 14.1 
hercules graphite vl 16.1 67 . 8 . 41.4 52.8 44 . 5 . 

unfortunately i do n't have the numbers here , but the ati ultra pro vlb 
had an overall score of about 26. the ultra pro was nearly as 
fast in text handling , but was blown away in the cad and paint tests. 

as an additional test , we hand timed a complex coreldraw ! slide resize 
redraw times. there was no swapping , but i 'd expect there is a fairly 
heavy load on the cpu .  . the graphite redraw times averaged about 10.2 
seconds , with ati ultra pro at 12 . 0 .  . this with steve gibson 's 
contention that the isa graphite is faster than an ati up on his complex 
draw document .  . 

so far , i'm very impressed. the drivers look solid , and the card flies .  . 
the installation and utilities are different , but comparable to ati 's .  . and 
i did n't have to wait for build 59 for some reliability .  .  .  . with hercules  
software developer special , you can get an evaluation copy of the card for 
just 225  ( or 200 for the isa version) .  . call 800 532 0600 if you want to 
give it a try i'm a happy customer now !

organization texas instruments inc 
lines 65 

in  ( daniel mittleman ) writes 

this may be an faq  ( if so , please direct me to the known answer) but i 
am getting frustrated and looking for help. 

i am running win 3.1 with ndw 2.2 on a 486sx with 8 meg of memory and a 
6 meg perm swap file and am getting exceedingly frustrated that my 
applications are not giving back system resources when i close them. 

i am aware this is a known problem what i am looking for are some 
suggestions of what i might do to mitigate it. 

1. what software is the culprit win 3.1 , ndw , my applications are 
some modes of win 3.1  ( standard , real , enhanced ) better than others at 
plugging this leak 

it 's the applications that do this. unfortunately , even the applets 
that ship with win31 seem to have this problem (i 've seen it in 
solitaire , for example) .  . 

2. are their system.ini switches i can set to help plug this leak 

none that i know of. if an application does n't give back the 
resources , they are lost and gone forever , pending a restart of 
windows. 

3. do people know of patches or third party software that help with 
this seems like increasing or better managing system resources is a 
great market for a third party memory company like qemm .  . 

if the applications do n't free up the memory  ( and a lot of them 
do n't) , there 's bugger all that any other piece of software can do 
about it. 

4. if i run progman instead of ndw will the leak (i was 
hoping that ndw 2.2 would have plugged this , but it seems no different 
than 2.0 in how it deals with memory and resources . ) . 

no. this is a problem with the applications , usually .  . 

5. when i am writing vb code are there things i can do to make it less 
likely my code will eat resources 

there are books written on this one. in general , just be sure to free 
up everything that you ask for before you exit .  . unfortunately , i 
understand that vb will internally lose resources for you , so 
there 's no way to avoid this entirely .  . 

6. any other suggestions that i do n't know enough to ask for 
specifically 

thanks for your help. as this is a common problem and i have seen only 
a little discussion of it on the net there are probably others who 
would like to read answers so please publish here rather than sending 
me email. 

there 's little discussion because it 's  inevitable  until ms manages 
to come up with an os that will do garbage collection or something on 
the resource pool.

hello , you wrote 

firstly , does windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode do anything special 
with that have been compiled using the large memory model 

no. 

we are being told that even in 386 enhanced mode windows 
will load into real memory below 640k and page lock it. 

no. 

my second question relates to static data inside  . is there 
any way at all to get multiple instances of the static data 
segment  ( dgroup ) 

no , but .  .  .  . 

you can allocate real static data within code segments ! 
when you need more dynamic memory you can allocate data on the global heap .  . 

you can forget most of what was written about memory management. under 3.1 
you have paged virtual memory. you can lock every block without 
the memory manager. you can use far pointer everytime without always lock 
unlocking the memory block. 

an besides dll 's are mostly just disguised exe 's , that happen to be called 
by another task.

munch 


you must of read too many os 2 advertisements .  . crash protection is such 
a marketing , it is n't funny .  .  . out of 4 months of using windows on my 
new machine i 've only had it crash once , and i do n't have a run of the mill 
configuration .  . 


munch following is reformatted 


it does sound funny , i will admit .  . but for me it is true. windows 
crashed on 
all of the time  ( and from what i have read in pc mag , this is not 
the exception ) 


i 'd say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare .  . 
windows itself almost never crashes , but it can be crashed by 
an errant application  ( my personal favorite any one of the corel 
3.0 programs) .  . on the other hand , i have had os 2 crash randomly 
a number of times , mostly just running it 's own applications. 

for instance .  . today i discovered a new one. while i was downloading 
with plus for windows  ( running seamless with the standard 
vga drivers on a run o' da mill vga card 640x480 ) , i decided that 
i wanted to edit a copy of a quote that i wanted to add to my 
 . finger .  . but since i 've learned not to really trust seamless , 
i fired up a full screen 23 . 1 . session. whoops , the download 
finished while 2 was loading .  . it had just gotten 
the pointer up , so i hit alt escape to get back t the desktop 
(i have a lot of fonts , so loading takes a good long while) .  . 

 . screen trashed , hangs up. hm .  . well , i can sorta 
see the mouse , so i clicked on the minimized 2 session 
and got back my fullscreen windows session  ( but the color were 
off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and  . 
so i closed this , and got back to the desktop  ( now fully  . 

pp was still sitting , window open , but it was no longer 
connected to the com port so i exited it (the normal way 
it told me i was still online and it would hang up , though it 
was already hung up) .  . hm .  . well , load no , bad idea. 
shutdown and reboot .  . 

ok , refresh first .  .  . now , shutdown .  . yes , everything is closed .  .  .  . 

hm .  . nothing seems to be happening. let 's see .  .  . ah , the 
windows list still comes up. ok , let 's try shutdown again. 

no go. huh. 

alright , wait 60 seconds to see if it 's just running slow. 

hmm .  . still seems to be running os 2. try shutdown again. 
nothing. oh well. reboot .  . enjoy the time. 

in this case , a part of the os crashed not only itself , but 
os 2 entirely (which is n't even smart enough to tell when it s 
been compromised , i guess) .  . in everyday  ( specifically today ) 
use. 


os 2 gives each windows app a and they ca n't touch each other or 
 ( generally ) anything they are n't supposed to have. 


that 's the idea , anyway. in truth , when a program crashes on 
os 2 , it will bring the system down with it. the programs that 
would just gpf under windows do the same under os 2 , but programs 
that are fine under dos and windows bring os 2 screaming to a halt , 
task protection or no. 

for instance , i'm still wondering why print preview in a windowed 
wp 5.1  ( dos ) locks up my system. it works fine under dos or even in 
a dos box under windows 3 . 1 .  .  ( admittedly , it does n't crash if i run 
full screen , but the first time this bug big me , it bit  . 



if windows works for you , 
then great. maybe this is why some people do n't see why os 2 is the os of 
choice. if windows does n't crash on you , and you do n't mind waiting on each 
task , 


please explain. the only time i wait on anything under windows is 
when i'm copying or formatting a floppy , or when printing  ( and even 
then , not long i get 9 to 11 pages dumped to the per 
minute , and can still go do things slowly while it 's doing 
this i 've downloaded with pp while  . 



and not being able to adress your memory better than dos , 


not sure what you mean here. os 2 sees 16 megs , uses 5 or six 
of these for it 's own use  ( more if you want to count 2) .  . 
windows sees 16 megs , uses 3 or 4  ( more like 5 if you count the 
disk cache as i am for os 2) for itself. if memory efficiency 
were a big issue , pc geos would be the current king of the 
intel desktop. 


some of the 
key reasons for using os 2 are gone. i probably would still use it , but it 
would be more of an even fight. 


on the other hand .  .  . i am finally able to say with some confidence 
that both os 2 and windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to 
them. for instance , the machine i am sitting at runs both fine , 
while the machine next to me constantly locks up under windows. 
 ( but ran os 2 without a hitch once i got it through a 5 crash 
 . on the whole , i 'd say os 2 is a whole lot more sensitive 
than windows , but there are (i suppose) machines that windows 
just does n't like. 


of th week i think that it 's wrong to believe in an ism , you should 
believe in yourself

in (scott bass ) writes 

1. for windows nt , is there an alternative to the , fairly useless 
dos batch programming language for os 2 , ibm introduced the language 
as an alternative to  . bat .  . surely windows nt should do the same thing , 
right 

2. in lieu of the above , is there any way to escape the cr lf in a 
 . bat . file and continue a single command across multiple lines i have an 
application which exits to the system and a batch file. the batch 
file is created on the fly from site specific code stored within the 
application. as currently designed , the line length for the stored code 
and the output file ( . bat . file) is 80 characters , which is not enough for 
all the options that must be specified on a particular command. it would 
help tremendously if i did n't have to redesign my code to kludge around the 
lack of a true batch shell programming language. 

rest deleted 

as a followup to my post let me add that 

i'm not really a windows or windows nt user , so please excuse my ignorance .  . 
however , i'm a developer at sas institute , and one component of the 
application that i support is the ability to submit a  ( sas ) batch job from 
within an interactive sas session. the user site can enter their 
site specific batch profile into a dataset within our product , specifying 
the pathname to the sas executable , specifying site specific sas options , 
etc. at run time certain variables are resolved , and the resolved file is 
written to an external ascii file. then i exit to the operating system and 
run the job asynchronously , returning to the interactive session as soon as 
the job is submitted .  . the batch job then runs concurrently with the 
interactive session. 

as currently designed , the internal dataset has a record length of 80 
characters. but , to run the batch job , the command to sas in 
batch mode requires more than 80 characters. up til nt this has not been a 
problem , since every job control shell language up til nt (eg .  . 
mvs cms vms unix os2 ) had a way to escape the cr lf and enter a single 
command across multiple lines  ( os 2 via their language , which is 
standard with os 2) .  . 

the gist of all this is , since this application is for end users , not 
within my company , i have to try to develop this process using native nt .  . 
since my first posting i 've learned that there are several third party 
companies that provide alternative script languages for windows windows nt .  . 
and i'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative 
script language if they had it , but i ca n't develop under the assumption 
that they have anything other than what comes with nt .  . 

i saw another post on this list (the subject was something like is vi 
available for windows ) in which someone said that vi , make , awk , and 
ksh was available with microsoft toolkit .  . what is that product is 
it a separate product or part of windows ksh would do what i need if i 
could count on it at all nt sites. 

one last question i 've heard that nt has remote processing capabilities , 
i.e. i could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run 
there. if these are native nt commands rather than network specific 
commands , this would also help me improve this process. if you can comment 
on these commands , i would appreciate it. 

thanks again for the help ,

i really think you are comparing apples and oranges .  . nobody disputes 
that os 2 has more big os features. the question is does an 
individual need the power. the sales of windows vs os 2 answer that 
question. the next question is even if i did want to run os 2 
and i had this big monster machine to run it on , is there a diverse 
set of applications to run on it that allow me to do my 
work. go to your local computer store to answer this one. 
i think the comparison you need to be doing is nt vs os2 2 . 1 .  . this 
is where the new battle lines will be drawn .  . windows 3.1 has won 
the single user pc war the next one will be the client server 
war and the entries are nt , os2 2.1 , unix and netware 4 . 0 .  . 
granted these os 's will be eventually scaled down to be 
attractive to the single user pc and that will probably be phase ii  
of the war. who wins only the marketplace will tell but it sure 
is fun watching and arguing about it tho.

less than 1 2 of mailorder price ! 

i have three libraries , all on cd , which cost me over two thousand dollars 
mail order. they are all genuine , high quality eps vector graphics (not just 
some scans with a silly eps wrapper ! ) they are 

1. totem graphics color eps library  ( about 1400 color eps  . 
this costs a thousand bucks mailorder .  . i rate this clip art as 
high quality  ( much better than dynamic graphics clip art , clip art , 
etc. , in my opinion) , but i rate both the 3g library and the c . a . r .  . 
library as higher. totem 's art is all color whereas most of the other 's 
are b w. it 's the best all color library out there , in my opinion. 

2. c . a . r .  . graphics library  ( have n't counted how many images , but you can 
purchase the library on 48 floppies , to give you an idea of the size) .  . 
this costs about 4 hundred bucks mailorder .  . i rate this clip art as 
very high quality , but it 's only b w. 

3. 3g graphics library  ( very popular in all the mac  . this costs 
about 4 hundred bucks mailorder .  . i rate this clip art as very high quality 
 ( got some awards in one of the major mac mags , forgot which) .  . some of 
the images are color , but most are b w. 

for what it 's worth , all three of the cd 's are saved in multiple file formats .  . 
they are readable on mac 's and pc 's .  . additionally , totem 's will mount native 
next also , although the next could just as easily mount either the mac or pc 
filesystems .  . i 've personally tested the cd 's on all three machines (i 've owned 
all three machines , although i sold my next a few months ago) .  . 

also , in my opinion , the 3g and c . a . r .  . libraries are the best in the business 
 ( and i 've seen  . also , totem 's is , in my opinion , the best all color 
library around , although i like 3g 's color art better. 

i want 850 for everything. can ship certified check c.o.d. , as well as 
visa mc charge. if you pay by visa mc , i 'll ship pre paid in the continental u.s.

do what it says (i . e .  . run windows apps) os 2 2.0 2.1 will not run windows 
apps in 386 mode , something that most larger windows apps require , but 
os 2 2.2 , which is supposed to be in beta test , is supposed to. i have heard 
that os 2 2.2 beta is available via ftp , and i was wondering if anyone knew 
where to obtain a copy. i would appreciate any information , as i would like , 
once and for all , to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

if you wait until may the 18th you will be able to buy the new os 2 
2.1 since it will be released at comdex that day. it will run windows 
3.1 apps and windows  . mode. if you ca n't wait , then you can ftp a 
6 months old beta version from ftp os2 . nmsu . edu . , but this version is 
probably a lot slower than the final product. 

when you do your test , please have in mind that a single tasking 
system will always be faster at doing one task. the real power of os2 
lies in the multitasking and ca n't really be measured by a stopwatch .  . 

happy benchmarking .  .

this character shows up with the windows charmap display as the

the may issue of pc computing page 246 has a windows hint and tips for 
just this thing. you have to edit the win.ini file and add a couple 
of lines. i tried it and it works. i actually made my title bar 
and iconized text , and icon text smaller. on my monitor it works well. 
you can select a larger font also. you edit the win.ini file with 
a font name in your system directory. read the article because i would 
not want to it here in case i type and caused your

subject print to file how do i print the file later 
organization mathematics department , memorial university of newfoundland

here 's the situation 

at home , i have ms word for windows but no printer .  . at work , i 
have windows a postscript printer , but not ms word. so , i 
configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer , and use 
the print to file option , which produces a nice postscript file , 
which i then bring to work. 

my question how do i print this postscript file through the print 
manager at work if , for example , i select print from the file 
manager , it treats the postscript as a text file , and gives me 
several pages of postscript gibberish .  . 

i know that i can open a dos window and do 

copy file . ps . com1 

which does work , but seems not to multitask very well other applications 
run rather slowly and often pause for 10 's of seconds. 

there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print 
manager , but if there is , i ca n't find any mention of it in the 
documentation .  . 

anyone know how to do this

even so , my point still stands to an extent ... that 64k limits appear all

while the 64k limit may not be necessary limitation , they probably fall 
within the category of  reasonable  limitations .  . if you find yourself 
trying to allocate an edit control for more than 64k of text , it 's probably 
time take a good look at your program 's design. 

why is there such a small limit to the number of global memory

in what way is 8192 a  small  number it seems to me that you 'd hit the

organization aspen technology group 
x mailer 2.1 modified 
lines 66 


in article , the author writes 
i am setting up my dos unix box on a ide and a scsi drive 
and was wondering about the use of the  ( ms dos 5 . 0) . join command. i 
like the way it sets things up since i wo n't have to stick with the c 
d e  ( crap ) that dos enforces .  . i like how it would mimic mount 
points of unix filesystems .  . i have heard that there were problems 
with using it , or at least under older versions of dos .  . please tell ! 

i have been using the join command for many years now , mostly with good 
success in duplicating unix style file mounts .  . you will hear lots of 
people cursing join because they confuse it with the dos append command 
(a truely hack ) , but do n't believe them. you also will hear 
people saying that microsoft recommends that you not use join. but , in 
microsoft 's windows 4 workgroups resource toolkit , the following appears 

join , an ms dos utility , works fine with windows for workgroups 3.1 if 
you do not change the state of the joined drives during a windows for 
workgroups 3.1 session. this includes adding or removing joined drives 
from within windows for workgroups .  . we recommend that you do not use 
join when running windows setup or windows for workgroups 3 . 1 .  . 

within this caveat , join appears to be valid under windows. however , i 
have found a couple of applications that do n't deal well with filesystems 
that have been mounted using join. 

in particular , the worst offender is word for windows 2 . 0x .  . it gets very 
confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive. it 
wants to create the saved file as nnnnn . tmp . in the current dir , then 
delete the old file and rename the nnnnn . tmp . file to the  . doc . file. 

unfortunately , wfw usually writes the nnnnn . tmp . file in some idiotic 
place other than the current directory  ( often in the root dir of the 
joined filesystem , but not  . then , after deleting the original 
 . doc . file , it ca n't find the nnnnn . tmp . file to rename it. unless you 
search your disk systems , the document is gone. 

i have also found subtle problems using the mks toolkit from a dos box 
when joined filesystems are present. i used to join c temp with a 
ramdisk , but mks sometimes gets confused when doing an ls on the c temp 
dir , and misses some files in the temp dir.  ( this is difficult to 
reproduce , but it goes away totally when join is not used . ) . i think 
this is a windows problem , rather than mks 's , since it works ok under raw 
dos .  . 

so , i would suggest that you can use join , but be aware that it may not 
be as robust you would like. 

would n't it be real great to mount network drives (i . e .  . z ) under the main 
file tree , rather than having all those darned drive letters unfortunately , 
join wo n't let you do it. there was talk on the net about a simple patch 
to let join work on network drives , but i do n't remember the source. 

it 's too bad the join command is not better implemented , since it would 
avoid using all those stupid drive letters. i realize that was 
meant for casual , even ignorant users , so mounting all the drives in 
one file tree might be confusing. but , it looks like ms is going to carry 
this over into windows nt  ( another os meant for casual , even 
users not ! ) .  . with all it 's old family system baggage , maybe ms needs 
a recovery group so they can get on with life ( .  .

subject summary canon vs. hp deskjet 500 
organization computer science department , stanford university .  . 
lines 401 


hello again , 

about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings 
on the inkjet family of printers .  . specifically , a comparison between the 
canon  ( bubblejet ) and the hewlett packard deskjet 500. many people 
asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail i 
received. below is my original query and the responses i received. i have 
not deleted any part of the responses , only the headers and signatures , so 
you can extract what you find necessary. some people asked me for an 
unbiased account however , the very nature of the question suggests 
favoritism and biased comments , you must extract the information you 
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer .  . there are a 
wide range of comments , each has its own value. 

there was no clear winner , some like the  ( especially its 
price performance ratio ) , others preferred the durability and reliability 
of the deskjet (the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid 
background) .  . two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention , a new 
printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year  ( around 
summertime ) , and an addition to the epson product line  ( their first 
 . you will find that after the initial purchase , the costs of 
re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same  ( this largely 
depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop 
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your 
printer) .  . no one mentioned approx. how many sheets each ink cartridge will 
print , but i suspect they are roughly equal at about 1000 1500 sheets 
 ( laser printers will do 4000 5000 sheets per toner  . well , 
that 's a brief research summary of my personal research. enjoy ! 



hello fellow 'netters .  . 

i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i 
should purchase , the canon  ( bubblejet ) vs. the hp deskjet 500. i 
thought , rather than trust the salesperson , i would benefit more from 
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest 
potential. and , i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls 
better than any salesperson .  . 

now , i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 
dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett packard deskjet 500  ( 300 dpi) .  . 
which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference , 
particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better  ( 75 
pages or more) any personal experience on either will be appreciated 
here which works better under windows 3.1  ( any driver problems , etc) 
cost of memory , font packages , toner cartridges , etc basically , your 
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable , 
both good and bad. 


well i bought the bj 200 about a month ago at the start of their 50 rebate 
program on that printer (it ends 5 31) , and i bought it from computer 
discount warehouse because their price of 325 could n't be beat anywhere i 
looked , and i think it 's a hot printer .  . just using regular copier paper 
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode. i compared the 
output of a designer legal size drawing with 4pt type done on my 
bj 200 with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet and i was amazed 
how well i could read the small print on the bj 200. printing speed was 
several seconds faster on the bj 200 which is amazing considering that the 
hp has 2 . 5m . ram installed. i measured the time from when the printer first 
indicated it was receiving data  ( as i used print manager in windows) .  . 

i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one 
immediately for his office , and two other engineers placed their orders 
too. if you need 's phone number , it 's 800 598  . delivery to ny 
was two days. 

good luck !

i own a deskjet 500. performance is n't spectacular under windows using 
truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen. quality for 
the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on  standard  photo copy 
paper the characters have slightly  frayed  edges but on better quality 
 distinction  type paper things look better. for most applications i find 
copy paper fine still better than dot matrix .  . comes with a windows 
driver , which seems to by pass print manager , has a few 
 fonts which are hp fonts probably faster than truetype 
but have n't really tried them out. can get ram font cartridges but unless 
the speed of truetype is a problem i would n't bother .  . the ram cartridges 
ca n't be used as buffer soft fonts only. 

for graphics , i.e. bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via 
the hp supplied win driver. there a number of dither options such as 
 scatter  ,  pattern  etc. the manual gives recommendations depending on 
the type of image being printed .  . text is not so good in this mode. problem 
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text. the 
range of tones for graphic images is n't brilliant but i think that is more 
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general. 

from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects .  . 

however , a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from 
epson .  . this printer is faster , cheaper , and capable of producing 
laser like quality on normal copier paper. ca n't remember the model , lx 
something i think 

i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here . the 
introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand .  . 



about a month ago , i got a canon  . i absolutely love it. it is 
incredibly fast , except for printing from pspice (i do n't know if you ever 
do stuff with that or not . ) . most of the stuff i print is either from 
microsoft word for windows or just plain text. the only problems i 've had 
are printing headers footers (the printer out) , and printing on 
cheap paper  ( lots of  . normal copy paper works great with it , you 
can only tell it 's not laser printed by holding it , oh , less than twelve 
inches from your face.  ( that is , if you 're , like me ! ) ) the 
printer comes with its own driver for windows 3.1 ! ! i have no other 
complaints .  . the printer also can act just like some epson or another for 
those archaic software packages that have n't written a driver for it yet. 
the footprint is a real plus , too and , if you purchase it 
between now and may 31 , you get a 50 rebate from canon ! ! i bought mine 
from a store called compusa , and the price now is 340 .  . i have a friend 
who has the hp you are looking at. it also prints very well , and everyone 
has drivers for it , but it is very slow ! 

hope i helped ! 

 ( 360dpi sure looks great ! )

50 rebate program on that printer (it ends 5 31) , and i bought it from 
computer discount warehouse because their price of 325 could n't be 
beat anywhere i looked , and i think it 's a hot printer .  . just using 
regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality 
mode. i compared the output of a designer legal size drawing 
with 4pt type done on my bj 200 with the same drawing printed on 
an hp laserjet and i was amazed how well i could read the small print 
on the bj 200. printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj 200 
which is amazing considering that the hp has 2 . 5m . ram installed. 
i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving 
data  ( as i used print manager in windows) .  . 


i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj 300 at work and a 
deskjet 500 at home. i prefer the deskjet .  . the printing speed and quality 
are similar (i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet 
for home) .  . the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support 
in so many applications. the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm 
to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be 
the case for a long time. the design is superior if you just want to use 
cut paper , the deskjet is quieter , and the ink cartridges are quite a bit 
cheaper due to the number of out there in comparision to the  . 

just my 0.02 worth .  .  .

yes , there is the landscape mode printing problem , but it does not 
present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the 
translation. i actually thought of some other points after i posted the 
note. the deskjet has an area of approximately  . around 
the paper the bubblejet does not. you are right about the graphics 
resolutions , i tested the printers with the applications i had access to 
wordperfect , harvard graphics , wingif , paintshop pro , and paintbrush and 
could not tell a difference. in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers 
gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer 
hence controlling the amount of ink you put down. the bubblejet did not. 
i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no 
comparision there. finally , i wanted sheet feeding .  . in that configuration 
the bubblejet cost approximately 100 more than the deskjet .  . 

i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i 
spent my own money. btw , i am replacing the bj 300 with a deskjet 500 at 
work this month anyway.

i spent some time comparing the two. we ended up getting the bubblejet 
bj 200 versus the hp. our reasons were 

1) the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon 
2) versus 300 we felt we could see the difference 
3) price canon has a 50 rebate program going on at the moment. 

the bj 200 was our choice over the bj we could have 100 pages in the 
bj 200 feeder .  . the bj holds only 30 pages , i think. 

as you can see , up to 100 pages on the bj 200. we have n't done anything 
big with the bj , but its performance seems reasonable under windows. i 
know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the 
printer , but i do n't know how it compares  ( also the driver included with 
the printer is canon 's whereas i do n't know where the microsoft bbs one 
comes from microsoft ) 

hope this helps.

i'm sometimes also a salesperson  ( if i'm not to study )) 
i would recommend to buy the  . the printing quality is a bit better , 
but you you 've got much more  . do n't forget the hp engine is at 
least 2 years on the marked , the canon engine  ( witch is also used in 
other new bubblejet printers like e.g. the epson ones) is quite recently 
available .  .  . 

now , i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360 
dpi of the canon bubblejet vs. the hewlett packard deskjet 500  ( 300 dpi) .  . 
which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference , 
particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better  ( 75 

i 've seen during a short demonstration (from someone who tryed to sell me 
canon printers ) 2 times the same picture , one printed with the , one 
with the canon , the other with the hp , and .  .  . there was a difference in 
printing quality ,  .  .  . the canon was a bit better .  .  .

when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to 
inkjet printers .  . they have near laser quality , speed , and they are quiet. 
we use both hp and the canon bj 200s .  . i prefer the paper handling 
qualities of the but i feel the canons have superior print 
quality. the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder , however i did end 
up buying a deskjet for home use  ( got too good a deal) .  . anyway , we are 
using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well. out 
of 15 and 4 bj 200s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and 
that was taken care of very quickly by hp.

whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say , pick out the top 
few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt. i 've been 
unusually flush lately (no begging letter please) and so i 've done this a 
few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers .  . 

i ca n't remember much about the process except that i read about three 
reviews of inkjets and that the 500 was always at or near the top. i 
bought the 500c because of the added dimension of colour (i intend to build 
a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner 
towards that) .  . although i haven 's used the colour thing in earnest yet i 
tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the 
result. 

i note that even though you can now get the 550c (the one with both colour 
and mono with no need to change the cartridge ) , the 500c and 500 are still 
readily available (at least in the uk) .  . the following are my 
views experience 

1. i do n't know anything about the canon except that i came away 
from reviews  ( and replies to a posting similar to yours ) with 
the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio .  . 

2. i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the 
ideal place to be but the market 's still young so one assumes 
they have the expertise .  . 

3. the 500c is worth the extra .  . operation in mono is perfectly 
acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from 
windows. 

4. i used to work for when they still manufactured 
typesetters  ( before their american owners closed them down ! ) 
and i can tell you that in terms of definition 300 dpi is 
pretty poor anyway so 360 dpi is just a bit less poor .  .  .  . 

5. the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers. 

6. if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it 's pretty 
slow with it , god knows what it 's like without ! 

i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it 's not in daily 
use. i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and 
having a really dumb problem at the start it 's easy to operate .  . 

hope this is of use.

just bought the bj 200. i thought the price could n't be beat ( 329 , with 
50 rebate thru 5 31) and so far it is comparable , even superior , to the 
deskjet in print quality. 

speed per page rate seems to be faster (i do n't have figures) .  . 
i do n't print long docs , though. 

quality i think the graphics quality is excellent. print quality is 
excellent as well , unless you use small fonts and hold it up 
close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet .  . 
the 360 dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the 
page print head in place , i would imagine. 

large docs not room in the standard model for a whole pages ... 
manual says up to 100 , though. have n't tried it. 

drivers no problems under win3 . 1 . yet. winword does n't want to print 
the envelopes the same way the canon does , though. 

know nothing of add on costs. 

daniel a. hartung ask me about 



the deskjet is slow. this is in comparison to the other printers i 
mentioned. i have no idea how the bubblejet compares .  . 

the interface between win3 . 1 . and the printer is just dandy , i 've not 
had any problems with it. 

i just bought a bj 200 printer a couple of days ago. i compared it to the 
sample print of an hp deskjet 500 and knew that the hp was n't for me. the 
bj 200 is pretty fast and really prints with good quality. i can compare 
it with the hp laserjet postscript and they look almost identical ( 
depending on the kind of paper) .  . i do n't have problems with the ink not 
being dry , it seems to dry very fast. probably within a second. since 
canon is giving a 50 rebate until the end of may , it is really a good buy.

wow , it 's funny you should ask this. i'm a little behind in news reading 
so i know this may be late. 

i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night. i was really worried 
that i would n't like it but the print quality , and noise level is 
fantastic ! i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it 
printed damn near laser quality. you ca n't tell it 's not laser unless you 
get 2 inches from the page. 

no problems with drivers. the printer came with the driver diskette 
which is good because i was beginning to panic when i could n't it 
under windows or wordperfect .  . it works well under both. i have yet to 
install word for windows so do n't know how it works with them. 

i had a deskjet 500 at work last year. it was a good printer as well ut 
i felt it was awfully slow. and much than the bubblejet .  . i wo n't 
say the bubblejet is much better , but i really do like it more. just my 
0.02 worth.

you 're right. 

you cannot read or write a mac or apple ii 800k 3.5 disk or apple ii 
5.25 disk without extra hardware. however , mac 1 . 44mb . disks can be read 
and written in a pc 3.5 hd drive with software only. 

this should probably be added to every pc and mac faq file. it sure gets 
asked enough. 

i agree that this should be added to some sort of faq list. but we have 
strayed from the original topic. our computer environment is pretty split 
between mac 's and pc 's .  .  .  . i am lucky and get to have both on my desk. but 
there are people who have pc 's and need to share data with the mac users 
here. the mac users have no problems because of package called dos 
which automatically lets the mac read dos disks  . for the pc there 
is no  .  .  . that i know of ! both mac and have been 
under the dos platform , and requires you to perform the activity 
in a dos program to selectively transport the files. 

the question originally posed was if there is such a program that hooks into 
windows like a  . dll . that will interpret the reading of a mac disk when it is 
in a pc , and allow access to it through the standard file dialogs .  . it is quite 
clear that this would only be available for the 1 . 44mb .  .

i have written the file manager , wich has two windows which compare 
the files in two to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files. the 7 most important operations , copy , move , delete , 
show the file , start a progam , navigate in the directory tree can be 
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. this is very 
convenient , because the selection of the file and the operation to 
be performed , occur in one move. for bitmap graphic viewing the 
program vpic can be integrated , for and database files 
i use the view program from pctools 7 . 1 .  . can be configured to 
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats .  . it does 
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated  . 
this filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface , but 
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university .  . 
the drawback of this filemanager is , it 's still a dos program and 
the development of a windows version has not yet begun .  . i use the 
program package zip . , where run tells its windows companion 
exe . which windows program should be started. in this way you 
can start a windows program from a  . the new version 3 . 19 .

customers must buy new releases from them that are little more than 
bug fixes .  . anyone who buys a 2500 computer system and then runs ms 
windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy .  . 

oh wait ! ms the plastic housing on the ms mouse did n't

personally , i 'll be blasphemous and say that if microsoft keeps doing 
what it does so well , i hope to see much stricter copyright 
and patent laws for computer algorithms , concepts , interfaces , and 
other intellectual properties to protect real innovators .  . i 'd hate to 
be one who actually does , and then have microsoft come in 
like a huge vulture and use their brute mass  ( development staff , 
marketing , etc) to get fat off of my innovation .  . i do n't have all 
that much sympathy for apple 's complaint against microsoft , since 
they just took the ideas from xerox 's pa research center when the 
federal government forced xerox to disclose their patents over 
antitrust fears .  . however , for other companies and individuals who 
have a great idea , yet get it borrowed by larger corporations who 
can afford to quickly bring it to market , without any licensing from 
the original innovator , i feel much sympathy .  .

subject logic of backup 
organization university of illinois , dept. of comp. sci .  . , urbana , il 
lines 25 

i have been backing up my hard drive ever since i had to re install 
everything from scratch after a crash  ( learned the hard way , did n't i ! ) .  . 
i am using a windows based backup program  ( actually norton) , and i 
began wondering about the logic of this. sure , if i accidentally delete 
a file , i can get it from the archive .  . but what if my disk crashes again 
i would not be able to start windows to run the backup program !  ( note , 
by crash , i mean , there was some error message that prevented the machine 
from booting properly. i think i gave up too early , but i did n't have 
the time patience tools to figure out exactly what the problem was. my 
hard drive needed cleaning up anyway. yeah right .  .  . ) . this whole scenario 
is complicated by the fact that i am using stacker .  . 

so i think there are 2 possibilities 

1) i'm right. if my disk really crashes , i would at least have to 
re install dos and windows to get the backup program working. 
2) i'm wrong. there is an easy way to make a mirror of a hard disk 
that can easily restore it 's state from scratch .  . 

the polls are open .  .  .  .

bitmaps are large .  . bitmaps cost us a lot of money. there are 
special news groups for bitmaps because of this. we do n't 
subscribe to them. put you bitmaps in the right place. 
read one of the faq guides in the newuser groups and it 
will tell you all about bitmaps and the thousands of

some of them have very limited budgets .  .

i believe that enough is inferior to make it overall as a product 
inferior to its competition apple system 7 , os 2 2.0 , nextstep 3.0 , 
unix xwindows  ( pick your favorite  . 

in other words , it is your opinion that 1 . is inferior to its 
competition. that 's not the same as 1 . being objectively inferior .  . 

no. it is technically inferior to the os guis that i listed. i have already 
described why. to say briefly 


actually you fell into the above because you said i believe 
if you had used the rest of this post in your previous post 
i do not think anyone would have with you. 



system 7 easier to learn and use. there have been independent studies to 
that effect. 
os 2 can run msw applications and has more stable multitasking .  . 
nextstep easier to learn , use , and program. more stable multitasking 
unix x as easy to learn and use. more stable multitasking .  . 


the following three are not the competition for windows 3.0  ( imho of course) 
system 7 does not currently run on intel boxes 
nextstep rather expensive should be a competitor to windows nt not 3 . x . 
unix x 


with the exception of os 2 all of the above will require most users 
to spend a very large sum of money to upgrade applications to ones that 
run under these os 's .  . and basically money speaks louder than anything 
else. you keep saying more stable multitasking is what you mean 
not multi finder gem geoworks co operative multi tasking but 
real honest to goodness pre emptive multi tasking 

with the setup , all of these will exchange data with msw machines as 
well as msw machines will amongst themselves , so interoperability is not 
an issue. 

basically this is moot since most users have been able to share data for 
quite a long time , but are still to blind to know it. 


by this criterion , it is inferior .  . if you have another , then perhaps i am 
incorrect .  . do you pick up the glove 


why pick it up you stated the reasons behind your opinions. stated them in 
a very straight forward , though over protective , manner. and aside from 
my earlier comments about who actually is a competitor , i think we are in 
agreement .  . 

does tim agree let 's wait and see.

i thought i 'd reply to this , though i ai n't brad .  . at any case , a lot

this , however , will write your  . rle . file with a  . bmp . extension , so you 
have to rename it. 

now , another thing .  .  .  .  . 
this is from the windows  faq 

your file has to be less than 64 k 
( at least that 's what the faq says , but mine wont work for more than 
about 30 .  .  . maybe . they mend 32k , i do n't know) .  . 

your file has to fit vga size  ( 480 860 , or whatever standard vga size 
is . ) . if you use a non vga screen (e . g .  . cga , ega , svga , there is also a 
way to do it , but i thing instead of vgalogo . lgo . you use another file , 
such as lgo . , lgo . , or something. i'm not sure about 
this , as i have a vga , but i'm sure you could find it in the faq (a 
windows help ver. of which is available at cica , but do n't the

also .  .  .  . your .  . bmp . has to be 16 colours or less. 

these specs rule out some of the good  . bmp . 's .  . i found cartoon drawings 
work quite well as they have the advantage of looking good with little 
memory. 

finally , remember to save your current win . com . before , and put your 
new win . com . in the windows directory. also , do n't start windows from a 
directory where another win . com . is present , as that is used instead of 
the one in the windows dir , and win. wo n't start.

congratulations , you 've just discovered a very nasty , and very frequently 
, bug in the word setup program. once you know what is wrong , it 
is quite easy to fix. go into the fonts dialog under control panel , and select 
the two fonts mt extra and fences .  . delete them , but only delete the list 
entries , not the disk files. now select add , and add the fonts mt extra plain 
and fences plain .  . close the font box , close control panel , and restart word. 
everything should be alright now. 

does anyone know if microsoft has fixed this thing yet they have to know 
about it by now , it 's been so frequently reported .  .
