foam fitted and anti static bags .  . i am not sure if they were ever 
used , but each drive that is sent out will be in good working order. 

30 each plus shipping cost ,  ( about 5) , 

if you have one of those old ibm xt or pcs , this is for you ! it 's cheaper

this posting reminded me about a long standing question i 've had. 
does it 
pay to consider an underwater camera for pictures taken on land but 
in 
harsh environments (e . g .  . rain , snow , heat , cold , mud , dust ) or are 
the 
lenses , etc. all tuned for the refractive index of water 

i have had a nikon since 1988. unfortunately it is no longer 
made. it is a p s sealed to resist water to a depth of 12 feet. it 
is not really an underwater camera but it has been great in wet and 
dusty conditions. it takes aa batteries  . it has the solid , 
heavy feel of old style and has taken all the abuse i have 
been able to give it. this includes a lot of water  ( rain , river and 
sea) , desert and beach sand as well as being used as a weapon 
against a mugger .  . shouting and swinging the camera by the strap 
did n't scare the mugger away , hitting him with the flying camera 
did. this is my , never be without a camera camera. the current 
water resistant  ( sport touch i think is the name) model is nothing 
like as solid or well sealed .  .

hi all 

i have a korg 1 for sale for 300.00 shipping. for those who 've not 
had the pleasure 

it is a midi controlled (no keyboard of it 's own) digital voice 
processor .  . what can it do with your voice it can pitch shift it  ( change the 
notes you  . it can add to your singing  ( up to 5 parts at one 
time) .  . it can change your voice into a synthesizer 's voice but leave what 
you say alone and intelligible .  . this works well for a computerized sounding 
singer , or robot voice. for those of you who just thought about that , yes 
you can do the voices from cop , and the old lead ins with it , and yes 
i'm a little red faced to say that i tried those specifically .  . for an input , 
it takes both xlr (3 prong mic) and 1 4 cables .  . for output , you can have 
a combination of the original input only , and your choice of mix between the 
original signal and the effect  ( can be effect only if desired) .  . it has preset 
setups , which you can edit and save for your own preferences .  . it has a couple 
of light scratches , but does not look bad , and works flawlessly .  . even when we 
do n't use it in my music , it 's been good for after hours fun in the studio. 
the manual is included. i never got around to getting rack ears for it , but 
it has only gotten studio use from me no roading , so it 's not beaten .  . 

o o steve hitch 
oo o oo oo my opinions are my own. nobody would want to 
oooo oo oo take responsibility for them anyway. i will 
eventually hang for them , but i'm happy.

it 's basement cleaning time. this stuff has got to go. 

i have two boxes of 9 track 2400  tapes , around 20 tapes box. they are 
free to anyone who wants to come by and pick them up. they 've seen 
very little use. if anyone wants these bad enough to ship , they 're yours 
for the cost of shipping , the cod charge and a 10 fee. 

i have a lot of serial cables .  . i have all kinds , ribbon , shielded , long , 
short m m , m f whatever you want. most appear to work well with pc serial 
ports , but i will not gaurantee that. tell me what you want and i 'll do 
the best i can to match. 1.50 ea or 10 10. shipping included. no cods 
under 20.  ( you want to pay a 5 cod charge for a 1.50 cable go buy 
the cable at your local computer store instead , it 'll be cheaper . ) . i believe 
these cables were removed from service at a computer center. they appear 
to be in good condition and the ones i have used have worked well. 

i also have a 15 ups with batteries that needs minor repair , probably 
a logic board. it weighs about 280 pounds and is 36 inches high. i think 
they used to run a prime system off of it. best offer over 75 , but you

does anyone know what the jumpers should be set to on the maxtor 2190 
i have a 2190 that came off of a that i would like to use on a pc. 

... useful info about the maxtor drive deleted ... 

since the normally has only one hd , you would jumper c1 to 
select the first  ( possible ) drive address if the 2190 is your second drive 
on the , then jumper between 2c . 

however , thad , you should note that he said that he would like to 
use it on a  pc  , not  unix  . also note the strange cross posting  ( as he 
probably did not) , so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends 
to mount it on. if it is a pc  ( or clone ) , then the 2c jumper would be 
the correct choice. 

i 've left the cross posting in effect , since i'm not sure which 
newsgroup he would really be reading this in. ) 


sorry for any confusion i may have created. the disk did come out of 
a and i would like to use it in a ibm pc clone .  . the reason that i 
posted to comp . sys . was because i saw the drive  ( xt2190 ) mentioned 
in a for notice. i had asked for info before but did n't receive 
any replies. 

thanks once again for the help.

he is a crook .  . don't deal with him ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 

please help 

i am looking for dana  . a month ago i made a deal with him over the 
net. i was to sell him some memory , in for 100 and a 486 66 cpu .  . 
i thought the deal was great , so i went on with it. 

i sent him the memory cod for 100. he was then suppose to send me the cpu .  . 
i receive his cod payment on 4 8 93 .  . he send me a message the he sent the 
cpu out 4 16 93 .  . it has been two weeks , and i did n't receive the cpu .  . 

i send him numerous message asking for confirmation that the cpu was ship , or 
what address he send it to  ( to make sure it did n't get lost in the mail . ) . 
he never reply my mail. 

i finally resorted to calling him in arizona .  . the first call did n't get 
throught , i got an answering machine. i left him my number. he did n't reply. 
i call again the next day and he pick up the phone. i asked him if he had 
send out the cpu .  . he said yes , but he does n't know what address he sent it 
to. 

he said that you would check his record at home and call me back the next day. 
to my suprise , he never called. i then send him some more email messages , he 
never reply again.  ( strang , when the deal was being made , he reply to every 
of my message , now that he got my memory , he wo n't even reply to me . ) . 

now i am still calling him , but he wo n't pick up the phone. i am also still 
emailing him , but he wo n't reply my mail. 

so if any one know this dana , please contact him. 
he can be reach at 
dana 
w las 
phoenix , az 
 ( 602)925 ) in the day time this is his business number. 
 ( 602)842 ) 2145 in the evenings this is his home number. 


his email address is

this is our deal 

from az . loral . com . wed mar 17 20 09 20 1993 


72 pin simms are n't hot sellers , i pick them up on the upgrade market for 
140 160 quite often. best i can do is the 486dx2 66 and 100. 



ok you got a deal , i 'll trade you 4  ( 72pins simms) for an intel 486dx2 66 and 
100. i need you address for , i will ship it via cod and i 'll pay 
shipping handling .  . when the simms arrive , there will be a 100 charge on your 
part. you can send the cpu to me via cod if possible 

my address 

by the way , is the cpu under warranty 

great , you can send the simms to me at 
dana 
w las 
phoenix , az 
(602) 925  ( days ) (602) 842 2145  ( evenings ) 

i would prefer us mail , 2nd day priority (it only costs 2 . 90) . 

the cpu is brand new , install it correctly  ( meaning do n't plug it in 
backwards or bend any pins) and i 'll warranty it for 6 months. 
thanks 

on 4 8 i send him and said .  .  .  . 
that i got the cod payment. 
and asked if the cpu is sent out yet 
is the cpu sent out yet 
he replied .  .  .  .  . on . 4 9 

glad the cod payment got to you ok , the cpu has been sent so keep your eyes out 
for it. be very careful when you install it , be careful of static discharge , 
bending pins during insertion and above all make absolutely certain you 
plug the chip in the proper orientation .  . the chip was checked out prior to 
shipping and if you cook it by plugging it in backwards i wo n't be real 
sympathetic ! 

if you do n't know how to tell what orientation the chip should be installed , 
don't guess ! 


dana update 

i call him sunday , his wife debbie picked up the phone. she said that he was 
busy with his kids , and he would call me back in 10  . half an house 
went by , did n't called. i called him again , and his phone was 
 . 

since this post , i have numberous people who mail me saying that this dana 
have ripped them off. we got do something about this guy. he has 
been doing this for a few years now. and he is getting away 
with it.

in a few days. thanks. 

please refer to 7870 , he is selling 150 for that cpu .  . 

correct. 150 may be high now that amd has started selling 486 clones ! 


you 're both dreaming .  . that guy who is selling at 150 is ripping himself off and 
once those chips are gone it 'll be a while before you see that price again , amd 
or not. a clone is still a clone , if you want the genuine article then you pay 
for it. just because one guy decides to sell at a ridiculously low price does n everyone else has to.

i have been quoted a price from a local dealer friend of mine , that i could get a

here is some friendly advice , go to your favorite book store  ( walden book 's) 
and pick up a computer shoppers guide .  .  .  . 

you think that was aa good price wait till you see some of the other goodies they sell

i recently purchased an ibm monochrome vga monitor from mike damico .  . the 
monitor arrived but it was missing it 's power cable. mike 's address is 
apparently not a proper address because mail ca n't reach it. if anyone 
knows how to contact mike and could help me find him i would appreciate it. 
i am sure he just set aside the power cord as he was packing the monitor 
but it would be a lot more useful to me if i had the cord as well.

items for sale .  .  .  .  .  . 

this package was bought throught a award give away company. i attempted 
to cancel my order before i received the package , but i was too late and 
the company refused to take the package back for refund .  . i know the truth 
which i would never get my 697 back , but i wish to get my money back as 
close as possible. here is the describtion of the package .  .  .  . 

3d camera it takes very good picture , never been opended 
or used. it came with wide angle flesh , carring 
case , film , and a instruction video. it has four 
lens and created a 3d effect on a regular 35mm 
film. 

jewelry it came with the package as additional gift. 

bahama vacation voucher the voucher is good for two rt airfare to freeport .  . 
the users get a special hotel rate of 27 per person 
per night. meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is 
not included. 

las vegas , reno , orlando the voucher provides one rt airfare , and 
hotel accomodation for 3 days 2 nights. 
meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is not 
included. the voucher is good for all 3 
locations , but you ca n't travel to all 3 
places at once. 

cancun , mexico the voucher provides one rt airfare , and hotel 
accomodation for 3 days 2 nights. meals and 
ground transfer , hotel tax is not included as 
usual. 

i paid 697 for the whole package. so try not to be cold blooded when you 
make your offer. details would be provided by request. i do wish to sell 
the whole package at once. so if you are just looking for the vacation 
vouchers , i do n't care if you sell the camera to other for a higher pric 
if you are interested in the camera , you could treat the vacation vouchers 
as gift. 

if you receive a letter in your mail box which says that you are selected 
to be part of the and you have at least one out of five awards .  . 
trust me , you would get the exactly the same package as i did. there is 
only one award which will be given away. so do n't bother even to call them 
back , if you are really interested , you could get it from me for a cheaper 
price. and you could receive the package within a week ( i waited three 
months to get my first and final packages) .  . also , they would ask for your 
credit card number and you have to pay for the interest to the credit 
card company. so why spend more than you should when you could get them 
from me for a cheaper price. 

if you are interested , please reply to me as soon as posible .  . i really 
wish to get this over with. make me an offer , if i am confortable with 
your offer , i would send the package by u . p . s .  . the next day morning. 
more details could be given if you wish.

since the normally has only one hd , you would jumper c1 to 
select the first  ( possible ) drive address if the 2190 is your second drive 
on the , then jumper between 2c . 

however , thad , you should note that he said that he would like to 
use it on a  pc  , not  unix  . also note the strange cross posting  ( as he 
probably did not) , so it is not sure exactly what sort of machine he intends 
to mount it on. if it is a pc  ( or clone ) , then the 2c jumper would be 
the correct choice.

computer equipment garage sale 

i 've finally decided to clean out my and get rid of some of the stuff 
that is broken or not being used by me. i 've put together a list and 
indicated what i think each item is worth. this is just my estimate , and i 
am very open to any offers , including trades .  . i'm currently looking for 
some cd roms that will work with a mac cd rom player cd caddies , hd floppy 
disks , any used macintosh software , a 387 33mhz co processor , or basically 
anything you have lying around  ( cans of soup , the neighbor 's cat , etc .  .  . ) . 
make me an offer , no offer will be overlooked .  .  .  . 
i really want to get rid of this stuff .  .  .  . 

ok , here 's the list 

52 meg 3.5 scsi hard drive. conner model cp 3150 .  . i bought this from a guy 
at a swap meet to use with my macintosh .  . unfortunately , i ca n't seem 
to get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer. the 
guy tested it with his pc , and printed out a copy of the norton disk 
doctor report which says it has no bad sectors .  . (i 'll send you a copy ) 
i was dumb enough not to get his phone number , so i ca n't return it to 
him. the drive has many jumpers on it , (which i do n't know how to set) 
so maybe that 's the problem. i was quite disappointed that it did n't 
work so i'm trying to minimize my losses .  . 45 

52 meg 3.5 scsi hard drive. conner model cp 3150 .  . same situation as above. 
i bought both of these drives from the same guy. despite the different 
model numbers they are the same exact drive. same report from ndd 
(i have one for each drive) will be included. 45 

40 meg sony 3.5 scsi hard drive. sony model  . the drive mechanism 
is completely trashed .  . this hard drive was in my computer (mac se ) and 
had a problem. well , repeated banging on the side of the 
computer resulted in a head crash (yes , metal scraping metal ) which 
was not too pleasant to listen to. still the scsi controller 
card is in good working order , and can be used for parts , or a 
project. 20 

65 meg seagate 5.25 hh scsi hard drive. model st  . i originally bought 
this drive , because it had a small problem , and i though that 
i could fix it. well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine , 
and that it was a controller problem.  ( motor controller was n't sending 
proper signals . ) . well , after taking the controller off the drive , 
looking at it , and putting it back together , i realized that i 
accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the 
drive to the controller .  . i tried to solder it , but i'm not that good 
at soldering so i could n't do it. worked perfectly before i messed 
up. i used it as a temporary drive when the sony  ( above ) crashed on 
me. also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications , 
worth well over 1000 .  .  ( claris cad , ms word 5.0 , think c , 
excel , and many others) 
i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable. you also get all 
the software on the drive.  ( if you can accept being a pirate ) i only 
ask that you delete my data files from the drive. i was really angry 
when i broke that connection , and then could n't fix it. i just do n't 
have time to play with it any more. 65 

at t isdn 7500 modem .  . this is for use on digital phone systems. if you know 
what this is or would like technical information on it , let me know. i 
have some tech documents on it. is supposed to be the same thing as an 
at t digital phone , but without the phone part. it seems to be in 
working order  ( passes self test perfectly ok) .  . i have no idea how 
this is worth .  .  .  . let me know if you 're interested. 

motorola coprocessor .  . i have n't tested this one out yet , but if anyone 
is interested i will get it tested out , to make sure that it works. i 
had trouble using it with my accelerator board , but then i spoke to the 
manufacturer of the board and found out it could n't be used without 
another controller chip .  . when i was looking around to buy one new , the 
prices were around 100. i will guarantee this to work. 65 

cga card. half length. 8 bit. was n't working last time i checked  ( although 
i think i was using a bad monitor ) 5 

5.25 360k floppy drive. ibm drive type 1355 .  . guaranteed to work , 
because when i took it out of the pc , it was working ! 25 

5.25 360k floppy drive. toshiba model number nd a. guaranteed to 
work. came out of same pc as above. 25 

5.25 floppy drives .  . ca n't guarantee that these will work. i do n't 
even know if they are low or high density drives .  . i do n't have 
any method of testing them. 
panasonic model number ju 455 5  . there 's another 
number on it 2626  . 
panasonic model number ju 475 2 agg .  . there 's also 
another number on it 
toshiba model number nd  . virtually identical to the one 
above. 
each drive 10 

3.5 ps 2 drive. these things are proprietary , so i ca n't test it , but i 
think it works. not sure if it 's high density or low density , but i 
suppose someone who is looking for one would know. model number 
 . i think these things are expensive to replace .  . 35 

mfm hard drive controller cards. i 've got three of these , and i have no way 
of testing them. two of them are 8 bit cards , and one is a sixteen bit 
card with a floppy controller built in. 10 for the 8 bits 15 for 
the 16 bit card w floppy .  . 

interesting cable. seems to convert from a vga plug to an ega plug .  . that is , 
standard nine pin to vga 15 pin .  . made by hewlett packard .  . part no. 
10 



i 've sold stuff like this before , and it was a huge success , with many 
satisfied people trading or stuff they did n't need anymore. i 
usually ship through the u.s. postal service  ( have n't had any problems yet) 
and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated .  . 

well , that 's all folks. as i said before , no offer will be refused .  . if you 
can convince me to give to you instead of throwing it out , try ! i hate 
to throw away stuff .  .  .  .

or used. it came with wide angle flesh , carring

lens and created a 3d effect on a regular 35mm 
film. 

jewelry it came with the package as additional gift. 

bahama vacation voucher the voucher is good for two rt airfare to freeport .  . 
the users get a special hotel rate of 27 per person 
per night. meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is 
not included. 

las vegas , reno , orlando the voucher provides one rt airfare , and

meals , ground transfer , hotel tax is not

places at once. 

cancun , mexico the voucher provides one rt airfare , and hotel 
accomodation for 3 days 2 nights. meals and 
ground transfer , hotel tax is not included as 
usual. 


asking for 500 or best offer .  .  .  . 

i paid 697 for the whole package. and it is too late for me to get the 
refund .  . i would sell it for 500 for the whole package. details could be 
provided by request. i do wish to sell the whole package at once. so if 
you are just looking for the vacation vouchers , i do n't care if you 
sell the camera to other for a higher price. if you are interested in 
the camera , you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift. 

some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you 
are selected to be part of the and you have at least one out 
of five awards .  . trust me , you would get the exactly the same package as 
i did. there is only one award which will be given away. so do n't 
bother even to call them back , if you are really interested , you could 
get it from me for a cheaper price. and you could receive the package 
within a week ( i waited three months to get my first and final packages) .  . 
also , they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay 
for the interest to the credit card company. so why spend more than you 
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price. 

if you are interested , please reply to me as soon as posible .  . i really 
wish to get this over with. make me an offer , if i am confortable with 
your offer , i would send the package by u . p . s .  . the next day morning. 
more details could be given if you wish.

car amplifiers for sale 

i have 3 high end car amplifiers for sale 

(2) old style rockford 150 's .  . these are great amps , and i 've never 
had a minute 's trouble with either of them. i 've been running them on 
high end for quite some time  ( front rear ) and have been very pleased 
with them in that setup , but i 've also run them on low end before , and 
they perform quite well in that situation as well. i'm trying to sell 
them because i'm considering upgrading to a rockford 650 .  . i already 
own a power 300 , and i 've always liked the way the 650 300 combo worked 
in cars. 

i'm asking 200.00 a piece , and list on them when i bought them was 
375 . 00 .  . if you 're interested in both of them , i 'd be willing to come 
down on the price a little bit. 


(1) precision power 2150 .  . this great utility amplifier is rated at , 
and looks brand new. the shroud is , and it works great. 
this is a great low end amp because of it 's high power rating into 
2 channels , however , i 've also had it running front or back high end 
before where it did very well. 

i'm asking 425.00 for this amp , but feel free to make me an offer on 
it.

recently i got a case of hot shots '93 cards. unfortunately i had 
not planned on keeping all of them. i sort of got stuck with the 
case.  ( i'm not going to mention any names , though . ) . 

so , i am trying to sell off most or all  ( minus a set for myself) .  . 

if you have any interest in a set , a box , or any singles , please let 
me know. 

the set has 250 cards. each card features a great looking woman in 
various stages of dress. some nude , semi nude , , dressed .  . 
99 percent are gorgeous , i feel. 

there are 4 subsets 

girl , girl , girls 1 through 9 
promo cards 251 through 259  ( also numbered 1 of 9 through 9 of 9) 
emperor 's all stars 269 through 277 
stripping 260 through 268 

also , i am supposed to be getting some holograms soon as well. 

oh , and lastly , i have a very few error cards and a few cards 
that were originally intended to be used as card 1 , but the 
company changed their mind. none of these cards are easy to get. 

anyway , if you have some interest in any of these cards , please 
drop me a line , as i am most eager to sell a bunch off. 

oh , and if you are interested , i also have 1 set of hot shots '92 
left , and about 2 sets of california dreaming cards as well. 

and lastly , i have promo cards for all of the cards i have 
mentioned , and holograms as well. not a lot , though.

i still have about 70 records left on hand , all in pristine condition 
(except where noted) , quite a few out of print and more than a few 
imports in the bunch. 

rather than selling the majority for 3 4 each , i'm looking to barter 
packages for stuff that you might be selling over usenet .  . i 'll also 
trade for other records in very good condition that you 've replaced 
with cd , as well as pre recorded videos on beta or vhs .  . in the past , 
i 've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list store price 
(e . g .  . , 1 cd 1 movie in beta format ) to get around what you or i 
might have originally paid  ( as if we can even remember ! ( ) 

at this time , i'm looking for a set of working aa nicad rechargable 
batteries ... if you have some lying around , and they 're sound , rsvp ! 

so if you 're curious , rsvp for my list and if you see anything that 
you like , send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of 
your ad for the stuff you 're selling ... thanks ! 

gld 

i.e. , the imports and out of prints are also valued at 1 used cd 

i once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records  ( list 81) 
anybody got a nice , unused blender for making frozen ( 

ps there have been no additions since the last posting in february 
the list has only shrunk as i 've made a few deals since.

i'm looking for an old album or cassette tape. the group is sanford townsend 
the name of the album is  smoke from a distant fire  (i think) .  . this album 
came out somewhere around 1975 76 , and i believe was the first album produced 
by kenny after he and jim messina broke up. 

if you happen to have this album and are willing to part with it , great. if 
you do n't want to part with it , but are willing to copy it onto cassette i 'd 
love that too.

three esdi  . i would consider a trade for a scsi dat tape drive. 

this box would make a great bbs system or terminal server. it was originally 
designed to service 40 active users , and up to 70 moderately active users. 
this is not a pc ! it was designed to be a unix box from the start , and it 's 
very fast and exceptionally reliable .  . 

it 's dimensions are approximately 2 . 5' . high  ( tower ) , 8 wide and 2 deep. 

i am only interested in dealing with someone local enough to come pick it up. 
shipping is way too much hassle .  . call if you wish , or send email.

i am not a company , thus this is not a commercial sale. 

i purchased 256 t shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. 
we did n't have the time to sell the shirts. i have about 175 shirts 
left and i am willing to sell them to you for 5.25 a piece  ( more than a 
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts , 
even in bulk )  ( that 's 918 . 75 . for 175 shirts ) these shirts are jim 
morris t shirts. they are all 100 cotton and most have more than 4 
colors.  ( they are clean and neatly folded in a box. if any happen to 
be damaged i will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace 
it , your option . ) . you could sell them for at least 8 to 15 a piece 
(the higher number is for the nicer shirts ) to raise money for a school 
event or a organization. i realize it is a big investment , but it could 
pay off big. 

i would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at 5.50 a 
shirt. i will pay shipping , but prefer local buyers and will give them 
more bargaining power. 

please help me. i do not have the time to sell these shirts and i need 
the money. i am taking a big loss by selling this cheap. i will give 
you jim morris  phone number so that you can the prices. 

all prices are negotiable .  . 

truman 

please email and tell all of the clubs in the area 
about this deal. once they 're gone , they 're gone  ( cause i am not a

subject sq 80 cross wave synthesizer for sale 
originator 
organization but in order 
lines 71 


sq 80 cross wave synthesizer 
i have an sq 80 for sale. the sq 80 is a powerful performance 
oriented synth with a limited on board sequencer .  . i bought it because 
it has a very large repertoire it seems to do analog 
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more digital . 
below are a list of features extracted from the owner 's manual 
o eight voice polyphonic poly synthesizer , capable of 
playing eight different sounds at once , with dynamic stereo 
panning for each voice 
o voice section employing cross wave synthesis combine different 
attack and sustain wave segments to create complex , dynamic sounds 
o 75 sampled waves  ( includes a drumset ) serve as the sound source 
o dynamic voice allocation each sequencer track midi channel has 
access to all eight voices 
o a full featured midi controller keyboard capable of sending eight 
midi program and volume changes at once. keyboard is velocity 
sensitive , and transmits receives velocity and polyphonic  . 
o powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
modulation sources and routings .  . 
o a 3.5 floppy disk drive which writes reads ordinary ds dd disks 
allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to 
1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk .  . also has a ram cart slot 
for patches that is compatible with esq 1 ram carts .  . 
o does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable midi device 
o 80 character fluorescent display and user friendly page driven 
programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface 
o stereo line outs , and stereo headphone jack for private listening 
o sound programs and sequences are compatible with the esq 1 
so that sounds and sequences created for the esq 1 can be played on 
the sq 80 .  . 

this sq 80 has been the main midi controller in my studio for quite a while 
now. it has performed ably in that role , and has also been a heavily 
used sound source at the same time. the sq 80 seems to have been designed 
with this role in mind , and it works very well with my software sequencer 
 ( wincake ) in its mode. 

from a synthesis point of view , this machine is a hybrid .  . it uses looped 
short samples  ( there are 75 of them) as sources , then these waves 
are processed with a sophisticated dca arrangement .  . the sq 80 
is capable of great things because of its 4 pole analog filter .  . 
simply put , it makes fabulous analog synth sounds. but unlike most 
good analog , it has a very thorough midi implementation so that it 
works very well with a midi sequencer .  . what i really like most about this 
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds. 
this sq 80 is about 5 years old  . date 1 21 88) .  . it does have 
an 8 track sequencer , but like most on board , it is a pain 
to use so i have avoided it. 

reason for sale 
i am selling my sq 80 because i recently joined forces with another individual 
here in boston , and we have more keyboards than space to put them. i 
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a 
powerful but economical master keyboard. 

pricing and terms 
i paid 1300 . 00 . for this synth a few years ago. i am willing to accept 
650.00  ( average r . m . m . s . asking price is 733 . 00) .  . i will include a bunch of 
patches on sq 80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth , as well as the 
original sq 80 owner 's manual.

i just received a music software for windows and found that it needs 
a midi sound card  ( sound blaster pro is preferred) to have its fantastic 
features show up. as i do n't have the plan to add a sound card now , i am 
putting it here for sale. it 's listed 79.95 on april issue of windows 
magazine and i paid 84 . 95 . as the total .  . i am asking around 70 with shipping 
included. 

for windows 

composer , sequencer  ( tape deck) , and box all in one. 

it 's a word processor for music you can write and edit  ( cut , paste , move 
and copy , etc) notes and symbols , play and print your composition .  . 

it 's graphical user interface works like a multi track tape recorder .  . 
up to 64 musical tracks can be arranged for play , record , rewind , fast forward 
and stop. 

it plays music on any midi compatible instrument piano , guitar , drum set , 
, clarinet , organ , and many. 

you do not need to be a musician to use this software. the on line manual 
is handy. for musicians , it 's great as writing music is not a tedious and 
stifling aspect .  .

sounds a little odd but i sold an amiga hand scanner to 
an elementary school teacher in south florida  ( miami , i 
think) but i have just recently found that i still have 
the scanner manual. the original shipment included the 
software manual , disks , packaging , etc. 

basically , i have since lost the name address of the 
person i sold it to .  .  . and . i would like to get it to him.
