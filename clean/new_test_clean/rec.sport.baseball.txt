hey valentine , i do n't see boston with any world series rings on their 
fingers. damn , morris now has three and probably the hall of fame in his 
future. therefore , i would have to say toronto easily made the best 
signing .  . and do n't tell me boston will win this year. they wo n't 
even be in the top 4 in the division , more like 6th .  . 


in spite of what all the stat heads say , jack morris played a large role in 
the jays winning the world series last year. i do n't care if his era was 4. 
he played a leadership role and did win 21 games. his era may have been high , 
but he did pitch many outstanding ball games. 

and he pitched many not so outstanding ballgames , too. 

jack essentially pitched a lot of .500 ball last year. this certainly 
is n't irrelevant , and you replace morris with replacement level quality 
the blue jays might not win. 

re leadership , i do n't see it. if the leadership effect is there for 
a starting pitcher , you would expect to see its primary effect on the 
pitching staff. you would expect to see the rest of the staff improve .  . 
instead , the rest of the staff declined .  . 

you can make a reasonable argument for winfield providing leadership 
the offense picked up considerably from its effectiveness the previous 
year. i'm not saying i buy that , but at least that argument makes 
internal sense.

in article  ( tim shippert ) writes 
the reason i bothered doing this dr stuff was to see if i could 
determine the answer to the age old question is jeff blauser more 
valuable than rafael . 

well , it looks like , just as doug tim , beating him to the net 
with his defensive analyses , so tim has gotten in ahead of me. 

the way i was doing it was a little different. being me , of course , i 
used equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth , 
and i calculated both rate of performance  ( fielding equivalent 
average ) and total performance  ( fielding equivalent runs) .  . but i 
compared , not to the average player , but the replacement player , and 
here 's why because the positional adjustment comes built in to the 
system. in the al of 1992 , the average ss is 32.9 runs above 
replacement  ( rar ) cf , 31.6 2b , 28.8 3b , 26 . 3 . lf , 26.0 rf , 24 . 6 . 
1b , 16 . 9 .  . we may quibble with the exact numbers , but the order looks 
substantially right. 

in the equivalent average , i have always set league average to  . 235 .  . i 
had decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an of 
 . 180 . the name of that replacement level hitter , often as not , is 
billy ripken . i decided to let the replacement level fielder be the 
same distance from .235 as  . 180 . , but in the opposite direction as i 
have set it up that makes for an of  . 280 .  . (yes , i can add. runs 
are proportional to squared the difference between 180 squared 
and 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared , and i rounded 
off for  . an all replacement fielding team would have 
randy milligan at first ( . , willie randolph ( . at second , leo 
gomez ( . at third , walt weiss ( . at short , kevin bass ( . 
in left , hojo ( . in center , and eric anthony ( . in right. ugh .  . 

so , the total number of for a player is the sum of his batting and 
fielding  . i can rate them by total , or per some number of 
batting outs , like 400 .  . an average player has a total of about 55 , 
30 batting , 25 fielding .  .

if this is true  ( note that i do n't think it is) , lasorda should be 
fired for at least two reasons 

1) publicly humiliating his players 
2) knuckling under to his players wishes. 

i did not write that ! in fact , those statements were a rebuttal to 
an earlier posting that i made , and this was culled from my strong 
rebuttal to those statements .  . please ! slander .  . shame. 


there is a fine line between getting players  input and knuckling 
under to players  demands .  . a manager , much like a military officer , 
needs to have his  ( her ) players  complete obedience and respect during 
a game. after the game , it 's no big deal , but when there is no time 
to do more than react , players must trust the manager or the team often 
falls apart  ( see boston red sox , ff .  . ) ) 


after the game , it 's no big deal after the employees leave 
the workplace , it does n't matter what they say about the boss or the 
company  . 


strawberry 's as represented by the media , often sounds like 
demands .  . i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth i'm 
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if 
it came from strawberry .  . russ porter quoted strawberry as saying , 
i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best 
in that role.  ( paraphrased by my memory and bias . ) . that seems like 
a fairly non answer to what was almost certainly a question 
like , how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order 


first , it 's ross porter .  . second , i am really tired of seeing the kind 
of response that indicates that all i do is parrot what some media 
person says or writes .  . i have a brain. if i choose to characterize 
something in a certain fashion , it 's because that is what i believe 
to be accurate. it is not just because some unnamed made 
the characterization .  . 

a more media sensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is 
doing. if he thinks that batting me third will help the team , then i 
am all for it. we 'd ignore that answer as brown stuff , so it seems a 
little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl 's response as  . 

i did not brand darryl 's response as , because i never heard 
any response from darryl .  . i did call him a name. i referred to him 
as a primadonna .  . someone else concluded that i did that because i 
hate him. i do n't hate him. i think he 's a primadonna .  . if you 
disagree , fine. but stop putting words in my mouth.

first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless 
you include watching the grass grow as baseball .  . 

i definitely do. that 's why i do n't like going to see games played 
on artificial turf ) 

the games 
are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking 
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers 
and pitching coaches .  . 

and while it 's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting , this 
is only true when they do n't become extra long. 

well , your idea of interesting differs from mine. i think 
batting practice is interesting , for example , and make a special 
effort to get to the game very early in order to see it. i think the 
delaying tactics of batters , pitchers , catchers , and managers are 
interesting because they 're attempts to gain advantage through control 
of the flow and timing of the game. of course , the umpires can , and 
should , intervene when these tactics get out of hand. as ryan robbins 
has pointed out , there are rules that cover this. 

one of the more fascinating things about baseball , i think , is its 
open with regard to time. you never know if the game is going 
to zip right by and be over in less than two hours , or if it 's going to 
go on until four in the morning. likewise , some games are action packed , 
and some games are slow and lazy. that 's fine by me. those folks who 
want constant action should watch the games on tv so they can channel 
surf and to their short attention spans .  .

i always thought that a reasonable means of measuring value between 
players was to attempt to determine if a team would trade one for 
another. 

the major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age. even if 
morris were performing as well as clemens right now , and were likely to 
this season , nobody would trade clemens for morris straight up because 
clemens has more of his career left.

that he d been thrown out. and gant had a legitimate beef about 
the 1 0 pitch that was called a strike .  . a reasonable umpire would 
not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation. 

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get 
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous 
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more 
umpires will do as did in the pitcher to pitch if 
the batter wo n't get back in the box. 

so what if the previous strike call was bogus it 's in the past , it ca n't 
be changed get back in there and deal with the next pitch .  . 

sorry , sherri , but i ca n't agree with this particular incident .  . while 
i'm all for cutting down the number of chain rattles and other examples 
of rampant , there was a difference here. 

1) since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls. 
so have pitchers and catchers .  . usually , nothing happens. 
unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing 
complaints , was acting against expectations. 

2) it 's not as if gant was in 's face . gant said 
something about the call , stepped out of the box , and turned away 
from  . as a hitter  ( alibet of little consequence , but 
with a decent eye ) , whenever receiving the short end of the stick 
on a questionable call , i 'd want a moment or two out of the box , 
if for no other reason than to rethink the strike zone based on 
the experience of the last pitch .  . and if i was really angry 
at the ump , i 'd rather turn away and catch my breath than 
turn to him and say something that might get me tossed , 
especially at a key moment in the game. 

when gant turned away , immediately motioned for gant 
to step into the box. imo , at this point in time , 
was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game. 
gant was n't he had n't had a chance to  . and 
was simply exercising a power play. gant resisted , as many of 
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and 
called for the pitch .  . at that point , cox came out on 
the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other braves left the 
dugout .  . cox was tossed protecting his player . i was pleasantly 
surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game. 

it 's a small sample size , but based on what i saw in that game , 
mark has a hair trigger temper and a need to play 
god on the field. not good qualities for an umpire .  . i will 
keep my eyes open for future appearances of in the 
future , in order to improve my sample size. 

imo , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was 
a bad game for the umpire .  .

1) why would owners decrease ticket prices when they obviously get 
lots of people to pay the price they 're asking 


i do n't think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing 
to pay the price. i'm sure someone out there in net land has some 
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity 
sold. but even if the trends are relatively flat , you have to consider 
what is happening on a team by team basis. 

when the tv money dries up , franchises will be seeking to the 
lost revenues from alternative sources. one of the best sources may 
be ticket sales. 

example 1 the dodgers 

the dodgers can count on a strong base of season ticket sales 
and probably believe that they have the ability to raise 
prices without hindering revenues .  . i certainly think that is 
true. 

example 2 the padres 

they will be lucky to average 10 , 000 fans a game this year. 
if they raise prices , less. if they want to increase their 
overall revenue base , the best thing they can do is put a 
winning team on the field. but given that wo n't happen (it 
wo n't) , they can probably make more money by lowering ticket 
prices and running frequent promotions .  . will they do that 
i have no idea. but they wo n't increase prices , because it 
wo n't work for them . 


2) even assuming that you have some strange power to make the owners 
decrease ticket prices , that does not decrease the tv contract. 


the only strange powers at work here are the forces of the market place. 
each team 's market is somewhat different , and each owner is going to 
be faced with a unique set of circumstances about how to deal with those 
market forces .  . as a manager , i would never want to lower my 
prices , but sometimes that strategy is necessary , and sometimes it works. 
you have to consider everything if you want continued success.

baseball is a team game , but it is made of individual talents .  . it is 
absurd to judge the success or failure of an individual by the success

cases . ) . morris won last year because he played on a team with joe 
carter , alomar , tom henke , juan guzman , john olerud , et al. 
clemens lost because he was surrounded by such lesser as 
herm , luis rivera , and jeff reardon .  . to define the quality 
of the team as a sum of its components  ( as i do , albeit imperfectly ) 
is a lesser error than defining the quality of an individual as the 
mean quality of the team  ( as my reading of your arguments suggests you 
do) 

no , i am not trying to define the quality of an individual , at least not 
for the purpose of ranking them. toronto won with olerud .  . they might 
have won with fielder .  . they might not have won with thomas .  . detroit 
might have won with thomas .  . chicago might have won with fielder .  . you 
ca n't rank these individuals .  . you can only look at who might contribute 
more to the team effort , which is winning the ws .  . thomas could not 
have contributed to that goal any more than olerud so i cannot say that 
olerud is less of a player. 


ok , roger , here 's a question for you. say you are running an expansion 
team. you do n't have a team at the moment , but the draft is coming up. who 
are you going to pick , guys who have won the most ws rings , or guys who

i agree that was just doing what he was instructed to do

bitching about it. i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking 
at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a 
ticket , i do n't mind a game that last more than 2 10. i really do n't 
understand it. 

games are longer now for several reasons more pitching changes , 
more basestealing ( and throws to first ) , etc .  .  . i . think a very small factor 
is the increased time it takes jose canseco deion sanders insert fancy 
ballplayer here to arrange their jewelry prior to stepping in the 
batter 's box. my impression is that and writers have made this 
an issue because they like shorter games they get to head back to hotel 
bar , eat steaks , get drunk , tell stupid jokes with their pals and chase 
around the bar. sure they want the game over with. print 
journalists have a slightly more legitimate reason for wanting faster games 
they have deadlines .  . the espn guys on baseball tonight drive me crazy they 
constantly harp on this primarily because they often have to work late 
when the game goes longer than 2 30. 

maybe i am just a ne er do well with nothing better to do , but i 
would like to hear reasons why the longer games upset you. 

as a parenthetical note , it seems the league is in any case fighting 
a losing battle this year. the increased offense thus far will certainly 
spoil any hopes of getting the games over with more quickly.

i suspect that splits such as these are the result of positioning .  . an 
outfielder who is fast and gets a good jump would be expected to catch a 
lot of balls , preventing both singles and doubles , and also cut off more 
balls , doubles into singles .  . however , a fielder 
who plays shallow will catch more short flies and fewer long flies this 
means that he will allow fewer singles but more doubles .  . 

has anyone seen these players  positioning do butler and felix play 
deep , and , martinez , and wilson shallow , or is this a park 
effect i thought butler liked to play shallow .  .

no statistic can describe it (sorry statheads ) and since there are so many 
new faces in the clubhouse i think the jays are still trying to find it.

this week 's play 


it took three days to get to us , but i 'll try anyway as i naturally 
have n't seen the answer. 

with runners at first and second and one out , the batter hits an 
easy pop fly to the third baseman .  . 

(a) the umpires declare the infield fly rule and the third baseman 
lets the ball drop. the runner at second heads for third and the 
third baseman flips the ball to the short stop who the bag 
before the runner .  . 

safe. the correct call is infield fly ,  ( batter out) if fair . runners 
may advance at own risk.  ( gotta tag up if caught , etc . ) . it is not a 
force , and the pop was not caught , so regardless of whether the ss 
3b or 2b (it was n't clear , above) , he has n't got the runner out. 

(b) the umpires do n't declare the infield fly rule and the third 
baseman allows the ball to drop and throws to the short stop , who 
the runner from second while the runner is between second and 
third .  . 

out. see rule 6 . approved ruling .  . (below) .  . in this case , the 
umpire has decided for whatever reason that the infield fly rule 
does n't apply.  ( sounds like a bad call here , but that 's not the 
point) .  . the batter is not out , so a force situation is created. 
therefore , the runner is out. ( unless , by rule 6 . the ball is 
dead and the batter is safe , then i guess the runners would advance 
unmolested .  . i ca n't really tell from 6 . that the ball is dead in 
this situation . ) . 


what 's the call in (a) and (b) 

pertinent rules 2.00 definition of infield fly when an infield fly 
is called , runners may advance at their own risk. if on an infield fly 
rule , the infielder intentionally drops a fair ball , the ball remains 
in play despite the provisions of rule 6 .  . the infield fly rule 
takes precedence .  . 

6 . a batter is out when an infielder intentionally drops a fair 
fly ball or line drive , with first , first and second , first and thrid , 
or first , second and third base occupied before two are out. the ball 
is dead and the runners or runners shall return to their original base 
or bases .  . approved ruling in this situation , the batter is not out if 
the infielder permits the ball the drop untouched to the ground , 
except when the infield fly rule applies .  .

we worry that it 'll be over soon , you say that we are not true fans. i am a

fans are true fans. i am excited at what they are doing. so greenwell

non darwin starts) , what are the mariners i think the sox have the best 
record in baseball still , so they lost one , darn .  . 

johnson is a quality pitcher .  . 

and not the only quality mariner pitcher .  . i logged on expecting to see 
at least one note for chris 's no hitter , but nary 
a peep .  . 

so i 'll take this opportunity to note that the red feet are now 11 5 and 
out of town without having scored a run in the last two games 
or even a hit in last night 's gem .  . 

not that we m 's fans can compare our suffering to those of the followers 
of new england 's long running tragedy , but only one winning season in 
history is something of a burden to bear. so we 'll take our joys when 
we can get 'em .  . 

the mariners now have two no hit pitchers on the staff and not 
coincidentally those pitchers beat the red sox in back to back games.

o any of you experts want to analyze ron gant 

sure needs to analyze him. gant is a head case. in his , what , six or 
seven years in the majors , he 's put together a combined total of maybe one 
good season he lacks self confidence , but worse , he does n't really 
understand baseball .  . curiously , he seems to perform best when his job 
is threatened .  . sit him down for a game , and he might get a hit the next 
night. but let him play , and what is he thinking about getting hits , 
driving in runs no , he 's worried if he 's going to get that 30 stolen 
bases , or that 100th career home run. he appears to have no learning curve .  . 
he never figured out how to play third base  ( what a  . he still 
plays the outfield with his legs. he 's lucky he 's so fast , because it enables 
him to outrun his mistakes  ( but , as i suggested earlier in the season , it 
looks to me like he 's slowing down a little bit , or else every 
is watering the infield dirt a little extra) .  . 

gant has had way too much of a chance already. he may get hot again for 
a couple of months , but he 'll always revert to his true level. 

gant 's ml record age 28 this season. 

year g ab ba obp slg hr sb cs 
1987 21 83 .265 .271  . 386 . 2 4 2 
1988 146 563 .259 .317 .439 19 19 10 3rd base  . year 
1989 75 260  . 177 . .237  . 335 . 9 9 6

1991 154  . 251 .  . 338 .  . 496 . 32 34 15 
1992 153 544 .259 .321  . 415 . 17 32 10 

in the majors for parts of 6 seasons , total playing time 
approx 4.5 seasons .  . 

just looking at his hitting record , he 's had 2 seasons of ops 
greater than .800 , which is pretty good for an of. his 
1988 season is pretty decent for a rookie 2b .  . the move to 
third base explains a lot of his 1989. when he returned as an of , 
he began hitting again. and of course , last year he slumped .  . 

but no learning curve he has obviously improved his batting eye 
over the years , as well as his sb cs ratio .  . as to his fielding , 
he was an infielder when he was drafted , a as he came 
up through the braves system , and then the braves put him through 
2 position changes in the space of a year. he 's an adequate of , 
although not great , and at least some of your perception of his 
fielding is colored by watching him learn to play the of at the 
ml level. (i know you 're another long term braves fan ) 

about playing 3b .  .  . imo . , that 's the 2nd most difficult position 
to field , after catcher .  . at ss or 2b , you need more range and 
speed , but at 3b , you 've got to have quick reflexes and have 
a gun for an arm. there are no second chances at 3b , even when 
playing softball ! granted , i 'd still put my best 
overall infielder at ss , but that 's because he gets more 
chances , not because the job is harder. it still amazes me 
that so many teams have tried to convert other position players 
to 3b .  . but maybe that 's because the supply of natural 3b is 
scarce .  . 

finally , gant is a player who puts pressure on himself to 
perform well , and works hard to improve .  . you do n't get 
those amazingly huge arms on that relatively small body without a 
lot of weight work. now , whether he 's been it these 
days may be a valid question , as is the question of whether 
he tries too hard to make something happen during each at bat .  . 
but frankly , if a player is going to not live up to potential , 
i 'd much rather they fail by trying too hard , than by not 
trying hard enough. you might be able to teach relaxation 
to an adult but at that age i do n't believe you can teach 
hustle .  . 

all that said , i do n't think i 'd sign gant to another long term 
contract. he 's 28 now , and i think he 's free agent eligible 
in 2 years , when he 'll be 30. given his career curve and 
limitations , i would n't expect him to last much past 35 
as a ml ballplayer .  . he might surprise me here , but atlanta 's 
got some talent on the farm , and i 'd rather take my chances 
down the road with nieves et al.

my supposition is that if we were to find the same players

indeed , you have struck right at the heart of our disagreement .  . to 
rebut my opinion , you have made an analogy with a game of chance. 
your hypothesis assumes that the players have no impact on 
the selection of the numbers , and hence their ability to win. 

well , that 's certainly true in  . but it has absolutely 
nothing to do with the sport of baseball .  . when you start down 
the wrong path , you finish down the wrong path. 





i repeat .  . i do not think that statistical analysis of prior clutch 
hitting performance is an accurate predictor of future clutch hitting 
performance. 

i do , however , think that analysis of prior clutch hitting performance 
may , for some players , indicate a deficiency in their game that indeed 
will provide a basis for projecting their particular future performance. 
and i think chris sabo is such a player.

the twins defeated the milwaukee brewers 5 4 today to conclude a three game 
with the brew crew. the twins took two of three games in the series , 
with scores as follows 

tuesday april 20th mn 10 
mil 0

wednesday april 21st mil 10 (10) 
mn 8 
lp hartley ( 0 1 ) 

thursday april 22nd mn 5

wp (4 0)

highlight low lights of the series 

jim continues to be the surprise of not only the twins , but of 
the american league as well. going into today 's game , was 3 0 
with a 1.74 era. allowed 2 earned runs in 6 2 3 innings , meaning 
his era will climb slightly .  . , who came to mn via a trade with 
philadelphia which sent david west there , continues to make andy macphail 
look like a true genius .  . 

willie banks has put together two solid starts for the twins , going 6.1 innings 
on monday while on solid twins hitting .  . and banks now 
combine for 6 of the twins eight victories , while erickson are 
0 5. 

wednesday 's game marked the first opposing left handed starting pitcher for the 
twins this year  ( rickey  . the twins off against both him and 
subsequent relief , including a grand slam by kent which pushed the lead 
to 7 3. the twins pitching staff could not hold the lead , though , allowing 
4 walks in the 7th inning , 2 of which scored and coming with bases loaded .  . 
gave up one walk before being relieved , guthrie two walks , and mike 
hartley one walk before the inning was over. this tied the game at 7 7 , and 
the brew crew rocked mike hartley for 3 runs in the top of the tenth to win 
it. 

aguilera continues to be shaky against the brew crew. 6 of 20 career blown 
saves have come against the brew crew , and today 's game was shaky as well. 
coming into the ninth with a 5 2 lead , aguilera gave up a solo hr to vaughn , 
then hits to darryl hamilton and dickie thon before finally retiring the 
side. once again , the tying run made it to second base on  . 
weak hearted twins fans are advised not to watch in the ninth .  . 

general news 

pedro munoz continues to improve as an outfielder , playing in left field on 
tuesday 's game. he continues to bat weakly against right handed pitching , 
though , which has limited his playing time. gene larkin and jt  ( bruett(former 
gopher ) have been playing right field , as both can bat left handed .  . 

the twins begin a three game series with the detroit tigers tomorrow. starting 
pitching is tentatively scheduled as erickson , , banks .  . the detroit 
tigers have had two 20 run games in the last ten days , and should provide 
quite a challenge to the young mn pitching staff. 

the twins have 9 hr 's this year , three each from puckett , , and winfield , 
the third , fourth , and fifth batters , respectively .  . 

brian harper pegged 4 of the first 6 baserunners attempting to steal second 
this year , and shows much improvement in this category. 

jim has three pick offs and one balk this year. some say he 
has the best 1st base move in baseball .  . this move has enabled him to pitch 
out of some tight early jams , and has certainly contributed to his 4 0 
start. watch to see if crews began calling the balk more tightly 
in response to opposing team complaints about his leg kicking behind the 
rubber on the pick off move.

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time  ( x 3 to 5)

as if walked .  . 

this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases 
considerably .  . suppose the pitcher uses up (n 1) of his n pick off 
attempts .  . the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base , 
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it 
right this time. 


if it encouraged the runner to stretch his lead , it would probably 
also result ina greater number of  . i think it would be a

roger clemens (sorry , val ) a couple of years ago. he threw a ball to 
incaviglia which was literally at inky 's neck , and he absolutely 
hammered the crap out of it. after the swing , clemens nonchalantly 
motioned for a new ball he did n't even turn around to look , or 
even get upset. the ball hit the lights in the left field standard , 
some 70 or so feet about the green monster  ( over 100 feet above the 
ground total ! ) 

truly an amazing shot. 

i was at that game , behind home plate next to a scout who was manning the 
radar gun. the 1991 season was winding down and roger did n't have his 
best fastball , out at 88 90  ( in contrast to frank , who went 
as low as 50 with one in the process of striking out phil 
five times on the night) .  . inky 's shot would have gone further 
than any i 've ever seen if it had n't crashed into the lights (not the 
lightstand ) as you say over 100 feet high , roy hobbs like , and bounced 
back onto the field. that had to have been a 525 footer if ,

disclaimer this is for fun. 

in my computerized baseball game , i keep track of a category called 
stolen hits , defined as a play made that an average fielder would not 
make with average effort. using the 1992 defensive averages posted 
by sherri nichols  ( thanks sherri ! ) , i 've figured out some defensive stats 
for the  . hits stolen have been redefined as plays kevin 
bass would not have made. 

ok , i realize that 's unfair .  . kevin 's probably the victim of pitching staff , 
fluke shots , and a monster park factor. but let 's put it this way if we 
replaced every leftfielder in the league with someone with kevin 's 49.4 out 
making ability , how many extra hits would go by 

to try and correlate it to reality a little more , i 've calculated net 
hits stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league 
average fielder would make. by the same method i 've calculated net extra 
bases  ( doubles and triples let by) .  . 

finally , i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution , or 
dcon . basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player. 
i add this number to ops to get dops  ( defense plus slug ) , which 
should represent the player 's total contribution to the team. so do n't 
take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this 
article.

dcon formula  ( nhs ndp ) pa )  ( nhs ndp neb ) ab ) 
why such a bizzare formula basically , it 's designed to be added into the 
ops , with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored . 
the extra outs are factored into obp , while the extra bases removed are 
factored into slg .  . that 's why i used pa and ab as the divisors .  .

nah , let 's reserve rec . sports . idiots . for people who post 
obvious flamebait , like yourself. 

funny. i did n't realize mr. tanner brought up bob v. pam postema 
in the first place. thought it was someone named jacobs .  . 

if someone posts something as controversial (not to mention 
idiotic ) as what austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup , 
someone should challenge the statement. 

why if a statement is truly idiotic , and is universally thought so , 
the challenge is a waste of  . further , challenges that have 
nothing (yes , nothing) to do with baseball are wasting others  time. 

you got a problem with what bob thinks let 's hear it , in 
some sort of categorical manner.  ( actually , i question whether either 
or postema are n't old news at this point , although what i 
have read of postema 's book is interesting . ) . 

there is a school of thought that suggests that silence consent .  . 

i agree this far. 

whereas this idea may not apply to everything in life , it certainly 
should apply to a forum of public discussion .  .  .  . 

sez you. 

if you 've been reading r . s . b .  . lately , you 'll find 
that even elementary school children have had access 
to our postings , albeit in an edited form. it 's making me 
think a little more carefully about some of the things i post. 

that does not come out in what you say down the road , here. 

in conclusion , if someone like austin wants to post his drivel 
in some obscure newsgroup that i do n't read , fine. he 's got the 
right to rant , rave , and all he wants to in the name 
of free speech. but if he in a newsgroup that i read , 
then i will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal 
to his drooling .  . 

yo .  . even elementary school children have had access to our postings , 
albeit in an edited form. you want them to hear you talk like this 
do n't you want people who come to this group to talk baseball to think 
you like to do the same or do you want them to think you 're some 
politically correct demagogue who 's oh so sensitive  ( ho hum . ) . 

plus , you 're here limiting free speech to some obscure newsgroup that 
i do n't read. what bs .  . you got a problem with what jacobs says , what 
thinks , all you have to do is defeat it with better ideas , more 
and better speech. yours is the easy way out. 

as for ever notice how sometimes these guys will say just about 
any darn thing that pops in their heads when a mike is shoved in front of 
them you know that often the best copy for the news is the one that is n't 
pre prepared .  . they know has controversial ideas about women , they 
pop some question about postema .  .  ( an interesting related question would 
be whether the two ever appeared in the same game. off the top of my head , 
i guess no. if my guess is right , popped off about something that 
had nothing to do with him and postema gets a book for it , and he does n't . ) . 

now , of course , you do n't have to read any of this. 
and if you want to cut down on flames , then don't post flamebait ! 
 ( you do n't have to respond to flames , either. saves cyberspace ) 

now , why did n't i think of that ) ) )

if a game can be shortened by half an hour by cutting out warmup 
pitches , outside the batter 's box , commerical time outs and that

in article  ( roger maynard ) writes 

not at all. i am talking about morris winning with toronto last year. you 
are about to launch into a fantasy about the red jays and how toronto 
would have done with viola on their team. viola did n't play for toronto 
last year. morris did. 

the problem with your approach , roger , is that it takes all the 
sense out of the game. by your line of reasoning , if a guy hits into a 
double play with one out and the bases loaded , there 's no point in saying 
that that was a bad thing to do  ( if his team won anyway) or speculating 
on what might have happened if things had gone otherwise , so the double 
play is merely an event that happened in the course of a game that was 
eventually won or lost for unknown reasons. after all , any speculation 
involves constructing a fantasy about what would have happened but did n't .  . 

roger , do you ever worry that the next pencil you drop will fall to the 
ceiling instead or are you willing to consider empirical evidence 

teams go to the post season when they win more games than anybody else 
in their division .  . if they do n't make the post season , they do n't win the 
series. will you agree that winning a division is a useful intermediate 
goal in ring collecting 

if so , you must agree that winning games is a useful intermediate goal 
towards winning the division , and our disagreements come when we consider 
how to win games. 

in your viewpoint as expressed , winning games happens for reasons that 
cannot be analyzed .  . while many of us are thinking things like base 
runners are good , outs are bad , and therefore walks are better than 
double plays with the bases loaded , you are thinking things like 
it 's a team game , so perhaps the double play will cause some mysterious 
team dynamics that will cause the team to win today . 

the result is that it becomes impossible to say anything about individual 
players. perhaps atlanta would have won the series with me playing left 
field. after all , perhaps in some way my knowledge and personality would 
have helped the team more than my complete lack of skill would have hurt 
it. therefore , i could be an extremely valuable player. did dave winfield 
have anything to do with the jays  victory probably , but how do you know 
if you replace him with andres galarraga , perhaps the jays would have won , 
perhaps they would have lost , perhaps they would have defected to alpha 
centauri  ( bearing in mind that the flying saucers would not have landed 
in mid season had winfield been for  . 

was babe ruth a good player he played on some ws winning teams , but did 
he have anything to do with their success 

it is generally accepted that ernie banks was a good baseball player , and 
jarvis brown and dan were n't .  . it seems to me that anybody who 
would deny this needs to provide the proof. 

now , we have observed things about baseball over the years , both empirically 
and by looking at the rulebook .  . it is necessary to score more runs than 
one 's opponent to win the game , so it would seem important to score runs 
and to prevent one 's opponent from scoring .  . runs are scored while a team 
is batting , and an inning ends after the third out , so it would seem that 
making outs is bad while hitting home runs is good. players have tendencies 
to hit or pitch at certain levels , and these are usually somewhat consistent 
from year to year. 

we do use these statistics to predict winners , and so do you. to make 
some flat predictions barry bonds will have a higher obp slg than 
gene larkin this year. the braves will finish ahead of the rockies 
in the standings .  . the tigers will score more runs than the royals , but 
will also give up more. i would be astonished if any of these turned 
out to be false , and , i suspect , so would you. as a matter of fact , i 
am pretty sure i can predict all the division winners this year , given 
3 4 guesses per division , and this is certainly better than random 
chance  ( and almost statistically  . 

if you will admit that the rockies and mariners are unlikely to meet in 
the world series , you must admit that there is some sort of way to measure 
, however fuzzy .  . 

it is impossible for all other things to be equal so your fantasy is totally 
meaningless .  . 

so how about real life person a a service station with two people 
in it , using a .38 automatic pistol , gets 42 , and is convicted and sentenced 
for three years. person b , with a similar criminal record , a service 
station with two people in it , using a .38 revolver , gets 42 , and is 
convicted .  . since they used two different types of handgun , are comparisons 
totally meaningless 

say you drop a pencil to see if the gravity still works  ( my cats are always 
testing this they do n't trust me to pay the gravity bill on time) .  . you 
have never dropped a pencil at that exact time of the century before , so 
all previous evidence is meaningless or would you be surprised if it flew 
out the window instead of hitting the desk

in article ,  ( gary built like villanueva huckabay ) writes 
you want to speed up ballgames 

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current 
rule is too lenient ) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more 
than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball , 
and restart the clock. 

i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried 
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work. i do n't remember 
why they said that it did not work. anyone remember this 

jody on wip in phil .  . has been saying that a pitch clock was 
inevitable .  . how would a pitch clock work on throws to first 

another pair of suggestions 
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe 
no matter what the pitcher does. 

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time  ( x 3 to 5) 
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base 
as if walked .  . 

the no balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage .  . the base walk allows 
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base. 

baseball games take about 2 51 in the nl , and just a shade under 3 hours 
in the al. that 's just too damn long. i do n't like to play in 3 hour 
games , much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep , and 
if i'm watching on tv , i 'll channel surf between pitches , catching 
versions of mr. ed , leave it to beaver , and those wacky 
on nick at nite .  . 

i too , find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between 
each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his .

in article  ( joe m leonard ) writes 

before folks jump on me , let me ask the net would the jays 
have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris  ( given 
his run support) how about an average ml pitcher i ca n't believe 
that morris  performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive 
impact on the jays performance ... 

i know it 's very trendy nowadays to dump on morris , but let 's give credit 
where credit is due .  . 

it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris .  . 

well , when you say , without morris , you have to mention an assumed 
replacement .  . if the alternative to morris was letting gaston 
soft toss the ball to the opposition every 5 days , then 
of course the blue jays would n't have won without morris .  . if the 
alternative was replacement level , then i think it would 've been very 
close , and yes , morris might 've made the difference. if the alternative 
was frank viola , the blue jays probably would have won more easily with 
viola .  . 

last year , when the team went 13 15 for the month of august , and all the 
other starters were being shelled , and milwaukee was making a charge , 
morris went 5 1 with a pretty good era (i ca n't remember exactly) .  . 

yes. you can make the argument that the his presence prevented 
the team from collapsing in august .  . 

also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day. if he did n't help us win the al east , forget 
about the and the world series. 

those innings were probably helpful. 

his run support was high (5 . 98 . runs) but so was 's (5 . 90 . runs) 
and he won only 12 games. i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 
6 5 and 8 6 ballgames , but this is to his credit. he pitched only as good 
as he needed to be. when he was up 6 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise 
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get out 
(i hate this expression ! ) .  . an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. but morris , being a 
veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in 
baseball .  . by saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra 
(i hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line. 

well , i think is complete bs .  . what happened most of the time is that 
morris fell behind , and the team came back and rescued him. mostly , 
this is because he 's a lousy 1st inning pitcher , and much better 
the rest of the way. that the team can climb out of 4 0 , 5 0 holes 
consistently and win them 6 5 is not to morris  credit it 's to the 
team 's credit. 

furthermore , while morris did exceed the w l percentage that would 
be projected from his runs allowed and run support , he has n't done 
this in previous years. in fact , his w l record in 1991 is a lot 
worse than what it projects to be with run support and runs allowed. 
do you think he just came up with this ability in 1992. 

look at the 2 postseason games he pitched decently in. typical 
morris games. morris gets behind team him. he 's not 
responsible for that rescue .  . and in both those games , the team 
just did n't rescue him enough. jack morris pitched as well as he did 
during much of the season in those 2 games the offense just did n't 
earn him a victory .  . 

btw , i think he should be put in the bullpen it would be embarrassing a 
veteran pitcher which would never do , but his era is 17 , how much more 
can he be embarrassed 

morris is one of those guys who will when he ca n't start 
anymore he 's too bad a first inning pitcher to serve in the bullpen .  .

hey folks , 

saw the giants play ball at the  stick saturday , april 17. it was the game 
where broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two out , 
two run homer to right to win it. (it was n't the game where the fans 
threw the give away onto the field in response to the homer 
too bad , huh ) 

well , the  stick is still cold. the saturday game ended at 5 45pm , and it 
was cold then. i ca n't imagine night games in april at the  . the 
wind kicked up a little , too , and i got this idea. 

at most games , there 's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on 
the field a lot of the time. i propose a kid 's clean up corps composed 
mainly of 10 12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run 
out on the field in the fifth inning  ( when the guy in the toro 
the infield ) and grab the trash .  . 

it might not be glamorous , but at that age i probably would have given 
anything to be on the field with the ballplayers .  . everybody wins here ! 

think

i was at opening day. the stadium and new owners were great ! ! ! i pick

the giants have won 8 of their last 10 games behind some solid pitching 
 ( excluding that 13 12 win against  . if they can stay around first 
place after say the first 50 games , i think they 've got a legitimate chance 
at winning the pennant  ( and maybe even more than that) .  . 

do n't you remember that the giants were in 1st place as late as 
june last year then their pitching collapsed .  .  .  .  . their problem 
is they have  ( optimistically ) only 2 3 good starting pitchers 
 ( swift , , and the  ( bowler(ca n't remember his name ) the 
other starters are extremely unreliable and often get blasted 
before 4 innings .  .  .  . that means the already shallow bullpen gets 
over worked. this means after a few months , the bullpen collapses 
and their post all star record tends to be much worst than 
their pre all star record. 

the bowler is john burkett , who went to 4 0 last night. he is 
a bargain pickup on my team , i got him at a minimum of 5. 

just a thought .  .  .  . does someone have the won lost pre post 
allstar records for the giants the last few seasons i bet 
their records tends to be worst and worst as the season goes on. 

this is not really true. excluding last season , the giants 
has been a better 2nd half team. in 1991 , they had a hot august 
to pull to within a few games of the braves and dodgers before 
fading in september .  . 
the giants may go back to earth , but not as fast as last 
season for two reasons 
(1) barry bonds 
(2) roger craig is no longer the manager. dusty can manage 
his pitching staffs much better than craig .  .

but it is subject to all kinds of bias , and is almost completely 
useless 
for first basemen .  . from the raw stats , there is no way to tell 
which of 
a first baseman 's putouts were made on throws from other fielders , 
and 
which were made on his own plays likewise , you ca n't tell whether 
a 
double play was 6 4 3 or 3 6 3. fielding runs thus gives a first 
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays , only for assists and 
errors. 

but putouts is biased in yet another way. range is 
not the only thing that makes a good firstbaseman .  . the ability 
to field all sorts of balls thrown to him digging some out of the 
dirt , stretching for others , and so forth is important. thus , 
putouts do provide some information. maybe what we need is a 
comparision of how many balls were thrown to the area of the 
first baseman vs. how many he actually got.

doubt that even you agree with it. 

sheesh ! i agree with you here , dave .  . anyone for starting

no , but i am for starting rec . sports . idiots . for people who respond to obvious

nah , let 's reserve rec . sports . idiots . for people who post 
obvious flamebait , like yourself. 

if someone posts something as controversial (not to mention 
idiotic ) as what austin posted in a widely accessed newsgroup , 
someone should challenge the statement. there is a school 
of thought that suggests that silence consent .  . whereas 
this idea may not apply to everything in life , it certainly 
should apply to a forum of public discussion , which r . s . b .  . 
is. 

if you 've been reading r . s . b .  . lately , you 'll find 
that even elementary school children have had access 
to our postings , in an edited form. it 's making me 
think a little more carefully about some of the things i post. 

in conclusion , if someone like austin wants to post his drivel 
in some obscure newsgroup that i do n't read , fine. he 's got the 
right to rant , rave , and all he wants to in the name 
of free speech. but if he in a newsgroup that i read , 
then i will support the right of anyone to provide rebuttal 
to his drooling .  . 

now , of course , you do n't have to read any of this. 
and if you want to cut down on flames , then 




don't post flamebait !

my father is a huge tiger fan , and i am a loyal blue jay fan , who endured the collapse of 87 , the heartbreak of 85 .  . 

i do n't have the stat book , so let 's throw them out. 

first of all , morris in his heyday (81 88) vs clemens (86 present) .  . 

how many cy does morris have 

how many cy does clemens have 

and such .  .  .  . fenway average pitchers park. detroit , hugh hitters 
paradise .  . 

morris is a great team pitcher , sort of in the doug mold .  . 
if morris 's team needs a well pitched game , as in minn in 91 , morris 
snaps the ball , and throw for ks .  . otherwise , he just tries to get people out. 

as for clemens , in the elias stat book of 1992 , i believe 
that clemens has the best lifetime record for his team , as compared to 
when he does n't pitch .  . how bad would the red sox have been last year 
without him can you say 92 phillies 

i believe clemens is the better pitcher because of more power , and hsi 
great tenacity .  . morris is among the pitchers i ve ever seen , 
but clemens is in a class with seaver , carlton , etc.

before folks jump on me , let me ask the net would the jays 
have won the al with a good pitcher from aaa in place of morris  ( given 
his run support) how about an average ml pitcher i ca n't believe 
that morris  performance in the playoffs and series had a large positive 
impact on the jays performance ... 
i know it 's very trendy nowadays to dump on morris , but let 's give credit 
where credit is due .  . 
it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris .  . 
last year , when the team went 13 15 for the month of august , and all the 
other starters were being shelled , and milwaukee was making a charge , 
morris went 5 1 with a pretty good era (i ca n't remember exactly) .  . 
also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day. if he did n't help us win the al east , forget 
about the and the world series. 

a guy who threw 240 innings with about .6 run lower era would have saved the 
bullpen even more. say , somebody like frank viola  ( 238  . 

his run support was high (5 . 98 . runs) but so was 's (5 . 90 . runs) 
and he won only 12 games. i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 
6 5 and 8 6 ballgames , but this is to his credit. he pitched only as good 
as he needed to be. when he was up 6 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise 
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get out 
(i hate this expression ! ) .  . an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. but morris , being a 
veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in 
baseball .  . by saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra 
(i hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line.

wiggins , alan 

i believe he was well out of baseball by the time he died. 

but that 's besides the point. i'm sure people would feel slightly 
sympathetic for rickey if he were killed. but , they would also be 
criticizing him a lot more for his actions .  . 

example 

how about jose canseco he gets a couple of speeding tickets , and all 
of the sudden his attitude is awful. what the hell do speeding tickets 
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway so why do sportswriters 
talk about it all the time. 

uh , he also has been charged with chasing his wife in a car , and smashing it 
into a tree , as well as carrying a loaded firearm in his car. and the 
speeding reported was over 100 mph reckless driving. 

or brian hunter and keith mitchell both of whom had problems 
towards the end of last year.  ( two years ago ) it was cited as a sign 
of their immaturity , etc. 

actually , i had n't heard about this thanks. 

meanwhile , dykstra almost killed both himself and , and i did n't 
read any complaining about that. they may have talked 
about how bad it was for the phillies , but i never read anywhere 
criticism of dykstra 's character  ( or 's intelligence , for that 
matter) based on this incident .  . 

i do n't know what you were reading or watching , but i sure saw a lot about 
that , and about dykstra 's poker games. most of the writing was along the lines 
of how incredibly stupid and selfish it was , and how he 'd hurt the team by 
wracking himself and the catcher up , etc. espn raised questions about his 
judgement , etc. the print media here in the sf area questioned why disciplinary 
action would n't be taken against dykstra , and one article pointed out that if 
lenny wanted to kill himself , there were ways that would n't endanger other 
people 's lives. then there was dykstra himself being quoted on how stupid it 
was , etc.

another pair of suggestions 
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe 
no matter what the pitcher does. 

quite honestly , this one is ridiculous. consider the following 
scenario runner on third .  . as the pitcher starts to throw home , the 
runner takes off for home and the batter squares around to bunt for 
the suicide squeeze .  . the pitcher , seeing this , does not throw home , 
but stops in mid action and puts the runner in a run down. it is the 
balk rule that prevents this from happening. 

believe it or not , this actually happened to me once in an oba

did anyone happen to see peter gammons on espn last night he addressed 
this exact issue , and dismissed it rather quickly. according to gammons , 
advanced scouts are reporting that morris  fastball and slider still have 
the same zip and that his problems this year are due to his sudden inability 
to keep the ball hidden during his release. guzman and have 
gone through similar stretches that have been cleared up succinctly by a 
little work with the pitching coach .  . gammons looks to see morris back in 
top form within the month. 

i , on the other hand , still have my doubts .  . morris  era last year was 
rather high for a pitcher who won 20 games. his showing in the series was 
not surprising .  . although i'm not convinced that he 's washed up , i have my 
doubts as to whether or not he can ever regain the form he had for the 
twins in '91 .  .

i agree with nick .  . what 's the big deal about long games if you want 
to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes , 
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves. 

first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless 
you include watching the grass grow as baseball .  . the games 
are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking 
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers 
and pitching coaches .  . 


until six or seven years ago i was an enthusiastic fan of nfl football. 
last year i hardly watched a game. what turned me off were the 
incessant to the continuity of the game. a team scores .  . 
2.5 minutes of commercials .  .  . 1.5 minutes of commercials .  . 
three downs and a punt .  . 2 minutes of commercials .  . ! 

earlier in this thread i commented on larussa and the a 's , whom i 
believe slow play. i do n't mind the cat and mouse 
game with rickey on first in fact , i rather enjoy it. similarly 
i would enjoy the battle with or lofton or polonia on first. what 
i object to is when such games are played with on first , 
or when the game is a blowout .  . i do n't mind when the pitcher steps off 
the mound to gather his thoughts in a crucial situation , or when a hitter 
steps out of the box to regain his concentration .  . what i object to 
is when hitters and pitchers take such breaks at every opportunity. 
when a game is exciting , these little delays serve as tension builders 
and for me enhance the value of the experience of the game. when the 
delays happen with regularity , they become , just like the 
commercial breaks in football. 

i understand the nfl imposed a number of rule changes to speed up 
the games , basically putting an onus on the officiating staff to move 
the markers and the ball to the spots faster. that did not address 
the problem of the continuity of the game. it may have the 
sponsors and the networks , but i would be amazed if it did anything 
to enhance the experience of the fans. 

similary , while some 3 hour baseball games bore me to tears , those are the 
ones where there is no continuity and the players are taking 
long periods to get ready for each pitch .  . i doubt if anyone watching 
the braves giants game cared about gant stepping out. i doubt if anyone 
watching that game would have found that pause to be anything but an 
opportunity to have their complete attention claimed by the drama that 
was present. i would be totally opposed to any effort that would 
eliminate that aspect of baseball .  . 

on the other hand , i wish baseball had a commissioner that was powerful 
enough to sit down with alderson larussa duncan and explain that they 
are actually hurting the product of baseball by dragging their games 
out the way that they do. i sure would n't mind a little arm twisting 
there.

that does not mean they the title america 's team 
the only reason they are considered america 's team is because of ted 
turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation .  . 

right. i 've watched enough braves' games to know a great deal

actually , i notice a lot of anti toronto sentiment here in the

good 30 seconds this morning wondering who the hell it was. would n't 
it make more sense to use 

i 've seen it as also. 

blame the associated press. after the official scorer balances the 
official score card , they copy it and give it to several people. 
one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up  ( using a 
template on a laptop ) and transmit it to the ap offices in new york 
 ( rockefeller center) via the telephone .  . the box scores are not checked 
and just over ap 's news delivery services. if there are 
corrections , those are issued later. it is the person sitting in front 
of a laptop at shea  ( or whereever ) whose fault that is. note the ap 
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in 
most newspapers being the first one 

not totally true. for the past year or two , the ap has been getting box 
scores from stats , inc. the ap representative in the press box is actually 
a stats reporter ( 25 dollars a game , but free parking .  . and anybody can 
do it . ) . the box is downloaded to stats in chicago , some quick error 
checking is done , and then stats sends it to the ap .  . i'm not sure where 
the come in hear. i do n't think it is at stats 's .  . it may 
just be a space correction by the ap sports editor that day. 

while i'm mentioning stats reporters , they are always looking for new 
people. especially if you live in cleveland or pittsburgh , you 're road 
to getting into the press box may be real short. for more info , call 
stats (708) 676 , and ask about the reporter network. it 's a fun 
way to get paid for watching baseball games. 

end of public service announcement .  . 


last week they were in denver .  . maybe the ap person in denver did this

for the last couple of years , the braves have been fostering a program to reach to the latin american audience. this has included licensing spanish fan magazines , encouraging spanish co broadcasts , and marketing programs directed at the latin american community. one of the biggest heros to the latin american audience has been francisco (a fact of which he was slightly embarrassed ! ) .  . 

one funny story is that during spring training , the braves played a game in mexico .  . this game was broadcast back to atlanta in spanish .  . it took the broadcasters a few innings to get a going because they had to keep changing their location. seems it took a while to find a place where they could get a clear signal on their cellular phones through which they were calling the game !

consider a night game starting at 7 05 pm est. (it was 7 35 last year , 
but cleveland showed what i thought was good sense in pushing it back . ) . 
i go , and i'm into it until 11 pm minimum. extra innings could put me 
well past midnight .  . even without extra innings , if the score is beyond 
2 1 i ca n't see my family that night at all. if the next day is a , 
i may have to bag that as well. further , the later the game goes , the 
colder it gets on the shore of lake erie .  . 

all that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game. if 
you say you do n't care about whether the game is sped up , you are 
saying you do n't care where the time goes , and that the game is for people 
who do n't have families and do n't have to get up for work the next day.

i do n't think it was that obvious at the time that viola was better. 
morris and viola had comparable k ip ratios in 1991. viola was coming 
off an injury , whereas morris was healthy. 

at the time i did n't really want the sox to sign either. i was more 
than a little worried about viola 's elbow .  . 

but you surely remember my shout of relief when , after a week of 
rumors that morris was coming to the red sox , they ended up with viola 
instead. 

now i'm even happier. viola seems to have rebounded nicely. 

also , morris was willing to sign for only two years. 
the jays do n't like to sign pitchers to long term contracts , which i think 
is a sensible policy. 

how long did viola sign for. three years i generally agree with 
their policy of avoiding long term contracts for pitchers .  . but i 
think they enforce it rather too strictly .  . these days the premier 
pitchers all sign three or four year deals .  . which leaves the jays 
with morris and stewart .  . if the jays want to compete for top free 
agent pitchers , they will have to accept greater risks .  .

subject yankee thoughts 
organization clam associates , cambridge , ma

yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are 
finally moving in the right direction. they should finish 
over .500 this year and maybe even be in the race 
in august .  . however , i would take back a few moves 

1. the jim abbott trade. 
i think abbott is not only an inspirational person , but a 
great pitcher also. he could win the cy young this year , 
but he wo n't because the right side of the yanks infield 
is n't good enough. so why was this not a good trade 
jt snow. how many rookies have been able to step in and 
immediately have the impact that he has had so far on 
the angels i know it 's early , but if you 've seen this kid 
hit , field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be 
a tremendous player. the yanks should have kept him. what 
about mattingly , you ask well it 's great that the yanks 
have taken care of him and remained loyal , but he 's 10 years 
older than snow and just does n't have the same bat speed as 
before his back injury .  . it 's a shame , but as a yankee fan 
who wants to see the best yankee team , i 'd take 
snow over mattingly at first. the yanks also gave up two 
promising with snow for abbott .  . besides , with 
domingo jean , brien taylor , , militello , and sterling 
hitchcock , they are just loaded with  . i know 
only 26 , but this was too much to give up. i believe george 
forced this trade because he believes  ( and he 's right ) that 
abbott will be a big hit in ny .  . however , i 'd like to see the 
yankees build a baseball team , not an amusement show. 

2. wade boggs .  . 
i live in boston and like wade a lot. but , his career is 
winding down and i would rather see the yanks start to develop 
a long term solution (i . e .  . hensley , russ davis , ) .  . 
besides , wade just does n't have any range. what a shame about 
charlie hayes , huh 

3. spike owen .  . 
see wade boggs .  . i 'd much rather see them develop dave silvestri 
or whoever .  . wade and spike next to each other in the infield is 
going to raise the yankee staff era 1 2 point. and these guys 
are on the down sides of their careers .  . 

4. danny tartabull .  . 
yes he 's put up some tremendous numbers and it 's nice to think 
about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year. but he 
never is. we should expect 120 games max out of him. meanwhile , 
gerald williams is playing at columbus and paul o'neil is playing 
left field ! i believe o'neil led nl outfielders in assists 
last year and tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder .  . 

what i'm basically getting at is the yanks are moving in the right 
direction but are not ready to win a this year. they should 
(at the gm level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series. this 
means getting the younger players experience in the majors now so they 
will be ready in a year or two. 

i'm afraid that all this stuff of george steinbrenner .  . 
certainly , the boggs deal was all george .  . it looks like george is 
planning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world 
series now. the veterans are always available and can be added at any 
time  ( like boston did this year) .  . develop the young players first , 
then add the one or two veterans  ( or in the yankees case , just keep 
them) .  . let 's all us yankee fans hope that george does n't dismantle 
the terrific job stick and company have done building the yankee 
organization back into one of respect. i'm really afraid that he will 
trade whoever it takes to patch holes today  ( relief pitching for 
example) .  . george must realize that the yankees rebuilding process is 
still one or two years away. have patience george and we will all 
enjoy the future. fire bucky and trade the kids and it 's baseball 
hell for all loyal yankee fans for a long time !

to the game on radio and listening to dave call the game was a 
real treat  ( as long as they keep ron fairly quite , i doubt if anyone is 
better than but that fairly guy is really annoying me) .  . 

but , i guess if clemens or viola had been pitching , it would have 
been a different story ) 

two shutouts in two nights against the hottest , best hitting team in 
major league baseball .... pretty impressive in any league. 

man , if johnson , and hanson keep going the mariners could be a 
really interesting team to follow this year. also , john cummings  ( rookie ) 
has had three solid with no support. if fleming comes back 
this may be the best starting staff in the american league this year 
 ( relief is another story , though  . 

too cool. the first no hitter that i have been able to follow from 
start to end. and again , i think will win some kind of award

garbled by me) , an official historian for the cia .  . she has won an 
for research on moe berg for a tv documentary (which i know from nothing 
but which sounds good) .  . she said that among other things , berg was the 
principal spy for the oss  ( cia 's wwii precursor ) spying on axis atomic 
programs , because of his physics background and language skills. she said 
that during the war he met with heisenberg in switzerland , and had 
instructions to shoot heisenberg if the germans were close to us in bomb 
research  ( he concluded they were two years behind , and did n't shoot him) .  . 
(i have heard elsewhere that heisenberg deliberately misled the nazi bomb 
program , but i do n't know how reliable this is . ) . unfortunately , npr did n't 
mention any kind of a book she 's writing i 'd certainly buy it. 

 ( in case you 're wondering about baseball relevance , berg was a longtime 
mlb backup catcher .  . he was a member of an mlb all star team that toured 
japan in 1934 , presumably not because of his baseball prowess but because 
he was one of the few americans , much less mlb players , who spoke japanese .  . 
photos he took of tokyo on that trip were later used to plan bombing raids ,

however , what is with this policy of trying to speed up the games. 
you are the first person ( non ) i have seen endorse this policy. 
i have no problem with the length of games at all and am tired of the 
espn crowd ( and other announcers ) bitching about it. i have never 
been in a ballpark filled with people looking at their watches and 
shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a ticket , i do n't mind 
a game that last more than 2 10. i really do n't understand it. 

i agree with nick .  . what 's the big deal about long games if you want 
to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes , 
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves. 

i suspect that a lot of the complaining about long games , especially when 
it 's coming from tv people , has to something to do with advertising .  . 
probably time wasted in the middle of an inning , say by a batter 
stepping out of the box to fiddle with his gloves , or by a pitcher 
walking around behind the mound trying to collect his thoughts , could 
otherwise be sold as advertising time.

some evidence that is not working 

take a look at the standings .  . it 's real easy to get so focussed on 
and forget that the giants happen to be in first place. if it 's 
working , you do n't screw it up by changing things , just because you think it 
ought to be different. 

some folks like to argue about theoretical details. i prefer to watch teams 
win. when the giants slip to third , then we can talk about how to re arrange 
the batting order. until then , i think it 's stupid to focus on what 's wrong , 
for the simple fact that it's working as it is. 

p.s. does the mailing list maintainer think that will clark is the best 
first baseman in the majors and that matt williams is a better power hitter 
than any other ballplayer 

in the majors i do n't follow al , so i wo n't comment on majors . in the nl , 
if i had my choice of any 1b in the league for my team , it 'd be clark , and 
i 'd hit him third .  .  ( my fantasy team has both grace and murray on it , because 
i 've never been able to get clark .  . i 'd take any of the three without 
hesitation in real life , but i think clark is it) .  . 

williams not even close. i much prefer his defense , but when he is n't 
it , matt has a good , solid swing and some real punch .  . if he drops 
to .230 , then he wanders out of cleanup , but according to the latest 
baseball weekly , he 's hitting .275 , and in the last week , hitting  . 296 .  . 
that 's not exactly chopped liver .  . 

mostly , though , the giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that 
continues , it 's rather silly to second guess their strategy .  . but evidently , 
some folks would rather be right than be first.

and it has worked again. pena went 3 for 3 last night against colorado .  . 


without opening this up for a flame war , i would like to 
question the notion that sitting a rested player down has any real 
effect on his long term performance. sure , if a man is tired and needs 
real rest , then taking a break might be a constructive act. perhaps if 
a man is mentally strained , then sitting him down might help to the 
extent that that helps him relax. but i would like to suggest that 
in the long run , players do slump , and is probably irrelevant .  .

during spring training i made a similarly looking comment 
about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying .  . no such

they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance , 
given their comments. i'm still licking the wounds , but i do have 
a rebuttal planned. )  ( gotta do my homework , as they say) 

some deletions 
rather they showed , quite convincingly , that 
past clutch performance has never been able to predict future 
clutch performance. 

i'm sure you are convinced , dave .  . apparently so is tony perez .  . 
i , however , am not. 


i believe at the time of the sabo plate appearance that juan samuel 
was on the bench available for pinch hit duty .  . over the past four 
seasons 

non clutch clutch 
ab h ba ab h ba 

sabo 452  . 294 . 259 59  . 228 . 
samuel 383 .245 278 83  . 299 . 

i do not claim that this is a complete statistical analysis that 
proves the existence of clutch hitting , or compelling testimony that 
samuel would have gotten a base hit. i'm sure there is something wrong 
with the sample size , or that the basic assumption that clutch 
performance is random invalidates any conclusions from this limited 
application. or something or other. i do n't pretend to understand 
statistical analysis. 


well , we agree on the last part. ) one of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player 's performance on it 
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. a 
player 's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. 
a player 's ability to walk or infielder 's defensive average are correlated 
better. that is to say , given their past performance in those statistics 
we can have a pretty good handle on how they 'll do next year. put in 
some simple information about aging and you can do even better. one of 
the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall 
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero .  . 
adding to the sample size does n't seem to help much. as a counterexample to 
what you showed , consider the following two players from 1984 1987 

non clutch clutch 
ab h ba ab h ba 

maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78  . 307 . 
lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 

if you had had these two players in 1988 , by your logic , in those clutch 
situations , you 'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye. well , in 
1988 , maldonado hit .267 in non clutch and .190 in clutch , while lemon 
hit .254 in non clutch and .313 in clutch . before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data , there were 96 players who had 25 clutch 
at bats every year from 1984 1988  ( according to  . as a simple 
measure of clutchness , let 's just look at clutch ba non clutch ba .  . if you use 
'84 '87 to predict '88 for those 96 players , you 'd find that 27 of the 
96 were below league average in that measure both in '84 87 and in '88 , 
26 were above league average in both periods and the other 43 were 
above in one and below in the other. if you were just flipping coins , 
you 'd expect to get 24 above below in both and 48 that switched .  . the 
difference between the observed results and the coin flip experiment 
is not significant .  . 

btw , players  overall batting average from '84 '87 with 
'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59 , which is significant at 
something better than the 99.9 confidence level. their 
 ( clutch non clutch ba ) for the same period gives a correlation of 
0 . 088 . , significant at no level of any interest. 



everyone would agree (i hope) that a grand 
slam in the bottom of the ninth when your team is down by three 
is a very clutch hit. there is just no way to predict who is more 
likely to get the clutch hit based on past performance  ( hitting in 
clutch  . 


if you say so , dave .  . no way. 


actually , it 's technically incorrect to say that we ca n't predict future 
clutch performance. it 's more correct to say that we ca n't predict 
future clutch performance with any skill.

the original poster wanted to know how the big cat looked .  . i was also at 
the saturday game in montreal  ( apr 17) that rockies won 9 1. i have n't 
paid much attention to since he left the expos but his stance 
seemed to be much different. he stands more erect and very open , with his 
left foot pointing to 3rd base. i'm wondering if this is a recent change 
in stance for him andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter .  . he could 
always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. if this is indeed a new 
stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily 

yes , the stance is new. don baylor was his batting coach at st. louis last 
year , and now , as his manager , is continuing to work with him. maybe andres 
has a weak left eye and the open stance gives him a better look at the 
ball. or maybe it is simply improving his mechanics i dunno. but the 
change seems to have enabled him to hit the ball as well as 5 years ago. his 
has not changed.

alright , that 's enough. i 've suffered with all kinds of insults  ( as 
typical for the net) , but give me a break. galarraga is currently 
batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he is n't drawing 
enough walks .  . what would he have to do to please you guys , bat 1.000 
you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team . 

fine , are you willing to bet that he will bat .400 the rest of the way 

the point is that he has hurt the rockies so far it 's that he will hurt 
them , eventually. just as much as he hurt the expos and the cardinals the 
past couple seasons .  . 

if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches 
and he starts making lots of outs  ( as someone speculated might happen) , 
then i would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches .  . my comment 

it has happened for the past 3 seasons where have you been 

that he is n't paid to walk does n't mean that he should have a license 
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it 's more along the lines of he 's 
batting .400 and leading the league in rbi 's so what bloody difference 
does it make if he is n't drawing a lot of walks sheesh .  . 

we 'll see come september .  . (i have an outstanding bet with someone that 
galarraga 's obp will be less than .300 on june 1 . ) .

huckabay 's counting frames for bat speed discussion ommited .  .  .  . 


well , it 's just studying tape , frame by frame. that 's all. the biggest 
thing that you notice , however , is how the strike zone has 
become .  . death to the umpires  union ! the plate is 17 ( 1 ) across , 
not 23 ! call the high strikes strikes , and quit calling pitches 3 
outside strikes they 're balls ! 


speaking of this 23 wide strike zone .  .  .  .  . 

i 'd sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that 
an overview shot of home plate is available. cbs had this during the 
ws , or did i just dream it. 

these pictures would be a feedback device for the umpires so that they can 
see just how terrible  ( or not) there calls were. tapes could be sent to 
the league as evidence of bad ball strike  . tapes are available 
as evidence of bad out safe calls on the bases .  . 

i guess that nobody noticed that the calls during the world series  ( and , in 
fact all year) have been pretty much consistently correct. remember the rule 
says it 's a strike if any part of the ball passes through the strike zone. 

i would certainly agree that high strikes are not called  ( who could argue 
this point ) but all in all i think in and out is called pretty well.

in article  ( mark singer ) writes 

actually , i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem. 
it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball 
in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of 
bell curve .  . (the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting 
vs. non clutch the y axis being the number of players . ) . certainly 
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell .  . 

right. most definitely .  . 

my supposition is that if we were to find the same players 
consistently  ( year after year) at one end of the bell or the other , 
then we might be able to make some reasonable conclusions about 
those players  ( as opposed to all baseball players) .  . 

this may be the root of the confusion .  .  .  . 

please consider the following hypothetical with an open mind. note 
that i am not (yet) saying that it has anything to do with the 
question at hand. 

suppose we have a simplified game. you pick a number from 1 10 
and win if that number is drawn .  . suppose we have a large population 
of people who play this game every week. 

in the first year of the game , approximately 1 4 of the population 
will win 7 or more times. 

in the second year of the game , 1 4 of those 7 time winners will again 
be 7 time winners. 

in the third year of the game , 1 4 of those who won 7 or more times in 
each of the first two years will win 7 again. 

suppose i started with 1024 people in my population .  . after three 
years , i have 32 people who have consistently , in each of the last 
three years , won 140 or more the number of times expected. 

do we expect them to be big winners in the fourth year of the game 
no. because we know there is no skill involved. nothing about these 
consistent winners can influence their chances of winning. but 
suppose we do n't know whether or not there is a chance that skill 
might be involved. perhaps some of the people in our population are 
psychic , or something. how would we test this hypothesis 

we can look for correlations in the population .  . now most of the 
population will show zero correlation .  . but our psychics should show a 
high positive correlation  ( even if they are n't very good psychics , 
they should still manage to win 7 or more times most years) .  . net 
result a small positive correlation over the entire population .  . 

this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having 
with others on this topic. must any conclusion based on statistical 
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before 
it has any validity is it impossible  ( or irrational ) to apply 
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base 

well , zero correlation is zero correlation .  . you mention that sabo has 
hit poorly in the clutch over the last  ( 3 ) years. but if we look at 
the past , we find that clutch patterns are just as likely to reverse 
as they are to remain consistent .  . the length of the streak does n't 
seem to make a difference to the probability that the player will be 
clutch or choke the next year. is there any reason to expect this 
streak to be different from past streaks 

now if it were true that 75 of all three year streaks remained true 
to form , then we might have something useful. but then we would n't 
have zero correlation .  . instead we have 50 of all three year streaks 
remain true to form , and 50 of all three year streaks reverse . you 
look at those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more 
likely to choke this year . but it would be equally valid to look at 
those numbers and say three year choke streak implies more likely to 
be clutch this year , since the probabilities are split 50 50 each 
way. 

i completely accept that reasoning .  . again , what if we were to find 
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent 
basis 

then we would have something useful. and we would also have a 
positive correlation .  . but for every individual that exhibits such a 
pattern and holds true , there is another who exhibits such a pattern 
and then  .

lines 22 

i like the clark williams bonds order. 
pitchers can only walk clark with 2 outs  ( unlike last year) .  . 

williams is getting better pitches to hit with bonds looming 
in the on deck circle .  . since matt has a terrible batting eye , 
this helps the giants a lot. 

when bonds gets on base all by himself , he can try to steal 2nd 
and then be driven in with a single by thompson , manwaring , or clayton .  . 

if you bat bonds before the other , then you do n't want 
him to run because a caught stealing could take you out of a 
big inning .  . 

also bonds is less in need of protection behind him because he 
is such a good base (a walk is a potential  . 

the only draw back is when clark and williams are up the 
bases of bonds .  .  .  . and i think that 's a problem the 
giants will be glad to see especially if thompson gets hot.

just to add to this vein , consider that range of a first baseman is not 
the only important thing. he is imo the best fielder of bad throws from 
the other  . i have seen him scoop balls out of the dirt , catch 
balls off a large bounce , take down balls over his head , wide , etc. ad 
infinitum .  . and he gets the out , much of the time. some of the things 
he does to save his of errors are amazing. you have to give 
mattingly credit for being able to do all of that while keeping his foot

another pair of suggestions 
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe 
no matter what the pitcher does. 

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time  ( x 3 to 5) 
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base 
as if walked .  . 

this last suggestion will probably increase the number of stolen bases 
considerably .  . suppose the pitcher uses up (n 1) of his n pick off 
attempts .  . the runner can probably stretch his lead off the base , 
given that there will be extra pressure on the pitcher to get it 
right this time. 

would this suggestion apply to pick off attempts per pitch , per 
batter , or per base runner  ( on the same base )

disclaimer this is for fun. 

in my computerized baseball game , i keep track of a category called 
stolen hits , defined as a play made that an average fielder would not 
make with average effort. using the 1992 defensive averages posted 
by sherri nichols  ( thanks sherri ! ) , i 've figured out some defensive stats 
for the  . hits stolen have been redefined as plays juan 
gonzalez would not have made. 

ok , i realize that 's unfair .  . juan 's probably the victim of pitching staff , 
fluke shots , and a monster park factor. but let 's put it this way if we 
replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with kevin 's 55.4 out 
making ability , how many extra hits would go by 

to try and correlate it to reality a little more , i 've calculated net 
hits stolen , based on the number of outs made compared to what a league 
average fielder would make. by the same method i 've calculated net extra 
bases  ( doubles and triples let by) .  . 

finally , i throw all this into a a formula i call defensive contribution , or 
dcon . basically , it represents the defensive contribution of a player. 
i add this number to ops to get dops  ( defense plus slug ) , which 
should represent the player 's total contribution to the team. so do n't 
take it too seriously. the formula for dcon appears at the end of this 
article.

dcon formula  ( nhs ndp ) pa )  ( nhs ndp neb ) ab ) 
why such a bizzare formula basically , it 's designed to be added into the 
ops , with the idea that a run prevented is as important as a run scored . 
the extra outs are factored into obp , while the extra bases removed are 
factored into slg .  . that 's why i used pa and ab as the divisors .  .

well then given your definition of best is it not conceivable that

no. i do not find this conceivable .  . i also cannot conceive of the

the subject line says it all. what is the rule that qualifies 
a pitcher as making a save 
imho this is the most untrustworthy , silly stat , by today 's rules , in all 
of baseball .  . my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 
appear in the on deck circle .  . also , the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 
three runs .  . 

this is a phenomenon known around work as ready fire aim .  . i am astounded at 
the number of times people post strong opinions about things they not only 
do n't understand but publicly admit to not understanding. in fact , there 's a 
plausible argument that saves are a more rational stat than wins. 

for the record , there are two ways that a reliever can get a save 
he must finish the game and either 
1. have entered the game with the tying run on base , at bat , or on deck .  . 
2. have pitched at least three innings effectively .  . 
a pitcher may not get a win and a save in the same game. 

i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 
determining winners etc. for instance , a pitcher can come in in the 
ninth with a lead , blow the lead , fall behind , have his team come back in 
the next half inning and earn the win. has this pitcher earned a win , no 
way. 

but this is an argument that wins is a dumb stat , not saves .  . 

i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 
teammates rally to tie the score. assume he came in to start the fourth 
and left after the eighth .  . his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. the 
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat 
satisfaction .  . 

this again does n't support your claim about saves at the beginning of your 
post.

well , my guess is because america loves underdogs .  . every year , no matter 
the cubs  talent or the predictions , they never  ( as close to never as

has fallen in love with these perennial losers .  . the cubs have more fans 
in chicago then some teams do worldwide .  . the cubs have more fans 
worldwide than most of the teams in their division combined .  . 
an aura of excitement surrounds the cubs at the beginning of the season 
like no one else.  ( including the ws champs ) it must be that eternal hope. 
this is the year. they 've got the talent. they 're off to a good start. 
they 've got the pitching  ( or hitting , or whatever their strong point is 
at the time) .  . it 's that inevitability that the cubs will eventually 
win the ws again. when only god knows. since it 's been so long , it 
could come at any time , or it could be another 85 years. but until they

name more than 3 players from their 1988 season. on the other hand , ask any 
cubs fan living anywhere in the united states to name 3 players from any given 
year and 80 of them probably could. 
granted , the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park , but 
that does not mean they the title america 's team 
the only reason they are considered america 's team is because of ted

in article ,  ( sanjeev punjabi ) writes 

as the heading indicates , it is impossible for me to fathom why barry is not 
batting 4th for the giants behind will clark .  . barry is such an awesome and 
consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho , to 
have williams , a hitter  ( and not really a clutch hitter ) batting 
4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the 
giants .  . 

2 simple reasons 

(1) batting williams ahead of bonds will create a  ( left(clark ) , 
 ( right(williams ) ,  ( left(bonds ) situation in the middle of the 
batting order. this makes it tougher for opposing manager 
to change pitchers .  . 

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get 
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles 
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to 
walk williams to get to bonds .  . 

both your reasons are not good ones. joe morgan thinks that bonds clark 
williams should be the 3 4 5 hitters .  . while he believes that clark bonds 
williams is fine , he definitely is of the opinion that bonds should hit 
ahead of williams .  . i am inclined to agree with him. 
your first reason is not valid because bonds can hit both lefties and righties 
very well. he hits lefties or righties better than any other giant 
williams is still getting breaking balls although not as much as last season. 
but , the bottom line is bonds is a far more disciplined and more productive 
hitter than williams , and i prefer to take my chances with bonds driving in 
the 1 , 2 or 3 hitters  ( who are expected to have high obps ) than with williams .  . 
williams would get more fastballs with bonds on first and second base open 
because of the threat of bonds stealing .  .

it is doubtful that the blue jays would have won the al east without morris .  . 
last year , when the team went 13 15 for the month of august , and all the 
other starters were being shelled , and milwaukee was making a charge , 
morris went 5 1 with a pretty good era (i ca n't remember exactly) .  . 
also , let 's not underestimate the importance his 240 innings to save 
the bullpen every fifth day. if he did n't help us win the al east , forget 
about the and the world series. 

his run support was high (5 . 98 . runs) but so was 's (5 . 90 . runs) 
and he won only 12 games. i do remember morris winning an inordinate number of 
6 5 and 8 6 ballgames , but this is to his credit. he pitched only as good 
as he needed to be. when he was up 6 1 in a ballgame , he just put it in cruise 
control and threw the ball up there and let the batters get out 
(i hate this expression ! ) .  . an inexperienced pitcher would wear himself out 
trying to make perfect pitches to keep his era down. but morris , being a 
veteran pitcher , knows that winning is the only thing that really matters in 
baseball .  . by saving himself , he was able to reach back for that little extra 
(i hate this too ! ) when the game was on the line. 

i do n't buy this at all. i think things are colored to a very large 
degree of notions of who the players involved are. try 
this exercise 

xxx is pitching today. his team scores 4 in the first inning , and 3 
in the fourth .  . xxx gives up 0 in the 1st through 4th. in the fifth , 
he gives up 3 runs .  . in the 6th , he gives up 2 more. the score is now 
7 5 , with xxx 's team still on top. 

i contend that if xxx were jack morris , the assessment would be he is 
a veteran who pitches only as well as he has to to win. 

if xxx were mike , the assessment would be he is an 
inexperienced rookie who does n't know how to pitch .  . needs more 
seasoning .  . send him to aaa .  . or to the spice rack .  .

did you see the same game i saw gant , most reasonable , argued a 
horrible call which , correctly , did nothing about. gant 
then proceeded to walk halfway to 3rd base , lean on his bat and 
glare at  . while i do n't subscribe to the 
theory of showing people up , this was an obvious attempt by gant to 
do so to  . he left no choice but to take control 
of the situation. the bottom line is gant started a dangerous 
power struggle with when his team needed him most and 
he lost. 


the events i saw were 
1) called strike by 

was it just me , or did it look like pointed to 
the 3b umpire before calling that strike i thought that 's 
why gant was asking for the appeal to the 1st base umpire 
he thought had gotten checked swing help from the wrong 
umpire .  . 

2) shocked looking gant asks for appeal to first 
3) no appeal to first 
4) gant steps out of batters box. 
5) immediately orders gant back in. bad move 
6) gant ignores and walks off. bad move 
7) yells at gant .  . gant is silent .  . 
8) calls for the pitch .  . 

after called for the pitch , but before the pitch was thrown , 
cox came onto the field. it was obvious that he was trying to get time 
called before the pitch , but no one was watching. 

9) pitch is called a strike .  . 
10) cox argues  ( could n't see when he came on the field ) 
11) cox is ejected , players everywhere 
12) play finally resumes .  . 


gant should n't have ignored  . not returning made the strike 
call fairly likely. although i suspect an argument might have gotten 
gant tossed altogether. but if had let gant step out , the 
whole incident probably would have been avoided .  . 

your listing pretty much agreed with what i saw , with the aforementioned 
 . perhaps it appeared differently at the ballpark .  . personally , 
i was amazed that gant did n't get ejected .  . but that 's why cox did 
it 's called protecting your players. 

and to those people who would have thrown everyone out of the game , 
all i can say is that you 'd be making baseball history. even in 
the worst baseball brawls , usually only the major instigators are 
ejected , not everyone who comes onto the field. and i 'd have to 
say that those brawls are considerably more threatening to the game 
than what the braves did fri. night. 

anyhow , that 's my last two cents on the subject , barring 
outrageous postings .  . i will try to keep my eyes open 
for more incidents involving  . i think there will 
be some with other teams as well. i hope not.

not bad. we had a similar situation. softball , bases loaded , 
weakest hitter at the plate. he hits a line drive over the third 
baseman 's head that hooked and hooked and finally landed ten feet in 
foul ground , almost hitting the fence down that side of the field. 
but the umpire called fair ball ! i was coaching third , yelling at 
to move up a base. the ump 's position it was still fair when it 
passed third base . 
why the other team did n't immediately protest i 'll never know we 
certainly were n't going to argue about it , since every body did manage 
to advance one base safely .  . 

there was also the time when a batted ball off my  ( runner

runner from first , and throw to first in time for what the umpire 
called a triple play protest removed when we won the game anyway.

who would you have playing 3b , wade boggs or charlie hayes my choice 
is boggs .  . no contest. it will give them time to develop younger talent 
in an area the yankee farm system seems to be deficient .  . 

a  . two words russell davis .  . playing in the cavern at albany  ( aa ) last 
year  ( 375 410 385 down the alleys and to center) , davis went .285  . 355 .  . 483 . 
with 22 homers .  . there are n't any small parks on the road in the eastern 
league , either. he 's  ( 23 ! ) and his mle was .258 .308  . 416 . , 17 hr. i have no 
fielding statistics , but from seeing him a number of times last year i 'd say 
that he 's not brooks robinson , but neither is he howard johnson .  . unless they 
think they can win the pennant this year (which seems possible) and need 
boggs to do it , i think they 're making the same sort of mistake with davis 
that boston made with boggs , leaving him in the minors for two or three 
years after he 'd shown that he was a good hitter .  . 

3. spike owen .  .

or whoever .  . wade and spike next to each other in the infield is 
going to raise the yankee staff era 1 2 point. and these guys

in regard to boggs i 'll relate a story about a yankee fan at fenway last year 
for opening day. i was there to see them face baltimore and could n't help but 
listen to the boston fans talk about various players on the team. one guy was 
totally boggs , how he sucks , etc .  .  .  .  . i told him i was a yankee 
fan and i 'd take him in a second and who would he want in a trade back. he 
said a pile of sh t. i know boggs had some personal problems while playing for 
boston , but come on he 's a future hall of famer who really adds a needed 
dimension to the yanks .  . a solid hitter , a decent fielder and more importantly 
a teacher , ask pat kelly .  . i think he 's got a few good years left in his bat 
and may be a key contributor down the stretch as they win the american league 
east this year. boston fans have no class ! ! ! they 'll probably boo him like 
crazy his first time back in pinstripes and i hope he goes 4 for 4 and shuts 
them up.

could contribute the most to your team. say the reds were dumb enough to 
not protect larkin , and the jays did n't protect alfredo .  . who would you 
pick 

for an expansion team i'm pretty sure i would go with the rings , as long 
as their salaries and ages were n't too high. i would want the fans to be 
able to identify the players. i would like a championship attitude in the 
clubhouse .  . 

as for larkin and griffin salaries aside , i would have to consider which 
player is likeliest to contribute to a ws victory .  . past performance , age and

if hayes is a defensive standout at third , he 's done a good job in disguising

boggs converted 11 more grounders into outs , turned 2 more double plays , and

some discussion about whether elias is money grubbing deleted 

funny , it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks , 
which are nothing but collections of statistics , are authored by bill james 
and stats inc.  ( and howe , for the minor league handbook ) . 

and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies 
as a book with statistics , while the elias analyst is a statistics book . 
the analyst contains more stats , sure , but it also contains more dialogue .  . 

finally , the point was not about the word statistics . it was about 
money grubbing . i do n't see how anyone who has looked at the bill 
james player ratings book cannot consider him money grubbing .  . 

bob vesterman .  . 

some thoughts and facts , 

1 . ) . bill james is a partial owner of stats , inc. however he has almost 
nothing to do with the day to day operations of the company , although he 
does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name. 
(the handbook , but not the  . to the best of my knowledge , the 
only things that bill actually writes for stats are the predictions section 
of the handbook , and the bill james fantasy baseball rulebook .  . 

2 . ) . the debate over elias goes way back. bill james  early stuff was hampered 
by the fact that elias would not give access to their stats at any price. 
project , and later , stats were founded to fill this void .  . you 
can call stats , and ask them for a report on just about anything in their 
database , and they will provide it for a price , of course. or you could 
just log into their online system and look at the data yourself. having 
attempted to pry numbers from elias in the past  ( football , not baseball) , they 
just do n't do that. in stats eyes , the high ground comes from making the 
information available at all. 

3 . ) . that being said , i'm pretty by bill 's book this year , too. 
i am given to that it was mostly a response to the publishers 
desire to have the book come out sooner than april .  . 

hope this makes things just a little bit clearer .  .

i do n't know why you guys keep bickering about morris .  . the stats show he 
is a mediocre pitcher at best  ( this year is another case) , he just happened 
to win 21 games. i saw many of his games last year , he did pitch some good 
games. but this crap about being a clutch pitcher is nonsense , he was 
constantly giving up go ahead runs in the 6 8th innings (the clutch innings ) 
and the jays would somehow scrape a win for him. another major factor in 
his 21 wins , is that  i dont realize i have a bullpen  gaston would 
leave morris in for ever , therefore giving him many more chances to win 
games (i believe this is the major reason he won 21 games last year) .  .

henderson is the best leadoff hitter of all time , arguably .  . winfield has

the batting order. until then , i think it 's stupid to focus on what 's wrong , 
for the simple fact that it's working as it is. 

this is a fine strategy if you expect to run away with the division .  . 
but the giants are going to need every break they can get , if they 
want too hold that lead. i do n't think they can afford to be 
, and say well it has worked pretty well so far , and 
while we might be able to improve the results , we do n't think it is 
worth the risk . 

mostly , though , the giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that 
continues , it 's rather silly to second guess their strategy .  . but evidently , 
some folks would rather be right than be first. 

the two tend to go hand in hand .  .  .  .

in article ,  ( steve a. conroy x6172 ) writes 

major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter 
attention spans (i . e .  . the football crowd) .  . ( invariably , all the 
arguments from people who do n't like to watch baseball on t.v. say the 
same thing the games are too long and too boring. baseball is trying 
to find a way to shorten the games for wider t.v. appeal. if you look at 
it , though , baseball games last around the same amount of time as football 
games. the difference is that there is more action in that duration in 
football games. perhaps if there were more action in baseball games , you 
would get more of those fans to tune in. anyway , coming up with a solution 
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult. 
on soapbox yet another reason to get a now since it 's obvious 
that ruling baseball by comittee works about as fast as a snail race in 
nebraska .  . off soapbox 

how can you say there is more action in football then baseball .  . a football 
game consists of approximately 120 plays and the average duration of a play 
is around 8 seconds. this means that in a game that lasts approximately 3 
hours you have about 16 minute s of action. in a baseball game you have 
upwards of two hundred pitches .  . there are very few on field strategy 
on field sessions (ie .  . huddles ) and you always have a chance to win 
until the last out is made. 



ah , but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and 
a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time , but it happens 
when there 's less than 5 minutes to go quite  . this sense creates 
drama , even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer 's 
attention. in baseball , only 3 players are involved in the action for about 
 ( here comes a wild guess) 70 of the time and they 're just playing a 
sophisticated game of catch hold the ball step out of the box adjust chains 
touch self in interesting locations .  . there 's a lot of dead time with the 
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the 
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher 
who then takes (8 10 ) pitches or helen dell playing the organ  ( dodger fans 
will appreciate that one) .  . to the non baseball this is boring. 
at any rate , i'm not putting baseball down for this i 've been an avid 
fan since i can remember it 's just that watching a baseball game on 
t.v. at home can be tedious for the non baseball  . that 's what major 
league baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of 
shortening the game. it 's because of t.v. not because football has more 
action than baseball .

lines 88 

 ( dale seer stephenson ) writes 
while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around , 
gant was n't ordered back in the box sooner , he was ordered back immediately. 
as soon as he stepped out , told him to get back in the box. 
now , gant does n't take a lot of walks between pitches .  . the only reason 
he did then because he was very bothered by the call. i expect his 
concentration was n't there yet , and in a crucial situation i imagine it 's 
best to be as calm as possible. contributing factors would be gant 's 
bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the braves long scoring 
drought .  . 

and it is not 's job to help gant with any of these difficulties .  . 
if gant ca n't gather his concentration for whatever reason , that just makes 
him all the more meat in the batter 's box. the umpire 's job is to 
maintain flow of play. gant is not entitled to time to his 
faculties .  . 

nor is anyone else. 

now , it 's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is 
telling you to get in there. you know the umpire is going to do something 
 ( call for a strike , throw you out , etc . ) .  . gant was wrong. 

absolutely .  . i think it 'd be more accurate to say gant was foolish .  . 

but was more wrong , in my biased view. aside from the major chip 
he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem. gant had a reason 
to want some time  ( disputed strike call) .  . 

if a disputed strike call is ample reason for a timeout , games would last 
about nine fifteen weeks , if jack morris or dave were 
pitching .  . a disputed strike call is not sufficient for a time out. 
suck it up , get back in the box , and never the blue. they 're 
not going to change their mind , and you 're just going to come across 
as a pinhead , which wo n't help you with the borderline calls. 

ftr i never speak to umpires when i do n't know them personally , nor 
do i glance at them , or react to calls. as a result , i think i get more 
than my fair share of borderline calls at the plate , because i have a 
rep of having a good eye.  ( actually , there are a lot of negative 
connotations that go with that rep , including copious questions about 
my , party affiliation , and sexual preference . ) . 

gant had n't been wasting time all 
game. the game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old. 

irrelevant .  . he was wasting time then. 

the score was 1 0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position. 
is there any reason could n't , and should n't , cut gant a little 
slack 

1. because it 's not his job. 

2. because setting the precedent of cutting slack there can easily 
extend to those 3 hour games.  ( kind of like the phantom dp . ) . 

for no discernible constructive reason , disrupted the 
game , caused a five minute delay , and hurt the batter in a key 
situation. did he have a date to get to 

gant hurt himself , and the braves disrupted the game. your biases are 
exposed , and i'm sitting here defending umpires and the sf giants , 
which is like phyllis defending gary , jack , 
and the swedish abortion team. 

and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game. 

i believe terry said the magic word. there are some truly quick ways 
to get tossed from a ballgame .  . for a primer , email me. 

good ways to get tossed from a game 

1. ask ken kaiser if he got his money back from nutri system. 
2. kiss rich garcia on the lips , and say hi , honey , i'm home ! 
3. goose eric gregg .  . 
4. ask bruce if his parents had any children that lived .  . 
5. get naked .  .

generate interest in baseball among the masses .  .

brawl . everybody just stands there and looks at each other. stand , 
stand , stand. look , look , look. ho , hum .  . then , the 
come running in. when they reach the fight , they just stand 
there , too. 

anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch 
should be suspended and fined .  . further , the should fight 
it out in the outfield , so as not to waste time and energy running 
to the infield .  .

there 's too many 's here for my taste by now , which means i 've

i agree. i 'll delete more as well. 

(mike fester ) writes 
 ( jonathan king ) writes 

perhaps you can give a more recent citation of any player mentioned as a 
malingerer thanks. 

i guess i do n't understand your question. i was trying to imply that 
the accusations of glenn davis  were certainly not played 
up very much. 

still , if the  whispers  reached san francisco , it is certainly possible they 
were stronger elsewhere. also , it was teammates making the aspersions .  . in any 
event , i know of no other player to be maligned in the last couple years. 

but , in any case , i believe mike has been accused of poor 
work habits and general sloth recently  ( probably not malingering ) , 
just as he was being released. it 's interesting that nobody heard 
much about these problems before if they were so important. 

i have heard sanders called many things as well. i have not heard him called 
lazy. given the 2 sport phenomenon , it would be difficult to label him as 
such. 

exactly so. which means his media detractors have had to say other 
things about him. i believe it 's a general phenomenon that if writers 
do n't like you , they 'll find a label that will stick no matter who you 
are. i find myself more interested in the selection of labels than in 
why writers feel they need to act this way. (not that this 
me that much , either . ) . 

uh , the original author 's point was that black and white players were por 
differently by the media , and towards this , he gave a highly selected 
list to prove his case. sanders  name showed up eventually. i dispute that 
sanders has ever been called lazy by the media . 

hmm , big ego , possible club house disturbance , etc. is that good press 

no , but it is n't the total extent of the press he received in 
pittsburgh , where he was called all kinds of things including lazy and 
spoiled by the local columnists .  . again , the actual words used may 
shift around with time and expediency , but lazy tends to be higher 
on the list for non white players , at least in my subjective opinion. 

aside it might be interesting for somebody to do an archival study 
on player descriptions before and after the color barrier was broken , 
and on teams like the red sox which have been traditionally white. 
nowadays , most people think of carl as one of those 
blue collar , hard working guys , but in the early 70s he was often 
portrayed as a lazy bum .  . really. 

hmm .  . i never heard anyone accuse canseco of being lazy. nor sierra .  . 

i 've heard accusations that canseco was a bad fielder , but could be a 
great one if he put his mind to it . ignoring whether or not he is a 

actually , dave stewart is  ( was ) one of the most vocal about this. in any 
event , that is not lazy . 

at least one poster in the last week has fired off a major on the 
canseco is lazy issue , so i think your point is at best a quibble , and 
probably weaker than that. 

uh , that poster specifically stated allow me to be the first . it is not a 
quibble , then , to state that the media did not portray canseco as being 
lazy. if the other person chooses to so accuse him , after my post , that does not 
make it a quibble .  . and in fact , the media around here  ( tend(ed ) to play up his 
time in the room. hardly lazy , and hardly a quibble . have you ever 
seen any portray canseco as lazy with his fielding , yes. 
lazy , no. 

bad fielder , i think this is still interesting. for that matter , i 
think canseco 's colorful off field get lots more national 
attention than those of , say , roger clemens .  . 

well , he 's had a few more of them. 

at least more that you 've heard about. i think one of the questions 
here surrounds selective reporting .  . having said that , i have to say 
that the selective reporting hypothesis has the potential to be 
unfalsifiable , at least by those of us who are n't reporters , police , 
or private investigators .  . 

well , canseco has been involved in several felonies , including his high speed 
record , carrying concealed fire arms , and of course the domestic violence .  . 
clemens had a run in at a bar. canseco had that , as well , and in both cases , the 
coverage was relatively minimal .  . 

puckett stewart jackson 

i said over represent non whites .  . three anecdotal data points do n't 
make an interesting counter argument. btw which jackson are we talking 
about here reggie , bo , darrin , danny , or ... 

uh , if the only evidence offered is anecdotal , how can it be objected that the 
counter to it is also anecdotal 

and it seems like everybody who has ever won a batting title  ( among 
others) has been accused at some time of caring more for his own 
stats than for the good of the team . it also seems to me that you 're 

kirby puckett i have never heard this accusation made of puckett .  . i 
have heard it of boggs .  . actually , i believe it of him , but that 's another 
matter. 

not living in minnesota , i ca n't say whether or not this line has ever 
been used against kirby there. as far as boggs goes , i'm not sure why 
you bring him up , since he 's one of the obvious prototypes for the line 
i quoted  ( along with ted williams , rod carew , and many others) .  . 

uh , yes , and i agree with your assesment of boggs , rather specifically .  . however , 
you did say everybody who has ever won a batting title has been accused of 
selfishness .  . i have not ever , anywhere , heard this said of puckett .  . pendleton , 
either. similarly , brett , b williams , and others. 

how about daryl strawberry and i think the plus or minus refers more to 
the born again types , ie , butler and  . 

again , you seem to be making an argument from anecdotes .  . on the other 
hand , my argument by is of the because jon says so variety if we have 
no other data. i have to admit i have problems generating lists of 
non white players who became  ( in)famous ) for their religious or 
political beliefs , while names like butler , , , , 
, et al. come rolling out. 

there are others. perhaps they are simply not as outspoken , except in the

league by days of the week , nor that there should be. but it does n't 
mean we ca n't make predictions based on that for that particular 
player. 

i believe that by 
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations 
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch 
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll 
just have to wait and see. 

is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this 
a prediction for all batters who have , over the past few years , hit 
 ( xxx amount ) worse in the clutch than overall 

i only see a prediction for one player here. i do n't see anything 
about all batters .  . 

here 's another one for you. in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting 
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting 
average in non clutch situations each year. i presume you think 
this is random. 
i'm not going to get into case analysis. sure , you can find somebody 
who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. you 
can also find those who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit well in 
'92 .  . 

that 's exactly what mark is trying to do though. find hitters 
that have these correlation and ask whether we can make predictions 
for these hitters based on their past performance. 

major league ballplayers .  . it just makes me think that in 1993 
joe carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be 
as high as his ba in non clutch situations. 
's fallacy .  . unless there is reason to expect consistency , a 

huh what does 's fallacy have to do with anything 
whether you can know the reason for correlation or not , you ca n't 
deny that it has existent , you can only make an argument that 
you do n't think it is likely to continue to exist because you 
ca n't see a reason for it to exist. 

run proves nothing. can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to 
correlate from one year to the next i 've seen a detailed study of 

someone posted recently on why negative clutch would correlate .  . 
the argument along the lines of star player with l r splits will 
always see an adverse condition in late innings of a close game 
(i . e .  . opposing manager will always bring in a ah pitcher to 
face him , where his manager will not pull him for a ph ) 

i do n't see how you can deny it . ) . as for total idiot yes. if you 
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might 
suggest that you are wrong , i would say the term fits nicely. 
so tell me does the term fit or do you have an open mind 

what about you if the shoe fits , will you wear it with an open mind

i wholeheartedly endorse it. 

i have no problem with the 
length of games at all and am tired of the espn crowd ( and other announcers ) 
bitching about it. i have never been in a ballpark filled with people looking 
at their watches and shouting hurry up ! if i cough up big bucks for a 
ticket , i do n't mind a game that last more than 2 10. i really do n't 
understand it. 

have n't been to many a 's games , have you 

seriously , i do n't mind a baseball game that lasts a long time if it lasts 
a long time because there is good baseball being played. however , i do n't 
like 3 2 games that take 3 hours , because there 's a lot of dead time going 
on in that game. i do n't find anything exciting about watching batter or 
pitcher wander around between pitches , or watching the catcher make a slow 
walk to the mound , or watching lots of pitcher changes for no good reason 
 ( whitey herzog used to be the master of this the game could be way out of 
reach , and he 'd still be making switches for platoon advantage) .  . 

i want to see the game , not people standing around. i do n't really enjoy 
watching nfl football games in person , for example , because there 's so much 
dead time  ( you do n't really notice how much dead time there is if you watch 
it on television , because they 're busy showing you  . i do n't like 
that college basketball games have so many time outs at the end of the game 
(the ncaa has made some moves to try to alleviate this problem for next 
year they 're going to stop the clock after made baskets late in games next 
year , and they 're going to a 35 second clock) .  . 

there 's also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if i'm 
watching them on the tube , and if i'm going there in person. for me , going 
to an a 's game has become a major commitment of time , one that i'm not 
willing to make that often the length of their games is costing the a 's 
revenue from me.

nobody 's saying it 's a hard and fast rule. my point is that white 
players are likely to stick around longer if they 're mediocre .  . 

i went through tb iii and made a list of 10 year of and 1b who were 
negative in both adjusted batting runs and total player rating. tpr 
has some problems , but it 's generally not too far off for a career , 
imho .  . all players who played most of their career after 1960 were 
considered .  . 

here are a through i  ( have n't done the rest yet) 

, , balboni , , , , bergman , berry , 
, blair , , , , bradford , l. brown , buckner , 
, c . castillo . , , , cline , , coles , d. collins , 
, , , gaston , geiger , , , , 
 . 

a few black players there a lot of white and hispanic .  . 

hmmm .  .  . one . question .  .  . how . do you differentiate hispanic and black 
after all , some people fall into both categories .  .  . rafael . 
comes to mind .  .  . and . he 'd fit into this grouping also. 
(oops .  .  . he . 's not an of 1b .  .  . although . he is a light hitting 
utility player. sorry about that. but would 
qualify , if i remember correctly . ) . 

when i say black , i mean us born black people for the purposes of this 
discussion. hispanic players were in baseball before 1947 , and one 
team in the 50 's signed lots of hispanics because they went over better 
with the local audience than blacks did. 

and why would more hispanics stick around than blacks 

do n't know. but remember this is the country that had special racial 
laws for one group and one group only blacks .  . our national history 
includes huge , long term , global tensions regarding the black minority 
the hispanic minority , while often discriminated against , has never been 
the object of national obsession .  . 

it might also be worth your while to subdivide the data into careers 
starting at 10 year intervals .  . i would think that your prediction 
would be most true for careers starting in the 1960 's and least true 
for careers starting in the 1980 's .  . of course , you 'd also have to 
compare total ml racial percentages for the era in question. 

absolutely .  . as i said before , i expect that this effect is disappearing .  . 
but it certainly did exist , and all out talk of twg 's and all that is 
not without some small reason. 

i'm of the opinion that your point is less valid today than it was 
25 years ago , but i would be curious to see the data. 

well , there 's the list. go for it ! i 'll cull some more names as i go. 
i expect you 're right , btw.

hi there , 

i'm german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now. 
there are many problems occuring for me. one of them is the era statistic for 
pitchers .  . what does it say 

era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per 
nine inning game. thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned 
run , his 9 inning would be 3 earned runs , thus his era 
is 3 . 00 .  . to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided 
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9. 

era  ( er ip) 9 

an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed 
to a fielding error. more specifically , if an error occurs that represented 
the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs .  . 
earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base 
when the pitcher exited the game. here are some examples 

if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base. if 
an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after 
this error and not counted as earned runs .  . 

if a pitcher issues some base on balls  ( walks ) , and leaves the game 
before the inning is completed , he is responsible for the people who 
were left on base. if the those runners who were left on base score , 
and the score was not a result of an error , those runs are 
attributed to the pitcher who left the game. 

i hope this explains things for you.

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike 
to them , than because they have a great eye 

this comes up periodically , and i just do n't get it. take , for example , mark 
mcgwire .  . he walked 90 times in 1993. if that 's not a potential great example 
of what you 're talking about then i do n't know what is. now let 's look at 
what happens when mcgwire does n't walk 
75 of the time he made an out. 
10 of the time he hit a single. 
5 of the time he hit a double .  . 
10 of the time he hit a homer .  . 
now , you 're pitching against mcgwire .  . would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers , 
1 double , 2 singles , and 15 outs i would. why give him the base when you 
can get him out 3 times out of 4 
then there are guys like alex cole , who has a career .363 obp even 
though he 's never had a batting average over .300  ( he did hit .300 in 
227 ab in 1990) or hit a single home run. yep , that 's right , he 's 
never hit a homer in 916 ab 's through the end of 1992. who 'd be 
afraid to throw a strike to him

for an extra 15 minutes game (average) in the al , and an extra 11 minutes

now , what i think i am seeing is more pitches .  . more strikeouts  ( over

i wonder why you say that i do n't see why having a spouse and or 
kids would have anything to do with it. it might if you brought 
your kids to the game and wanted them to get home in time to get 
to bed at a reasonable hour  ( in which case i 'd probably decide 
to take my kids to games on weekends , as many people do , or else 
be prepared to leave the game early ) , but from what you say later 
on , you do n't bring your kids or your spouse to the game. 
as it happens , i have a husband but no kids , and my husband usually 
attends games with me. 

extra innings could put me 
well past midnight .  . even without extra innings , if the score is beyond 
2 1 i ca n't see my family that night at all. if the next day is a , 
i may have to bag that as well. 

i can see it 's a problem if you do n't bring your wife to the ballgame , 
but that 's a problem even if the game goes a trim 2 1 2 hours. as far 
as bagging work the next day , i do n't really understand why that 's 
necessary , unless going to a game also means that you consume vast 
quantities of beer (i note that this is the case for many guys) .  . 
if you do n't think you can get up to go to work after a long evening 
out , then do n't have long evenings out during the week. 

all that stuff enters into my consideration of even going to a game. if 
you say you do n't care about whether the game is sped up , you are 
saying you do n't care where the time goes , and that the game is for people 
who do n't have families and do n't have to get up for work the next day. 

look if i pay between 8.00 and 20.00 apiece for tickets , plus 10.00 
for parking , plus spending my time and energy driving to and from boston , 
plus spending additional money on concessions etc. at the ballpark , then 
i see going to a game as a considerable investment of time and money. 
i ca n't afford to go to a lot of games. hence , going to a game is a 
big deal , like going to a play or an opera .  . maybe you have more money than 
i do and can go to games all year long , so it 's not such a big deal for you. 
but i'm not interested in having games sped up , any more than i want to 
have die cut down to a convenient version of two 
hours. if i felt that going to a night game during the week would interfere 
with my family life or my work life , then i 'd choose to go to a weekend game.

i do n't pretend to understand 
statistical analysis. 

well , we agree on the last part. ) 

cool. and thank you for an intelligent response devoid of the silly 
name calling of others. ) 


one of the basic things you need to 
have in a statistic to be able to predict a player 's performance on it 
in the future is for there to be a correlation from year to year. a 
player 's batting average is correlated fairly well from year to year. 

ok. 

the basic problems with something like clutch batting average overall 
batting average is that the correlation from year to year is almost zero .  . 
adding to the sample size does n't seem to help much. 

actually , i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem. 
it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball 
in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of 
bell curve .  . (the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting 
vs. non clutch the y axis being the number of players . ) . certainly 
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell .  . my 
supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently 
 ( year after year) at one end of the bell or the other , then we might 
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players 
 ( as opposed to all baseball players) .  . 

as a counterexample to 
what you showed , consider the following two players from 1984 1987 

non clutch clutch 
ab h ba ab h ba 

maldonado 1060 260 .245 254 78  . 307 . 
lemon 1643 457 .278 256 57 .223 

if you had had these two players in 1988 , by your logic , in those clutch 
situations , you 'd bat maldonado for lemon in a blink of an eye. well , in 
1988 , maldonado hit .267 in non clutch and .190 in clutch , while lemon 
hit .254 in non clutch and .313 in clutch . before you accuse me of 
completely cooking the data , 

you wo n't hear those kind of accusations from me. it is interesting 
that you selected maldonado , because he is someone whom i have also 
looked at. he has been a very inconsistent hitter  ( in terms of ba ) , 
hitting in 1989 92  . 217 . ,  . 273 . , .250 , .272 admittedly , he has 
been traded between leagues as well as clubs .  . his clutch hitting 
record is equally inconsistent .  . so , for my purposes in 1993 i would 
not draw any conclusions about his ability to hit in the clutch based 
on his prior performance. i do n't know how i would have felt in 1988 , 
but you may indeed be right. 

when i looked at sabo i found a more consistent record of hitting , and 
a more consistent pattern of his clutch hitting being proportionately 
below his non clutch ba .  . ditto for joe carter .  . 

this probably brings us to the heart of the disagreement i am having 
with others on this topic. must any conclusion based on statistical 
history be able to be applied broadly throughout a data base before 
it has any validity is it impossible  ( or irrational ) to apply 
statistical analysis to selected components of the data base 


btw , players  overall batting average from '84 '87 with 
'88 gives a correlation coefficient of 0.59 , which is significant at 
something better than the 99.9 confidence level. their 
 ( clutch non clutch ba ) for the same period gives a correlation of 
0 . 088 . , significant at no level of any interest. 

i completely accept that reasoning .  . again , what if we were to find 
the same individuals at each end of the spectrum on a consistent 
basis 

actually , it 's technically incorrect to say that we ca n't predict future 
clutch performance. it 's more correct to say that we ca n't predict 
future clutch performance with any skill. 

amen .  .

if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches

then i would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches .  . my comment 
that he is n't paid to walk does n't mean that he should have a license

based only on this data , i do n't see any reason to 
pinch hit for sabo , or any other player who had been a poor clutch 
hitter in the past. 

but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch hit. 
does the pinch hitter give you a platoon advantage  ( any portion of 
sabo 's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a 
real ability , even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting . ) . do you 
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run do you 
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves 


hey ! what 's this we agree ! 

no platoon advantage  ( sabo vs.  . 

both players have a reputation of being excellent fastball hitters , 
and both have a reputation of being fooled too often with 
slow curves and change ups .  . 

sabo has more power , and a little bit of a better batting eye. samuel 
is noted as an agressive free  . sabo has more homerun power. 

both players started the game hitting below  . 200 .  . 

there may have been some game considerations that might have prompted 
perez to want to reserve samuel for use later. but the game 
was on the line , and samuel never did get in. 

given all of this , i do n't see a lot to suggest pinch hitting , nor do 
i see anything to suggest no pinch hitting .  . there is , of course , the 
clutch hitting information. but if that 's useless .  .  .  . 

then again. if it 's not .  .  .  .

we have no way of knowing because we cannot separate morris  contribu 
tion from the rest of the team 's .  . there is only one way of determin 
ing best in baseball .  . and that is by looking at the scoreboard at 
the end of the game. each game determines which team is the best 
that day. at the end of the season , the team that was the best the 
most often is the best in the division .  . the playoffs determine the 
best of the best. but the point is that the only decision making pro 
cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re 
lates to the teams . not the individual players. there is no method 
inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances .  . and that 
is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game. 

and you know what there is no such method inherent in real life 
either. so i would assume you would endorse the notion that we 
cannot state , with any level of objectivity , that mother theresa 
has accomplished more good in this world than joseph stalin .  . 
after all , life on earth is a team effort. 

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens has 
done better with those statistics as a criteria , then fine. but you 
have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the 
individual 's contribution to winning the ws because that is the 
only measure of best that has any meaning in the context of base 
ball. so until you can prove that clemens contributes to a ws cham 
more than morris your evaluation of clemens is totally sub 
and is mere opinion. i have yet to see that any of you can 
predict a ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon .  . 

have you tried glasses i find them quite useful. 

after all , there must be some reason you choose to ignore the 
of evidence we present. it 's too bad you feel it necessary to close 
your mind and eyes to knowledge you live a poorer life as a result 
of that choice. 

heck , i 'd wager that you could predict a ws winner with greater 
accuracy than jeanne dixon .  . and you know why because i have 
full confidence that despite your protestations to the contrary , 
you are quite capable of using the knowledge we can come up 
with through statistical methods to boost your knowledge level. 

you do n't have to be rude. 

have you tried calling a kettle black 

for you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point 
of my argument , or you yourself have committed a fallacy 
elenchi .  . i am not saying that morris is better than clemens because 
he has more rings  ( although i have , tongue in cheek , claimed 
that in the past) .  . i am saying that it is impossible to isolate an 
individual 's performance from that of his team 's for the purpose of 
comparing that individual 's performance with another individual 's per 
formance .  . 

in other words , in your world , you cannot objectively state that 
jack morris was more important to the blue jays than al last 
year. 

in your world , that may indeed be true. fortunately , in the world 
the rest of us occupy , it 's not. 

i hope you never serve on a jury , roger .  . i think the rest of the 
jury would have to kill you. there 's no way i can objectively 
judge the defendant to be innocent or guilty .  . you see , there are 
2 billion other people on this planet. we have no way of knowing 
whether the defendant would have committed the crime if it was n't 
for all the other people on the planet. we have no way of knowing 
how the defendant would have acted had he been on a different planet , 
because living on this planet is a team effort. and no individual 
committs a crime totally isolated from his society he is a part of 
that society. that being case , anything i have to say on his 
culpability would be absolute subjectivity , so i refuse to vote.

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike 
to them , than because they have a great eye 

this comes up periodically , and i just do n't get it. take , for example , mark 
mcgwire .  . he walked 90 times in 1993. if that 's not a potential great example 
of what you 're talking about then i do n't know what is. now let 's look at 
what happens when mcgwire does n't walk 
75 of the time he made an out. 
10 of the time he hit a single. 
5 of the time he hit a double .  . 
10 of the time he hit a homer .  . 
now , you 're pitching against mcgwire .  . would you trade 20 walks for 2 homers , 
1 double , 2 singles , and 15 outs i would. why give him the base when you 
can get him out 3 times out of 4 

i did n't say that pitcher 's fear of throwing strikes to guys like 
mcgwire , bonds , and frank thomas was rational .  . 
i just said that it exists. 

then there are guys like alex cole , who has a career .363 obp even 
though he 's never had a batting average over .300  ( he did hit .300 in 
227 ab in 1990) or hit a single home run. yep , that 's right , he 's 
never hit a homer in 916 ab 's through the end of 1992. who 'd be 
afraid to throw a strike to him 

i do n't know alex cole 's batting style at all. some questions 
how tall is he 
does he go into a crouch like rickey pete rose 
does he foul off a lot of pitches like brett butler 
does he take 1 or 2 strikes in each at bat 

it could be the cole has a good batting eye . 
look above , i said that many high obp guys draw their walks because 
pitchers are afraid to throw a strike to them , not all high obp guys.

i think sac flies are the only way obp can be below ba .  . 


does this seem dumb to anyone else 
(the fact not the comment . ) . 

why should a batter 's obp be hurt by a sac fly especially if sac 
do n't have the same effect , since they do the same thing , 
but sac flies usually score a run while just advance a base. 

but both of these situations involve the batter giving up an ab for 
the benefit of the team  ( sacrifice ) so why should it hurt their 
stats 

the sac bunt is a purposeful act , ordered by the manager. 
the batter does not go up trying to get a sac fly , and the 
evidence available indicates that there is no such ability 
players ca n't will themselves to hit sac flies , they fly out 
to the same place just as often when there 's nobody on third .  . 

greg 



sorry , i gotta disagree here. last time i played ball , i went up on 
several occasions intending to hit a fly ball deep enough to score the 
runner from third or advance a runner to third .  . it 's relatively easy 
actually .  .  .  . you swing under the path of the ball you normally would to 
hit a good line drive. with fastballs it 's very easy , much more 
difficult with good breaking balls. a good hitter with excellent bat 
control can voluntarily hit fly balls to the outfield at least , oh , 60 
of the time 

you have n't been facing major league pitching .  . 

maybe more .  .  .  . you have to be good at the plate , and most 
of those guys are just as likely to opt for getting the base hit and 
helping their average as getting the sacrifice .  . the best example i know 
of is jerry willard in the 91 series against minnesota .  . all he had to 
do was put one in the of and the game was over. he swung past 
parallel and accomplished  ( barely ) getting the run in safely .  . 

stats did a little study in the 1993 scoreboard book entitled can 
you hit sacrifice flies on purpose a summary of the findings 

over the 5 year period , sac fly type fly balls were produced 17.6 
percent of the time in situations where a sac fly was useful , and 
17.7 percent of the time when a sac fly was n't useful. 

they looked at the leaders in sac flies , and found that the leaders 
in sac flies in other words , the guys you would expect to be good 
at it it hit sac fly type fly balls only 3 more often when they 
needed to a difference way too small to be the result of a skill. 
essentially , the players who hit a lot of sac flies seem to do 
so because they hit hit sac fly type flies often , with and without 
a runner on third .  . 

stats concludes so it appears conclusive that hitters cannot hit 
sacrifice flies on purpose even if they practice in the batting 
cage .  .

i agree. however , i have to object. growing up in the early 
1980 's and playing 2 years of mario mendoza esque little league , i was 
told that since my hitting , well , sucked , i would do best to either 
walk , or take one in the face for the team . i did both. and , my

violence baseball players are such utter boys. the pitcher beans 
the batter , and both benches empty in what is called a bench clearing 
brawl . everybody just stands there and looks at each other. stand , 
stand , stand. look , look , look. ho , hum .  . then , the 
come running in. when they reach the fight , they just stand 
there , too. 

anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch 
should be suspended and fined .  . further , the should fight 
it out in the outfield , so as not to waste time and energy running 
to the infield .  . 



i think what bob is describing here is a game which mad magazine

you want to speed up ballgames 

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current 

rule is too lenient ) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more 

please pardon my ignorance if this is well known , but what is the current 
rule 

than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball , 
and restart the clock. 

i remember a post from last year indicating that a pitch clock was tried 
in one of the minor leagues some time back and did not work. i do n't remember 
why they said that it did not work. anyone remember this 

jody on wip in phil .  . has been saying that a pitch clock was 
inevitable .  . how would a pitch clock work on throws to first 

maybe we could limit the number of throws to first that the pitcher can make , 
and award a balk if he exceeds it. i 'd have another question who would 
operate the pitch clock one of the umpires add another one to the crew 

another pair of suggestions 
1. remove the balk rule. it is the runners responsibility to stay safe 
no matter what the pitcher does. 

i'm not sure i like this idea. i think it would severely diminish the 
number of stolen bases and limit the availability of such neat strategic 
as the hit and run and the squeeze play  ( one of my personal favorites) .  . 

2. if a pitcher throws to an occupied base more than x time  ( x 3 to 5) 
without successfully picking off the runner , the runner advances a base 
as if walked .  . 

ahhh ! i suppose i should read the whole article before i hit the  f  key , 
eh obviously , from what i wrote above , i like this idea. 

the no balk seems to give the pitcher the advantage .  . the base walk allows 
the runner to challenge pitcher to throw over to the base. 

it may also increase the number of wild throws to the bag , since the 
pitcher knows he does n't have very many chances to pick off the runner , 
so he may hurry too much. i 'd rather see runs scored as the result of 
sound hitting and sound baseball strategy rather than on the sloppiness 
that could result from this kind of rule. so , i suppose there are some 
disadvantages to that idea too. 

baseball games take about 2 51 in the nl , and just a shade under 3 hours 
in the al. that 's just too damn long. i do n't like to play in 3 hour 
games , much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep , and 
if i'm watching on tv , i 'll channel surf between pitches , catching 
versions of mr. ed , leave it to beaver , and those wacky 
on nick at nite .  . 

i too , find myself surfing when i know that it will be enough time between 
each pitch to allow the batter to adjust his . 

i remember in little league , if when up to bat we stepped out of the batter 's 
box , even for a moment , we were automatically out. that may be a little 
harsh for the majors , but seriously , how about putting a limit on the 
batters being able to step out , take several dozen practice swings , pound 
their shoes , scratch their balls , etc. maybe forcing them to stay in the 
batter 's box would n't be such a bad idea. that could save a few minutes.

i do n't think that it is obvious that lots of people are willing 
to pay the price. i'm sure someone out there in net land has some 
facts about trends in attendance regarding percentage of capacity 
sold. but even if the trends are relatively flat , you have to consider 
what is happening on a team by team basis. 

attendance in 1992 was down. by .3 . from an all time record in 1991. 
in people terms , attendance was down by 310 , 000 from 1991 to 1992. two 
franchises , the dodgers and mets , were down by 1 , 100 , 000 from 1991 to 1992. 
had either of them not been entirely awful , mlb would have set another 
attendance record in 1992.

this chatting about the best player of all time is pointless .  . you 
ca n't compare players from different era 's .  . 

of course you can. you just have to be careful about what conclusions 
you draw .  . 

if you will notice the best 
pitchers  ( stat wise were in the 20 's and 30 's) and the best all around hitters 
probably came from the 40 's to 60 's .  . 

huh the 20 's and 30 's were the worst decades for great pitching .  . grove , 
vance , dean , and not a whole lot else. 

as for the best all around hitters , stat wise , ruth , gehrig , foxx , greenberg , 
hornsby , cobb , etc. all played before the 40 's .  . stat wise , the 60 's were 
a graveyard for hitters .  . 

now we have a great number of great 
pitchers and an equally great number of great hitters and fielders .  .  ( also , 

how do you know which ones do you consider great 

about fielding , the gloves were much smaller than they are now in the early 
years of baseball) maybe a hitter like sheffield with the .330 ba , , and 
100  ( rbi(even though it was probably a fluke year) can be compared to a mantle 
because the pitching sheffield faces is faster and not to mention better. the 

so sheffield also has better shoes. more time between pitches .  . you can 
run the comparison , but there are lots of things to take into account. 

same could be said for frank thomas who is said to be the best hitter since ted 
williams , although frank 's defense does suck. 

well , can we compare them or ca n't we 

all i am saying is that you ca n't compare players from different era 's , 
if you want a best player try choosing best players from different era 's .  . that 

why we can compare players to the standard of their era and we can 
keep in mind era to era differences without throwing up our hands in 
despair .  . 

way there is reasonable basis for comparison. 

you have n't shown us what 's un reasonable about the mantle sheffield 
comparison that you yourself did.

you want to speed up ballgames 

1. enforce the two minutes between innings .  . as it is , many fields are 
allowing three minutes between them. fifteen seconds before 
tv commercials are gone to , thirty or so before action begins upon 
the return to the game. two minutes , last out to first pitch , or 
a ball is called. 

2. do n't grant time to batters just because they want it. they may get 
pissed at first , but they 'll get in line , once anything the pitcher 
throws while they 're adjusting their is a strike .  . 

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current

i 've only ever seen this called once. back around 1979 1980 .  . i think 
that steve carlton was pitching .  . on the other hand , i am not sure how 
much effect this would have. it seems that most of the time lost is 
when there are runners on base and the rule does not cover this. 


i have wondered why a pitcher is given 8 pitches when he enters the 
game. let 's be serious. the relief pitcher has normally been 
throwing out in the bullpen for a few minutes. does he really need 8 
more pitches

hit a good line drive. with fastballs it 's very easy , much more

tim belcher pitched a dandy three hit shut out tonight as cincinnati won 
their second straight 5 0. pittsburgh lefty randy tomlin was hit early and 
often by the heavily right unbalanced reds line up , which managed some 
recently rare power with their bats .  . 

belcher (1 1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the 
game progressed .  . early on he had several three ball counts , but even those 
were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base on balls while 
striking out nine .  . in a post game interview he said his change up was working 
for him i should say so all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 
breaking balls. 

tomlin (0 1) , on the other hand was in trouble early , giving up a second pitch 
double to lead off batter bip roberts .  . bobby kelly followed with a single and 
barry larkin scored roberts with a sharp single to right. the big guys 
 ( mitchell , sabo , milligan ) were unable to get anything after that in fact 
they all struck out but kelly managed a score anyway due to a double steal 
and a tomlin wild pitch .  . 

in fact , it appeared that tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky 
start he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only 
2 0. randy milligan , though , had different ideas as his line shot was 
poorly played by orlando merced and turned into a triple .  . milligan would 
later score on reggie sanders  sacrifice fly , giving cinci the 3 0 lead 
after 4. 

the fifth inning spelled loss for tomlin when roberts led off with his second 
double of the game , and one batter later larkin smacked a double down the 
left field line , chasing tomlin .  . barry later would score the final run on 
tom prince 's two base passed ball. 

the pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the 
fifth when merced and kevin young hit back to back singles (the second 
being of the bunt variety ) , but carlos garcia struck out , prince fit a 
foul fly , and pinch hitter lonnie smith k 'd to end any pittsburgh hope. 

pittsburgh pitchers backed tomlin up well , though relievers blas minor , 
moeller (sp ) , and nagel gave up only two hits in their four plus innings 
work. 

barry larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he  ( mis)played ) 
bruised his right thumb .  . he was taken to the hospital for precautionary 
x rays . let 's hope he 's ok. 

cincinnati is now 4 9 , still the worst record in the majors , but with the 
two wins they may be looking at moving out of the cellar ! 
pittsburgh is now 7 6.

do n't worry. this is a perfectly normal state of affairs .  . had they 
actually been using him , you should be worried. 

i heard he was completely recovered , but now i'm not so sure. 

he 's recovered totally from his injury .  . that 's why he 's not 
pitching .  .  . so . he can rest his arm enough that he can get injured again 
pitching on 38 days rest and then have fun dining in the diamond club in

organization vista college , storm lake , ia

in article ,  ( geoffrey e dias ) writes 

the subject line says it all. what is the rule that qualifies 
a pitcher as making a save 

imho this is the most untrustworthy , silly stat , by today 's rules , in all 
of baseball .  . my understanding is to qualify as a save a pitcher cannot 
pitch more than three innings and the potential tying run must at least 
appear in the on deck circle .  . also , the lead a pitcher enters with cannot 
three runs .  . 

i believe that the official scorers must assert more of their authority in 
determining winners etc. for instance , a pitcher can come in in the 
ninth with a lead , blow the lead , fall behind , have his team come back in 
the next half inning and earn the win. has this pitcher earned a win , no 
way. 

i guy could pitch five strong innings of middle relief and see his 
teammates rally to tie the score. assume he came in to start the fourth 
and left after the eighth .  . his teammate holds the opposition scoreless in 
the ninth and they score a run in the bottom of the ninth to win. the 
third pitcher earns the win and the middle reliever gets no stat 
satisfaction .  .

sigh. here we go again. 

you started it .  .  .  . 

for predicting the future , it has been entirely meaningless .  . at least 
if it has meaning , we do n't know how to find it. 

i did not say i could predict the future. 

you most certainly did ! 

non clutch clutch 
ab h ba ab h ba 
sabo 452  . 294 . 259 59  . 228 . 
samuel 383 .245 278 83  . 299 . 

sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel .  . yet you would pinch hit 
samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and 
sabo will be a choke hitter .  . right i 'd call that predicting the 
future . 

if you were to have been the reds manager at that time , i assume you 
would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch 
hitting samuel .  . i'm sure some of that basis would have utilized 
prior performance. you just would n't have used this particular 
aspect of prior performance. is this not correct 

right. i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been 
shown to be consistent in the past. overall performance , l r splits , 
even matching hitting pitching styles .  . all of these will give me some 
advantage if used properly. 

even if all else were equal , there would be no advantage gained by 
looking at past clutch performance. and in this case , everything else 
pointed to sabo .  . 

one more time. i did not claim to be able to predict the future. 
i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would 
have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo .  . 

that comes down to the same thing. when perez left sabo in , he 
was predicting the future , the next ab .  . he was predicting that 
sabo was more likely to get a hit than samuel .  . 

by supporting the swap , you are predicting the opposite .  . 

and i am not dismissing your work. i'm stating my opinion. 
you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary 
invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult 
to your work. 

well , yes. you are aware of its existance .  . you claim to be incapable 
of understanding it  ( though i suspect you are simply  . yet 
you rather forcefully state the opposite .  . you do n't seem to think the 
work is worth reading  ( yet you obviously feel the topic is important) .  . 
i 'd say this is insulting .  . 

i did not say that it is a consistent skill. 

i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a 
certain set of circumstances .  . 

right ! this is the beef .  . it has not proven to be an indicator of 
future performance under any circumstances .  . at least none that 
we 've been able to come up with. if you know of some where it is an 
indicator of future performance , please let us in on your secret. 

it is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility 
that you actually could have some biases .  . 

most certainly .  . as i have repeatedly stated , if you can come up with 
a study which even hints at a consistent clutch ability , i would 
love it ! however the straightforward attempts at such a study have 
all failed miserably .  . 

yeah. hindsight is always 20 20. does n't that make you bright this 
is a stupid argument and you know it. 

ah .  . i knew we could get to the name calling .  . and there 's that word 
you like so much. 

well , it was a stupid argument.  ( are you honestly debating that ) 
sure , we know sabo did n't get a hit. we have no idea whether samuel 
would have done any better or not. one ab most certainly does n't 
prove anything ! 

i believe that by 
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations 
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch 
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll 
just have to wait and see. 

is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this 
a prediction for all batters who have , over the past few years , hit 
 ( xxx amount ) worse in the clutch than overall 

if you mean the first , then as you say , we 'll just have to wait and 
see. but the second is a much stronger statement. in fact , it 
suggests a rule. we can then test this rule on past data to see if it 
worked for recent years. i think you will agree that if the rule 
did n't work last year or the year before , that it is unlikely to do 
any better this year. right 

here 's another one for you. in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting 
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting 
average in non clutch situations each year. i presume you think 
this is random. 

i'm not going to get into case analysis. sure , you can find somebody 
who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. you 
can also find those who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit well in 
'92 .  . 

no , this does n't prove any overall statistical trend that can 
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers .  . it just makes me think that in 1993 
joe carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be 
as high as his ba in non clutch situations. 

's fallacy .  . unless there is reason to expect consistency , a 
run proves nothing. can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to 
correlate from one year to the next i 've seen a detailed study of 
why i should n't expect it to correlate .  . 

stupid . total idiot . 

my , my .  . such hostility .  . 

the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid.  ( and 
i do n't see how you can deny it . ) . as for total idiot yes. if you 
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might 
suggest that you are wrong , i would say the term fits nicely. 

so tell me does the term fit or do you have an open mind

as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him , the

should , but if he thinks it will , it might be a self fulfilling 
prophecy .  . 

i do n't understand. if it is williams  lack of ability (which you say 
above , and i agree with) which causes him to swing at bad pitches , how 
will thinking that bonds hitting behind him will help him to stop 
chasing bad pitches .  . 

i did n't mean that it would necessarily help him improve at that 
specific deficiency .  . i meant that if having bonds bat behind him 
gives williams  ( possibly unfounded ) confidence , that might translate 
into more hitting productivity .  . but you 're right if williams

rule 7 . states it is interference by a batter or runner when

... he runs outside the three foot line , or inside  ( to the left of) 
the foul line and , in the umpire 's judgment , interferes with the field 
er taking the throw at first base .  .  .  . 

the key word in the rule is and .  . a runner is n't out just for running 
out of the baseline .  . he 's out for interfering with the fielding of the 
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first. because the catcher 
opted to throw the ball over the batter runner 's head , there 's no inter 
 . 

sorry , i still do n't buy it. you 're certainly right that the runner is 
not out merely for running out of the baseline he must interfere with 
the play. but the argument here is over what constitutes interference .  . 
you certainly cannot infer from what you 've quoted that the batter runner 
must be hit by the ball to be guilty of interference you have n't posted 
a definition of interference at all. 

imo this calls for one of the approved ruling s that go in small print 
in the rulebook .  . something like 

approved ruling 
if in the judgement of the umpire the runner , by running to the left 
of the allowed path , caused the fielder to make a bad throw , blocks the 
vision of the fielder receiving the throw , or otherwise the 
defensive team 's making a play on him , the batter runner shall be 
guilty of interference .  . 

or 

approved ruling 
the runner cannot be judged guilty of interference in the unless he makes 
contact with a fielder or is hit by the thrown ball. 


in the absence of such an approved ruling i claim that this is a poor 
rules trivia question since it cannot be authoritatively answered.

summary let 's talks stats and not stats 

note i'm not posting this as part of an argument with roger , 
but as an independent sort of thread. i do actually quote some things 
that roger wrote , but it might be better to think of this as 
sampling his post  ( in the hip hop sense) because it fits in with what 
i want to say. 

 ( roger maynard ) writes 
but the point is that the only decision making pro 
cess used to determine the best is the score of the game and it re 
lates to the teams . not the individual players. there is no method 
inherent in baseball of comparing individual performances .  . and that 
is how it should be , because , after all , baseball is a team game. 

there 's an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball 
team and some people 's conception of a biological organism .  . in the 
biology context , we would very likely read fitness for the score of 
the game and organisms for teams . how we interpret players is 
trickier , but either organs , or genes might seem reasonable 
choices depending on what point we were trying to make. a genes 
interpretation actually might be really interesting in this case , 
but that would be a different and probably longer post. 

if , however , we take the organ view , then our knowledge of biology 
should make us pause before we start saying things like species x is 
more fit than species y because of a better organ z . given what we 
know about the interdependence of organs , we would often be suspicious 
of such claims .  .  ( but note that this type of argument is quite often 
made when you map species x onto  humans  , and organ z onto 
 . on the other hand , some statements of this kind do seem 
more reasonable than others , as far as we can test them (e . g .  .  brain  
above might be more reasonable than  pancreas  assuming no gross 
pathology , particularly if species y is a  . 

even when you make such statements , you should be concerned with the 
functioning of the whole organism , and the possibility that one organ 
might be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another. 
(not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial 
in some third species . ) . however , if we are non with any 
kind of streak , we will want to say that an organism is 
not some completely magical whole but an intriguing 
process made up of various that interact in ways that are 
potentially observable .  . some of these processes might be localized to 
particular organs , while others may be distributed across multiple 
organs .  . in a way , this is just like a baseball team , except that i 
think it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved 
in baseball are much simpler and less numerous than in most organisms .  . 

to say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab 
solutely that player a 's team would have played better with player b 
in their lineup .  . sheer speculation .  . impossible to ascertain .  . 

one thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly 
controlled experiments are sometimes very tough to do. but , of 
course , this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they 
can , and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the 
absence of certainty .  . most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation , 
but even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research. 

if you want to select a group of statistics and claim that clemens 
has done better than another pitcher with those statistics as a 
criteria , then fine. 

in this cases , we 're seeing the word statistics means summary of 
observed events , where the events themselves can be viewed as the 
output of some process , and possibly inputs for other processes .  . 
thus , if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together 
into the functioning organism , data in the form of statistics might 
give us a basis to test particular hypotheses .  . 

but you have to be able to prove that those statistics measure the 
individual 's contribution to winning the ws because that is the only 
measure of best that has any meaning in the context of baseball .  . 

this statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again. 
fitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment 
you might be fit in one situation and not another. moving to 
baseball , it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an 
environment including all the other teams in the league. in at least 
a nominal sense , the division winners are the teams in the 
league , in that they  ( on average ) had better fitness scores than any 
of their competing  . but in a real sense , there is a fairly 
large random component in the performance of each team that is 
difficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors 
intrinsic to  ( or interesting for) baseball .  . the same is true in 
biology .  . but here is also no direct biological equivalent of the 
world series in basebal .  . in the world series , the random component 
may be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played , 
and both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the 
where they were originally successful. it might be fun to watch , but 
it 's unclear what it all really means. 



now just one more un related point 

i have yet to see that any of you can predict a 
ws winner with any greater accuracy than jeanne dixon .  . 

on the other hand , you have seen some of us who can predict the 
outcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of 
teams to finishes , and maybe some of us (e . g .  . me) who can do this 
better than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis. 
but this is probably only due to the fact that a 162 game schedule 
gives you a little hope that bad hops are n't the only difference 
between the winners and the losers .  . 

moreover , you 've had the opportunity to see some analysis of the world 
series situation that makes the strong claim that nobody can predict 
the ws winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only 
to reflect the well known home vs. road effect on winning percentage .  . 

the stats are a nice hobby and that 's about it. there is no new 
knowledge being produced .  . 

since stats are summaries of events , it 's true that if you know the 
events you can derive the stats. but if somebody is trying to 
understand the process behind the stats , then the stats produce new 
knowledge , and some of this might even be reliable , repeatable , and 
useful. speaking of which , i should get back to producing knowledge 
in a different field. that is , of course , if i can produce knowledge 
even though i'm relying on stats to do it.

that he d been thrown out. and gant had a legitimate beef about 
the 1 0 pitch that was called a strike .  . a reasonable umpire would 
not have tried to force gant back into the box in that situation. 

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get 
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous 
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more 
umpires will do as did in the pitcher to pitch if 
the batter wo n't get back in the box. 

while i can see why they want to cut down on the time spent walking around , 
gant was n't ordered back in the box sooner , he was ordered back immediately. 
as soon as he stepped out , told him to get back in the box. 
now , gant does n't take a lot of walks between pitches .  . the only reason 
he did then because he was very bothered by the call. i expect his 
concentration was n't there yet , and in a crucial situation i imagine it 's 
best to be as calm as possible. contributing factors would be gant 's 
bad day at the plate , bad year at the plate , and the braves long scoring 
drought .  . 

now , it 's pretty stupid to go ahead and talk the walk when the umpire is 
telling you to get in there. you know the umpire is going to do something 
 ( call for a strike , throw you out , etc . ) .  . gant was wrong. 

but was more wrong , in my biased view. aside from the major chip 
he seemed to have on his shoulder , what was the problem. gant had a reason 
to want some time  ( disputed strike call) .  . gant had n't been wasting time all 
game. the game had been cruising along , and was just over two hours old. 
the score was 1 0 , with 2 outs in the ninth and a runner in scoring position. 
is there any reason could n't , and should n't , cut gant a little 
slack for no discernible constructive reason , disrupted the 
game , caused a five minute delay , and hurt the batter in a key 
situation. did he have a date to get to 

and i still wonder why terry was tossed earlier in the game.

1) since time immemorial , batters have complained about calls. 
so have pitchers and catchers .  . 

however , batters did n't use to go for after bad calls to the degree 
they do now. 

unless the league notified teams this year about not allowing 
complaints , was acting against expectations. 

everyone was told of the new emphasis on speeding up games. the rule that 
invoked has been in the books a long time. 

2) it 's not as if gant was in 's face . 

nobody , including , ever said he was. 


when gant turned away , immediately motioned for gant 
to step into the box. imo , at this point in time , 
was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game. 
gant was n't he had n't had a chance to  . and 
was simply exercising a power play. 

that 's your  ( perhaps colored by your of the braves ) 
perception .  . 's view was that gant was heading off for a long 
walk , and in accordance with his instructions concerning speeding games up , 
directed him into the batter 's box. 

gant resisted , as many of 
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and 
called for the pitch .  . 

the point is , based on the rulebook and the umpires  instructions , it was 
not an unreasonable request. 

the braves were already upset 

imo , any game where you remember the name of the umpire was 
a bad game for the umpire .  .

do n't worry. the bats will come alive , and the braves will come around. 
the pitching is solid , and as long the braves do n't have serious injuries 
to the starting rotation , they 'll continue to pitch well. heck , with 
the five starters on the braves rotation , they could even sustain an 
injury to one of the five (i hope this does n't happen , though) .  . 

the bats are there .  .  .  . pendleton will certainly bat over .280 , justice

much offense there to be kept quiet for much longer. right now , the

i 'll post my guesses to some of these and other trivia questions posted. 

for most career k 's with one team , if it 's not ryan , perhaps steve carlton .  . 

no way gotta be walter johnson .  . all were with washington .  . 
carlton spent too long in st. louis to collect less than 700 there. 

with the rangers , hough was there for a long time. 

i 'd also guess hough due to his length of tenure though i suspect 
bobby witt was n't far behind. maybe even jenkins snuck in close .  .  .  .  . 

in the 100 saves department .  .  . maybe . lee  ( smith(he should have at least 
a hundred with the cubbies , maybe enough with either the or cards . ) . 
then maybe , gossage  ( nyy and sd ) , fingers  ( mil , oak ) 

fingers had to have achieved 100 with either mil or with sd so , yes , 
i 'd go with that guess. otherwise i was thinking that reardon has a better 
chance of having 100 with min along with (i would think) easily reaching 100 
with mon. 

do n't know about the homers steals dept. 

gotta be willie mays .  .  . i . am fairly sure he had over 300 steals in his 
career. 

in some other article ,  ( mets trivia ) , it could be tim leary in at least 
the losing to all teams , maybe beating all of 'em too. probably seaver 
and fit too. 

hmmm .  .  . leary . is a really good point. i 'd forgotten about him. well , 
if nothing else , there are plenty of ex met pitchers in the category of 
could have lost to all teams , leary , , ryan , seaver .  .  .  .  . 
i guess the best three guesses would be leary , ryan , and either seaver or 
 .

actually , i think the large scale sample size is part of the problem. 
it seems to me that if we were to plot all the players in baseball 
in regard to ba vs. clutch ba deviation we would get some kind of 
bell curve .  . (the x axis being the deviation in clutch hitting 
vs. non clutch the y axis being the number of players . ) . certainly 
there would be some players on the extreme ends of the bell .  . my 
supposition is that if we were to find the same players consistently 
 ( year after year) at one end of the bell or the other , then we might 
be able to make some reasonable conclusions about those players 
 ( as opposed to all baseball players) .  . 

let 's be careful here. if players  performance was completely random 
in  ( clutch no clutch ) , then you would still expect some players to be 
good in the clutch every year and some to be not so good every year. 
with two years worth of data , you 'd have 1 4 of the players good each 
year , 1 4 bad each year , and 1 2 would have one good and one bad year. 
we have 96 players for 5 years  ( '84  . just flipping a coin , you 'd 
expect 3 players to be good all 5 years and 3 to be bad every year. 
this is what we actually get 

no. of good years 0 1 2 3 4 5 
clutch 4 10 37 24 18 3 
coin flip  ( random ) 3 15 30 30 15 3 

essentially the distribution of clutch by number of years 
of good performance is the same as what you would get if the process 
leading to deviations from non clutch performance was completely random. 
if there was anything to clutch hitting (at least in this definition) 
that had any predictive capability , you expect to see the number of 
players at the ends to be much larger than that predicted by flipping 
a coin .  . further , if you limit yourself to players who were a lot above 
or below average in clutch situations  ( say , 1 standard deviation from 
the mean) more than one year , the random explanation still looks good. 
in the four years  ( '84 '87 ) that i looked at the data from elias , there 
were 79 (29) players with a minimum of 25 (50) at bats in clutch 
situations that were 1 sigma from the mean two different years. of 
those 79 (29) players , 38 (14) of them changed sign between the two 
years. in other words , they were great clutch hitters one year and 
really horrible the other year. if it was just a random process , 
you 'd expect those numbers to be 39 . 5 . (14 . 5) .  . 

everything that 's been measured about clutch hitting over a period 
of years that could be used to predict any ability with any 
proposed definition has looked like a random process  ( with the 
caveat that there may be something related to platoon advantage 
that could be dragged out of the data e.g. , john lowenstein 
probably never had a clutch ab against a left handed pitcher , 
but he might well have had some in blowouts , so that there would 
be a bias since his clutch abs would be more geared to his 
platoon advantage) .  . this is not a subject that has been glanced 
at casually .  . a lot of people have put a lot of effort into 
studying it and every one of them , with the exception of the 
elias study , has been unable to find anything that would allow 
you to predict how someone will do in clutch situations better 
than flipping a coin .  .  ( self serving plug follows some of the 
flaws in the elias study are discussed in my paper in the forth 
coming sabr book , the perfect game , by taylor publishing .  . the 
authors are supposed to get a slice of the advance , so go bug 
your local bookstores now , and maybe i can get enough to take my

ought to be different. 

so , that is the reason why the toronto blue jays should keep alfredo

a team not winning does n't mean that everything that it 's doing is wrong , or 
otherwise  ( to borrow the sharks  situation ) you would say that george kingston

some folks like to argue about theoretical details. i prefer to watch teams 
win. when the giants slip to third , then we can talk about how to re arrange 
the batting order. until then , i think it 's stupid to focus on what 's wrong , 
for the simple fact that it's working as it is. 

by then , it 's too late. the problem with not fixing something while it 's 
working is that by then , there may not be anything left to fix. 

mostly , though , the giants are winning , and frankly , as long as that 
continues , it 's rather silly to second guess their strategy .  . but evidently , 
some folks would rather be right than be first.

alright , that 's enough. i 've suffered with all kinds of insults  ( as 
typical for the net) , but give me a break. galarraga is currently 
batting over .400 and you guys are complaining that he is n't drawing 
enough walks .  . what would he have to do to please you guys , bat 1.000 
you can hardly claim that he is hurting his team .

and a  . 413 . obp .  . that 's on 19 for 45 hitting with 0  ( zip , nil , nada ) walks .  . 
the reason a lot of us are down on galarraga is that he 's has a long history 
of showing that this is nowhere near his real level of ability (except for 
drawing  . if he hit .400 for , say , even 250 ab 's i 'd be convinced that 
there was a real change in his ability .  . if he did it with an obp avg , i 'd 
not only be amazed but i 'd make a bet that that would be a unique feat in

are any of these guys really that good well , in a word , no. how significant 
is galarraga 's average at the 45 ab level , a hit is worth about  . 020 .  . if 
he 'd had one of those hits called an error and one taken away by a good 
defensive play , he 'd be in the  . 380 . range. if he goes 0 for 4 in his next 
game he 's all the way down to  . 388 .  . in one game. come back in june .  . let 's 
talk then. 

if it happens that the pitchers start throwing him fewer good pitches 
and he starts making lots of outs  ( as someone speculated might happen) , 
then i would agree with you that he is n't taking enough pitches .  . my comment 
that he is n't paid to walk does n't mean that he should have a license 
to swing at bad pitches and make outs it 's more along the lines of he 's 
batting .400 and leading the league in rbi 's so what bloody difference 
does it make if he is n't drawing a lot of walks sheesh .  . 

it 's history , greg .  . andres  history is that he does n't walk much because he 
swings at bad pitches , so his average is n't very good. 45 ab 's does n't mean 
an awful lot compared to a history of a couple of thousand , especially when 
there 's ample evidence (0 bb in 1992) that his basic hitting approach has n't 
changed. yeah , he might suddenly have turned into a .400 hitter who never 
walks , but do n't bet the rent money on it.

viola has only played in the nl with the mets not possible for him 
to have defeated or lost to every team. ditto for who was mentioned

the 3rd pitcher to lose to every team is probably tom seaver , but 
it could be  . 

i do n't remember if seaver managed to get a win against the white sox

consistent hitter definitely the best in the national league. imho , to 
have williams , a hitter  ( and not really a clutch hitter ) batting 
4th ahead of bonds is simply an injustice to the giants and fans of the 
giants .  . 

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get 
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles 
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to 
walk williams to get to bonds .  . 


you 're definitely correct in that williams absolutely has to be 
in between clark and bonds .  . he must , and i mean must , get fastballs to 
hit .  .  . otherwise . he becomes little more than in disguise .  . 
what i would suggest is perhaps batting bonds , williams , and clark 
3 4 5 , the reason being that i feel bonds  potential basestealing 
abilities are wasted when he 's stuck behind two slow runners .  . 
i think the chance of getting 20 30 extra stolen bases with bonds in the 
3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 
clark in the 5 spot.

i do n't understand this at all. matt williams has demonstrated 
throughout his career that he will not wait for good pitches to hit. 
he wo n't take walks .  . he 'd rather swing .  . if i'm the opposing pitcher , 
why would i groove a fastball to williams and have him hit it well , 
when i know that williams will swing  ( and miss , or at least not hit 
very well) at a low and away curve 

matt 's problem is really more ability than attitude. it is n't that he 's 
got it in his mind that he wants to swing away , but rather that he 's 
 ( still ) a total sucker for the curve ball. it looked for a while in 
1990 that he was getting better but it 's still his weak point. 

as to whether it does him any good to have bonds behind him , the 
net . stat . will probably tell you there 's no reason that it 
should , but if he thinks it will , it might be a self fulfilling 
prophecy .  . 

as to whether the giants  lineup is optimal who knows batting bonds , 
the team 's best hitter , fifth does seem to be odd , but the 1 and 2 
hitters are n't exactly messrs .  . oba , so they are n't giving much up 
there. and although clark is n't the overall offensive force that bonds

he starts hitting one of these days .  .  .  .

at any time during this year. then you must predict either 

(1) their record the first time they 're at .500 , if they are , or 

(2) their final record , if they stay above .500 the rest of the year. 

so valentine 's earlier prediction would go as 13 13  ( resend it if you

yes everyone seems to be in agreement that the yankees are 
finally moving in the right direction. they should finish 
over .500 this year and maybe even be in the race 
in august .  . however , i would take back a few moves 

1. the jim abbott trade. 

! this was a terrific trade. snow will certainly be better than 
mattingly in the future , but that they 'll be about the same now is a 
defensible opinion. abbott is one of the few truly great pitchers in 
the game today. 

2. wade boggs .  . 

i'm not sure about this one. i think that it 's good , in that a 
pre 1992 boggs kicks hayes  ass , and that a 1992 
boggs still is n't all that shabby .  . it 's bad , though , that the 
yankees expect a pre 1992 boggs , and will probably get a 1992 boggs .  . 
however , i 'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam .  . 

3. spike owen .  . 

you have my full agreement here. he 's not all that much better than 
, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him. 
however , i do enjoy the fact that spike is not a nickname .  . 
not that this helps the yankees .  . 

4. danny tartabull .  . 

i strongly disagree. i 'd much much rather have a hundred games of 
tartabull and sixty games of dion james than 162 games of james .  .

i watched the final inning of 's no hitter with several people at 
work. after made that barehanded grab of the up the 
middle , someone remarked that if he had fielded it with his glove , he 
would n't have had time to throw riles out. yet , the throw beat riles 
by about two steps. i wonder how many others who watched the final out 
think had no choice but to make the play with his bare hand. 
does anybody think was wrong to field the ball barehanded and 
if he failed to field it cleanly , would it  ( or should it) have been an 
error or a hit  ( judging from 's grimace when the ball bounced 
past him , he must have thought it would go through for a hit . ) . whether 
was right or wrong , he certainly made one hell of a play.

to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes , 
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves. 

i do n't really mind the length of games either. if they want to speed 
the games up in sensible ways , that 's fine with me too. however , what 
i object to is the assertion by baseball people  ( whitey herzog , buck

where broke up the scoreless tie in the ninth with a two out , 
two run homer to right to win it. (it was n't the game where the fans 
threw the give away onto the field in response to the homer

was cold then. i ca n't imagine night games in april at the  . the 
wind kicked up a little , too , and i got this idea. 

at most games , there 's a pile of hot dog wrappers and cups and trash on 
the field a lot of the time. i propose a kid 's clean up corps composed 
mainly of 10 12 year old kids who would love nothing better than to run 
out on the field in the fifth inning  ( when the guy in the toro

it might not be glamorous , but at that age i probably would have given

if i were the manager , i 'd argue that the runner was out of 
the base line since he was to the left of the first base 
line. if the umps do n't budge (which they wo n't they 
er admit when they are wrong) , i 'd file a protest with the 
league. 

rule 7 . states it is interference by a batter or runner when 
in running the last half of the distance from home base to first base 
... he runs outside the three foot line , or inside  ( to the left of) 
the foul line and , in the umpire 's judgment , interferes with the field 
er taking the throw at first base .  .  .  . 

the key word in the rule is and .  . a runner is n't out just for running 
out of the baseline .  . he 's out for interfering with the fielding of the 
ball or throw or fielding of the throw to first. because the catcher 
opted to throw the ball over the batter runner 's head , there 's no inter 
 . 



so what is your definition of interfering with the fielder taking the throw 

the rule book certainly does n't have a definiton or clarification , so it 's 
possible to interpret the rule as saying that if the catcher has to alter 
his throw to avoid hitting the batter runner , then again we have interference .  . 
you know , it seems that there is no way to apply this rule justly if the 
catcher  ( or the pitcher , say rob dibble , for example) throws toward first 
and hits the runner running inside the baseline , the fielder takes the chance 
of being ejected .  . therefore he probably would throw around the runner or 
 ( your scenario ) above him. 

you should note that in our american legion league , (which uses mlb rules) we 
interpret the rule to say in this very circumstance there is interference 
per rule 7 . 09 .  .

believe. 
i do n't think he is gold glove calibre , but he does n't boot 
it around either. i think if is given a chance , 
he could become extremely productive .  . i do n't have any stats 
to back this up , and i do n't know if his defense would 
cost any games , but i think he could help and he has 
this year. he has 3 hr already. same goes for 
jim  . he has a big mouth , but he does get 
the job done when he concentrates .  . i think the situation 
with is that he believes he is a potential

granted , the fact that a team wins brings people to the ball park , but 
that does not mean they the title america 's team 
the only reason they are considered america 's team is because of ted 
turner and his little tv station which broadcasts across the nation .  . 

this is precisely why they were considered america 's team. even 
 ( especially ) when they were bad , you could see most of the braves games on 
cable. you could do that for the cubs as well , but the braves had better 
, better announcers  ( what would you rather listen to harry discuss 
the game , or skip and pete discuss ) , and teams that were n't too 
much worse. because of tbs , the braves had a lot of fans outside of georgia .  . 
at home in kentucky , even though we were much closer to cincinnati there was 
as many braves fans as reds fans , even in 1990. you could actually watch the 
braves play you had to go to cincinnati to watch the reds .  . i can go 
anywhere in america and watch the braves .  . 

i 'll consider toronto america 's team before the braves

i think that , everything else being equal , it 's not too much to ask that 
if a game can be shortened by half an hour by cutting out warmup 
pitches , outside the batter 's box , commercial time outs and that 
sort of thing , i'm not asking for too much. 

how do you know they can be shortened by half an hour has anybody done a 
study to determine how much time is actually wasted say , in these a 's 
games 

oh , probably. 

ms. nichols has given the average game times  ( and average runs scored ) for 
1983 and 1992. (a very nice piece of information , ms. nichols .  . who knows 
she may be listening , and not have me in her kill file after all . ) . those 
numbers indicate somewhere in the neighborhood of half a run less being 
scored per game , and the games taking 15 minutes longer . something is 
being done now that was n't done ten years ago , which is extending the games 
by 15 minutes. ms. nichols thinks it 's more pitches .  . given the increasing 
of pitchers , it would n't surprise me. 

if it 's not simply more pitches , though , i do n't think it 's unreasonable 
to think that something can be done to get ten of those minutes back. then 
i get a couple more from shortening the warmup time for a relief pitcher 
after he comes in , and a couple more still from enforcing existing rules , 
which have been stated in other posts in this thread  ( and other related ones) .  . 

the problem is , who decides whether that time is wasted you do n't seem 
to think it is at all. right now , i think it is , although i have heard one 
case favoring giving the reliever all the he thinks he needs (the 
difference in between the field and pen ) but who knows if the 
rules get changed , maybe something i did n't foresee will happen to change my 
mind. but you can bet a lot of minds would fail to foresee the same thing , 
or else nothing will be changed.

also , i have the impression from reading this group and bill james

charge as much as they can for baseball statistical info 


and bill james is not yeah. sure. do you own the bill james players

uh , bill james does n't sell statistics. he sells books with statistics , 
but he is not in the business of providing stats like elias , stats , 
howe , baseball workshop etc. are. 

greg 

funny , it seems to me that the stats major league and minor league handbooks , 
which are nothing but collections of statistics , are authored by bill james 
and stats inc.  ( and howe , for the minor league handbook ) . 

and i am not sure how the 1993 bill james player ratings book qualifies 
as a book with statistics , while the elias analyst is a statistics book . 
the analyst contains more stats , sure , but it also contains more dialogue .  . 

finally , the point was not about the word statistics . it was about 
money grubbing . i do n't see how anyone who has looked at the bill 
james player ratings book cannot consider him money grubbing .  .

the phillies have won two games back to back in extra innings .  . last 
night 's game was hard fought .  . the game in chicago should have been a 
blow out. all in all these two games show a different phillies team. 
in past seasons they tended to always be on the short end of 1 run 
games. i do n't know how many times i saw them losing by only 1 run. 
if they were able to win most of those , they might have been more of 
a contending team. they are 3 0 so far in extra innings .  . and of 
course , they are 10 3.

are you sure about this 

i 'd say pitching around him is more likely. 


yeah , maybe that is more likely. but from the mariners tigers 
series , it seems like every time there are base runners , the pitchers 
seem to purposely pitch around him or give him a free pass. the 
funny thing was that griffey was struggling up until the last game of the

the original poster wanted to know how the big cat looked .  . i was also at 
the saturday game in montreal  ( apr 17) that rockies won 9 1. i have n't 
paid much attention to since he left the expos but his stance 
seemed to be much different. he stands more erect and very open , with his 
left foot pointing to 3rd base. i'm wondering if this is a recent change 
in stance for him andres had one glaring weakness as a hitter .  . he could 
always be fooled by a curve ball low and away. if this is indeed a new 
stance for him , maybe he is not being fooled as easily as for his patience , 

dennis martinez definitely did not have his good stuff. if he was 
pitches to andres , you can hardly fault him for drilling them (which he did ! ) .  . 
does andres generally start hot or cold does it take until may for most 
pitchers to have confidence in that curve ball low and away

while we 're on the multipurpose subject , let 's not forget shea , which 
was designed to accommodate both the mets jets .  . it was the first 
stadium (i think) to have the box seats on rollers so they could be 
oriented at right angles for baseball in parallel for football. 

minor point shea stadium was designed as a multi purpose stadium but 
not with the jets in mind as the tennant .  . the new york football giants 
had moved to yankee stadium (from the grounds ) in 1958 and was 
having problem with stadium management (the city did not own yankee 
stadium until 1972) .  . the idea was to get the giants to move into shea .  . 
when a deal was worked out between the giants and the yankees the 
new franchise , the new york titans , approached the city about using 
the new stadium .  . the titans were playing in downing stadium (where the 
cosmos played soccer in the  . because shea stadium was tied into 
the world 's fair anyway , the city thought it would be a novel idea to 
promote the new franchise and the world 's fair  ( like they were doing 
with the  . so the deal was worked out. 

of course , with the jets gone to jersey  ( and a truly good football 
stadium) , the mets are saddled with a multipurpose stadium where , 
because it 's circular , the seats are almost always too far from the 
action. the mets announcers kiner murphy in particular have 
always hyped it as beautiful shea 
stadium , a tipoff to how unbeautiful it truly is. 

i'm under the impression that when murph says it , he means it ! as a 
regular goer to shea , it is not a bad place since they 've cleaned and 
the place. remember , this is its 30th year !

ideally , should be the strongest offensive players , because 
any schmoe can play dh if he can hit. that would take care of position 
corrected such as frank 's .  . since that is not the case  ( and why 
not is it always this way ) then we are going to have trouble finding the 
true value of using the same models as that for position players. 

there are several reasons for this difference. the main reason is that 
good hitters in their prime  ( such as frank thomas and danny tartabull ) 
are rarely regular dh 's , even if they ca n't field it 's more commonly a 
place to put aging veterans .  . 

another use of the dh slot is to help a player come back from injury 
slowly , getting his bat in the lineup without forcing him to play in the 
field. i would expect such players to hit worse as dh 's than they did 
during the rest of the season. 

a third factor is that most player who split time between dh and first 
or the outfield do n't hit as well as dh 's for some reason. reggie 
jackson was a good example in five years as a rf dh for the angels , he 
hit like the old reggie when he was in right. 

the second and third factors will be lost if players are considered by 
their primary position only a player who plays 90 games in right and 60 
at dh will count only in the right fielders  averages .  . 

a logical starting place would be to look at defensive replacement 
value  ( if you can find it) for 1b or lf or something. we can assume that 
if forced to play defense they would play at true zero value , even though i 
doubt this is actually true for players like winfield and molitor .  . this 
would let us discount the time they spend playing dh , because that 
forces the team to find another real fielder to play. 

this makes sense you might also look at it another way. although the 
average offensive performance of a dh may be lower than for a left 
fielder , the replacement level offensive performance is certainly 
lower if you are a left fielder but ca n't hit well enough to keep a job 
anywhere , then you certainly ca n't hit well enough to keep a job at dh .  .

when gant turned away , immediately motioned for gant 
to step into the box. imo , at this point in time , 
was determined to show gant exactly who was in charge of this game. 
gant was n't he had n't had a chance to  . and 
was simply exercising a power play. gant resisted , as many of 
us might to what we thought was an unreasonable request , and 
called for the pitch .  . at that point , cox came out on 
the field , the pitch was thrown , and many other braves left the 
dugout .  . cox was tossed protecting his player . i was pleasantly 
surprised that gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game. 

did you see the same game i saw gant , most reasonable , argued a 
horrible call which , correctly , did nothing about. gant 
then proceeded to walk halfway to 3rd base , lean on his bat and 
glare at  . while i do n't subscribe to the 
theory of showing people up , this was an obvious attempt by gant to 
do so to  . he left no choice but to take control 
of the situation. the bottom line is gant started a dangerous 
power struggle with when his team needed him most and 
he lost. 

the events i saw were 
1) called strike by 
2) shocked looking gant asks for appeal to first 
3) no appeal to first 
4) gant steps out of batters box. 
5) immediately orders gant back in. bad move 
6) gant ignores and walks off. bad move 
7) yells at gant .  . gant is silent .  . 
8) calls for the pitch .  . 
9) pitch is called a strike .  . 
10) cox argues  ( could n't see when he came on the field ) 
11) cox is ejected , players everywhere 
12) play finally resumes .  . 

gant should n't have ignored  . not returning made the strike 
call fairly likely. although i suspect an argument might have gotten 
gant tossed altogether. but if had let gant step out , the 
whole incident probably would have been avoided .  .

in article (robert and stimets ) writes 


in a game that saw a little of everything incredible defense , some power , 
clutch pitching , and a little the reds managed to overcome their 
trademark lack of timely hitting in crucial situations .  .  .  . 

during spring training i made a similarly looking comment 
about clutch hitting on this bb and the flames were flying .  . no such 
thing as clutch hitting they (the sdcn 's) all screamed .  . i assumed 
they also meant there was no such thing as any kind of clutch performance , 
given their comments. 

this is certainly not the case. there is no significant ability 
perform in the clutch , but clutch performance certainly happens every 
time there is a game winning hit. the clutch pitching quoted above is 
something which happened , not a claim that any particular player should 
be expected to be a clutch pitcher .  . 

over the past four seasons sabo has had 59 hits in 259 abs defined as 
clutch situations (by the scouting report ) for an average of  . 228 .  . 
over that same period he had another abs with 452 hits for an 
average of  . 294 .  . 

according to the rest of the sdcn 's , any differential such as this is 
completely and totally random and cannot be used for any reasonable 
inference , such as perhaps perez should have used a pinch hitter in 
that situation. 

simple statistics tell me that there is a 2 chance an average clutch 
hitter would have this large a split (the average decrease is 7 points , 
standard deviation about 30) .  . there will be such hitters in any league , 
just as there will be hitters who hit poorly on tuesdays .  . 

and there is only a very weak correlation ( . 01 . in my best study) between 
clutch hitting in the last four years and clutch hitting this year , 
probably because most of the clutch data is by luck rather 
than any ability .  . based only on this data , i do n't see any reason to 
pinch hit for sabo , or any other player who had been a poor clutch 
hitter in the past. 

but there are many other factors involved in a decision to pinch hit. 
does the pinch hitter give you a platoon advantage  ( any portion of 
sabo 's clutch split that results from his platoon split is certainly a 
real ability , even if it has nothing to do with clutch hitting . ) . do you 
have a singles hitter at the plate when you need a home run do you 
have a curveball pitcher facing a batter who has trouble with curves

as the sox tended to go down quickly and was also 
working fast. the sox relief pitching was ok the runs off 
were on two ridiculous and a hard line single 
which greenwell let get past him trying for a catch .  . 

greenwell 's mental stability is a serious concern (i guess it 
has always been , but his quirks were amusing back when he was 
an mvp  . wednesday he got in a huff with johnson a 
after striking out on a bad inside pitch  ( apparently johnson 
made an ok , i 've got to stay focused gesture which iron mike 
interpreted as taunting ) , and struck out to heavy the 
next two times. as valentine noted , last night he came up in 
the first after riles and quintana had walked to open the game. 
can you say take the first pitch not mike , who it 
into a 6 4 3. the pi quoted that this was a batting 
practice fastball . next time up he also hit the first pitch , 
a hard liner straight to in center. he also made the 
pathetic error and failed to catch boone 's hr (which looked 
comparable to the ball lance johnson caught on the highlight 
reel that night) .  . 

is riles to be good defensively i could n't tell from 
the field angle but his range looked bad , and he a dp 
that cost a run or two. why was he leadoff i hope fletcher 
gets well soon. 

also on lineups , put bret boone fifth for reasons beyond 
me. it seemed to work , as he was 3 4 with a hr and some good 
defense (a wag behind us said he sure do n't want to go back to 
calgary ! ) there is a theory that you put a leadoff type fifth 
because they 'll likely lead off the second  ( as boone did) .  . 

well , now we face the hot angels and another power pitcher in 
langston .  . a reminder that contest entries are open through next 
wednesday i expect a surge of pessimism .  . by the way , ties will 
be broken by earliest entry. one entry per person or pseudonym ,

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike 
to them , than because they have a great eye 

i'm not sure. i used to think this was true , but more and more i'm becoming 
convinced that it 's the other way around among players with the physical 
ability to hit the ball real hard , the patient ones are the ones who get the 
chance to do it a lot. 

let 's break down the four basic categories of hitter , according to whether 
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot 


power no power 

patient frank thomas brett butler 
barry bonds ozzie smith 
mark mcgwire craig 
babe ruth miller 
ted williams billy hamilton 
rickey henderson eddie 
joe morgan mike 
. . 
. . 
. . 

impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen 
dave kingman dunston 
joe carter andres thomas 
george bell jose lind 
kirby puckett devon white 

okay , i think we all agree that singles hitters should take a 
strike or two and try to get on base any way they can. 

so the no power impatient guys have no excuse. 
the no power patient guys are doing the right thing. 

now the impatient power guys  ( how could you leave out the big cat ) .  . 
would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took 
more pitches perhaps , but i doubt it. if you tell joe carter 
to go up there and take a few pitches , he will draw more walks , but 
he also wo n't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because 
he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive. 

the patient power guys joe morgan had a small strike zone and 
rickey henderson has a strike zone the size of hitler 's heart 
so they get their walks based on the small zone. 

look at the other 5 guys thomas , bonds , mcgwire , ruth and williams .  . wow ! 
a lot of pitchers would rather at the corners and maybe 
walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them. 
the pitchers would do better  ( in my opinion) by just coming after 
them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch , but pitchers 
would rather , go 2 0 or 3 1 and then get hurt.

well , this may be good news. if hits , i 'd look for bream to be

hits. 

according to the atlanta paper , bream will be the full time first baseman

for a pinch runner .  . he 'd have to hit a homer in his first ab  ( or win the

if this is true  ( note that i do n't think it is) , lasorda should be 
fired for at least two reasons 

1) publicly humiliating his players 
2) knuckling under to his players wishes. 

there is a fine line between getting players  input and knuckling 
under to players  demands .  . a manager , much like a military officer , 
needs to have his  ( her ) players  complete obedience and respect during 
a game. after the game , it 's no big deal , but when there is no time 
to do more than react , players must trust the manager or the team often 
falls apart  ( see boston red sox , ff .  . ) ) 

strawberry 's as represented by the media , often sounds like 
demands .  . i suspect that a comment like i enjoy hitting fourth i'm 
used to it would get pretty brutally misinterpreted by the media if 
it came from strawberry .  . russ porter quoted strawberry as saying , 
i feel more comfortable hitting cleanup and i think i perform best 
in that role.  ( paraphrased by my memory and bias . ) . that seems like 
a fairly non answer to what was almost certainly a question 
like , how do you feel about being moved to the third spot in the order 
a more media sensitive player might answer the manager knows what he is 
doing. if he thinks that batting me third will help the team , then i 
am all for it. we 'd ignore that answer as brown stuff , so it seems a 
little bit of an overreaction to brand darryl 's response as  . 

personally , i think his argument is nonsense and that it really does n't 
matter much in which order the 2 5 players in the order are batted , 
except for personal stats. if i were darryl , i 'd probably answer that 
question , the number four spot gets a few more rbi opportunities and i get 
paid for rbis .  . i think it is best for me to bat fourth , but i am willing 
to hit third if tommy thinks it will benefit the team. or something like 
that. it would be helpful at salary time my rbis were down because i was 
hitting third and make him sound like a team player. since strawberry 
will not likely go through arbitration , but use the free agent market for 
his next contract , maybe that argument is useless , but it would help 
his image with the media without appearing to be totally content free. 

remember , the media is of the belief that one 's best rbi man should hit 
fourth , so the argument is sensible , regardless of whether or not it is 
true.

the events i saw were 
1) called strike by 
2) shocked looking gant asks for appeal to first 
3) no appeal to first 
4) gant steps out of batters box. 
5) immediately orders gant back in. bad move 

even i noticed that gant 's was not one of a batter 
attempting to regain his concentration .  . gant was off. 
i wonder if gant said something to the ump 

6) gant ignores and walks off. bad move 

actually , there was a small hand wave by gant .  .  . as . if to say 
 do n't bother  . gant may have said something here , too. 

7) yells at gant .  . gant is silent .  . 
8) calls for the pitch .  . 
9) pitch is called a strike .  . 
10) cox argues  ( could n't see when he came on the field ) 

cox was already halfway to the ump when the strike was called. 

11) cox is ejected , players everywhere 
12) play finally resumes .  . 

gant should n't have ignored  . not returning made the strike 
call fairly likely. although i suspect an argument might have gotten 
gant tossed altogether. but if had let gant step out , the 
whole incident probably would have been avoided .  . 

my impression was that gant was not  stepping out . ' . he was making 
a protest about the lack of an appeal to first. as has been 
pointed out earlier , there is no appeal to first on a strike .  . 
i can understand gant feeling a little pressure in a two out , 
risp , 1 0 game , ninth inning .  . he let it get to him. the ump 
also overreacted .  . gant was off , but i doubt he would 
have been gone long. should have let him have a 
moment to compose himself before telling him to come bat .  . 
imho , umpires should be more flexible than what 
showed .  . gant was disturbed to the point it was pretty likely 
he would not get a hit. 

a very bad finish to a pretty good game.

just watch me. mattingly is a below average fielder .  . 

before you start up , yes , i have proof. there are really only two 
adequate ways to measure fielding prowess .  . the first , which has the 
advantage of being applicable to older players , since it uses raw data 
available for almost all of mlb history , is the total chances per game 
method favored by the total baseball people among others. it basically 
says that you measure a fielder by how many balls he gets to. 

but it is subject to all kinds of bias , and is almost completely useless 
for first basemen .  . from the raw stats , there is no way to tell which of 
a first baseman 's putouts were made on throws from other fielders , and 
which were made on his own plays likewise , you ca n't tell whether a 
double play was 6 4 3 or 3 6 3. fielding runs thus gives a first 
baseman no credit for putouts or double plays , only for assists and 
errors. 

it thus favors first basemen who play deep , reaching a lot of balls but 
forcing the pitcher to cover first more frequently .  . it also hurts first 
baseman who play behind left handed pitching staffs and thus face few 
left handed batters .  . 

a better method , but newer and based that has only been collected 
over the last few years , measures the percentage of balls hit into the 
part of the field the guy is responsible for. 

this is better of course , it still is n't all of a first baseman 's 
defense .  . 

some references mattingly 's 1992 defensive rating , stats method , from 
mike 's baseball player and team ratings 1. 

defensive average , which uses larger  ( and probably better) zones , has 
mattingly tied for second in the league. 

on the other hand , he has contributed 233 runs by his batting 
actions , a pretty healthy number. 

while 233 batting runs is good , it is mostly in the past the runs he 
produced in 1986 do n't say much about his value in 1993.

total baseball , which also tries to evaluate a player 's total offensive 
and defensive contributions , gives barry bonds a total player rating of 
9.0 for 1992. only one other player since ruth attained that mark cal 
ripken for his 1984 season. rounding out the top five offensive players 
in the nl last season sheffield , 5.9 sandberg , 5.8 van , 5.3 and 
larkin , 4 . 7 .  . 

the top 5 offensive players in the al in 1992 were e. martinez , 4.8 
ventura , 4.8 anderson , 4.5 r. henderson , 4.4 and thomas , 4.4 

in short , total baseball says bonds enjoyed one of the best seasons 
ever in the game 's history better than any year had by mantle , 
mays , williams , etc.  ( if you disagree , do n't flame me flame the 
writers of total baseball . ) . also , martinez and ventura are neck and 
neck , so given the shortcomings of any statistical analysis , which one 
had the better year can be considered a toss up. thus , total baseball 
supports your choices of bonds and ventura as the mvps of 1992.

sigh. here we go again. 

actually , several 's stated that there were no definable skills 
that would make a hitter more likely to perform better in clutch 
situations vs. non clutch situations , however one might choose to 
define clutch . 

right. can you define such a skill 

must i if i were to say that batting average is a predictor that 
can be used to judge which of two hitters is more likely to get a 
hit on a particular plate appearance , is that only valid if i can 
define the skill in hitting a baseball that 's all i 've said , 
except i used the smaller sample of batting average in clutch situations. 

and elsewhere on this thread sherri nichols repeats her position 
that batting average in clutch situations is a meaningless statistic .  . 

for predicting the future , it has been entirely meaningless .  . at least 
if it has meaning , we do n't know how to find it. 

i did not say i could predict the future. i 've suggested that the 
statistic is not necessarily meaningless .  . here 's the data for this 
situation 

non clutch clutch 
ab h ba ab h ba 

sabo 452  . 294 . 259 59  . 228 . 
samuel 383 .245 278 83  . 299 . 


if you were to have been the reds manager at that time , i assume you 
would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch 
hitting samuel .  . i'm sure some of that basis would have utilized 
prior performance. you just would n't have used this particular 
aspect of prior performance. is this not correct 


i 'll try to avoid being insulting .  . but it 's difficult when you so 
dismiss hundreds of hours of work with an i do n't pretend 
to understand , but .  .  .  . 

nobody is denying that there are people who have hit well in the 
clutch in the past. but i challenge you to find a method to predict 
who will hit well in the clutch in the future . which , after all , is 
what you are claiming you can do. since 


one more time. i did not claim to be able to predict the future. 
i said that i accept the above data as an indication that samuel would 
have had a better chance for success in that situation than sabo .  . 

and i am not dismissing your work. i'm stating my opinion. 
you are saying that your work renders any opinion to the contrary 
invalid , so that the retention of that opinion is some kind of insult 
to your work. 


fine. we have plenty of data. obviously our biases must 
be coloring our work , since you know clutch hitting is a 
well defined and consistent skill , all of our failures 
not withstanding .  . so i challenge you to prove it ! i guarantee you 
that if you can prove the existance of some form of clutch ability , 
you will have plenty of happy dancing around you. 

i did not say that clutch hitting is well defined .  . 

i said that the data is significant to me. 

i did not say that it is a consistent skill. 

i have said that it is an indicator of performance under a 
certain set of circumstances .  . 


but you are n't going to win any support by merely stating a position 
and claiming  they are stupid , so i must be right' .  . 


and , big sigh 


i have not 
not 
not 
not 
not 
not 
not ever called you or anyone else on r . s . b .  . stupid . 


it is nice , however , to see that you will consider the possibility 
that you actually could have some biases .  . 


yeah. hindsight is always 20 20. does n't that make you bright this 
is a stupid argument and you know it. 

ah .  . i knew we could get to the name calling .  . and there 's that word 
you like so much. 


a suggestion take data from 1990 1991 , and attempt to come up with 
some method that predicts who hit well in the clutch in 1992. if that 
works , we can then attempt to apply it to 1993 and beyond .  . 

wait a minute. i thought i first had to define clutch hitting .  . 
do i , or do n't i 

you have made strong statements .  . now back them up or be proven a 
total idiot. 

i made two statements in my post. 

1. i am not convinced of your conclusions regarding clutch hitting .  . 

2. i would have hit for sabo .  . 


as for 2 , many of us make a number of written statements through 
this media about what we think will happen in baseball .  . i'm not 
shy about it. i 'll make the statement again. i believe that by 
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations 
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch 
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll 
just have to wait and see. 



here 's another one for you. in 1989 1991 joe carter 's batting 
average in clutch situations was significantly below his batting 
average in non clutch situations each year. i presume you think 
this is random. 

non clutch 1585 ab 411 h .259 
clutch 338 ab 68 h .201 

so what could we expect in 1992 from mr. carter 

well , his composite ba through 1989 was .268 through 1990 was 
.262 through 1991 was  . 263 . , so i think we have a pretty good 
idea of what kind of batting average he can produce .  . in 1992 
he hit  . 264 .  . not surprising , huh also in 1992 

non clutch 536 ab 144 h  . 269 . 
clutch 86 ab 20 h .233 

no , this does n't prove any overall statistical trend that can 
be used to predict future performance across the breadth of 
major league ballplayers .  . it just makes me think that in 1993 
joe carter 's batting average in the clutch is not going to be 
as high as his ba in non clutch situations. 


as for 1  ( above ) , i have plenty of company. john of stats , inc. is 
the editor of the scouting report wherein the statistics regarding 
clutch hitting are compiled , reported and referenced in the text. 
bill james makes numerous references to a player 's ability to hit 
well in the clutch .  . i am not saying that i can predict the future 
any more than they are. you  ( and others) are saying that your 
work renders their statements  ( and mine) meaningless .  . i do n't 
accept that , which in your words proves that i am a total idiot .

hi there , 

i'm german and i have been into this mlb stuff since almost one year now. 
there are many problems occuring for me. one of them is the era statistic for 
pitchers .  . what does it say 

era indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per 
nine inning game. thus , if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned 
run , his 9 inning would be 3 earned runs , thus his era 
is 3 . 00 .  . to compute the era you simply take the number of earned runs divided 
by the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9. 

era  ( er ip) 9 

i think there is another formula for era. i heard something about it last 
year. im not sure what it is , but im gonna give it a stab .  . it allows for 
a pitcher to pitch more than 9 innings at a time and not benefit , cuz it 
uses outs recorded instead of innings pitched .  .  .  . 

era  ( er 27) outs recorded 

like i said , im not sure this is exactly it , but im pretty sure they changed 
it to something of the sort .  . 


an earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed 
to a fielding error. more specifically , if an error occurs that represented 
the third out , all runs scored after the error are considered unearned runs .  . 
earned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base 
when the pitcher exited the game. here are some examples 

if there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base. if 
an error occurs that represents the third out , all of the runs after 
this error and not counted as earned runs .  . 

if a pitcher issues some base on balls  ( walks ) , and leaves the game

were left on base. if the those runners who were left on base score , 
and the score was not a result of an error , those runs are

a reasonable umpire would do as he 's been instructed to do this season get 
the batters back in the box sooner to try to cut down on the ridiculous 
length of games. i for one am glad to see this happen , and hope more 
umpires will do as did in the pitcher to pitch if 
the batter wo n't get back in the box. 


a reasonable umpire would have recognized that ron gant was 
disturbed with the call. a reasonable umpire would have realized that 
there was a 1 run game in progress , with two outs in the ninth .  . what 
ron gant did was try to regain his  . what a normal baseball 
player would have done would have been to get into a heated argument 
with the umpire , and since you ca n't argue balls and strikes , he would 
have been ejected from the game. ron gant , by trying to avoid such a 
conflict , was penalized for showing some restraint .  . 

incidentally , a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been 
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire , as gant 
requested .  . if the home plate umpire had appealed to first , the first base 
umpire could have wrung up the strike , and gant would not have been so 
upset. if the call had been a ball , and the catcher had requested the 
appeal , it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help. 

finally , the entire game was pretty much a mockery of the so called 
efforts to speed up the game. the game was played very quickly , it was 
just at 2 hours when the stuff happened in the ninth , and the only delays

now that time has passed , what would the posts be like if rickey were driving

say if bonds , drunk out of his skull , smashed his car into a tree disabling 
himself , say , willie mcgee for the season i can tell you. they would be 
considered spoiled , lazy  ( say it)  . 

this awfully of you , to assume you can read our minds and 
predict the future. what makes you so sure i would be thinking these things 
what makes you think that there 's not a lot of people out there do n't think 
crews is a god anyone who is dead because of a mistake deserves sympathy , be 
it crews , olin , bonds , mcgee , rickey , or you , or me . why . does it bother you so 
much that two dead white men are getting a little sympathy would it make you 
feel better if we only dead black baseball players 

to beat a dead horse , i seem to remember a fair amount of sympathy for 
some black fringe player named roberto clemente .  . and for roy 
campanella .  . and for thurman munson .  . and for just about anyone else 
who we may not even have liked as players , but for dying too young. 

wiggins , alan 

but that 's besides the point. i'm sure people would feel slightly 
sympathetic for rickey if he were killed. but , they would also be 
criticizing him a lot more for his actions .  . 

example 

how about jose canseco he gets a couple of speeding tickets , and all 
of the sudden his attitude is awful. what the hell do speeding tickets 
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway so why do sportswriters 
talk about it all the time. 

or brian hunter and keith mitchell both of whom had problems 
towards the end of last year.  ( two years ago ) it was cited as a sign 
of their immaturity , etc. 

meanwhile , dykstra almost killed both himself and , and i did n't 
read any complaining about that. they may have talked 
about how bad it was for the phillies , but i never read anywhere 
criticism of dykstra 's character  ( or 's intelligence , for that

i did not say i could predict the future. 

you most certainly did ! 

i really do n't want to get into a didnot debate with you. but 
this is somewhat at the heart of our disagreement .  . i did not say , 
nor did i imply , that i could predict the future. you have inferred 
that my comments meant this , and you have based your rebuttal of my 
comments on the fact that statistical studies have demonstrated that 
there is no reasonable basis for predicting future performance in 
regard to clutch hitting .  . 


sabo 452  . 294 . 259 59  . 228 . 
samuel 383 .245 278 83  . 299 . 

sabo is clearly a better hitter than samuel .  . yet you would pinch hit 
samuel because you predict that samuel will be a clutch hitter and 
sabo will be a choke hitter .  . right i 'd call that predicting the 
future . 

that is your opinion that sabo is clearly a better hitter than 
samuel .  . the above data is for a 4 year period ending last season. 
last season samuel batted .272 while sabo hit  . 244 . (not park  . 
this season they are both hitting below .200 , albeit sabo with more 
at bats .  . i will agree that over his career sabo has been a better 
hitter than samuel , but i will also remind you that samuel has been 
a better hitter in certain situations than sabo .  . 

i did not predict that sabo would choke , nor that samuel would get a 
hit. i expressed my opinion that had i been the reds manager  ( or 
even a reds fan) that i would prefer to have samuel hit in that 
situation than sabo .  . 


if you were to have been the reds manager at that time , i assume you 
would have had some basis for letting sabo hit rather than pinch 
hitting samuel .  . i'm sure some of that basis would have utilized 
prior performance. you just would n't have used this particular 
aspect of prior performance. is this not correct 

right. i would have used aspects of prior performance which have been 
shown to be consistent in the past. overall performance , l r splits , 
even matching hitting pitching styles .  . all of these will give me some 
advantage if used properly. 

ah .  . properly . yes. i see. 

even if all else were equal , there would be no advantage gained by 
looking at past clutch performance. and in this case , everything else 
pointed to sabo .  . 

please help me. what , exactly , is everything else that pointed to sabo 


well , yes. you are aware of its existance .  . you claim to be incapable 
of understanding it  ( though i suspect you are simply  . yet 
you rather forcefully state the opposite .  . you do n't seem to think the 
work is worth reading  ( yet you obviously feel the topic is important) .  . 
i 'd say this is insulting .  . 

i must say , i was not aware of the publication .  . can you email me the 
information regarding its availability 

and i guess i must apologize to all of those who have done extensive 
study on , say , supply side economics .  . i did n't mean to insult you. 
but i never did believe you were on the right path. i'm sorry for 
my contrary opinion position. i also regret that i do n't have the 
ability to prove that you are wrong. but you are. 


i believe that by 
season 's end that chris sabo 's batting average in clutch situations 
will be significantly lower than his batting average in non clutch 
situations. i ca n't prove that it will happen , so i guess we 'll 
just have to wait and see. 

is this simply a prediction for chris sabo for this year or is this 
a prediction for all batters who have , over the past few years , hit 
 ( xxx amount ) worse in the clutch than overall 

it is what it says it is ! 

if you mean the first , then as you say , we 'll just have to wait and 
see. but the second is a much stronger statement. in fact , it 
suggests a rule. we can then test this rule on past data to see if it 
worked for recent years. i think you will agree that if the rule 
did n't work last year or the year before , that it is unlikely to do 
any better this year. right 


the second is your statement , not mine. 


i'm not going to get into case analysis. sure , you can find somebody 
who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit poorly in '92 as well. you 
can also find those who hit poorly from '89 '91 and then hit well in 
'92 .  . 

well , actually , i have n't yet. but i'm not finished looking. 
that is , i have n't yet found someone who hit significantly below 
his overall batting average in clutch situations for the years 
1989 91 , and then reversed that relationship in 1992. 


's fallacy .  . unless there is reason to expect consistency , a 
run proves nothing. can you give us a reason to expect clutch ba to 
correlate from one year to the next i 've seen a detailed study of 
why i should n't expect it to correlate .  . 

nope .  . sorry. but if you were interested in a reason why i expect 
chris sabo 's ability to hit in the clutch to correlate from one 
year to the next , i think i could. if you were interested in a 
reason why i expect joe carter 's ability to hit in the clutch to 
correlate from one year to the next , i think i could. but you 're 
not interested in that , because you think that those conclusions 
could only be valid if they could be over the entire 
baseball population .  . and they ca n't be. 


the stupid was in reference to a statement which was stupid.  ( and 
i do n't see how you can deny it . ) . as for total idiot yes. if you 
prove yourself unwilling to even consider evidence that might 
suggest that you are wrong , i would say the term fits nicely. 

the problem here is that i do believe you. i accept your work. 
i believe that trying to predict future clutch performance based 
on prior clutch history is meaningless .  . no better than a coin toss .  . 
i actually do accept your work. 

as it happens , i also have an opinion that in certain situations , 
for certain players , a history of superior or inferior ability to 
hit in the clutch might suggest a reason what such history could be 
valid in projecting future player performance. for that player. 
and chris sabo is one such player. 


so tell me does the term fit or do you have an open mind 

well , since i defer to your statistical wisdom , i think i must have 
an open mind. now we have to pose the same question to you.

stuff deleted 
mattingly scores badly on both counts. he does n't get to very many 
balls , and he lets a lot of balls go through. the fact that he looks 
smooth , has great hands , and makes few errors means nothing. this is 
traditional brainless reliance on observations that can easily be 
misled .  . like a lot of bad fielders , mattingly actually makes himself 
look better by not having any range. he 's nowhere near as bad as steve 
garvey , but that 's not much of a compliment. 

i agree with the flavor of this post , but disagree with one specific 
argument. that has great hands means nothing. it seems to me that 
a first baseman 's defensive value is not entirely  ( or even primarily ) 
from his ability to field grounders or catch popups .  . how many such 
chances does he get during a game many fewer than he gets chances 
to catch throws from 2b , ss , 3b and p (i mean the total of these is 
much higher than grounder popup  . this implies to me that there 
is value in catching these throws well , even if they are high , up the line 
or in the dirt .  . good hands are needed for such plays , and thus have 
value. i do n't have any numbers for the relative number of 
of these plays , but i 'd guess that the values of these abilities are 
similar. it 's just like you do n't judge catcher 's defense primarily 
on how they field and popups .  .  ( but not as marked i suppose) .  .

major league baseball is trying to expand its appeal to people with shorter 
attention spans (i . e .  . the football crowd) .  . ( invariably , all the 
arguments from people who do n't like to watch baseball on t.v. say the 
same thing the games are too long and too boring. baseball is trying 
to find a way to shorten the games for wider t.v. appeal. if you look at 
it , though , baseball games last around the same amount of time as football 
games. the difference is that there is more action in that duration in 
football games. perhaps if there were more action in baseball games , you 
would get more of those fans to tune in. anyway , coming up with a solution 
to make baseball more appealing to a bigger crowd is going to be difficult.

yeah , morris just knows how to win. that 's why he lost 18 for detroit in 
1990. funny how he wins a lot of games when he pitches on good teams but 
loses a lot when he pitches on bad ones. and if rings was the only 
criteria for success , then teams would always tend to repeat , and 
eventually you 'd have the same team win the ws every  year. sort

morris is a decent pitcher on the downside of a good , not great , career. 
toronto will finish 3rd or 4th this year , with morris and all those

i agree with nick .  . what 's the big deal about long games if you want 
to watch baseball , there 's that much more baseball to watch. and yes , 
baseball includes the space between plays as well as the plays themselves. 

first , a longer game in no way suggests more baseball to watch , unless

are so because of batters stepping out of the box , pitchers taking 
longer between pitches and excessive trips to the mound by managers 
and pitching coaches .  . 

and while it 's true that the gaps between plays can be interesting , this 
is only true when they do n't become extra long. quickly pitched games 
can grab and hold your attention much better.

rf of all time , as far 
as anyone can tell 

i did a quick scan last night , looking for players with a peak 
comparable 
to or better than winfield .  . in my quick n dirty subjective judgement , 
you 
could make good cases for ruth , aaron , ott , robinson , clemente , , 
, klein , jackson , , and probably a few others. this is not a 
knock on winfield , but a comment on his consistency all of those other 
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches , while winfield 
has 
been more uniformly excellent. hall of fame absolutely .  . top 10 peak 
i'm not so sure. top 10 total career value yes , almost certainly .  . 

point taken. when was winfield 's peak years anyway probably around 85 .  . 

that 's the trouble what peak years he between excellent and 
very good , with no real bell shaped pattern in there. 1979 was a fine 
year 78 and 80 were merely really good. with the yankees , 84 (i think) 
was the best that was the one with the  . 340 . ba .  . 

of course , 1992 was n't bad , either. he 's been in the bigs since 1973 , 
with a one year intermission for surgery. though he does n't have the 
mix of skills that pete rose did , he 's like pete rose in one way he 's 
not a natural hitter .  . winfield 's swing used to be the ugliest thing 
in new york , and that includes the gulf western building. but his sheer 
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot. 

fascinating player to watch , even now. not obviously great in any one 
way but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising 
levels.

argument over reasonable players and umpires deleted 

incidentally , a reasonable home plate umpire would not have been 
so resistant to seeking the appeal to the first base umpire , as gant 
requested .  . if the home plate umpire had appealed to first , the first base 
umpire could have wrung up the strike , and gant would not have been so 
upset. if the call had been a ball , and the catcher had requested the 
appeal , it is likely the home plate umpire would have asked for the help. 


yes , but the baseball rules say you can only appeal a ball and not a 
strike .  . there was no decision made by the umpire regarding an appeal. 
once he called it a strike the call could not be changed. 

i thought that the umpire did the right thing.

subject rbi question 
organization worcester polytechnic institute 
lines 27 
nntp posting host wpi . edu . 

is there any judgement call on the part of the scorer for sac fly rbi 's 
this is the situation that brought the question up 

the red sox were up in the bottom of the 9th by a score of 5 1. the mariners 
had the bases loaded with 1 out. the batter hits a fly to center , which the 
fielder catches .  . the runner at third and scores without a throw .  . 

now , without a judgement call  ( and i do n't think there is one) , this is an rbi 
for the batter .  . it seems to me that a better name for this would be defensive 
, since it does n't really matter whether the guy at third scores 
at that point. (i know , i can think of several if the mariners stole third 
and second , which opening the base would allow , and then the batter hit a 
grounder which the third baseman gets deep in the hole between himself and 
third , he would n't have a play at home , third , or second for the out , and 
maybe he therefore ca n't make the throw to first to get the last out , etc .  .  .  . 
scenarios , too. but does it really matter if this guy scores this way when 
you 're down by 4 if the tying run is going to score , so is the guy on third . ) . 

the point is that the batter (imo) should n't get credit  ( an rbi ) for utterly 
failing to do his job which at this point is to get a hit or a walk , not 
trade an out for one run. what do you guys think

blame the associated press. after the official scorer balances the 
official score card , they copy it and give it to several people. 
one of those is a person from ap whose job it is to type it up  ( using a 
template on a laptop ) and transmit it to the ap offices in new york

and just over ap 's news delivery services. if there are 
corrections , those are issued later. it is the person sitting in front 
of a laptop at shea  ( or whereever ) whose fault that is. note the ap 
puts out boxscores in three different formats with the one you see in 
most newspapers being the first one 

last week they were in denver .  . maybe the ap person in denver did this 
 ( remember , they just started with mlb out there) .  . check tomorrow 's

i laugh at you now , and i will laugh at you again , equally publicly , 
when the jays finish third due to the severe depletion of their talent. 

the jays will finish third because of the depletion of their pitching staff , 
not because derek bell was traded for darrin  . 

i could n't agree more. the jays have a lot of power in their line up. 
so far pitching has been the biggest problem. maybe we can get acker back ) 

but anyway the point of my post , if you missed it , was that derek bell was 
traded because he was basically in the doghouse with and the rest of 
the team. 

one incident that sticks out in my mind was when derek bell ran back out on 
to the feild after the jays had won the division and all the players were 
back in the clubhouse .  . bell ran around the field with his arms in the air , 
waving a big towel over his head. he looked like a big jerk , especially 
when you consider he did not contribute much to the team over the whole 
season. the next day , winfield and carter somehow got the keys to bell 's 
jeep and brought it out on to the feild before the game started. the stadium 
announcer said that there was going to be a draw later in the game for bell 's 
jeep .  . bell really out. i do n't think bell was to popular after that. 

i think that jackson might be trying a little too hard right now. he 's known 
for being a great outfielder , and he 's not the only blue jay who has been 
booting balls and playing generally awful.

i suppose a foul ball machine  ( like brett butler ) is pretty valuable , 
but i 'd rather watch  ( and root for) the lower obp guys who can 
actually hit the ball. 

now this is a legitimate point. baseball is entertainment , and i have no 
quarrel with people who find certain styles of play more entertaining than 
others , regardless of their win value. personally , i'm a huge fan of the 
slug bunt i doubt it 's a high percentage play , but i get a big kick out of 
it. i am willing to live with the bad consequences in exchange for the fun. 

of course , this is not the same as claiming  ( as some do) that galarraga 's 
inability to defer gratification is n't hurting his team because he is n't 
paid to walk or is an rbi guy or whatever. 

and finally , i 'd like to point out that many high obp guys draw 
their walks more because pitchers are afraid to throw a strike 
to them , than because they have a great eye 

i'm not sure. i used to think this was true , but more and more i'm becoming 
convinced that it 's the other way around among players with the physical 
ability to hit the ball real hard , the patient ones are the ones who get the 
chance to do it a lot. 

let 's break down the four basic categories of hitter , according to whether 
they are power threats and whether they walk a lot 


power no power 

patient frank thomas brett butler 
barry bonds ozzie smith 
mark mcgwire craig 
babe ruth miller 
ted williams billy hamilton 
rickey henderson eddie 
joe morgan mike 
. . 
. . 
. . 

impatient ernie banks ozzie guillen 
dave kingman dunston 
joe carter andres thomas 
george bell jose lind 
kirby puckett devon white 
etc. 

as far as i can tell , all the categories are full. it really looks like the 
two are independent .  . nobody could possibly be afraid of craig at 
the plate , and yet he walks quite a lot. part of that , undoubtedly , is being 
small of stature , but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of 
target at least 3 times out of 6. randy milligan is an even better example 
he 's only shown noticeable power for one  ( partial ) season , but he walks all 
over the place , despite his huge strike zone.

others have questioned why darryl should be so concerned with what

darryl has not gotten off to a good start , he has to blame someone. 

but i guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities 
of the fan. 

as long as the fan does n't interfere with the play i see no problems.

the subject line says it all. what is the rule that qualifies 
a pitcher as making a save 



as far as i know , a save opportunity is when it is 7th inning or 
beyond , and the batter on deck can either tie or win the ball game. 
for example if it is the bottom of the 8th inning and clemens is 
 . the red sox are leading 4 1 and clemens has just up a hit. so , 
there is a man on first , the batter , and the batter on deck could tie the game 
with a homer .  . if jeff russel came in , (the red sox reliever ) , and finished the 
game without allowing the tieing or losing run to score , he would get the save 
and clemens would get the win. 
thats how i beleive it works.

are you kidding i'm stuck with the toronto skydome , where their idea 
of a 7th inning stretch is that blue jays song where everyone gets 
to yell okay , okay , blue jays , blue jays , let 's play ball ! 

wow .  .  . what genius did it take to compose that one , to the 
old classic. and there are women on the field to lead the crowd .

the outstanding plays by the opponents  fielders .  .

there 's also a difference in how tolerant i am of long games if i'm 
watching them on the tube , and if i'm going there in person. for me , going 
to an a 's game has become a major commitment of time , one that i'm not 
willing to make that often the length of their games is costing the a 's 
revenue from me. 

i stopped going to a 's games some years ago while i still lived inthe 
bay area for exactly this reason. i believe the length of their games 
has been institutionalized by larussa duncan .  . they encourage their 
pitchers to be overly deliberate , to throw to first often , to study 
the catchers  signals , and so on. and almost every a 's hitter takes 
a step out of the box after every pitch .  . this is not , imo , a coincidence .  . 
this is planned. and i hate it. 

as for the gant situation , i did not see the game or the replays .  . but 
i do wonder. what if gant had requested a time out would 
have been required to give it to him could he have denied the

i 'd sure like to see cameras placed in each major league park such that 
an overview shot of home plate is available. cbs had this during the

then again , players managers must not be too upset with the current 23 
wide strike zone.

wait a minute. if i read the rules right. a is any portion of the ball 
over any portion of the plate. 


given that the ball is 2.9 in diameter .  . this sez that the zone width 
is 17 (2 2 . 9) . or 22 . 8 . . while this is still less than the 23 
number given. i can forgive any ump for .2 on an object moving 
at 85 to 100 miles per hour many times not in a straight line.

keywords mlb , 04 . 20 . 
organization department of industrial engineering 
lines 93 

tim shippert recently posted summaries of last year 's defensive average 
stats in terms of the linear weights estimated run value of defensive 
performances , compared to league average .  . i 've combined those with my 
position adjusted numbers to come up with first approximation total 
run values for players last year. we can use these as a for 
of the mvp award. 

major caveats these numbers include no defensive park adjustment , so if 
san diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the 
infield , that will cause some inaccuracies .  . the offensive numbers are 
position adjusted , but not park adjusted , so we have to deflate some and 
inflate others to be fair. finally , we still do n't know what to do about 
catchers , and i have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions 
of tony phillips and bip roberts .  . 

having said that , there are still some surprises .  . let 's look national 
league first. all numbers in total runs contributed over the season. 

player offense defense total 

sandberg 44 32 76 
bonds 67 3 70 
walker 26 26 52 
justice 14 33 47 
44 44 
larkin 36 4 40 
grace 13 27 40 

as i see it , these are the legitimate mvp candidates from last season. 
if you deflate sandberg 's offense a wee bit for playing in wrigley , you 
get essentially a dead heat. had bonds been his usual defensive self , it 
would n't have been close , but that apparently was n't the case. darren 
needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference , 
and i could n't tell you whether that 's easy or impossible. a good case 
could be made for any of sandberg , bonds , or as top dude .  . 

my personal vote bonds , sandberg , , walker , justice. 


in the american league 

player offense defense total 

ventura 22 34 56 
martinez 47 1 46 
b. anderson 21 25 46 
thomas 47 5 42 
r. henderson 25 16 41 
raines 17 23 40 
33 33 

ok , let 's see a show of hands how many of you picked robin ventura as top 
player in the al last year i certainly did n't , but i 'd have a hard time 
arguing against him at this point. yes , i know these numbers are only 
approximate , but that 's a big gap between him and the 2 guy. also , those 
of you who thought rickey henderson stank last year are out of your minds. 

once again , there 's a catcher in the ointment .  . if calling a game is as 
important as it might be , 23 runs is easy to make up  ( or give  . take 
a guess , folks i do n't think we can do any better than that. 

my personal vote  ( excluding pitchers ) 

ventura , , anderson , martinez , henderson .  . 

i'm a big frank thomas fan , but i have to admit to a bias in favor of 
balanced offensive defensive contribution , which should have a higher 
leverage in w l record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with 
negative defense .  . 

for the record 

carlos baerga 27 5 32 
roberto alomar 35 2 33 

forget it it 's a wash. 

let me also take this opportunity to admit that i was grossly wrong regarding 
don mattingly 's defense this past season. don recovered from his 
weak '90 and '91 to end up with 

mattingly 1 17 16 runs 

which is clearly an above average first baseman .  . however , it 's still 18 runs 
behind mark mcgwire , 26 runs behind frank thomas , and 7 runs behind john 
olerud .  . on the other hand , it 's ahead of rafael , cecil fielder , and 
every other al first baseman not yet mentioned.

you want to speed up ballgames 

1. enforce the two minutes between innings .  . as it is , many fields are 
allowing three minutes between them. fifteen seconds before 
tv commercials are gone to , thirty or so before action begins upon 
the return to the game. two minutes , last out to first pitch , or 
a ball is called. 

2. do n't grant time to batters just because they want it. they may get 
pissed at first , but they 'll get in line , once anything the pitcher 
throws while they 're adjusting their is a strike .  . 

3. mandate a rule permitting only n seconds between pitches (the current 
rule is too lenient ) , and then enforce it. fifteen seconds is more 
than enough time. if the pitch is n't released in 15 , call it a ball , 
and restart the clock. 

baseball games take about 2 51 in the nl , and just a shade under 3 hours 
in the al. that 's just too damn long. i do n't like to play in 3 hour 
games , much less watch a game for that long. my butt falls asleep , and 
if i'm watching on tv , i 'll channel surf between pitches , catching 
versions of mr. ed , leave it to beaver , and those wacky

umpires are not required to call time out just because a player 
asks for time. only in extreme cases , like dust in the pitcher 's 
or hitter 's eyes , should an umpire call time. 

the batter has 20 seconds to get situated in the box and receive 
a pitch .  . i'm against putting a giant clock  ( or any size clock 
for that matter) up to count down 20 seconds between pitches and 
the minute for warm ups .  . but i think umpires should tell hitters 
to go to hell if they step out to get the sign or whatever , and 
instruct the pitcher to pitch .  . the same goes for pitchers .  . umps 
should tell them to pitch or within 20 seconds or a ball 
will be called. that 's the way it should be.

pitchers are required to pitch  ( or or attempt a pick off) 
within 20 seconds after receiving the ball , not 15. 

pitchers are required to pitch their warm up throws within a 
one minute time frame , beginning after each half inning ends , 
not two minutes. 

and the reason why a reliever should be allowed warm ups is 
simple different mound , different catcher .  .

as for rickey   due to his contract problems this year any

ruth is in a class by himself for both rate  ( eqa ) and total  ( eqr ) 
performance , aaron runs over everybody in the total category. ott and 
robinson , who lead winfield in both categories , could be safely put 
ahead of ahead of him. reggie too , although he is barely ahead. these 
numbers are normalized for league and park. clemente is held down by 
some really anemic offensive production in his earliest years , and was 
still productive when he died it is reasonably safe to assume he had 
150 200 runs more he could have gotten .  . still , jackson , , 
clemente , and winfield form a pretty tight knot .  . 


yes , but 

(a) we were talking about peak level , not career averages 
and 
(b) clemente was the best fielding rf of all time , as far 
as anyone can tell 

i did a quick scan last night , looking for players with a peak comparable 
to or better than winfield .  . in my quick n dirty subjective judgement , you 
could make good cases for ruth , aaron , ott , robinson , clemente , , 
, klein , jackson , , and probably a few others. this is not a 
knock on winfield , but a comment on his consistency all of those other 
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches , while winfield has 
been more uniformly excellent. hall of fame absolutely .  . top 10 peak

no , i am not trying to define the quality of an individual , at least not

(2) having bonds batting behind williams means that matt will get 
more good pitches to hit. this is important since he struggles 
so much with breaking balls. opposing pitchers do n't want to 
walk williams to get to bonds .  . 


you 're definitely correct in that williams absolutely has to be 
in between clark and bonds .  . he must , and i mean must , get fastballs to 
hit .  .  . otherwise . he becomes little more than in disguise .  . 
what i would suggest is perhaps batting bonds , williams , and clark 
3 4 5 , the reason being that i feel bonds  potential basestealing 
abilities are wasted when he 's stuck behind two slow runners .  . 
i think the chance of getting 20 30 extra stolen bases with bonds in the 
3 spot would more than offset any drop in in run production by having 
clark in the 5 spot.

williams does not like hitting cleanup ! !
