this may be a dumb question , but i need to put a hard drive on my father 's 
pc xt , either mfm , rll , or ide .  . i know how to hook it up , but how do i tell 
the computer the geometry of the drive. on my 386 , you set it in the bios , but 
i doubt that 's how it 's done on an xt .  . i thought it might be software with 
the controller card , but the ide card for xt 's that i saw did n't come with 
any. also , how do i low level format it once it 's on the computer  ( assuming 
a drive which needs formatting ) 

since there is no bios support for st 506 interface hard disks in an xt , 
that support must come from a bios extension rom on the  ( mfm rll) hard disk 
controller .  . usually the controller has a rom based low level format 
program (a common jump address is c800 ... you can type g c800 5 from 
debug to see) and a small table of drive it knows about. 
sometimes these are selectable using jumpers on the card , sometimes you 
can enter them manually in the menu. failing that , you must use a 
third party hd prep program like , disk manager , or the like. 

ide drives come formatted already , and since the is controller part of the 
drive mechanism itself , concerns about geometry are irrelevant .  . plug 
it in and go to fdisk .  .

hi , 
that might look like a dull request , but i have been following this newgroup 
for a couple of weeks and it did n't help me make my mind. 

i bought a new 486 machine not long ago after being disconnected from the 
pc world for a while (i have been running on an xt 5mhz till last january ! ! ) .  . 
the machine i bought came equipped with a ati vga xl 24 graphic card. it 
gives a very nice picture and the windows drivers are pretty stable .  . the only 
problem is that it is quite slow. 

i would like to go for a faster card (not in the 400 range) .  . i saw a lot 
of comments on many products over the last weeks , but did n't get an overall 
picture clear enough to make a choice. my question is could somebody 
direct me to a source of information which would help me in my quest .  . 
i would like to get information about 
the refresh rates the various cards provide 
quality of windows drivers 
standard vga performance  ( non windows stuff) .  . 

direct me to a magazine article or something like that (i got zip . 
info , but it is not enough) .  . if you have an isa card you are really satisfied 
with it , let me know. 
if this information is of any use , here is my system configuration 
486 33mhz isa system  ( contaq motherboard ) 
monitor darius 14 non interlaced multisync  ( up to 1024x768 ) 
 ( can reach horizontally ) 

i would also like to know if it is a standard for video drivers to allow 
screen dimensioning and screen positioning by writing on the eprom of the 
graphic card. this is the case with my ati card and it is very convenient 
when changing graphics mode since my monitor is not intelligent 
enough to record settings. 

merci a l for any information you would be kind enough to provide me ,

i am planning on upgrading my old xt compatible system with a new 
motherboard , hard drive , and 1.4 mb floppy .  . 

i am interested in using my old power supply  ( 150 w) to power the new 
hardware , if possible. 

i have been told by the motherboard vendor that i could probably 
use the supply if it had twelve wires going to the motherboard .  . 
 ( apparently some xt vintage supplies had only 11 wires the 
12th wire is a 5v line used to charge the motherboard battery) .  . 

my question is has anybody tried bringing an additional wire 
out of an 11 wire supply or using an auxiliary power source 
to charge the motherboard battery 

i do not wish to buy an entirely new power supply if i can 
make use of my existing one with simple hacks .  . 

thank you for any information.

on 04 19 93 04 09 , john bongiovanni had the gall to say this 

suddenly , the date no longer rolls over. the time is  ( reasonably ) accurate 
allways , but we have to change the date by hand every morning. this involves 
exiting the menu system to get to dos .  . 

jb did i once hear that in order for the date to advance , something , like 
jb a clock , has to make a get date system call apparently , the clock 
jb hardware interrupt and bios do n't do this  ( date advance ) 
jb automatically .  . the get date call notices that a midnight reset flag 
jb has been set , and then then advances the date. 

when a program uses a dos call to get the system , it resets the flag that 
tells the bios that it has passed midnight .  . it then uses this flag to 
increment the date. if the menu does a call to the system to get the time 
before midnight , before the bios sees the midnight flag , then bios will not 
know that the day passed and the date will not get updated. 

i might have some dos 's and bios 's mixed up  ( darned cold messed up my 
brains ) but this has been a well documented problem for years. i do n't know 
of a workaround .  . hope this helps !

there are various bbs 's and other similar services avalible  ( like compuserve ,

approximate order of importance they are 

1) the mail files news are read written locally and to the network 
server. (ie .  . no continuous on line  ( connection)(note ) all users are remote 
and will use modems over conventional phone lines . ) . 

2) simple. the users i have for the system have very little computer knowledge 
have never heard of unix , and have very little interest in learning. it is 
essential that the client software is completely pain free. 

3) cheap. we would prefer not paying high connect fees to an established 
commercial network , just so we can send large files between members of the 
group hence (1) .  . in addition i would like the network server to be 
something small , simple and inexpensive like a 486 .  .  ( there are only about 
40 people in the group , so it is not a huge network . ) . 

4) the capability for internet access  ( for news mail) .  .

the attached fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential 
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you 
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing .  . 

yes , this is a valid concern imho .  . with the directly attached fan units i 've 
seen , it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all. in other words , if the fan stops 
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to 
suffer permanent damage , not just stop working temporarily .  . 

a suggestion slave  ( hook in series) a small pilot light off the fan 
circuit .  . then , if the light goes out , you know your fan is not working.

nntp posting host pc ee . und . ac . za . 

some of our students change the ami bios passwords on a few of our computers 
and set it for always. what we 'd like to know is if there is a way to bypass 
or remove the password. we have tried switching bios , but to no avail. the 
battery is soldered to the , an all three machines is still under 
guarentee so if that would have help we ca n't remove the batteries .  . 

as far as i know , there is no way to get around the bios password except by 
shorting out the power supply to the cmos memory , thereby erasing it. this 
will remove the password , but it will also destroy all the previous bios 
settings , so then you 'll have to go and set them all up again. on my 386 , 
there is a jumper on the motherboard which is provided for the purpose of 
shorting the battery. you just short this jumper briefly , and it interrupts 
power to the cmos long enough to erase it. i would imagine there is 
something like this on your board too. 

in the future , i would suggest that you set the password , and leave it on 
setup only. that way , no one else can go and reset it or set it to 
always unless they know what password you used. they had to do this over 
here too when they got a bunch of new 386 's , for just the same reason.

bus i o , not doing floating point , not doing 32 bit protected mode etc. this 
is in a micron computer , without heatsink .  . 

i recently put a heatsink fan on the chip , but i might take the fan off. it 
makes a horrible whine at times , and i wonder what the vibration is doing to 
the pins on the cpu etc .  .  .  .

end of file , press return to quit 

rob , 
do n't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks 
of use , mine did .  .  .  . 
as to the vibration well that something i thought about to as i have 
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically .  . so i mounted the fan 
on the case so that it just blows air at the cpu and its heatsink 
instead. work just like a charm , but the realy biggy to think about 
is after the whine goes away on the fan. if the fan should stop  ( burn out) 
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. thats what 
you should be thinking about. i have the parts together but have not 
had the time to assemble them as yet. but you build a controlled 
circuit that will turn on a speaker and a led when the temp .  . goes 
above the normal operating range  ( 96c ) or there abouts .  . cheep to do if 
you use radio shack junk under 5 .  .  .  . think . about that one for a while !

no , vl bus ide is no faster than isa ide .  . the ide interface is 
fundamentally nothing more than an extension of the isa bus , and if 
you hook it to vl bus it 'll work as fast as the slower of the two , 
meaning isa speed. 

it 's not true. ide bus uses signals which has similar name and same

does n't have to be same to isa signal timing. my vl ide bus card has 
a set of jumpers to set its transfer rate from 3 . 3mb . sec up to 8 . 3mb . 
sec (the manufacturer might have to correct these numbers as 3.3

the attached fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential 
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you 
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing .  . 

yes , this is a valid concern imho .  . with the directly attached fan units i 've 
seen , it looks like if the fan were to stop the chip cooling would be 
a good bit worse than no heat sink at all. in other words , if the fan stops 
the unit turns into an insulator and the chip might get hot enough to 
suffer permanent damage , not just stop working temporarily .  . 

i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel 
to blow air across the cpu depends a lot on case and board layout , though. 

my zeos 486dx2 66  ( tower case) has a passive heat sink on the cpu , and it 's 
located so the front fan , which sucks air into the case , blows right on the 
heat sink .  . if that fan stops the heat sink is still cooled by convection air 
flow so should not see too dramatic a temperature rise. essentially the 
arrangement you 're talking about and a good idea imho .  . 

on chip fans from fry 's electronics in the sf bay area are about 30 . 00 .  . i 
get the stock power supply fans for about 11 . 00 .  .

a standard ide controller card on my isa 486 50. 

i'm currently thinking about adding another hd , in the 300mb to 500mb range. 
and i'm thinking hard about buying a scsi drive  ( scsi for the future benefit) .  . 
i believe i'm getting something like sec transfer right now  ( according 
to nu) .  . 

how would this number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for 
my isa pc , and the state of the art scsi hard drive (the best system i could 
hope for) 

obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would 
you want to use on your isa system and how much would it cost 

along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd 's if i 
were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my 200mb , 15ms hd

ibm , apple , motorola ready to powerpc 601 processor 


the wraps will come off the powerpc 601 processor this week , as motorola 
corp. , ibm , and apple computer inc. detail the results of their 
effort. this first in a series of powerpc processors will be a 32 bit 
processor with a 64 bit memory interface , much like intel corp. 's 
pentium , with the capability of performing as many as three instructions 
per clock cycle , according to sources familiar with the chip .  . motorola 
is expected to release the chip in volume by year end in two 
configurations , running at 50 and 66 mhz with performance of 40 and 50 
marks , respectively , sources said. floating point performance 
for the 3.6 volt processors will be even better , as their 
performance will be 60 and 80 , respectively .  . the 601 , a scaled down 
version of the power 220 chip developed by ibm for its rs 6000 
workstations , will also include a 32k single buffered cache on the chip 
with protocols to support motorola 's 64 bit multiprocessor bus 
built in. the chip , which is being designed initially to support the 
micro channel architecture , is bus independent , so vendors could develop 
powerpc based systems using a number of different architectures , 
including isa , eisa , or sun microsystems inc. 's s bus design , one source 
noted .  . 

according to sources familiar with the development effort , motorola has 
been extremely successful in developing the powerpc as an inexpensive 
architecture , despite a complex design made up of more than 2.8 million 
transistors using a 0.6 micron technology. initial chips are expected to 
be priced from 300 to 400 only slightly higher than intel corp. 's 
486 processors but could be sold for less than 100 , one 
source said.

you unfortunately failed to mention if the error occurs with the parity error 
checking enabled or disabled .  . i assume you mean it gives you a parity error 
when it 's enabled , and not when it 's disabled .  . how high will the count go on 
the memory check at boot up before this error occurs does the system beep 
at all if so what 's the pattern of beeps the error could be occuring in 
cache memory (not so likely) or video memory , as well as the simms .  . 

the fact that you have ami bios is not conclusive in determining the board 
manufacturer either. boards are made by thousands of small taiwanese companies 
 ( among others) that buy the name brand chips and put them together with some 
simm sockets to make your board. i tend to doubt your problem is with your 
ide controller , also. 

anyway , perhaps if you answer those questions someone can help you out better.

the 50 mhz external bus speed provides a hell for cache designs. most

dx2 50 s. also as someone else pointed out , local bus boards are 
better off at 33 mhz bus speed. the 8k internal cache allows the

you are correct ! the motherboard manufacturer where i usually buy boards says

brian j schaufenbuel 

i do n't see this as a problem with the chip set (a mistake ) , i see this 
as something that was designed in intentionally .  . 

so it would seem that to enhance the design (from 24 to 32 bit eisa dma ) 
would require an update to the chipset .  . an update to the chipset may 
begat an update to the motherboard board design. 

what i'm saing is the motherboard manufacturer seems to be passing this 
off as a simple fix. in my mind the fix is a updated chipset from hint 
along with a possible motherboard layout update. this is not simple. 
if i were you i would be cautious about this. 

you might look into the advanced integration research  ( air ) vl eisa 
motherboard .  . all slots are eisa isa capable .  . 2  ( or 3) of the slots are 
vl bus capable .  . the air people confirmed this board supports  real  
32 bit eisa dma (i called them) .  . pentium p5 ( ) capable .  . less expensive 
than equivalent ami or micronics vl eisa board. 

look in computer shopper  ( april '93) .  . the ads show the air mother

serial cables 

there are only three output signals td , dtr , and rts .  . 
there are five inputs signals rd , dsr , dcd , cts , and ri .  . 

there are many differnt null modem as dictated by the software. 
the ibm bios requires asserts dtr and rts and then waits for both dsr and 
cts before sending .  . when a bios recieve call is made , it asserts dtr and 
waits for dsr to become true  ( times out after a while and returns with an 
error if dsr never becomes true) .  . it requires cts to be true for sending 
and recieving .  . most communications packages bypass this and replace it 
with their own protocol .  . the key is that each comm. package could very 
well have different requirements. 

my favorite cable works in many cases short rts to cts at each end , but 
also run rts through to dcd at the opposite end. td runs through to rd 
and dtr runs through to dsr from both dte 's and of course sg goes through 
to sg .  . 

i have never had trouble with this null modem even though i have used it 
with a comm. package that was expecting rts to go to cts instead of dcd .  . 
the advantage of this cable is that it also works with the ibm bios .  .

same here. 

any help would be appreciated , since i intend to install this drive 
asap i 'd like to know what to do  ( and what not to do) before i start.

1 scsi cdrom .  . i currently using always scsi card , but i also have 
a future domain , a western digital scsi card , and i work with an 
before. as i recall , all these cards can support boot and floppy drive. 
however , to use with other controller  ( ide , mfm .  .  . ) . the boot drive has to 
be the ide  ( or mfm) .  . you can not boot from the scsi if you have other 
controller in the system. if you guys only have 2 drives (1 ide , 1 scsi) .  . 
just set up the ide in your cmos setup. make sure you can boot from it. 
then , set up the scsi controller  ( irq , dma , etc) .  . set the scsi drive to 
id 0. just plug and play for all the cards i seen so far. only if you 
have more than 2 drives then you need driver for the third drive and so

my pc is a 486 33dx (isa) with ami bios and opti chipset .  . i am thinking of replacing the ami bios chip  ( dated 6 91) with an up to date one (not for any reason , just messing around) .  . my questions are 

1. do i just take out the old one and plug in a new 

2. anything else i have to take care of what precautions should i take 

3. where can i get the new bios chip , compusa , mailorder or what (i live in orange county california) .  . 

4. what is the most up to date version 

5. very important. how much would it be 

thank you for your help.

 ( andy nicola ) writes 

in a previous article ,  ( holly ks ) says 

what is the difference between the us robotics courier v32bis external and the 
sportster 14400 external i see that the price of a sportster has dramatically 
dropped to below 200 but the price of the courier remains above 400 .  . 

anyone with knowledge of both of these modems or anyone that owns a courier 

the courier is their top of the line product , thus the higher price. i 've 
never taken a real look at the sportster line  ( only couriers ) , but from what 
i 've gathered , it 's basically more of an entry level modem .  . probably 
does n't meet the same specifications that the courier does. i'm not sure 
if the sportster line is fully dsp driven like the  ( more recent ) courier 
modems are , so upgrades in the future may be an issue. 

again , take all of the above with a grain of salt .  .  . i . 've never evaluated 
the sportster , so i'm going by bits and pieces that i 've heard. if you 
want a real answer , post the question in comp . dcom . modems . and you 'll find 
people who have worked with the sportster .  . 

personally , though , if i were going to look at the courier modems , i 'd 
buy the dual standard .  .  . then . i 'd get both hst and v . 32bis .  . in fact , this 
is exactly what i did. ) i'm sitting here looking at my usr ds right 
now. 

and now , to correct a few very incorrect statements .  .  .  .  . folks , if you want 
to get reliable answers to modem and or uart questions , post them to 
comp . dcom . modems .  . if you post in other groups , you never know what you 'll 
get in the way of an answer  ( you may very well get a good answer .  .  . or . you 
may get something like the one below) .  . at least in , if someone posts 
complete and utter bs , you 'll see a flurry of folks correcting them  ( to 
avoid spreading faulty info) .  . 

the sportster at 14.4 has v . 42 . error control and v . 42 . bis data compression .  . 

just as it does at lower speeds , too. there is absolutely nothing in 
either recommendation v . 42 . or v . 42bis . that says that they can only 
operate on modems that are running v . 32bis .  . v . 42bis . , of course , is 
currently only standardized for operation on top of v . 42 .  ( in its primary 
mode of operation , lapm ) , but that 's about as far as that goes. 

and just in case there 's some confusion on this , v . 42 . v . 42bis . are also 
supported by the courier line  ( unless you have a really ancient one) .  . 

the difference 
with the courier , is that it can run at 16.8 and only in the hst mode. 

take a second look at the original question 

in a previous article ,  ( holly ks ) says 
what is the difference between the us robotics courier v32bis external 

see the v . 32bis . up there the question was not about the courier hst 
modem , or about the courier dual standard .  .  . it . was about the courier 
v . 32bis . modem .  . the modem in question does not support hst , period. it 
therefore does not support the 16.8 kb hst .  . 

also , not all courier hst courier dual standard modems support the 16.8 kb 
version of hst .  . my dual standard only supports hst at 14.4 kb .  . there are 
even older models that only run hst at 9 . 6 . kb .  . 

this is a proprietary mode of usr and it will only connect to another of 
the same type unit to achieve this speed. 

hst is usr 's proprietary modulation scheme .  .  .  .  . but we 're not talking about 
hst , we 're talking about v . 32bis .  . v . 32bis . is most definitely not a 
proprietary modulation scheme .  . 

the sportster will do 
asynchronous transmissions as well as synchronous .  . the hst is one way 
only. 

i do hope you did n't mean for these two sentences to be related in some 
way .  .  .  .  .  . 

first off , v . 32 . and v . 32bis . are both synchronous and asynchronous .  . this is 
part of the recommendation (i . e .  . , part of the  . it is n't a 
feature unique to the sportster (i just looked at the appropriate chapter 
in the courier ds  . 

second , hst is not way only . '' . more correctly put , it is an 
modulation scheme , meaning it does n't work at the same speed 
in both directions. hst operates at 9 . 6 . 14.4 16.8 in one direction , 
and has a low speed back channel in the other direction. the high speed 
channel goes in the direction of the higher data flow. this is fine if 
you 're logged on to say , a bbs , and type one letter and get screens of 
info back , transfer files (not using bimodem ) , etc .  .  .  .  . there is , of course , 
a penalty for turnaround time when the high speed channel needs to reverse 
directions. 

v . 32 . and v . 32bis . are both symmetrical , meaning they do transfer the full 
data rate in both directions at the same time. 

third , synchronous vs asynchronous has absolutely nothing to do with 
symmetrical vs  .  . they . are two completely different topics. 

the hst 's will be upgradeable to the v . fast . spec when it is available. 

again , more correctly put , some of the courier line will be upgradeable 
to whatever is called when it 's complete. if you have the large 
footprint courier modems  ( like i do) , you 're s . o . l .  .  .  .  .  . there was an 
upgrade plan a while back to upgrade to a small footprint variety , which 
could eventually be upgraded to support v . fast . , but the cost of the two 
upgrades together pretty much put it higher than just buying a new modem .  . 

later .  .  .  .  .  .

i have run some diagnostic software  ( pctools v7 . 1) . and it says that the

flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read) .  . 

does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these

rg this may be a dumb question , but i need to put a hard drive on my

rg how do i tell the computer the geometry of the drive. on my 386 , you 
rg set it in the bios , but i doubt that 's how it 's done on an xt .  . i 

most xt ide controllers are responsible for keeping track of the drive 
geometry and getting the information to the computer. the controller may 
come with software to update its on board bios , or may be designed to work 
with a particular drive. seagate drives usually have special controllers 
for use on xt 's , and these are to the drive. 

also , you cannot low level format an ide drive. the low level format is 
stored on magnetic areas on the disk surface called servos (not 
like the electronic use of the term) that need a higher recording bias than 
the drive 's recording heads can generate .  . do n't try to low level format an 
ide drive !

i had one and on three different motherboards it did n't work with nt and

on some systems such as micronics motherboards it is necessary to 
shut off the internal cache on the 486 to have it work.

well , i 've installed dos 6.0 in three different systems , with and without 
stacker a friend installed it in two other systems , both with stacker .  . 

not a single problem. (except perhaps some minor bugs with config.sys 
menus ) 

he 's right ya know. i 've helped to install dos 6 on about 4 computers now , 
mine included. on one , he bought the stacker to doublespace converter , 
and it worked fine  ( rather , he sent in the coupon for the  . 

in other cases , i 've run the doublespace installation without a problem 
when compressing a new drive , compressing free space , or whatever else. 
seems to work for me. 

ofcourse , we did not , repeat , not run any program called install 
or setup or a very sophisticated ai auto configuring setup 
installation program that will think for you and do what you never wanted to 
do but could n't stop it from doing 

well , i ran the normal setup thing and it worked fine for whatever that 's 
worth. 

also , dblspace is crap. it writes about 40 slower than stacker , reads about 
20 slower , and compresses about 10 less. all tests were made on the same 
computer with the same disk , no cache , and the same  ( big ) files were used. 

could n't agree more. on my 486 50 i do n't miss the speed. it 's still 
faster than a normal disk read would be. as for the less compression , 
i 've sacrificed that in favor of the convenience of having the dblspace . bin . 
load before anything else. with stacker , any changes to your config.sys 
or autoexec.bat meant rebooting twice so it could update those. 

personally , i'm waiting for stacker 4.0 to come out and implement those 
hooks and stuff. plus , the defrag that comes with dos is okay , but i 
much prefer compress from pc tools for sheer bells and whistles .  . plus , 
defrag is sooooo sloooow on a dblspace drive. 

but , dos 6 is quite good reformat disks i honestly do n't understand why 
you had to do this.

i have a floppy drive which has developed general failure errors. (it 's a teac 1 . 44mb . 3.5 drive) .  . 

i took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty .  . i used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it 's quite clean now. 

however , it did n't help the problem. i 've also identified that when the machine boots  ( and the drive seeks for a boot disk) , the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time. what i mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector .  . 

is there anything more i can do to try and save this drive i 'd prefer not to shell out 100 for a new one if i can help it. 

thanks !

if you 're considering buying a system , with a view to using 
it to run unix  ( linux , bsd , etc .  .  . ) . or some other special software , 
there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards. 

that is , if the special software is free , like xfree86 .  . there are 
vendors that sells diamond x drivers for commercial unices .  . but 
then , they charge . 

this is due to diamond 's propriety attitude to it 's hardware 
it 's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
 ( specifically their dot clocks ) without paying , and signing non disclosure 
agreements .  . 

i think they only need a signing (i . e .  . no  . this still 
violates the fsf 's policy of publically available code. 

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide 
x windows compatibility with these cards , as diamond did n't want to 
divulge programming  . 

while this is true , there are fixes for those who have already 
bought diamond cards. in linux , for example , there are utilities 
that will put the card in vesa mode before invoking x. of course , 
this means no fine tuning of diamond cards , but at least this 
will allow those who 're stuck with them to use linux x. 

i agree with mark 's suggestion if you are buying a video card 
for specialized free software , avoid diamond .  . but if you already 
have one , there may be a fix that can help you.

you can configure devices for the same irq as long as you do n't use them 
simultaneously , under dos at least. both lpt1 and sb just sit there until 
you tell them to do something. you ca n't configure a soundblaster for irq7

wm the software is netware 286 level ii and i can see burnt on to the 
wm screen sft netware 286 level ii v2 . 0a .  . however , to configure netware 
wm for level ii  ( mirrored or duplexed disks) requires a second disk , yes 

yes. mirroring requires a controller that is capable of writing to two 
disks at once. duplexing , which is the preferred way of mirroring , uses 
two controller cards and two disk drives .  . duplexing requires a special 
card and two identical disk drives  ( in most cases) .  . duplexing can 
sometimes be pulled off with slightly different drives controllers , as long 
as the sizes are the same. 

wm so how is the novell server normally configured 

the configuration is completely up to the user. 

wm 1. can i install sft netware 286 level ii v2 . 0a . as level i , or is this 
wm what is causing my error 

if you only have one disk , then you ca n't use level ii sft .  . however , the 
disk has a serial number on it , and if this disk is for a different 
version of netware then you would get a error. make sure 
that this disk actually belongs to the rest of the set of floppies in the 
netware installation set. 

wm 2. is the novell server normally equipped with two hard drives , 
wm one of which has failed 

two drives could be either two netware volumes at sft i , or one volume 
mirrored using sft ii. impossible to tell with the network being down. 

wm 3. would this mean i can not install the network software because it 
wm will not be serialized for this hardware with a failed drive 

try disconnecting the failed drive , using a standard disk controller , and 
installing the software as one volume under sft i. if the software will 
install , and if the one disk is functional , then it should be able to work 
in this configuration .  . 

wm 4. what else can cause a error 

see the comment concerning the serial number on the installation 
floppy .  .

when i insert that card into my dos 5 . 02 . pc , it shows up

when i get into debug , and dump the data at 40 0 , it shows 
the address 2e8 as belonging to com3 even though the modem 
should be at com4 .  . 
... 

this is a common misconception , shared my many manufacturers , programmers , 
and users alike. com3 , for example , is simply the third equipped comm 
port , not necessarily the one with i o address 3e8 .  . the bios just 
searches sequentially through a set of potential comm port addresses .  . the 
first equipped port it finds will become com1 , etc. if you 're playing by 
the rules , you ca n't have a com4 unless you have a com3 equipped .  . the set 
of standard  ( whatever that means) port addresses merely reflects the 
order in which the bios searches the i o address space in its search for 
serial ports. 

so , what you have is indeed com3 at the non standard address 2e8 .  . were 
this address in the 4th table slot instead , programs which query the bios 
to determine the number of installed comm ports would not find it , as the 
field in the bios data area which contains this number would indicate that 
there are but 3 comm ports installed.  ( frankly , i do n't know of a 
program that would actually have a problem with this . ) .

have anybody succeded in converting a atari monitor into a 
mono vga monitor. if so please let me know exactly how you did and what 
graphics card you used. 

i wish i could help ! i posted a similar question about two weeks ago 
i got no response at all. i 've asked locally at my friendly atari store. 
i was told that it should be possible , but that they had no idea how 
it might be done. nor did they particularly care to investigate .  . 

ok , here 's my results so far .  .  .  .  . 

1 you have to define the monitor as lcd it does n't really support 
analogue video input (it works , but is n't very linear .  .  . ) . 

2 the incoming sync pulses need inverting .  . this is best achieved 
with either a cmos xor package or a transistor inverter .  . 
if you do n't know how to do it , do n't even contemplate it .  .  . ) 

3 it 'll only work in standard vga mode. 

ok , having said that , i'm trying to either find a circuit or ic 
which will act as a universal sync decoder .  . 

i want which basically only detects the leading sync 
pulse edge , and does n't care about the polarity , outputting 
the ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires .  . 

there are 2 reasons for doing this 

1 vga cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they 're 
in herc emulation is , while is , for example. 

2 it means i do n't have to put a switch on the back of the 
monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my 
ibm .  . currently i have 3 (yes , 3 ! ) monitors sitting on my desk , 
and i want to get that number down as much as possible. 
being able to use the atari monitor as a paper white vga 
will cut things down to 2. if i forget about atari colour , 
i can get down to 1. 

ultimately , the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor , 
but i'm as pressed for cash as anyone else , so it 'll have to wait .  .  .  .

do all scsi cards for dos systems require a separate device driver to

no. all that i 've seen have also an on board bios which enables you to 
use up to 2 hard drives directly under dos (2 drives is a dos 
limitation and you have the same problem with ide and all other 
standards for that matter) .  . software drivers often allow for better 
performance , though. you have to use them if you want to use other 
devices besides hard disks or have more than 2 disks .  . 

will this also be true of the 32 bit os 's 

obviously these are not able to use the 16 bit real mode bioses that 
are written for dos , so you need software drivers. that 's not a big 
deal  ( as long as the drivers are available) , because you wo n't have to 
fight with any low memory problems either.

i just bought a western digital caviar ide drive and i want to add it to 
my system which already has a ide drive. the controller says it 
supports 2 hard drives , but when i plug in the cables , do the bios setup , 
and try to start the system , it pauses and then i get an invalid drive d 
error message. the system boots , but i cannot access the new hard drive. 
... 

there are jumpers on each drive that must be set for both to work. the c be set to be the master drive , and d must be set to be the slave drive. 
the actual settings should be in info with the drives or is available from 
western digital .  .

ik i'm in the market to upgrade my bios to a phoenix 1.10  ( got a new hard 
ik disk , discovered my bios does n't have a type 47 ) and i would like 
ik know where i can purchase one of these things. 

call phoenix .  . they can put you on line with replacement bios chips. i had 
to do this when i upgraded a emerson 386 20 to an ide drive. 

also , if you are installing an ide drive , and there is a bios setting that 
has a total volume the same as the ide drive 's volume , try using it. the 
ide drive can usually respond to a variety of different , as long 
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive 's actual 
size. the controller will do the necessary translation automatically , in 
most cases. 

warning ! ! ! do not use a bios setting that is even one byte larger than the 
actual size of the drive ! a smaller setting will not harm the drive , but 
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over. drive damage will not 
result , but headaches will !

i have a 486 dx 33 motherboard in my pc that i 'd like to speed up. 
i 'd rather not replace the whole motherboard , instead i 'd like to know 
if i can use a dx 2 66mhz cpu .  . the bios is late model ami , circa 1991 , 
and the system crystal is approx 66 . 3mhz .  . 

my question is , can i just replace the original 33mhz cpu with the new 
dx 2 cpu if its possible , will there be a need for extra cooling 
devices such as heatsinks and or muffin fans

i dont think you can mix the two types of drive , unless you have one of 
the 
scsi ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off. 


is this true i was under the impression that people on the net had both 
scsi and ide working together. 

i have had a scsi and ide drive working together for some years now. 
scsi is supposedly pretty transparent to other types of drives 
 ( esdi , rll , ide , etc) but oftentimes you need to get the correct drivers 
to get it to work with odd environments .  . 

for information purposes , i had 

st 01 card drive and a maxtor 212a drive with generic ide 
controller running together. i have also had the same scsi setup work 
in combination with a rll drive , the 1 drive.

address is and it 's ram base address is 
 . it 's also using irq 2)

i do n't have my copy of the manual with me right now , but i can offer the 
following in the interim 

1) the card uses port addresses and 0x2e8 (which are not 
 . these addresses , incidentally , were inadvertantly 
omitted from my version of the manual. 

2) i believe there is a dip that controls whether or not to enable

should i configure for mpu 401 compatibility .  . the manual and installation 
program recommended irq2 , but on my machine it is configured to cascade to 
15. so can i still use irq2 , or should i choose a different one right now

a related questions  ( to other gw or vl bus machine owners ) i was told that

lino montuno 

i totally agree with your friend , since when the cpu is apparently idle 
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second 
 ( checking for keyboard input for instance) .  . 

the exception to this is for cpu 's used in laptops , where the cpu can 
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but 
doing absolutely nothing. in this case it needs a hardware interrupt 
to get it going again.

windows all act as if the port is n't there. it 's not an irq conflict , because i can swap the irqs for com3 and com4 , and com3 still works  ( and com4 still does n't) .  .

this has the smell of an i o port conflict , but i ca n't imagine with what. there are no other expansion cards installed in the machine other than the video card , and gateway would have to be pretty stupid to have the on board com4 conflict with something else on the motherboard !

i ran into this about six months ago. my system is a gw2000 66v ,

i posted almost the same bad experience with midwest micro but our 
news program only sent one paragraph out of the middle. in 
addition to the facts that 
(a) the modems (i had ordered two ) would n't work as documented 
and 
(b) the tech person had no clue as to how it should work , 
it also turned out that 
(c) one of the two modems they sent was clearly used but the techs 
thought that was standard practice and 
 ( d ) the modems made all three of my floppy drives quit working and 
my tape drive start running away. 

that they are incompetent is one thing , but that they sell used stuff 
as new and wo n't even apologize for it is another. stay away from 
these crooks !

bob , 
i have walked into micro center here in the cleveland area and bought 
a new track ball and picked the only one that was sealed in plastic 
rap .  . only to get it home and it up to find a good year old used 
dirty old track ball with a warranty card for some software package. 

i would never even think of installing anything that looked like 
it was used at all. you should of called micro 
and made them do a pus pull tag on it. they would of picked it up 
and sent you out a ner one the same day. 
things get better in knowing how to but equipment after the first try !

i got a et4000 w32 card which is made by yesterday 
and ran a winmark test on it. the card is a vl bus card which 
can display 16.7 million colours in 640x480 mode with 1mb dram .  . 

it comes with et4000 w32 window drivers and a normal et4000 drivers. 
the et4000 w32 drivers handles , 640x480 , 800x600 , in 256 colours. 
also , in 640x480 and 800x600 , it supports hicolor , 32k and 64k colours. 

here is my winmark result running on a 16mb 486dx33 eisa vl bus system using 
hint chipsets .  .

from the result , the et4000 w32 drivers are specialized to use the 
hardware feature of the et4000 w32 chip whereas the et4000 drivers are 
just normal driver for et4000 based graphics card. 

the price of this graphics card that i got is 185 from a local dealer .  . 
it may be less from mail order. it has os 2 2.0 drivers comes with it 
which supports 256 colors on all resolution. 

from these results , it has double the performance of a based card 
in 256 colours mode.

i have a 486 50mhz isa board with cache and 16 megs

install the card. the uses 16bit dma channel . i . could 
select between channel 5 to 7. it is the first card i ever 
installed that uses 16bit dma transfer .  . after i tested 
the card the first time , the computer crashed and i got a 
parity error system halted .  . this happens either from dos as 
also from windows. so it seems that my 16 bit dma channels 
are not working properly  ( they are there because exe . 
them and tests them ok until first access) .  . 

well , does anybody know a solution for this problem or a 
special test program for dma problems i eliminated the 
problem by using only 8 bit dma channel but it 
makes the system slow ! 

thanks for your help.

come to think of it , though , i hear and see a lot of complaints about 
the ati boards too , though recent word looks like the build 59 code looks 
much better. 


build 59 still has a number of problems sheared fonts , for 
instance , if you have crystal fonts enabled .  . some other problems 
color and some others. i do n't use the drivers in 
any mode other than 1024x768x256 , so if there are bugs in the 
other modes i ca n't say. 


does anyone have an accelerated video board with drivers for windows 
 ( os 2 ) where all the modes function properly anyone anyone 


to be honest , up until now , i have only found one bug in the 
diamond viper drivers , and it seems innocuous .  . 

that is , under microsoft word , select format border , click 
shading and take a look at the patterns. the 5 pattern 
has been swapped with the 90 , and so on. the whole list 
is completely reversed looks right onscreen , but take 
it to another machine (i . e .  . , a gup or machine) or 
print it and iy shows badly ! 

keep in mind that i use mainly mode , so i ca n't 
speak for the others , but otherwise these drivers seem pretty 
solid.

is it possible through either pin configuration or through software 
programming to change the ip numbers on an ethernet card 

the ethernet card does n't use the ip number  ( 32 bits , usually 
. . . ) it uses the ethernet address (48 bits , usually 
) .  . i have never run across an ethernet controller that 
cannot be programmed to use an address that is not assigned to it. 
decnet requires this feature. 

however , that said , there is no reason to ever change the ethernet 
address. they are globally unique , the first three bytes being 
assigned to the manufacturer by the ieee , and the last three by the 
manufacturer .  .

about a so called  . this is an interface 
between a pc 's parallel port and any video recorder for 
backing up your data on a videotape .  . the company  ( datasave ) 
claims that it can store up to 7 gb on a 300 minutes tape. 


it costs dm 250 .  .  ( about usd 200 , i think) 

my question is 
does anybody use this product , if yes , how many bytes 
really fit on a 300 minutes tape (7 gb sounds quite

reviews. i'm interested in getting more information about nanao 's products 
as well as some others that may fit the bill. 

i would like a monitor that can handle high resolutions like 1024x1024 ni .  . 
i'm using this monitor on an amiga 4000 or amiga 2000 w a graphics 
board like the retina , and or on a sun like the sparcstation lx .  . basically 
i want a high resolution monitor. this monitor need not be large 
( 17 ) if it meets the brief requirements as outlined above. i 've been 
very happy with a 16 on suns and could probably cope with smaller at home. 

i'm interested if anyone has more details on high quality sony and 
monitors since they seem to be used on sun 's fairly often and look pretty 
good  ( to me at least) .  . i have n't seem them brought up in c . s . i . p . h . very 
often as are mag and viewsonic .  .

are we talking about a scsi 1 device (e . g .  . hd ) on a scsi 2 controller 
or 
are we talking about a scsi 1 controller that had a chip upgrade 
using the same chip that is on a scsi 2 controller board. 
we are talking about a scsi 1 device (e . g .  . hd ) on a scsi 2 controller .  . 

here is a rewrite of my mac info sheet scsi section 
scsi only external device expansion interface common to both mac and ibm .  . 
allows the use of any device hard drive , printer , scanner , nubus card 
expansion mac plus only , some monitors , and cd rom .  . normal asynchronous 
scsi is 5 mhz fast synchronous scsi is 10 mhz .  . difference between these 
modes is mainly in the software drivers. 
main problem there are a lot of external devices which are internal 
terminated which causes problems for more then two devises off the scsi port 
a scsi chain is supposed to be terminated only at the begining and end. 
any other set up causes problems for either mac or ibm . 
scsi 1 8 bit 7 devices per scsi controller .  . asynchronous 1 . 5mb . s ave 
and synchronous 5mb s max transfers .  . 8 bit scsi 2 is often mistaken for 
a fast version of scsi 1 see scsi 2 for details . 
scsi 2 fully scsi 1 compliant .  . scsi 2 mode 10 devices per scsi controller .  . 
8 bit scsi 2 is implimented as a very fast scsi 1 since it can run using 
scsi 1 hardware and software drivers which limits it to 7 devices , which 
results in it sometimes being mistakenly part of scsi 1. 16 bit 
and 32 bit scsi 2 require different ports , electronics , and scsi software 
drivers from scsi 1 which makes them more expensive than other scsi 
interfaces . 32 bit scsi seems to run only in synchronous mode , hence term 
 wide and fast scsi  transfer speeds are 4 6mb s with 10mb s burst 8 bit , 
8 12mb s with 20mb s burst 16 bit , and 15 20mb s with 40mb s burst 
32 bit . 

8 bit scsi 2 is the biggest headache due to the fact that it is the only scsi 2 
that i know of that can pump scsi 2 speeds through scsi 1 devices and software 
controlers .  . its main implimentation is on the mac though you do see adds 
for scsi 2 at 10mb s maximum throughput for pcs. since 8 bit scsi 2 does not 
need all the hardware including and software of 16 bit and 32 bit 
scsi 2 it is the of the scsi 2 interfaces .  . just pop out the scsi 1 
and pop in 8 bit scsi 2 electronics .  . some people consider 
16 bit where scsi 2 really starts i used to be one of them but 
4 6mb s average though put with a theoretical burst of 10mb s is not scsi 1 
but is 8 bit scsi 2. 
rule of thumb if it is and over 5mb s then it is some type of scsi 2. 

8 bit scsi can use part of scsi 1 electronics which further reduces its cost 
compared to 16 and 32 bit scsi 2.

i have tried others , but i think that the adaptec is best value for

2 connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power

do i have to worry about the power supply i think i have 200 watts

all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 


i dont think you can mix the two types of drive , unless you have one of 
the 
scsi ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off. 


is this true i was under the impression that people on the net had both

this is normally the case , but make sure you get a board with a plug in oscillator

subject upgrading the processor on 386 486 machines 
organization harvard university science center 
lines 43 


in case anyone was wondering about upgrading their 386 or 486 class machine 
without spending a lot of money , i looked into replacing the processor 
on those machines and here are the facts  ( as i understand them) .  . 

if you have a ps 2 model 70 or model 80 , you can replace the i386 chip with 
either 1) a cyrix chip for 130 which will increase your processing 
power by about 60 for normal , and not at all for math functions. 
this chip will only run at your original clock speed , ie. if you have a 16mhz 
machine the cyrix will run at 16mhz .  . 
note windows does not use the math functions , so it is a good upgrade if 
you are running windows. 
or , 2) you can get a kingston 486 now platform for 450 with a 
on it which will increase your normal processing power by about 100 , if you 
were running at originally .  . but again it will not increase the speed 
of your math  . i think that it will continue to run at even 
if your original processor runs at a slower speed. 
there is also 3) the kingston 486 now platform for 750 with a 33mhz 
on it. this might speed up your math functions as well , but i am not sure. 

if you have a ps 2 model 70 or other ps 2 machine with either an 
or a non clock doubling (ie .  . it runs at either 25 or 33mhz) in it , 
then you can get an intel overdrive chip (which is really an chip) and 
replace your chip with it. you should get about 95 better for 
both normal and math functions. the 25 50 mhz version of the overdrive chip 
costs 450 and the 33 66mhz version costs 700 .  . the replacement for the 
486sx chip is an good deal as it provides the math 
coprocessor which the 486sx does not have. note that the speed ratings on the 
overdrive chips are the maximum speed at which they can run. if you have a 
20mhz 486sx , then the overdrive chip will run at 20 40mhz , ie. 20mhz externally 
and 40mhz internally .  . there is no reason to buy an overdrive chip which is 
rated at faster then your machine , you will not get faster performance. 

you should be able to buy these chips from any of the merchants that 
advertise at the back of pc magazine or pc week. you might want to shop 
around as prices do vary .  . if you need a name phone number for a source for 
a particular chip , e mail me , and i will respond with a couple of sources.

just got a 66mhz 486dx2 system , and am considering getting a fan for the

 ( stuff deleted) 

my 66 dx2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me. 
i am using the pc power and cooling cpu cooler .  . this one has 
precision ball bearings in the motor .  . it has a pretty substantial 
heat sink so if it happened to fail it would still probably 
dissipate more heat than the bare chip .  . 

it attaches with peel off adhesive .  . this is a full size at case , so 
the fan has gravity in its favor. i would be a little nervous about 
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let 
go. 

all of the cpu fans that i know of are powered from a drive cable. 
there are other board type fans which are isa boards with a couple 
of fans mounted on them. they are powered by the slot .  . i do n't 
know how effective they are maybe someone else could comment. 

the cpu is cool enough to touch with the pcp c unit. 

pc connection at 800 243 8088 has them for 29.95 5.00 next day 
delivery. the y cord is 7.00 if you do n't have a spare lead off the

i just bought a new ide hard drive for my system to go with the one 
i already had. my problem is this. my system only had a ide cable 
for one drive , so i had to buy cable with two drive connectors 
on it , and consequently have to switch cables .  . the problem is , 
the new hard drive 's manual refers to matching pin 1 on the cable 
with both pin 1 on the drive itself and pin 1 on the ide card. but 
for the life of me i cannot figure out how to tell which way to plug 
in the cable to align these. 

most ide drives that i have dealt with have had pin 2 labeled on the printed 
circuit board  ( this is sufficient to determine which side is which) .  . if your 
ide drive does not have a label , then you can look for a polarization notch in 
the receptacle (the connector on the drive with the pins) .  . if the receptacle 
is center polarized , that is it has one rectangular notch about 4 mm wide 
positioned in the center of one side , then you can identify pin 1 as follows 
look into the pins with the notch at the top , pin 1 is at the top right. on 
all drives i have seen this is toward the power connector .  . as for which pin 
is pin 1 on the controller , well you can use the same criteria but look hard 
for the labelling of any pin .  . once you know which end pin 1 2 are on or pins 
39 40 (the oposite end) , then you are all set. all you need to do is keep 
the pin 1 end connected to the pin 1 end. you do n't even have to look at the 
cable itself. just trace the pin 1 side of the cable through. usually the 
pin 1 of the cable is identified by a different color  ( red usually) .  . but 
beware many cable makers are not very careful about this i have seen cables 
with pin 40 being the one marked red. of course with non polarized connectors 
this does n't matter you can plug the cable in either way and you decide 
which side is pin 1. 

secondly , the cable has like a connector at two ends and one between them. 
i figure one end goes in the controler and then the other two go into 
the drives .  . does it matter which i plug into the master drive 
and which into the slave any help appreciated. thanks .  .  .  . 

it does n't matter what gets plugged where. but it does matter how the drives 
are jumpered .  . there will be  ( amongst other options ) two jumpers that you 
should be concerned with on both drives .  . one jumper will select whether the 
drive is the slave or the master. if it is the master , then a second jumper 
selects whether or not a slave is present. you will have to consult the 
that came with you drives .  . if you do not have , 
then just call the manufacturers hotline number or fax number if they have 
one. this kind of information is routinely needed by people just like 
yourself. they will fax you complete info about the jumpers .  . if you do n't 
have convenient access to a fax machine , then you can usually get voice 
help. or post the specific question to this group. (i probably wo n't be 
able to help you) .  . 

good luck

the vl ide adapter can be much faster then the normal ide , it depends on the

it is tested under coretest with 2 . 000 . kb s using a cheap seagate and nearly

speed. i haven t used a vl ide cache controller yet , but it might speed up twice.

you will notice that nanao is the only one which supports a 31 .

i believe there is a file on the diamond bboard that

know the bboard number. 

if you can , please help me with as many of the following 
as possible 

a ) send me the diamond bbs number

i have an 8 bit serial card with two ports. each port has the option of 
using irq 2 , 3 , 4 or 5. i also have two serial ports on a multi i o card , 
and the ports can be set to irq 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 or 9. from other posts i 've read , 
i get the impression that irq2 on the 8 bit card is the same as on

organization compact solutions , canberra act australia 

this may be a very naive question but is there any 
basis for the 
claim that a cpu will get hotter when a 
computationally intensive 
job is running my friend claims that there will be 
little difference 
in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu running a 
computationally 
intensive job. 

from what i 've seen in coursework , most cpus never actually 
idle . they will continue to service interrupts , etc. , 
etc. the clock will always be running at n mhz no matter 
what it 's doing. 

i suppose depending on the instruction , the cpu may use 
circuitry which has more transistors than other 
instructions , but if you consider the additional heat 
generated by only a handful of additional , tiny resistors 
and then spread that heat dissipation over the cpu 's 
packaging , the change in temperature to the immediate 
environment (ie .  . the surface of the package) will be 
negligible .  .

subject re any info on cyrix chip 
organization netcom online communication services  ( 408 241 9760 guest ) 
lines 64 

it seems that there are a lot of questions regarding the cyrix 386 compatible 
and  . my info comes directly from cyrix 's fast fax service 
and also from installing one of these chips in an ibm model 80 .  . 

the is a 486 instruction set compatible cpu which fits into a 386dx 
socket  ( pin grid array , or  . the dlc currently is available in 3 speeds .  . 
the 25 , the 33 , and the 40. they do not have a coprocessor on board , but any 
software query will return as present. i guess they emulate the 
instructions. math functions are on the 386dx level without the 
actual coprocessor .  . 

the internal cache on the is 1k .  . cyrix literature claims a 85 hit 
rate. my informal tests show that the cache accounts for a 10 performance 
boost when it is enabled by software. overall performance boost from a 
386dx 25 to a 25 is about 60 . the benchmarks i used were nu si and 
and  . the performance , with the cache enabled , 
is about on a par with my 386dx 40 with 256k external cpu cache , which is 
around the performance for a 486sx 25. the computer runs faster , 
and dos 6 with dblspace is not complaining. the company claims os 2 
compatibility , but i did n't test it. 

the is not a chip , as commonly thought. the is actually 
a small daughterboard slightly larger than the 386dx , which contains 
the logic to manage the clock doubler .  . this board plugs into the 386dx 
pga , and the 33 or 40 plugs into this board. i guess the board 
doubles the frequency apparent to the cpu , and insert wait states when 
access to the rest of the system is required. there are no info available 
from cyrix there. anyway , the is available for 386dx 16 , and 386dx 20 
only. double these clock rates , and you get the and the 40mhz  . 
if cyrix is planning to do the same thing for the 50 , then they need 
to put out the 50mhz first .  .  .  . 

i also tested a motherboard , along with a cyrix coprocessor .  . with 64k 
external cache , performance were about 30 faster than the 25 , but still 
significantly  ( 25 ) slower than an actual intel  . 

imho , the dlc is a great , low price upgrade for people who ca n't afford , or 
ca n't install , a new motherboard .  . it is definitely worth what i paid for it , 
but if you need 33 performance , the wo n't cut it. i'm not sure 
about the dlc 40 , but i think even if it matches the performance , it wo n't 
beat it in any significant way. 

the last time i posted info about the dlc , people sent quite a bit of mail , 
asking where i got it. so here is where i got mine 

treasure chest peripherals , they advertise in the computer shopper .  . 
1 800 677 
the 25 kit was 179 . 00 . 

but .  .  .  .  . 

i liked the chip so much that i found the supplier , and became a dealer .  . 
if you are interested in the chip , e mail me , and i can fax or mail you 
more info. i'm well aware of the net 's policy against commercial use , 
so i can t post anymore info here. however , if there are more questions 
regarding the itself , i 'll post what i can.

rationale 

the rationale for this proposal is a need for those interested or 
involved in the publishing of cdrom materials to have a forum for 
the discussion relating to their needs. at the moment the main 
for such discussion are in alt . cd . rom and comp . multimedia . neither 
of which have publishing as their focus .  . some lists serve the 
general cdrom community with focuses on library , government and 
network usage , and until several weeks ago none were devoted 
to publishing  ( cdpub has just been setup) .  . in any case a list is not , 
and ought not , be a replacement for regular usenet newsgroups .  . 

the reason for the division into three groups is a natural 
partition of interest between the hardware and software topics , 
and between the two main focal points of software , i.e. 
and multimedia publishing .  . topics such as cdrom xa , cdi , cd r , 
photo cd and other related formats would be included as well. 
topics related to cdrom publishing that are neither clearly 
hardware or software related such as books , copyright issues and 
other legal matters , packaging , distribution , could be included in 
the of comp . publish . cdrom . software . , as would any other 
or multimedia topic that relates in some way to cdrom 
publishing , in any format , and is appropriate to the internet. 

the main focus of comp . publish . cdrom . software . would be topics such as 
index and retrieval software , software , cdrom 
simulation software , hypertext , sgml , scanning and imaging 
software , data capture software , data clean up , compression , 
encryption etc as relates to publishing cdroms .  . 

the main focus of comp . publish . cdrom . multimedia . would be software that 
aids in the multimedia authoring and publishing process audio and 
video. 

the main focus of comp . publish . cdrom . hardware . would be hardware that 
relates to cdrom publishing , as well as hardware for data capture , 
such as all sorts of scanners and data capture hardware , as well as 
information that publishers need to know about the hardware that 
the intended will utilize (the hardware that will 
eventually play the published cdrom ) including networks for cdrom .  . 

notes 

these groups are not to be used for topics such as reviews or 
questions relating to already published cdroms or reviews or 
questions relating to general purpose cdrom drives and the like. 
requests for help in installing a cdrom drive and other general 
topics should be directed to other  . questions about cdroms 
mounted on lans should be directed to bit . listserv .  .

the name. given the poor reports on the net about this modem , i would not 
have ordered it , had i known this in advance. 

it arrived on time. the documentation stated that it would work  ( and was 
preconfigured ) as com4 , providing that com2 was not in use at the same time. 

for several reasons , i have a serial card configured for com1 com2 .  . at the 
time i installed the modem , nothing was connected to com2 .  . 

although the modem appeared to work , during every connection at 9600 or 
14.4 , it would randomly break the connection and hang up the phone. after 
spending some time on the phone with midwest 's tech support , they suggested 
disabling the com2 port. 

this appeared to solve the disconnect problem , but was an unacceptable long 
term solution. i had to have com1 and 2 available , even though they both 
would not be in use at the same time as the modem .  . 

i called back 20 minutes prior to their closing and waited in voicemail 
hell , listening to repeated advertisements for midwest micro products. i 
was then promptly disconnected .  . apparently it was time and they 
did n't want to be bothered with callers that had been waiting on the line. 

i called the next day and asked the customer agent for an rma 
number. she promptly switched me to a tech support rep that implied that 
it was my equipment at fault and that he was n't going to give me an rma 
number. he suggested i use some nonstandard irq settings , a solution i 
was not happy with. the modem should work as originally configured .  . 

conclusion 

i'm not sure the modem would work ok in a basic system , but it clearly does 
not work in a multi port system like mine. since my time is worth more 
than the aggravation or the cost of the modem , i gave it to a local 
charitable organization  ( with a description of my problem) and ordered 
a practical peripherals 14 . from pc connection. 

for 30 more , i have a solid external modem built by a company i know 
will support their users and sold by a company  ( based on personal 
experience) will treat me right if there is a problem. i should have 
known better .  .  .  .

just got a 66mhz 486dx2 system , and am considering getting a fan for the 
cpu .  . the processor when running is too hot to touch so i think this is a 
fairly good idea.  ( long ago when i did some electronics training i read 
somewhere that the regions within a chip that define junctions gates etc 
slowly diffuse over time and this increases with temperature , hence a hot 
chip goes off spec sooner ) 

has anyone out there got a cpu fan 

yes 

is there more than 1 type 

yes , seen glue on , tape on , clip on , one inch square and larger .  . 
my favorite is the 3.5 inch plastic u . s . fan i use just 
down on top of the chip during open case service. 

do you have to remove the cpu from its to install the fan 

depends on the mounting 

do all cpu fans derive their power from spare drive power lines 

only if the manufacturer was smart 

anyone had any trouble with cpu fans 

only if it goes out got that blanket effect which does n't help chip life 

does anyone have any evidence that cpu fans are a complete waste of money 

longer system life makes good economic sense to me 

how are these fans attached  ( glue clips melted cheese ) 

yes well , not the melted cheese 

roughly how much cooler will the cpu be with a fan as opposed to without 

lets you touch the surface the rule of thumb for cooling solid state 

 ( an advert i 've read claims vs 185f ) 

any info appreciated , 

the attached fans look slick and work well but i'm bothered by the potential 
loss of cooling if the fan goes out. at least with the power supply fan you 
can reach back there every few days and feel the fan blowing .  . 

i prefer to put a stock fan off the drive brackets or front panel 
to blow air across the cpu depends a lot on case and board layout , though. 

on chip fans from fry 's electronics in the sf bay area are about 30 . 00 .  . i 
get the stock power supply fans for about 11 . 00 .  .

no. in a standard isa bus , the one that almost all non laptop pcs use , 
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt .  . this is due to 
a screwup in the bus design. for example , if your soundblaster wants 
to drive interrupt number 7 , then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 
or 1 at all times , depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt .  . 
this precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. 

when two or more devices in an isa bus pc share an interrupt , it 's 
because they 're implemented by a single card. 

interesting. would you care to explain to me then , how my soundblaster

diamond video cards  ( stealth , viper , speedstar , etc .  .  . ) . 
may have excellent specifications , and the windows drivers that 
come with them might make windows fast , but 

if you 're considering buying a system , with a view to using 
it to run unix  ( linux , bsd , etc .  .  . ) . or some other special software , 
there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards. 
this is due to diamond 's propriety attitude to it 's hardware 
it 's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
 ( specifically their dot clocks ) without paying , and signing non disclosure 
agreements .  . 

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide 
x windows compatibility with these cards , as diamond did n't want to 
divulge programming  . 

as far as i know only diamond has this propriety on it 's info.

i used to have a lot of line noise problems with my 1200 baud modem .  . 
what was to me was to put a transformer on the line. 
this is easily done by getting a large core from your local 
electronics shop , a core is a ceramic metal , and wind the 
telephone line in through the center of the core and out around the 
outside five or six times. this is a easy and cheap fix that does not 
have the of having to use to fix a hardware problem.

hi , 

does anyone have a source for 386dx 25 motherboards i 've 
been calling around the local stores and everyone appears 
to be only stocking the 386dx 33 40 or 386sx 25 33 motherboards .  . 

how difficult is it to modify a 386dx 40 motherboard to run at 
25 mhz is it as simple as replacing the system clock with a 
slower part

so , when you 've got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by 
increasing the amount of overlapping you do. 

one way is with dma or bus mastering .  . either of these make it 
possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory 
without interrupting the cpu .  . the alternative is for the cpu to move 
the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and 
bus mastering .  . 

how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus 

as an earlier post noted through dma .  . 

ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface 
created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data 
bytes , with no dma .  . 

if we 're talking isa  ( at ) bus here , then you can only have 1 dma channel 
active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device. 
so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus , explain how 
all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card 
to the isa at bus at the same time. 

any one time means imho a single byte xfer .  . if i have four sources of 
dma requests ready , the dma would service the one after the other. if 
the bandwidth for the four together is lower than the isa dma 
bandwidth , this will work. 

note that the bus mastering here is the priority mechanism in the dma 
controller .  .

but i heard that some board t work properly 
cause some is that true 

should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution 

in case i buy local bus it 's better to buy an accelerated 
svga card with a normal local bus ide controller 
or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated 
with a normal ide controller 

3) is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color 
svga card at which price 
4) i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read

could n't agree more. on my 486 50 i do n't miss the speed. it 's still 
faster than a normal disk read would be. as for the less compression , 

koberg 

i recall reading a review article in pc computing wherein they reported 
a reduction in the loading time for lengthy programs using stacker 3 . 0 .  . 
this was not due to the compression algorithm per se , but to the fact 
that fewer fetches were required during the sequential file access. does 
anyone have any actual performance numbers relating to speeds of stacker

i am right now working on an mpr ii certified  ( swedish standards for 
low emissions ) hitachi 15 monitor. it 's 1024x768 , up to at 
that res , and it got a good write up for image quality in a recent (feb .  . ) 
issue of pc magazine. as far as i know , very little fully matches a nec in 
image quality (at least according to the mags i ca n't tell any 
difference between the two ! ) , but i think nec is low emissions on only one 
of the two types. there 's vlf  ( very low frequency ) and elf (i think that 's 
extremely low  . the mpr ii standards set strict limits on both. 
but many , nec included according to one article i read (i get a 
bunch of mags so it 's hard for me to remember which ! ) , which claim low 
emissions but not specifically mpr ii compliant or mpr ii certified 
only control for one , usually vlf , and ignore the other. 
so , the nec probably has higher overall image quality (i 
hear it rated as the best or close to the best ) , but not as low 
emissions as the hitachi .  . i like my image quality , but for all i know you 
may be more discerning .  . good luck !

quantum hard disk phantom seeks 

i just purchased and installed a quantum 3.5 hard drive , model 
, and have a concern about its behavior. 

although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to 
file i o , it performs what i call phantom seeks .  . 

when the pc is absolutely idle , i can hear a spurt of activity in the 
drive every 30 40 seconds , lasting 1 2 seconds. this activity seems to 
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk led never 
comes on. the disk led is attached to the disk controller card , not 
the drive. 

my other hard disk , a seagate , does not have this kind 
behavior. 

can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon

dave tigger !

dave c johnson 

i think you mean the ethernet numbers. the 8 byte ethernet id is the unique 
electronic serial number  ( esn ) assigned to each ethernet board in existence .  . 
this is a physical layer concept. the ip address is a higher layer protocol .  . 
the analogy to telephone service is the ip address is your phone number , while 
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some  ( unknown to you or 
i) physical identification scheme  . 

but to answer your question  ( assuming you indeed meant the ethernet number) 
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number. of course the 
manufacturer can always retro fit a board , but there could hardly be a 
reason to ever do that. 

if your question is actually referring to the ip address , it is most definetly 
 . but it is strictly software.

i still do n't see why they ever made the 486 50 cpu at all. its to 
fast for both isa and lb and vesa boards .  .  .

i have the following problem i have to use a computer for special purposes

program but no keyboard. 
i ca n't disable the keyboard from bios setup  ( in fact , there is no setup) .  . 
i spoke to someone who said that he had fooled the bios with simply 
using a self made connector that connects two pins via a resistor .  . 
pity , pity .  .  .  . i lost contact to the person before getting more detail. 
so does anyone of you experts can help

this may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the 
claim that a cpu will get hotter when a computationally intensive 
job is running 

i totally agree with your friend , since when the cpu is apparently idle 
it is still in fact churning away millions of instructions per second 
 ( checking for keyboard input for instance) .  . 

the exception to this is for cpu 's used in laptops , where the cpu can 
enter an idle state where it is just preserving its current status but 
doing absolutely nothing. in this case it needs a hardware interrupt 
to get it going again. 

actually , the family has a halt instruction that causes the cpu to 
cease processing instructions. the cpu resumes processing either by being 
reset or by receiving an external  ( hardware ) interrupt .  . this is different 
from the power management facilities victor mentions .  . of course , whether an 
operating system 's idle loop uses the halt instruction is another matter 
entirely .  .

i ran into the same problem when i upgraded from a 2400 modem to a 14400 
modem .  . any time i give the modem a reset command while , in windows. 
the computer locks up. if i give the command in dos , it will work. my solution 
was to not give the modem the command thru windows. in the 
install process i told the program i have a hayes compatible 2400 modem .  . 
was not included in the initialization string it works fine. i called ms 
about this , they did n't have a clue as to what the memory interupt conflict 
could be. the lockup using any windows comm program that gives the 
command.

well , i tried this method based on responses from several people. either 
i am a  ( klutz(probable ) or they have changed the connector .  . i ended up having 
to destroy the connector , put heat shrink tubing on the individual pins and

thanks in advance 

volker 

ide drives have jumpers on them to indicate if it is a master or a slave .  . 
if it is a master , then a second jumper indicates if a slave is present. 
these must be set correctly according to each drive 's manufacturers spec 
 . the cmos setup is almost positively not the problem. it is 
probably not the controller ide controllers all support exactly two 
drives maximum .  . check those jumpers .  .

disclaimer i do n't speak for and they do n't speak for me. 
i 've been told by our local computer guru that you ca n't do this unless you 
perform a low level format on your existing hard drive and set your system 
up for two hard drives from the beginning. i took him at his word , and i 
have not tried to find out any more about it , because i'm not going to back 
everything up just to add another hdd .  . if anyone knows for sure what the 
scoop is , i would like to know also. thanks in advance also. 

bill willis 


1. do not do a low level format on an ide drive unless you have the 
executable for doing so supplied by the manufacturer .  . these are 
available from bbs 's or mail but the mail version costs a nominal 
fee. 

2. in addition to the master slave jumper on an ide drive there is also 
another jumper to indicate whether a slave is present. get it right ! 

3. the cabling is not an issue as long as pin 1 goes to pin 1 goes to 
pin 1. no twisting or swapping on an ide cable. be sure of pin 1 
on all three components do not make assumptions  ( guesses are ok 
but assumptions are  . 

4. if the cable and jumpers are correct , and the cmos setup is correct , 
then you may have to do an fdisk followed by a high level format. 
i have never personally found this necesary , but perhaps there is 
something gone wrong with the data on the disks probably not but 
i understand your you will probably throw salt over 
your shoulders , wear funny clothes and do a spooky sounding chant 
while dancing around the room if someone said it might help. 

good luck

this may be a very naive question but is there any basis for the

in the temperature of an idle cpu and a cpu running a computationally 
intensive job. 

it first depends on what an idle cpu is doing ! 

i'm not sure about dos , but many multitasking oss have an loop like this 


loop 
is there anything to do 
yes do it goto loop 
no goto loop 


the cpu is not doing any work but it is still processing instructions .  .  .  . 

i 've done some asic and digital design , but not any cpu design. 
it would seem to me that on a 486 , the fpu is not being used , most of 
the cache is not being accessed , the off chip buffers drivers are idle , 
the multiplier is n't multiplying , the barrel shifters are n't shifting , 
microcode is n't , etc. this means transistors are n't 
switching which means less power dissipated  ( in cmos ) , which means 
less heat. 

from what i understand , the pentium shuts down those sections of the 
cpu which are n't being used in order to cut down on heat power.

sorry phillips do n't make it any more. what is it anyway

types on the screen are all out of focus .  . i 've gotten replacement video 
cards , and a replacement monitor. none of that has helped though. 
could someone help me with this very problem. 

i have the 1 meg card with the crystal scan 15 inch also. i see very 
faint shadows on the left side of the screen only in 1024 x 768 mode , 
but not enough to really bother me. the characters on the screen 
are clear until i turn on the crystal fonts , then they become blurry .  . 

i have a friend who has 2 meg on the video card who has the same shadows ,

email me and maybe i can upload them to some other sites as well. 
i have a local bus based card  ( vl24 from micron ) but i think 
the drivers work with isa cards  ( or at least includes drivers for them) .  . 

i found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version , 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3 . 11) . by about 2 million (7 . 77 . to 9 . 88) . 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
cirrus 's part but i do n't think so.

its no viper , but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ati card and when compared to the other cards included in gibson 's review. 

micron system owner 's , i would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
dtc local bus disk controller .  . my system came with a maxtor 7120

i am now at 22 kb s. is this about as good as it gets i ca n't get a norton 's

tk accidentally discovered that if a have a floppy from one particular

tk the non system diskette message , the machine hangs and the cmos 
tk gets overwritten  ( luckily , gateway sends a print of the standard 

just a wild thought here , but how about this there is a small boot program 
on every formatted diskette , whether or not it contains system files. it is 
this small program that prints the non system disk error , not dos .  . if 
this program tries to transfer control to a bios location that is 
nonstandard on the gateway , then it could clear the bios .  . 

i do n't think that the bios is overwritten , there is usually a small routine 
to clear the cmos area , in case an invalid configuration prevents the 
machine from booting .  . i think that the boot code on the fuji disks may 
inadvertantly call this routine. 

just a thought.

does anyone have experience with the promise technology caching 
ide controller i just ordered one , 110 with 512k installed , 
and have a few questions 

1. is it easy to use does it need any kind of tsr 's , or is 
it completely transparent to the system board , so that i wo n't 
have to change the bios configuration 

yes , it 's easy to use. it 's just like an ordinary controller .  . 
you do n't have to change the bios config .  . 

2. is it transparent to the ide drive will it work with any drive 
or does it have to be configured explicity for the type of drive 
installed 

it 's transparent .  . it works with any drive. if you change the 
drive you only need to change the bios config .  . as usual. 

3. will it work with a dual drive system  ( master and slave) 
yes , no problem. 


4. with it , will i need smartdrive or dos buffers 
that depends .  . you will get a little better performance 
if you use smartdrive and buffers in addition .  . that 's 
because access to the card through the isa bus is slower 
than access to system ram .  . i do n't use smartdrive myself , 
but i have a few buffers .  . 


5. is the promise technology controller a good one 

any information would be greatly appreciated. thanks !

after reading many postings concerning hard drives i'm still unclear

thanks to anyone who can clear this up. 

i have two scsi hard drives , each has 512kb of  . 

there several reasons for this 

when the drive has read requested data from the disk the scsi bus may be 
busy. this data needs to be stored some where until the bus is free and 
the data can be transmitted .  . 

when the drive receives data to be written , the data can come down the bus 
faster than the drive can write it to the disk .  . it needs to be stored 
somewhere while the disk is writing it out. 

in these situations the memory is being used as a buffer not a cache ! 

may be the drive does some read caching as well .  .  .  .

these lpt1 , com1 , disk controller are call devices. there are 
devices that requires exclusive interrupt ownership , eg. disk 
controller  ( i6 ) and keyboard (i1) .  . there are also devices that 
does not require exclusive ownership , ie. it will share an 
interrupt with another device , eg. lpt1 

no. in a standard isa bus , the one that almost all non laptop pcs use , 
two separate interface cards cannot share an interrupt .  . this is due to 
a screwup in the bus design. for example , if your soundblaster wants 
to drive interrupt number 7 , then it must hold a certain bus wire to 0 
or 1 at all times , depending on whether or not it wants an interrupt .  . 
this precludes letting another card assert interrupt number 7. 

when two or more devices in an isa bus pc share an interrupt , it 's 
because they 're implemented by a single card. 

interesting. would you care to explain to me then , how my soundblaster 
pro card and my printer card are sharing irq 7 successfully i assure 
you that they are both set to irq 7 and that i have no problem. my 
computer is a dtk 286 12 ibm clone .  . 

simple. first , andrew is correct , although i can see where there might be 
some confusion. it is indeed possible to have two cards configured to use 
the same interrupt .  . they can not share the interrupt in the sense that it 
is not possible to have both cards active at the same time. 

here is an example. for some time , i was short of free interrupts .  . i had a 
tape controller (not a floppy tape ) that needed one of irq7 .  . (it 's an 
old tape drive . ) . my solution was to use irq3  ( also used for com2 , where my 
modem is) .  . i did this because i reasoned i would never be using the modem and 
the tape simultaneously .  . when kermit runs , it installs its own interrupt 
handler for irq3 and uses the serial port. if the tape drive were to generate 
an interrupt , kermit would not have a clue what to do with for the tape 
controller .  .  ( and since the tape controller would not be serviced , it would 
most likely hang .  . ) likewise , when the tape backup software runs , it 
installs an interrupt handler for irq3 .  . that handler wo n't do anything for 
the serial port. 

under dos , printing is not interrupt driven .  . instead , the bios polls the 
status of the parallel port to determine when another byte may be sent. 
that 's why you can have your sound card and lpt1 both configured to use irq7 .  . 
try that on nt and see how far you 'll get. )

yes its realy simple , no one makes a mother board that runs the

which bus 

i think there are several reasons 

50mhz motherboards are harder to get right 
50mhz need a fast l2 cache 12 is a good idea 
50mhz needs to be slowed down to make a compliant vesa bus 
66mhz dx2 chips are faster for a lot of things

interference problems with 50 systems. getting an fcc b  ( home use) 
certification required additional shielding in the system. 

2 . ) . heat .  .  . a . lot of people seem to be installing heat sinks and or cooling 
fans on their 486dx2 66 chips. i would guess that the 50 ran 
temperatures inside the case even hotter .  . and heat is the enemy of system 
reliability .  .

hi 

i need some advice  ( opinions ) regarding which pc would best suit my needs ! 
i want to use this  ( proposed ) beast for basically four things 

editing documents using wordperfect 5.1  ( under dos) 

creating graphs analyzing data using v5 . 0 .  ( under dos) 

editing playing with images using aldus , running under 
windows 3.1 these images can be large , say 2k x 2k , 24bits pixel 

using the pc as an xterminal , running x 1.1 and sun pc nfs , 
talking to our network of sparcstation 's this is where a lot of 
the images data come from , and is the most demanding of these tasks .  . 

i 've read , read , read pc magazines , performed benchmarks , read this newsgroup , 
and decided that a nice system  ( price performance) would be 

50 256k cache , isa , vlb , ram 
ati graphics ultra pro , 2 meg ram , local bus 
15 monitor , 1280x1024 ni 
3com iii 16bit 
maxtor ide hard drive 

however , the parts do n't fit ! our local retailer apparently put one of these 
together , only to discover that the ati card would n't run at 50mhz surprise 
surprise. actually , after reading this group , i'm surprised that they even 
have a 50mhz local bus running .  .  .  . 

i have a choice now between basically the above system but with a 
486dx2 66 with isa and vlb , or , a 50 with eisa and no vlb  ( and thus 
the non local bus version of the ati card) .  . which is better , keeping in mind 
that i'm primarily interested in the last two tasks 

any help would be greatly appreciated ! (i need to decide quickly , so any 
speedy help would be appreciated even more ! ! ) 



btw we have a system now to perform these tasks , it has the following 
configuration 

33 64k cache , isa , 8 meg ram 
ati graphics ultra , 2 meg ram 
14 monitor , 1024x768 ni 
smc 8 bit 
maxtor 120mb ide hard drive 

we 're quite happy with the ati card very fast , once the data gets to it ! ! 
slow repainting images under that have moved off screen , or 
been uncovered ! 

there does n't seem to be enough raw cpu when running x ! its sluggish 
running the local window manager. also , many functions under take 
a long time  ( even when the images fit entirely in ram) .  . 

there 's not enough memory in the system x and a 1 meg smartdrive 
do n't leave much room for other apps. will page to disk with 
medium size images. 

i have performed a number of benchmarks on the ethernet transfer rates. this 
machine only 120k sec over ethernet while our sustain 600k sec 
on the same network. going to the 16 bit version of the smc card increases 
transfer rates to 160k sec still very slow  ( especially when moving large 
 . is there such a thing as a local bus ethernet card coming will it 
make a difference i'm hoping so , and leaning towards the 486dx2 66 choice 
 ( above ) , for that reason. 

also , are there dx2 100 's on the horizon what about 99 's 150 's ! 

any information is greatly appreciated.

would someone be willing to explain to me the 50mhz is not more

faster than the 66mhz for certian applications. plus , a 50mhz 
motherboard would seem better if you had any plans on upgrading the

buying the dx2 66 .  .  .  . many adds do n't even mention the dx 50. 
thanks a lot ,

yes its realy simple , no one makes a mother board that runs the 
bus at more than 33mhz .  .  .  . sam . 

this is n't quite true depending on the number of local bus slots , and 
whether or not the device is integrated into the mother board , it is 
possible to run local bus at up to 40 and 50 mhz .  . i 've also spoken to a few 
people who run standard local bus video cards at 50 mhz without trouble 
 ( and a couple of people who could n't get a lb card to work at that speed) .  .

which would you choose , and why 

i have both ! 

i have ide only on my box and ide and scsi on my unix box. 

ide on the box  cos it only has a hard disk , scsi on my unix box  cos it 
has a scsi hard disk , cd rom and tape. 

i bought scsi as it makes adding many devices easier. for the price of one 
irq and dma i have three different types of device connected up. 

faster drives are also available for scsi i have a dec that realy 
does have a average seek time. i.e it finds data 25 faster than my 12ms 
toshiba drive. 


like lots of people , i 'd really like to increase my data transfer rate from 
the hard drive. right now i have a 15ms ide drive  ( seagate 1239a ) , and 
a standard ide controller card on my isa 486 50. 

i do n't think that scsi will increase your data transfer much on an isa bus ( 


i'm currently thinking about adding another hd , in the 300mb to 500mb range. 
and i'm thinking hard about buying a scsi drive  ( scsi for the future benefit) .  . 
i believe i'm getting something like sec transfer right now  ( according 
to nu) .  . 

s is pretty good .  .  .  . 


how would this number compare if i bought the state of the art scsi card for 
my isa pc , and the state of the art scsi hard drive (the best system i could 
hope for) 

many state of the art scsi disks use the same mechanicals as many state of the 
art ide drives .  . only the interface differ look at the 
drive for an example ! 


obviously money factors into this choice as well as any other , but what would 
you want to use on your isa system and how much would it cost 

i use an adaptec 1542b on my unix box and no name ide cards on both. 


along those lines , what kind of transfer rate could i see with my ide hd 's if i 
were to buy the top of the line ide caching controller for my 200mb , 15ms hd 
and how much would it cost 

caching controller ! why what does it give you that smartdrive ( for dos ) does 
not about 30kb extra lower memory ! that 's about it. 

a properly configured main memory cache will produce better results than a caching 
controller ! my unix reads reads data from its main memory cache at 8 . 5mb . s ! that 's 
faster than the standards isa bus can ever sustain ! 



thanks for any comments.

i have a computer with a 105 mg seagate ide drive and a controler 
built into the motherboard .  . i want to add a scsi drive (a quantum prodrive 
425 mg formatted) .  . i have no documentation at all and i need your 
help ! 

as i understand it , here is the process of adding such a drive. could you 
please tell me if i'm right .  .  . 

1 buy a scsi contoler .  . which one i know adaptec is good , but they are 
kind of expensive. are there any good boards in the 100 region i want 
it to be compatible with os2 and unix if possible. also , i have seen on 
the net that there are scsi and drives .  . is this true does the 
adapter need to be the same as the drive what type of drive is the 
quantum 


i have tried others , but i think that the adaptec is best value for money. 


2 connect the drive to the adapter via a scsi cable and the power cable. 
do i have to worry about the power supply i think i have 200 watts and 
all i'm powering are two floppies and the seagate drive. 


i dont think you can mix the two types of drive , unless you have one of the 
scsi ide cards that is available. you will have to turn your ide off. 


3 setup the bios to recognize the drive as the second drive. what type 
of drive is this i do n't have the numbers for this drive. 


instructions for drive type are included with the controller .  . with some it may be 
a type 1. no matter what the disk is. with others it may be a type 47 .  . i had one 
controller that i had to tell the bios that no hard disk was installed. 


4 format and create partitions on the drive. do i use format or fdisk i 
think that ide drives ca n't be low level formatted .  . is it the same with 
scsi how exactly does fdisk work i have a reduced msdos 5.0 manual 
 ( clone obliges ) and there is no mention of fdisk .  . ideally , i would want 
the drive partitioned in to two partitions d and e how do i do this 


do not low level format a scsi unless you have the scsi low level format program. 
first use fdisk to set the partitions , then use format. 


well that seems to be all. is there anythiing i'm forgetting

i am no expert on this. but i am pretty sure there is no way to recover this. ide drive has mapping information written directly on drives .  . when you low level format it , the information itself is gone as well , i do n't think you can get it back unless you send it back to western digital and ask them to refurbish it for you.

p.s. i'm intending to use the cable for pc to pc transfers  ( via lap link or

i do not have specific knowledge of lap link or telix , but my recommendation 
for any package is to follow each one 's instructions for making the null 
modem cable. the reason is that each one may be different since there is n't 
really a standard for pc to pc communications .  . the following is a tutorial 
i wrote up that will give you an understanding about rs 232 and null modems , 
but you should still check your software ! 

i will a couple of details of rs 232 .  . rs 232 is 
a specification for communicating between a computer and a 
modem .  . actually it can be between any end system and any communications 
hardware. the terminology used is data terminal equipment  ( dte ) and data 
communications equipment  . rs 232 spells out the voltage levels , the 
connector type , the pinouts , and the signal protocols .  . the connector is 
a db 25 but ibm has set an alternative standard of db 9. the primary 
signals are transmit data  ( td ) , recieve data  ( rd ) , and signal ground  . 
there are other signals that provide control between the dte and the dce .  . 
for example , the dte announces that it is powered up and ready to participate 
in communications via the data terminal ready  ( dtr ) signal .  . dtr is an 
output on the dte and an input on the dce .  . similarly , the dce announces that 
it is ready to participate in communications via the data set ready  ( dsr ) 
signal .  . dsr is an input on the dte and an output on the dce .  . ok that 's 
five signals there are only four more of interest. the request to send  ( rts ) 
signal is an output from the dte  ( and an input to the dce ) that is used 
to ask the dce permission to send data. if the dce agrees , it sends an ok 
via the clear to send  ( cts ) signal .  .  ( for completeness , the cts is an input 
to the dte and an output from the  . the other two signals  ( of interest) 
are ring indicator  ( ri ) and data carrier detect  . these are both inputs 
to the dte and outputs from the dce .  . ri is just what you would expect 
a signal to the dte saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection 
to the dce .  . this is rather specific to the modem telephone line setup. 
dcd is a way for the dce to announce that the connection has been established 
i.e. the local dce is talking to some remote dce .  . there that 's it. oh 
there are many other rs 232 signals defined , but they are obsolete .  . i have 
explained the nine signals that are on a pc. the pinouts are as follows 

name db 9 db 25 
sg 5 7 
td 3 2 
rd 2 3 
dtr 4 20 
dsr 6 6 
dcd 1 8 
rts 7 4 
cts 8 5 
ri 9 22 

now to address your problem at hand. when you connect a pc to a pc (a dte 
to a dte ) , there is no dce pair in the middle and therefore the rs 232 
signal definitions do n't work out quite right. there is no dce to assert 
the cts , dsr , dcd , or ri .  . so the common thing to do is to not use these 
signals at all and also forget about the dtr and rts outputs as well. if 
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through sg , 
and crosses td and rd (i . e .  . pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other 
end , etc) .  . the problem with this solution is that a pc that wants to send 
data has no way of knowing if the other pc is ready. it would have to just 
send the data and hope it got through. therefore a better null modem would 
include the dtr dsr pair crossed .  . a particular point a confusion is in the 
software area. just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft 
ware will use them. if you are using the built in bios to control the 
serial port , then the bios dictates what wires you need and how they are to 
be used. but if you have a comm. package such as brooklyn bridge , or lap 
link or telix , then those packages dictate the cabling requirements. the 
only thing you can guess reliably is the sg , td , and rd. the dtr dsr is also 
fairly common. there is one more issue that needs to be addressed here. and 
that is flow control. in the rs 232 , the dce 's are responsible for 
flow control and it is assumed that the dce could n't possible over run the 
dte .  . by this i mean that as long as the dte has its dtr line asserted , the 
dce will send data without requesting permission first. note the contrast 
to the other direction of data flow the dte must request permission by 
asserting the rts line and it must wait for the cts signal before it can 
send .  . and now in the dte to dte , the question is do you need flow 
control the is usually .  . but how for non binary communications , 
one common technique is xon xoff which is implemented in software no 
wires are dedicated to flow control the td and rd carry the xon and xoff 
commands .  . this type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware 
flow control , but the problem is that you ca n't send binary data because 
your data might include the xon or xoff codes and cause erroneous 
signals .  . (a work around is to have the software insert and extract escape 
codes , but the hardware flow control is  . the problem with hard 
ware flow control is that there is no standard. there are lots of ways to 
do it and i bet they have all been tried. one cornerstone of all the methods 
is to use the rts cts for one direction. but beyond that anything is fair 
game. again , you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements. 
but i bet you 'll find that one cable  ( if wired properly ) could work with 
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage .  . by the way , 
i am familiar with one package that uses rts cts and dtr dsr for flow control 
the rts is request to send and the dtr is ready to recieve , the cts is the 
clear to send and the dsr is the request to recieve .  . this does not mean a 
differnt cable it is just software. the clincher to all of this cabling 
stuff is that it is common to have the uart directly controlled by the cts 
signal which means that the cts must be present even if you are not support 
ing it in software. for these cases you will find cables that short the 
rts to the cts at the same end  ( or perhaps the dtr to the cts) .  . other 
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain 
signals that you do n't have  ( or do n't feel like providing because it would 
mean additional wires) .  . specifically i am talking about the dsr .  . shorting 
the dtr to the dsr is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like 
this. it is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose. one more 
gotcha signal is the dcd .  . some software  ( including the pc bios) expects to 
see the dcd before it will work. this signal sometimes gets shorted with the 
dtr .  . but my favorite null modem has the rts and cts shorted at each end , but 
the rts is also connected through to the other end and connected to dcd .  . and 
of course the dtr dsr are crossed as are the td rd and of course the sg must 
pass through. this null modem works with most software. the flow control , 
if any , can use the rts dcd with the dtr dsr .  . if your comm. package does not 
specify the cable required for pc to pc connection , then i suggest you use 
this one.

recently , i have been getting a cmos checksum error when i first turn on my 
computer. it does n't happen everytime i turn it on , nor can i predict when it 
is going to happen. i have an ami bios and all of the setting are lost , for 
example the drive types and the password options. however , the date and time 
remain correct. if anyone knows what can be causing this , please let me know. 

most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing this battery 
maintains the contents of the cmos memory when ac power is turned off , and 
if the battery is then the contents of the cmos will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong  ( along with most other of the cmos data) .  . try 
replacing the battery. 

if , however , your pc does n't use a battery but a large capacitor to power 
the cmos , you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. if this is n't possible , make sure you leave 
your pc on for a half hour or hour each day this will keep the capacitor 
charged .  . i 'd opt for the battery change , though. 

it 's also possible , but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the cmos .  . if your battery seems okay , get a virus scanner and 
check out your system.

is this true i was under the impression that people on the net had both 
scsi and ide working together. 

no , it 's not true. you can get scsi and ide to work together , but 
there are restrictions (at least with the adaptec 1542 ) 

you must boot from the ide drive. there is no way to boot from the 
scsi drive if you have both ide and scsi drives .  . 

you must disable the scsi rom bios  ( i'm not sure about this , though) , 
and so you must also use some special drivers to access the scsi 
drive.  . i know that you have to disable something related to 
the scsi bios , but i'm not sure if it is the rom itself . ) . 

back in february , someone asked about ide and scsi  ( this question 
gets asked again and again) .  . at the end of this message , i 've included 
an edited copy of my reply. you might find it interesting. 

darryl okahata 
internet 

disclaimer this message is the author 's personal opinion and does not 
constitute the support , opinion or policy of hewlett packard or of the 
little green men that have been following him all day. 


1) is it worth it to get scsi over ide will there be a noticable 
decrease in access time increase in xfer rate 

for msdos applications , isa based scsi and ide controllers 
generally have comparable throughput .  . you might get slightly higher 
throughput with a scsi disk , but you 'll also pay more for the disk 
( 30 100 and up , in some cases) .  . you 'll also pay much , much more for a 
good scsi controller .  . 

note that good scsi controllers really show their power if they 're 
used with a good multitasking operating system  ( like a pc unix) .  . 
unfortunately , neither msdos nor windows 3.1 is a good multitasking 
operating system. the performance advantage of scsi controllers is 
mostly wasted with these , which leaves the advantage of being able to 
connect multiple devices to the scsi bus as the only advantage .  . 
however , note that you can expect to pay a premium for scsi devices. 

if you 're only going to be using msdos , stick with ide .  . it 's 
cheaper , and you 'll have less headaches .  . 

4) will virtually any scsi device chain into the controller for my 
hard drive  ( bernoulli box , cd rom , tape drive , etc) .  . 

note the following is true for msdos windows only. who knows what 
the future holds for windows nt and unix 

no. generally , you have to find drivers for each scsi device , 
which probably do n't exist unless you 're using one of the better high 
performance scsi controllers .  . these are typically bus mastering scsi 
controllers that cost around 180 400  ( street prices ) and up , and 
drivers that allow you to connect these controllers to popular 
name brand scsi devices either come with the card , or can be purchased 
 ( for under 100 list price) .  . examples of such driver kits are 

adaptec 's ez scsi kit  ( list 75) .  . this works only with adaptec scsi 
controllers .  . 

! (from the same people who make coreldraw ! )  ( list 99 ( )) .  . 
this driver kit will supposedly work with any scsi controller card 
that has an aspi driver , like the adaptec .  . 

central point 's pc tools for dos 8.0 supports a number of scsi tape 
drives (the documentation lists 40 tape  . unfortunately , it 
works only with adaptec controllers .  . 

5) are there likely to be other problems incompatibilities with a 
scsi controller and sound cards video accelerators and similar 
equipment. 

yes , you will run into problems , if you 're using a 
high performance , bus mastering scsi controller .  . this does n't sound 
right , does n't it it 's true , though. with one of these controllers , 
you 'll probably have to tweak your system to get it to work with sound 
cards , floppy controller based tape drives  ( like the cms jumbo 250 ) , and 
windows 3 . 1 .  . i know. i 've been to h ll and back getting my scsi 
controller to work with various hardware software  ( thank god for tape 
 . if you want a copy of my adaptec 1542 hints and tips file , 
send email. 

these problems are n't really the fault of the scsi controller card 
the problems are really with the general hardware and software design of 
the pc (e . g .  . , no standards) .  . however , adding a bus mastering scsi card 
is what brings these problems to the surface and makes them visible .  . 

scsi holds a lot of promise , but you can run into a lot of pc 
compatibility problems. if you 're planning on using only msdos windows 
3.1 , stick with ide .  . if you want to use windows nt or a pc unix , you 'll 
have to make some hard decisions a good scsi controller and more than 
one scsi hard disk will probably give you excellent performance , at the 
possible cost of msdos compatibility .  . i say , probably , because , 
while i know this to be true with a pc unix , i do n't know if this really 
will be true of windows nt .  . i suspect that it will , but i do n't know 
for sure.

the modem is an internal at  ( e)isa ) 8 bit card  ( just a little longer 
than a half card) .  . it has v . 32bis . for 14 . 4kbps . data 9600 bps fax , 
v . 42 . , v . 42bis . , and mnp5 for error correction and data compression , so 
you can get error free links up to 57 , 600 bps on a conventional phone 
line. they will fall back to any speed  ( down to 1200bps ) and even 
disable compression and error correction if necessary in order to 
connect with slower and older modems .  . 

it has a 16550 buffered uart for better compatibility with 
multi tasking operating systems  ( windows , os 2 , unix , etc) .  . 

they use a patented technology called optical line interface  ( oli ) 
which reduces noise generated by the modem to assure the fastest and 
cleanest connection possible. 

these modems come with a lifetime warranty and free lifetime tech 
support  ( and the call is free , too) from at t. 

they also include the lovely and talented quicklink ii for dos and the 
new quicklink ii for windows communications and fax software which 
will let you conveniently sent faxes from any dos or windows 
application just by printing .  . the windows version will send faxes of 
any font and can include graphics , etc. the dos version can fax 
graphics and a limited set of fonts (i believe that there are 5 or so , 
as well as any hp laser ii resident fonts) .  . 

i'm asking 210.00 for this modem  ( plus utah tax) .  . this is at or 
below the prices of any other  ( reputable ) manufacturer of an 
equivalent modem  ( including zoom , us robotics , etc) .  . and , it is 
backed by a company that will never go away. 

this price will include delivery if you live within 20 miles of 
downtown slc .  . i can also arrange shipping , or you can stop by my home 
to pick it up.  ( if you 're concerned about installing an internal

if you 're interested , please let me know. this is an excellent modem 
at an excellent price  ( they normally list for 500 and retail for

improving my graphic winmarks (v3 . 11) . by about 2 million (7 . 77 . to 9 . 88) .

its no viper , but i think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of

hello , 

for 2 months i 've attempted to get either 
a 3rd or 4th serial port working on my system. 

various systems diagnostics (e . g .  . , msd , norton) tell me 
it 's there , but anything i hook up to it ca n't use it 

i have two serial ports on the motherboard 

if i set my internal fax modem for com4 the utility 
programs report a com3 

i 've checked to make sure all the irqs and addresses are 
correctly  ( as listed in most manuals ) set 

am i missing something very basic 

where should i go from here 

any help , even a point in the right direction , would be 
most appreciated.

if you 're considering buying a system , with a view to using 
it to run unix  ( linux , bsd , etc .  .  . ) . or some other special software , 
there is a good chance that it will not work with the diamond cards. 
this is due to diamond 's propriety attitude to it 's hardware 
it 's impossible to get free information from them about their chips 
 ( specifically their dot clocks ) without paying , and signing non disclosure 
agreements .  . 

this made it impossible for the free software foundation to provide 
x windows compatibility with these cards , as diamond did n't want to 
divulge programming  . 

i do n't think the two main free x systems ( and xfree86 ) are part 
of the fsf as such. 


considering the above , and some postings about diamond 's bad attitute 
customers , i ordered and vlb 2m card. it will 
these days. 

does anyone know of an e mail address for diamond to which penio could 
forward his purchase information

the current adaptec drivers do not support the toshiba 3401 .  . you should 
get the corel scsi drivers , which do support it.

a couple of months ago i tried out a hercules graphite card. a pretty nice 
board. fairly fast , and seemed quite compatible even seemed to handle the 
svga modes i have whined about here on occasion. at the time i was just 
buying a vlb system , so after checking out the card i sent it back. i wanted 
a vlb card , and purchased a fahrenheit vlb card. this card is fairly fast , 
will do 70 hz refresh at 1024x768 , but is not compatible with my cd roms 
(the svga thing i think i have merely conjectured that is the cause of 
an old graphics board being able to run in a higher resolution with those 
programs than the modern boards i have tried. i have not gotten a straight 
answer out of anybody .  .  . ) .  . the monitor i am using it with is a 17 magnavox , 
which also tops out at hz so its really a pretty good match. 

but .  .  .  . 

that is for my wife. i just purchased a viewsonic 17 for myself , and am 
looking for a graphics card to drive it. i want 70hz refresh , 
and would really like it to handle my cd roms .  . i tried the orchid p9000 , 
which did neither of those things  ( though robert at did say that the 
70hz was possible if i the driver data  . so my thoughts go back 
to hercules .  . they were supposed to be coming out with a vlb version of the 
graphite around the end of march .  . i have heard precisely zero about it since 
then. does anyone know if the card was actually released , and what capabilities 
 ( and price) it has 

any info would be most appreciated.

kin chan  ( sparrow wrote 
just curious why floptical drives never seemed to catch on. remember 
those 21 mb disks that look and feel like 3.5 floppies these drives 
are scsi devices and can read and write both 720 kb and 1.44 21 mb 
disks .  . sounds to me to be one great product for the pc market. are the 
prices really that compared to cd roms which are currently 
not i know about the new cds and expect sony to 
develop the first mds for the computer. my question is why is n't there 
any substantial interest in developing the flopticals 

certainly in the uk the 21mb flopticals are about the same price as a 
cheap cd rom now  ( you seem to be able to get them for around gbp 
200  . however the bigger optical drives (e . g .  . 128mb ) are much more 
expensive around the gbp 1000 mark. 

a couple of questions that someone may be able to answer the 21mb 
flopticals are they direct drop in replacements for a floppy or do 
they need driver software etc. i.e. do you just rip out the floppy 
drive , plug the same cables into the floptical , stick in a disk 
and hey presto you have a 21mb floppy .  . this sounds far too easy. 

on the subject of sony developing mds for computers , i have reread a 
pcw article on this subject and there it says that sony have been doing 
optical drives for other people for some time and may be about to do a 
product themselves. from the article it seems that the audio md format 
is a byproduct of their computer storage work the md mechanism is 
identical to their mo computer optical drives .  . a sony spokesman was 
quoted as saying that a 2.5 md disk would hold about 100mb of data 
though he refused to comment on any possibility of this being 
 . 

the article said that one of the problems holding back development in 
this area was lack of sensible standards plus there are at least 2 
distinct optical storage mechanisms around at present. given that it 
probably needs mds being used as a distribution medium to get it 
into the market and since this has already been cornered by cds it 
probably needs someone to come in with a very strong lead 
to get mds accepted.

organization university of helsinki 
lines 52 

(paul bartholomew ) writes 

clip clip 

interesting. would you care to explain to me then , how my soundblaster 
pro card and my printer card are sharing irq 7 successfully i assure 
you that they are both set to irq 7 and that i have no problem. my 
computer is a dtk 286 12 ibm clone .  . 

running ms dos or a derivative os , obviously. please take note that the 
following is not what exactly happens , but a slightly simplified 
explanation. 

technically , the irq line is only a means for the device  ( printer 
adapter , soundblaster , modem , hard disk ,  .  .  . ) . to signal the cpu that 
something 's happening here , please take note. how the cpu is 
programmed to handle this signal is usually up to the operating system. 
in ms dos , the interrupt vector is used to store the address of the 
function that handles each interrupt .  . 

now , basic dos does n't care whether the printer reports that it 's ready 
to print some more stuff or not it simply ignores the interrupt .  . when 
dos prints , it looks at the lpt buffer .  . if there 's a character there , 
wait a while and check again. if there 's not , copy a new character to 
the lpt port. since the irq 7 is ignored as a printer interrupt , it 's 
free for use for any other adapters in this case , the sb .  . 

with any multitasking or otherwise advanced os , this kind of printing 
approach just does n't work  ( or more precisely , it wastes a lot of cpu 
cycles . ) . hence , you ca n't share the irq 7 with lpt1 and sb if you 're 
running unix or os 2 or whatnot .  . 

another issue with the sb is that only the digitized sound uses 
interrupts .  . when the sb plays plain music , the cpu simply tells it what 
to play until told otherwise. with digitized sound the interrupt is 
required to notify the cpu when the output ends and new data is 
needed. 

you can , however , hook two  ( or more) com ports to one interrupt , but use 
them only one at a time. this is because the interrupt handling routine 
is same for both ports , and it can see from which port the data came 
from. this , of course , applies for some other devices  ( like lpt ) as well. 

remember , this was greatly simplified in parts , but i think gives the 
general picture correctly enough.

hi , 

i bought , on the net here , a mini tower system. it works fine , but 
i have no docs on the motherboard .  . 

does anyone know who a manufacturer named wpi is that is the only marking 
on the board that is not related to a chip connector name. it says 
 ( c)1991 ) , wpi 

also , this board has a connector at the other end of the motherboard , it looks 
like this 




387 socket for 387 math coprocessor 

386 386 chip is about here 

j signs are the isa slots 
m 
p jumpers for turbo kb etc are where 
e marked 
r 
s signs are 8 banks of simm sockets 

these connectors are the mystery 
connectors ! ! ! ! 

what is this connector 

is this a place to plug an extra memory board in i 've seen mentioned 
in some motherboard docs .  . some allow an 8 meg card and 8 meg in simms .  . is 
this what it is for

i must say that i have been a customer of midwest micro for over 4 
years now , and have been well taken care of on each purchase. 
i have had many friends that have bought that same modem and  ( they ) 
do have some experience with setting up modems , so there have been 
no problems in 6 of them that i know of. the fact that your time 
to valuable for you to spend on the modem is where you went wrong. 
why you say because i must tell you of the 12 yes i say 12 modems 
that i have had in the past that i was trying to use on my bbs .  . they 
all were junk and were replace 3 times each , to ther point that 
i just said forget it and i wanted my money back. 's teck even 
said that they did n't even repair them. that they just strip the 
parts that are good and junk thr rest of the modem .  . 
i think it was more your fault than midwest 's  .  . sam . 

gosh .  . i . think i just installed a virus .  . it . was called ms dos6 .  .  .  .

discussing the use of irq 7 

in recent article (mike sprague ) writes 

i as a number of poeple in this thread have already written 
(i ca n't prove it 's true , but i believe it) , lpt1 does not 
actually use irq7 , even though that interrupt is supposed to 
be dedicated to lpt1 .  . 

to put it a little differently 

irq 7 is the de facto standard interrupt assigned to be used by the 
printer adapter to announce its completion of some activity. 

dos does n't monitor irq 7 it uses other means to determine when it 's 
time to send out another byte to the printer .  . 

most  ( all )  ( hardware ) printer adapters have the ability to disable 
the use of irq 7 , usually by merely breaking the connection between 
the isa pin and the associated driver. other adapters control the 
irq line by a tri state driver , and by programming just leave it 
in the high impedence mode. 

unfortunately , there are a lot of adapter cards which use 
drivers (i . e .  . , either assert high or assert low) for the irq lines 
rather than drivers  ( assert high , assert low , or do n't 
assert anything) .  . the presence of such a card on an irq line precludes 
the use of that irq by any other adapter unless it is physically 
disconnected by a jumper .  . 

 ( incidentally , note that there 's no requirement that a card hold 
the irq line low when no interrupt is desired .  . if that were true 
you would have to somehow tie down all unconnected irq lines , and 
that certainly is n't a requirement . ) . 

non dos operating systems  ( os 2 , nt ( ) , various unices or whatever the 
proper plural of unix might be) require the use of irq 7 for performance 
reasons. 

and the , alas , is one of the cards which uses drivers.

in article ,  ( wayne smith) writes 
in article (richard krehbiel ) writes 
can anyone explain in fairly simple terms why , if i get os 2 , i might 
need an scsi controler rather than an ide .  . will performance suffer that 
much for a 200mb or so drive if i do n't have a tape drive or cd rom 
any help would be appreciated. 

so , when you 've got multi tasking , you want to increase performance by 
increasing the amount of overlapping you do. 

one way is with dma or bus mastering .  . either of these make it 
possible for i o devices to move their data into and out of memory 
without interrupting the cpu .  . the alternative is for the cpu to move 
the data. there are several scsi interface cards that allow dma and 
bus mastering .  . 

how do you do bus mastering on the isa bus 

ide , however , is defined by the standard at interface 
created for the ibm pc at , which requires the cpu to move all the data 
bytes , with no dma .  . 

if we 're talking isa  ( at ) bus here , then you can only have 1 dma channel 
active at any one time , presumably transferring data from a single device. 
so even though you can have at least 7 devices on a scsi bus , explain how 
all 7 of those devices can to dma transfers through a single scsi card 
to the isa at bus at the same time. 

think ! 

it 's the scsi card doing the dma transfers not the disks .  .  .  . 

the scsi card can do dma transfers containing data from any of the scsi devices 
it is attached when it wants to. 

an important feature of scsi is the ability to a device. this frees the 
scsi bus for other devices. this is typically used in a multi tasking os to 
start transfers on several devices. while each device is seeking the data the 
bus is free for other commands and data transfers .  . when the devices are 
ready to transfer the data they can aquire the bus and send the data. 

on an ide bus when you start a transfer the bus is busy until the disk has 
the data and transfered it. this is typically a 10 second lock out for other 
processes wanting the bus irrespective of transfer time. 


also , i'm still trying to track down a copy of ibm 's at reference book , 
but from their pc technical manual  ( page 2 93) 

the  ( fdd ) adapter is buffered on the i . o . bus and uses the system board 
direct memory access  ( dma ) for record data transfers .  . 
i expect to see something similar for the pc at hdd adapter .  . 
so the lowly low density original pc fdd card used dma and the pc at 
hdd controller does n't ! ! that makes real sense.

universal arithmetic receiver transmitter .  . normally , the older boards have 
a 8250 or 16450 uart on board. those chips generate an irq for every char 
they received. the 16550 uart has an internal 16 byte buffer , so with the 
right software installed it generates an irq every 16 chars .  . 

close. universal asynchronous receiver transmitter .  . 

3) is it necessary for 14 . 4k . or higher throughput 

if you ran dos , you do n't need a 16550 , because dos runs only one task at a 
time and the whole cpu power could be used for the transfer .  . 

even if you are running dos , if your cpu ca n't handle the speed of the 
interrupts , you will still lose characters. i have one 286 10 machine with 
an external 9600 bps modem attached and ca n't drive the serial port any faster 
than 19 . 2k . without losing characters.

ide also uses dma techniques. i believe floppy controller also uses dma , 
and most a d boards also use dma .  . dma is no big deal , and has nothing to 
do directly with scsi .  . 

no. the simple 25 style ide controller does not use dma .  . the cpu performs 
the data transfer with a string move instruction .  . this requires that the 
cpu stop what it had been doing and transfer the data. only the smart drive 
controllers , be they ide or scsi , can transfer via dma .  . these controllers 
tend to cost the same wether they are ide or scsi .  . to get the dma benefits , 
ide must sacrifice it 's price advantage on the controller . 

for example , when rewinding or formatting a tape , the command is 
issued to the controller and the bus is released to allow access to other 
devices on the bus. this greatly increases productivity or , at least , do 
something else while backing up your hard drive ) .  . which happens to be 
what i am doing while reading this group. 

you can thank your software for that. if dos had a few more brains , it 
could format floppies etc. while you were doing something else. the 
hardware will support it , but dos (at least) wo n't .  . again , this has 
nothing to do with scsi .  . 

floppies are n't on the ide bus , your arguement makes no sense , this is n't 
an ide issue. the have their own processor on their controller 
board which handles all of these commands .  . 

the difference between ide and scsi is that all scsi are 
intelligent .  . they each have their own controller .  . they depend on the 
cpu to do fewer things for them , i.e. ide drives needing a processor 
to transfer their data. 

its a long story , but i still use ide on my 486 except for the cdrom which , 
thanks to scsi , i can move between both machines. if , and when , scsi is 
better standardized and supported on the ibm clone machines , i plan to 
completely get rid of ide .  . 

and if you stick with dos you 'll wonder why you ca n't multitask .  . 

again i ask why ca n't a unix or os 2 type os do all the miraculous things 
with an ide harddrive that it can with a  ( single ) scsi hard drive. 

the callback mechanism the cpu to make requests of the 
devices on the scsi bus and then and go about its business. 
later , when the device is done , it issues a callback to say that the 
data has arrived or the function has completed. most scsi cards will 
also dma the data into memory without the interupting the cpu , therefore 
allowing it to continue working  . ide supports no such concept 
as callback .  . 

can you see how this would be a win in any multitasking system

i ran out of time on my last reply to this string and i do n't 
know if it was sent or not but .  . i have never heard of anyone that 
had to return something in the 30 grace that had a problem 
at all with midwest micro .  . they may of thought that you did n't 
know what you were doing and suggested how to correct the problem. 
but it sounded as you did n't give them much of a chance to correct 
things at all. the fact that the worked okay for you is because 
it is setup more for the no nothing user that ca n't understand the 
instruction and the commands to configure it to his her system. 
when you find out things like the fact the the ec led that looks like 
you have connected to another ec modem , does n't realy say that. 
but that it only tells you that you have ec turned on , on your modem .  . 
i think that these led are nothing more that just light to hype up 
the product. just like i bet someone took home a few extra 
in the last year for giving the modems the pc magazine award 
of the year. not so for the stash (12) of them that i saw on my test 
bench .  . i could go on for hours at no end as to all of the problems 
that i found with the modems but i will try to control myself. 
i will not even go into the 6 weeks it took to credit my card 
back for the modems after they had received them back .  .  . no . i will 
not go into that one nor will i go into talking to the parent co.

anyway , the problem is that in this mode , the horizontal total register

is set to , so 0x27 is nonsense. a resonable value would be so is 
there a high bit , and if so , where is it 
also , how does one set the video dot clock to the appropriate frequency ( and 
what would be an appropriate frequency ) .  . the documentation is n't really very

my card is a 1024 1mb card. seems to have a tseng labs bios (ver 8 . 05 . i
