people who would otherwise sympathize with their cause only shake their 
heads in disbelief at such childish ranting .  .

hi , 

i have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with 
a theist acquaintance .  . he stated that thousands of bibles were discovered 
at a certain point in time which were syllable perfect. this therefore 
meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted 
by my was approximately 50 years after the death of jesus .  . 

you can tell your friend from me that i was in a publisher 's 
warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of the joy of 
cooking and every one of them was syllable perfect. 

i have since sold all i own and become a follower of the joy 
of cooking .  . the incident i mentioned convinced me , once and 
for all , that the joy of cooking is inspired by god and the 
one true path to his glory.

which killings do you say are religously motivated 

for example , i would claim that the recent assassination of four

what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n . i .

i 'd say it was motivated by a primitive notion of revenge , and by

catholics are not killed by mainland protestants , and southern 
catholics are not killed by southern protestants , and so on. take away 
all plausible causes bar religion , and the violence diminishes markedly .  . 
gee , why is that 

now , it 's possible to argue that 
religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in 
the present , but i do n't know of any evidence that this is so and i'm 
not enough of a historian to debate it. 

given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland 
into a country that has a particular church written into its 
constitution , and which has restriction on civil rights dictated 
by that church , i fail to see why the word past is appropriate. 

the country also has a different official language written in its 
constitution  ( and vice versa ) maybe they 're motivated by a love of 
irish poetry .  . your argument is fallacious , jon .  . 

for what it 's worth , i agree with all that you say about ireland above ,

i recall a discussion i had heard years ago. it went something like this 
the problem with omnipotence (at least as i perceive it) as personified by 
the christian god ideal is that it is potentially contradictory .  . if a 
manifestation such as god is truly infinite in power can god place limits 
upon itself

some stuff i ca n't recall .  . 
then some other questions i think i recall correctly 
can god itself 
can god make itself  ( assuming it does n't yet exist) 
has god has always existed or is it necessary for an observer to bind all of 
gods potential quantum states into reality 
was god nothing more than a primordial force of nature that existed during 
the earliest stages of universal  ( inflationary ) creation 
is god a vacuum fluctuation 
given a great enough energy density could we re create god 
would that make us god and god something else 
.

some more stuff i do n't recall concerning creating god. followed by 
is god self aware

is it that god be a living entity

belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism .  . 

correlation is not  . and a belief that absolutes exist is not 
the same thing as a belief in absolutes , any more than belief in a shortest 
route from to is the same thing as a knowledge of the 
irish  . 

correlation is not necessarily  . however , as you might have noticed , 
the above allows to conclude that the correlation between religion and fanatism 
is based on common features of religious belief .  . 

(sorry for the long quotes , but i dont see where to cut ) 


huh are you barking mad 


hardly .  . 


(1) theism is not as strongly correlated with fanaticism as you say. plus 
you could find stronger correlations if you were actually interested 
in the truth instead of being as you seeming are , a bigot .  . 


theism is correlated with fanaticism .  . i have neither said that all fanatism 
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism .  . the point is , 
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic .  . one could of course 
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism  ( for example) , but i just 
have to at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology 
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it. 

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your 
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered .  . , 
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more 
reliable indicators .  . and the really dangerous people the sources of 
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical 
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing. now , some 
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism , 
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned 
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction 
of religious freedom .  . ever read animal farm 

(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that 
reason is always useful 


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has 
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate .  . one point is that 
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does 
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information. 

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful 
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would 
be irrational .  . which is it 

the first part of the second statement contains no information , because 
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism 
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the 
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an 
datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is 
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is 
used to obtain it. 

compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of 
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but  . 

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism to 
say that all theism is necessarily requires a proof which 
i suspect you do not have. 

the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe 
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis .  . however , the beliefs say they are 
more than a work hypothesis .  . 

i do n't understand this. can you your argument

just for the record ( not that any kind of information would be 
likely to affect your thinking ) i have an focus in 
from penn. 

a photo of the smallest logo in the world does not an atom make. 
what was observed is something we can measure that matches what 
the mathematical model we call an atom had predicted .  . 

much in the same way that we need both a particle model and a 
wave model for light , the atomic model is a mathematical 
representation of physical phenomena .  . a model that can and 
probably will continue to change over time. that makes it 
subjective (the model that is) .  . however , the model gives us an 
objective way to talk about the physical world. 

to put it another way , the quantum mechanical model of the atom 
allows for discussion of the atom that will give repeatable and 
unambiguous results , which is objective .  . however , as bohr and 
einstein it out mid century , the interpretation of 
those , observable measurements is quite subjective .  . 
bohr said that the observable randomness of atomic motion was 
inherent in the nature of the universe. einstein said particle 
motion was deterministic , but it was our measurement shortcomings 
that introduced the randomness .  . they were talking about the 
exact same results , though.

andy 

i do n't accept atoms or gravity as fact either. they are extremely useful 
mathematical models to describe physical observations we can make. 
other posters have aptly explained the atomic model. gravity , too , is 
very much a theory no gravity waves have even been detected , but we 
have a very useful model that describes much of the behavior on 
objects by this thing we call gravity .  . gravity , however , is not 
a fact. it is a theoretical model used to talk about how objects 
behave in our physical environment. newton thought gravity was a 
simple vector force einstein a wave .  . both are very useful models that 
have no religious overtones or requirements of faith , unless of course you 
want to demand that it is a factual physical entity described exactly 
the way the theory now formulated talks about it. that takes a great 
leap of faith , which , of course , is what religion takes .  . evolution 
is no different.

sense of memories , feelings , perceptions ) i'm trying to think of 
anything that would be a fact for you. give some examples , and let 's 
see how factual they are by your criteria  ( btw , what are your 
criteria ) .  . 

gravity is not a fact is that a fact how about newton 's 
and einstein 's thoughts about gravity is it a fact that they had 
those thoughts i do n't see how any of the things that you are 
asserting are any more factual than things like gravity , atoms or 
evolution .  . 

in short , before i am willing to consider your concept of what

simple logic arguments are folly .  . if you read the bible you will see

our ability to reason is just a spec of creation. yet some think it is

overview 

welcome to alt.atheism and alt . atheism . moderated .  . 

this is the first in a series of regular postings aimed at new readers of the 
newsgroups .  . 

many groups of a  controversial  nature have noticed that new readers often 
come up with the same questions , mis statements or misconceptions and post 
them to the net. in addition , people often request information which has 
been posted time and time again. in order to try and cut down on this , the 
alt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following 
titles 

1. alt.atheism faq overview for new readers 
2. alt.atheism faq introduction to atheism 
3. alt.atheism faq frequently asked questions  ( faq ) 
4. alt.atheism faq constructing a logical argument 
5. alt.atheism faq atheist resources 

this is article number 1. please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting. the 
others are entirely optional .  . 

if you are new to usenet , you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup 
news . announce . newusers .  . the articles titled a primer on how to work with 
the usenet community , answers to frequently asked questions about usenet 
and hints on writing style for usenet are particularly relevant .  . questions 
concerning how news works are best asked in news . newusers . questions .  . 

if you are unable to find any of the articles listed above , see the finding 
stuff section below.

these articles are free. truly free. you may copy them and distribute them 
to anyone you wish. however , please send any changes or corrections to the 
author , and please do not re post copies of the articles to alt.atheism it 
does nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating 
around the network. 


finding stuff 

all of the faq files should be somewhere on your news system. here are 
some suggestions on what to do if you ca n't find them 

1. check the newsgroup alt . atheism .  . look for subject lines starting with 
alt.atheism faq . 

2. check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines. 

if you do n't find anything in steps 1 or 2 , your news system is n't set up 
correctly , and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the 
problem. 

3. if you have anonymous ftp access , connect to rtfm.mit.edu 18 . 70 . 0 . 226 . . 
go to the directory pub usenet alt.atheism , and you 'll find the latest 
versions of the faq files there. 

ftp is a a way of copying files between networked computers. if you 
need help in using or getting started with ftp , send e mail to 
mail with 

send usenet news.answers ftp list faq 

in the body. 

4. there are other sites which also carry news.answers postings .  . the article 
introduction to the news.answers newsgroup carries a list of these 
sites the article is posted regularly to news . answers .  . 

5. if you do n't have ftp , send mail to mail 
consisting of the following lines 

send usenet news.answers finding sources 
send usenet alt.atheism faq 
send usenet alt.atheism introduction 
send usenet alt.atheism logic 
send usenet alt.atheism resources 

5.  ( penultimate resort ) send mail to mail consisting of 
the following lines 

send atheism faq faq . txt . 
send atheism faq logic . txt . 
send atheism faq intro . txt . 
send atheism faq resource . txt . 

and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files. 
there 's other stuff , too interesting commands to try are help and 
send atheism index . 

6.  ( last resort ) mail , or post an article to the 
newsgroup asking how you can get the faq files. you should only do this 
if you 've tried the above methods and they 've failed it 's not nice to 
clutter the newsgroup or people 's mailboxes with requests for files. 
it 's better than posting without reading the faq , though ! for instance , 
people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who do n't have 
ftp will probably need assistance obtaining the faq files.

i think you 're letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of

how does that qualify 
indeed , it 's almost oxymoronic .  .  . a . rather amusing instance .  . 
i 've found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as 
accepted uncritically , especially the few that are legend .  . 
many are trying to explain basic truths , as myths do , but 
they do n't meet the other criterions .  . 

andrew , 

the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have 
created to make religion appear absurd .  . rather than approach religion 
 ( including christainity ) in a rational manner and debating its claims 
as the are stated , atheists concoct outrageous and then 
hold the religious accountable for beliefs they do n't have. what is 
more accurately is the a term like , reasonable atheist .  . 

bill 

divine justice. according to the most fundamental doctrines of 
christianity , when the first man sinned , he was at that time the 

you accuse him of referencing mythology , then you procede to 
launch your own xtian mythology .  .  ( this time meeting all the 
requirements of myth . ) . 

here 's a good example of of what i said above. read the post again , i 
said , to ... , which means i am referring to christian 
doctrine  ( as i understand it) , if i am speaking for myself you 'll know 
it. my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of 
doctrines since it seemed germane .  . 

bill 

with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it 
means. when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and 
do n't know what he wants , they contradict the bible which clearly says 
that everyone knows. the authority of the bible is its claim to be 

 .  .  . should . i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting 
it across you may trust the bible , but your trusting it does n't 
make it any more credible to me. 
if the bible says that everyone knows , that 's clearly reason 
to doubt the bible , because not everyone knows your alleged 
god 's alleged existance .  . 

again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this 
point , your dispute is not with me ... 

bill 

refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified .  . those that 
claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is 
unknown , must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is 
no excuse. 

1) no , they do n't have to ignore the bible .  . the bible is far 
from universally accepted. the bible is not a proof of god 
it is only a proof that some people have thought that there 
was a god.  ( or does it prove even that they might have been 
writing it as series of fiction short stories. as in the 
case of dionetics . ) . assuming the writers believed it , the 
only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it. 
and that 's ignoring the problem of whether or not all the 
interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct. 

2) there are people who have truly never heard of the bible .  . 

3) again , read the faq .  . 

1) here again you miss the point. the bible itself is not the point , 
it 's what it contains .  . it makes no difference who the bible or 
even who 's unaware of its existence , christians hold that it applies 
universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate 
and the same innate knowledge of god. 

2) see above 

3) if you read my post with same care as read the faq , we would n't be 
having this conversation. 

bill 

freedom .  . you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to 
ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known 
in both cases. that an atheist ca n't accept the evidence means only 

bzzt .  .  . wrong . answer ! 
gravity is directly there. it does n't stop exerting a direct and 
rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it. god , on the 
other hand , does n't generally show up in the supermarket , except 
on the tabloids .  . god does n't exert a rationally undeniable influence .  . 
gravity is obvious gods are n't .  . 

as i said , the evidence is there , you just do n't accept it , here at 
least we agree. 

bill 

secondly , human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god , so 
much so that it is , in itself , intrinsic to our nature. human reason 
always comes back to the question of god , in every generation and in 

no , human reason has n't always come back to the existance of 
god it has usually come back to the existance of god . 
in other words , it does n't generally come back to the xtian 
god , it comes back to whether there is any god. and , in much 
of oriental philosophic history , it generally does n't pop up as 
the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces 
are and which ones are out there. from a world wide view , 
human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to 
be and or what  ( force(s ) are currently in control. a natural 
tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful 
thinking. 

yes , human reason does always come back to the existence of god , we 're 
having this discussion are we not 

bill 

i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently 
reasonable , that divine justice is just and human nature is much 
different than what atheists think it is. whether you agree or not 

you certainly are not correct on human nature. you are , at 
the least , basing your views on a completely eurocentric 
approach. try looking at the outside world as well when 
you attempt to sum up all of humanity .  . 

well this is interesting , truth is to be determined by it politically 
correct content. granted it 's extremely to be a wasp male , and 
anything european is , but i thought this kind of 
dialogue , the purpose of a.a , was to get at the truth of things. but 
then i remember the oxymoron , atheist , and i understand.

in article (david nye ) writes 
reply to  ( frank o'dwyer ) 

the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral 
truths and the method by which they can be established .  . if we accept 
that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to 
what ought to be  ( see naturalistic fallacy ) then they cannot be proved 
by any facts about the nature of the world. 

this can be avoided in at least two ways (1) by leaving the good 
undefined , since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is 
either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a 
reply. 

if the good is undefined  ( undefinable ) but you require of everyone that 
they know innately what is right , you are back to  . 

no , and begging the question. see below. 

(2) by defining the good solely in terms of terms. 

ditto here. an statement implies a value judgement on the 
part of the person making it. 

again , incorrect , and question begging .  . see below. 

at this point the objectivist may talk of  self evident truths  

pretty perceptive , that prof. flew .  . 

but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self evidence is in the 
mind of the beholder 

of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy .  . 

please explain how this helps. i do n't see your argument. 

i do n't see yours. it seems to rest on the assertion that everything 
is either a subject or an object. there 's nothing compelling about that 
dichotomy .  . i might just as well divide the world into subject , object , 
event. it even seems more sensible .  . , for example , is 
an event , not a subject or an object. 

furthermore , if subject object were true dichotomy , i.e. 

everything is either a subject or an object 

then , is that statement a self evident truth or not if so , then it 's 
all in the mind of the beholder , according to the relativist , and hardly 
compelling .  . add to that the fact that the world can quickly be shoved 
in its entirety into the subjective category by an idealist or 
argument , and that we have this perfectly good alternate 
set of categories  ( subject , object , event ) which can be reduced 
to  ( subject , object , quality) without any logical difficulty and why 
yes , i guess i am denying that self evident truths are all in the mind of 
the beholder .  . 

if not , what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true 

all of it. 

if nothing , then no moral judgements are true. this is a thing that 
is commonly referred to as  . it entails that science is of 
no value , of the fact that some people find it useful. how 
anyone arrives at relativism from this argument beats me. 

this makes no sense either. flew is arguing that this is where the 
objectivist winds up , not the subjectivist .  . furthermore , the nihilists 
believed in nothing except science , materialism , revolution , and the 
people. 

i'm referring to ethical 

the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are 
some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself. 
to hold a moral opinion is , he suggests , not to know something to be 
true but to have preferences regarding human activity. 

and if those preferences should include terrorism , that moral opinion 
is not true. likewise , if the preferences should include , 
that moral opinion is not true. why should one choose a set of 
preferences which include over one which includes 
oh , no reason. this is patently absurd .  .  .  .  . 

and also not the position of the subjectivist , as has been pointed out 
to you already by others. ditch the strawman , already , and see my reply 
to mike cobb 's root message in the thread societal basis for morality .  . 

i 've responded over there. btw i do n't intend this as a strawman , but 
as something logically by relativism  ( really any ethical system 
where values are assumed to be  . it 's different to say relativists 
say .  .  .  . than relativism implies .  .  .  . .

merely a question for the basis of morality 

moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior . 

i disagree with these. what society thinks should be irrelevant .  . what the 
individual decides is all that is important. 

this does n't seem right. if i want to kill you , i can because that is what i 
decide 

exactly. although this may be a answer , there has to be an 
interplay of the two. personal ethos and societal morality .  . a person 's 
self generated learned set of beliefs are usually expressed on a purely 
mental verbal level , and do n't usually find expression in society except in an 
impure (not in the sense of bad ) ) state. sometimes this has to be so. 


1)who ) is society 

i think this is fairly obvious 

not really. if whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok , there are 
always some in the society who disagree with the mandates , so which 
societal mandates make the standard for morality 

also , what if one feels oneself to be part of more than one society , in a very 
real sense to use the obvious example , there is a political society , and a 
racial society , and a gender society , and sometimes they do not always agree on 
every issue .  .  .  . 


2)how ) do they define what is acceptable 

generally by what they feel is right , which is the most idiotic policy i can 
think of. 

so what should be the basis unfortunately i have to admit to being tied at 
least loosely to the feeling , in that i think we intuitively know some things 
to be wrong. awfully hard to defend , though. 


yes. perhaps with an infamous do what you want so long as it does n't hurt 
others the problem with this is that it is merely saying what you can do it 
is not a morality in that it does n't any specifically preferred 
behaviours .  . 


3)how ) do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position 

by thinking for ourselves. 

i might agree here. just because certain actions are legal does not make them 
moral . 

i 'll add a hearty me two . however , one could just as well say just because 
certain actions are moral does not make them legal one still does n't really 
get an impression of which one is truly right .

i agree , but this started at one particular point in time , and we 
do n't know when this starting point of  accurately copied scriptures  
actually happened. 

this begs the question of whether it ever started perhaps because 
accuracy was always an intention .  . 

even worse , if the events in nt were not written by eye witness accounts (a 
high probability looking at possible dates when the first gospels were 
ready) then we have to take into account all the problems with information 
forwarded with the  telephone metaphor  , indeed. 

it makes little difference if you have eyewitnesses or people one step away 
 ( reporters , if you will) .  . as i said earlier , the telephone metaphor is 
innately bad , because the purpose of a game of telephone is contrary to the 
aims of writing these sorts of texts .  .  ( also , i would point out that , by the 
standards generally asserted in this group , the distinction between 
eyewitnesses and others is hollow , since nobody can be shown to be an 
eyewitness , or indeed , even shown to be the author of the text . ) . 

there is no evidence that the original texts of either the ot or the nt 
are largely lost over time in a sea of errors , corrections , additions and 
deletions .  . in the case of the nt , the evidence is strongly in the other 
direction the r. and the text do not differ on more 
than a low level of significance .  . it is reasonable to assume a similar 
situation for the ot , based on the nt as a model.

if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that what

mandated morality pardon the extremism , but could n't i murder your 
brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was 
doing what felt good , did n't want anyone forcing their morality on me , 
or i do n't follow your morality 

i believe that morality is subjective .  . each person is entitled to his 
own moral attitudes .  . mine are not a priori more correct than someone 
elses .  . this does not mean however that i must judge another on the 
basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to 
believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is 
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is 
offensive to the majority .  . 

why your last statement. why by which authority 

most criminals do not see their behavior as moral .  . the may realize that 
it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral 
system but being immoral .  . for someone to lay claim to an alternative 
moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be 
internally consistent .  . 

why your last statement. why are these things necessary 

and believe me , a belief in terrorism can be both sincere and frighteningly 
consistent .  . 

some lack an innate moral sense and 
thus may be incapable of behaving morally .  . while someone like hitler 
may have believed that his actions were moral , we may judge him immoral 
by our standards. holding that morality is subjective does not mean 
that we must excuse the murderer .  . 

trouble is , this would sound just fine coming from someone like hitler , too. 
(i do not mean any comparison or offence , david . ) . try substituting 
the social minority of your choice for  sociopath  ,  hitler  , and

jim halat 

this deserves framing .  . it really does. atoms are n't even real. 

tell me then , those atoms we have seen with electron microscopes are 
atoms now , so what are they figments of our imaginations the 
evidence that atoms are real is overwhelming , but i wo n't bother with 
most evidence at the moment. 

you would have us believe that what the eye perceives as images are 
actaully there as perceived this may be interesting. i thought 
that an electron microscope was used because no wavelength of light 
can illuminate any object of atomic scale. if this image is to have 
useful resolution , would n't the illuminating sources wavelength have 
to be several orders of magnitude less than size of thing observed 

if an atom is a probablity cloud , lower resolutions would give the 
appearance of solidity , but it seems fairly certain that an atom is 
not an object is any conventional sense. obviously i am not a 
physicist , but the question does have of a philosophic 
nature. anyway , just a stray thought , carry on ...

here 's a suggestion for the logical argument faq .  . i do n't think it 's covered , 
though the fallacy probably has a better name than the one i used how about 
it , mathew 

inconsistency and counterexample 

this occurs when one party points out that some source of information takes 
stand a , which is inconsistent with b. there are two variations in which b is 
either a mutually agreed on premise or else a stand elsewhere from the same 
source. the second party fallaciously responds by saying see , the source 
really does say b , it 's right here ! this reply does not refute the allegation 
of inconsistency because it does not show that the source only says b. 

example of the first type the koran says unbelievers should be treated in 
these ways. we can both agree these are immoral .  . the koran clearly says in 
this other passage that unbelievers are not to be treated that way. 

example of the second type there are two biblical creation stories. you 're 
wrong , since the bible clearly describes the creation as description .

reply to  ( frank o'dwyer ) 

the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral 
truths and the method by which they can be established .  . if we accept 
that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to 
what ought to be  ( see naturalistic fallacy ) then they cannot be proved 
by any facts about the nature of the world. 

this can be avoided in at least two ways (1) by leaving the good 
undefined , since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is 
either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a 
reply. 

if the good is undefined  ( undefinable ) but you require of everyone that 
they know innately what is right , you are back to  . 

(2) by defining the good solely in terms of terms. 

ditto here. an statement implies a value judgement on the 
part of the person making it. 

at this point the objectivist may talk of  self evident truths  

pretty perceptive , that prof. flew .  . 

but can he deny the subjectivist 's claim that self evidence is in the 
mind of the beholder 

of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy .  . 

please explain how this helps. i do n't see your argument. 

if not , what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true 

if nothing , then no moral judgements are true. this is a thing that 
is commonly referred to as  . it entails that science is of 
no value , of the fact that some people find it useful. how 
anyone arrives at relativism from this argument beats me. 

this makes no sense either. flew is arguing that this is where the 
objectivist winds up , not the subjectivist .  . furthermore , the nihilists 
believed in nothing except science , materialism , revolution , and the 
people. 

the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are 
some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself. 
to hold a moral opinion is , he suggests , not to know something to be 
true but to have preferences regarding human activity. 

and if those preferences should include terrorism , that moral opinion 
is not true. likewise , if the preferences should include , 
that moral opinion is not true. why should one choose a set of 
preferences which include over one which includes 
oh , no reason. this is patently absurd .  .  .  .  .

i do n't necessarily disagree with your assertion , but i disagree with 
your reasoning .  .  ( faith bad. dogma bad. religion  ( faith  . 
religion  ( bad  . religion bad . ) . unfortunately , you never 
state why faith and dogma are dangerous. 

faith and dogma are dangerous because they cause people to act on 
faith alone , which by its nature is without justification .  . that 
is what i mean by the word ``faith'' belief without justification , or 
belief with arbitrary justification , or with emotional  ( irrational ) 
justification .  . 

for example , when someone says that god exists , that they do n't know 
why they believe god exists , they can just feel it , that 's faith. 

dogma is bad because it precludes positive change in belief based 
on new information , or increased mental faculty .  . 

so christians are totally irrational irrational with respect to their 
religion only what are you saying one 's belief in a christian god does 
not make one totally irrational .  . i think i know what you were getting at , 
but i 'd rather hear you expand on the subject. 

faith and dogma are irrational .  . the faith and dogma part of any religion 
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals .  . i claim that 
faith and dogma are the part of any religion. if that 
makes (the much overused in this context) buddism a philosophy rather 
than a religion , i can live with that. science is not a religion , 
because there is no faith nor dogma .  . 

a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind , 
whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and dogma present 
in any religion. 

again , this statement is too general. a christian is perfectly capable of 
being a philosopher , and absolutely capable of changing his her mind. faith in 
god is a belief , and all beliefs may change. would you assert that atheists 
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a 
god which , of course , may show unfair bias when studying , say , religion 

have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists if a philosopher 
is not an atheist , s he tends to be called a theologian .  . 

a christian tends to consider christianity sacred .  . christianity is 
a special set of beliefs , sanctioned by god himself , and therefore , 
to conceive of changing those beliefs is to question the existence 
of that being who makes no mistakes. faith comes into play. dogma 
comes into play. lord works in mysterious ways   is an example 
of faith being used to reconcile evidence that the beliefs are flawed .  . 
sure , interpretations of what said   are changed to satisfy the 
needs of society , but when god says something , that 's it. it was said , 
and that 's that. since god said it , it is , even if the 
interpretations are flawed .  . 

science ,  ( as would be practiced by atheists ) in contrast , has a 
built in defence against faith and dogma .  . 
a scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to 
suit whatever is the best information available at the time , and , 
and , and , a scientist understands that any current beliefs 
are deficient in some way. the goal is to keep improving 
the beliefs .  . the goal is to keep changing the beliefs to reflect 
the best information currently available. that 's the only rational 
thing to do. that 's good philosophy .  . 

can you see the difference science views beliefs as being flawed , 
and new information can be obtained to improve them.  ( how many 
scientists would claim to have complete and perfect understanding 
of everything none it would put them out of a job ! ) religion 
views its beliefs as being perfect , and the interpretations of 
those beliefs must be changed as new information is acquired which 
conflicts with them. 

please explain how just because thinking kills people.  ( and please 
state more in your answer than waco .  . ) 

it 's easier for someone to kill a person when s he does n't require 
a good rational justification of the killing .  . i do n't consider 
's jewish   , or was born of jewish parents   , or 
document says he 's jewish   to be good rational justification .  . 

by the way , i was n't aware mass suicide 
was a problem. waco and jonestown were isolated incidents .  . 
mass suicides are far from common.

the same way that any theory is proven false .  . you examine the 
predicitions 
that the theory makes , and try to observe them. if you do n't , or 
if you 
observe things that the theory predicts would n't happen , then you 
have some 
evidence against the theory. if the theory ca n't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations , then you say that it is false .  . 

but how does one handle the of the experiment in 
many types of 
experiments the prediction is that the observed phenomena will 
happen again 
and be capable of being observed .  . for example , in chemistry someone 
may predict 
the outcome of a chemical reaction and then actually observe that 
reaction 
repeatedly .  . 

there are several problems here. first , you are discussing only 
experimental procedures .  . observational procedures are also useful. the 
main criterion is attempting to verify an idea by using it to make 
prediction about as yet observations .  . the observations could be 
the result of an experiment , or they could be of activity 
occuring in nature , or they could even be observations of 
the lasting results of events long past. all that matters is that the 
observations be new . this is what prediction is about in science 
it is 
not about predicting the future except in this very restricted 
sense. 

secondly , can also take many forms. it is really just 
the 
requirement that independent observers be able to verify the results. 
the 
observation of a fossil is  repeatable  , since any qualified observer 
may 
look at it  ( this is why the specimens are in a  . also , 
there is the implicit prediction that future fossil finds will 
correspond 
to the current one. new fossils are found often enough that this is 
tested regularly. many times a new fossil actually some 
conclusion made on the basis of previous fossils .  . 

unfortunately for you , the models that were falsified have alway been 
peripheral to the model of evolution we now have.  ( for instance , the 
front legs of rex turned out to have tremendous muscles , 
rather than being weakly endowed as previously  . 

so , in fact , science findings are repeatable in the 
necessary sense. just becuase you cannot go out and repeat the 
original 
event does not make it impossible to make valid observations .  . 

this is not to say that biologists would not go if extra 
terrestrial life were discovered that could make the determination 
of the process of abiogenesis relatively easy .

have to at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology 
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it. 

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your

the point is that theism is a factor. 


, 
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more 
reliable indicators .  . and the really dangerous people the sources of 
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical 
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing. 

that 's a claim you have to support. please note that especially in the 
field of theism , the leaders believe what they say. 


now , some 
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism , 
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned 
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction 
of religious freedom .  . ever read animal farm 


that 's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to 
repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to 
fanatism , and not all fanatism is caused by theism .  . the point is , 
there is a correlation , and it comes from innate features of theism .  .

and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw

(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that 
reason is always useful 


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has 
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate .  . one point is that 
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does 
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information. 

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful 
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would 
be irrational .  . which is it 


that 's bogus .  . self reference is not circular .  . and since the evaluation of 
usefulness is possible within rational systems , it is allowed. 

your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics 
and mathematics are therfore circular .  . 


the first part of the second statement contains no information , because 
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism 
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the 
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an 
datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is 
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is 
used to obtain it. 


i 've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions 
of god here. 

an datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here 
is a an often refuted fallacy .  . have a look at the discussion of the 
axiom of choice. and further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems 
out of which they are usually derived .  . i exist is derived , if you want 
it that way. 

further , one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms .  . 

what is it you are trying to say 


compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of 
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but  . 

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism to 
say that all theism is necessarily requires a proof which 
i suspect you do not have. 


using the traditonal definition of gods .  . personal , supernatural entities 
with objective effects on this world. usually connected to morals and or 
the way the world works. 


the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe 
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis .  . however , the beliefs say they are 
more than a work hypothesis .  . 

i do n't understand this. can you your argument 

person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice. that does not make 
b true , it is at best a work hypothesis .  . however , the content of b is that 
it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis .  . testing or evaluating 
evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b  ( already believed ) 
says it is wrong a waste of time not possible. depending on the further 
contents of b idolaters protestants are to be killed , this can

let us go back , oh say 1000 years or so , whatever. pretend someone says to you 
someday there will be men on the moon.  ( now remember , you still think the 
world is  . this is quite an extraordinary claim .  . 

i think c.s. lewis has argued that medieval people did not all think the 
world is flat. 

however , this argument goes both ways. pretend someone telling plato that 
it is highly probable that people do not really have souls their minds 
and their consciousness are just something their brains make up , and 
their brains  ( their body) is actually ahead of their mind even in 
actions .  . i do n't think plato would have been happy with this , 
and neither would paul , although paul 's ideas were quite different. 
however , if you would read what we discuss in this group , and not 
just preach , you would see that there currently is much evidence in 
favour of these statements .  . 

the same applies to the theory of natural selection , or other sacred 
cows of christianity on our origins and human nature. i do n't believe 
in spirits , devils or immortal souls any more than in gods .  . 

the fact is we can argue the existence of god until the end of time , there really is no 
way to either prove or disprove it , but there will be a time when we all know the truth. 
i hope and believe i'm right and i hope and pray that you find your way too. 

ah , you said it. you believe what you want to. this is what i had assumed 
all along. 

ok maybe i should n't have said no way . i guess i really believe there is 
a way. but all i can do is plant seeds .  . either they grow or they do n't .  . 

you might be as well planting satan 's seeds , ever thought of this 
besides , you have n't yet explained why we must believe so blindly , 
without any guiding light at all (at least i have n't noticed it) .  . 
i do n't think this is at all fair play on god 's part. 

your argument sounds like a version of pascal 's wager .  . please read the 
faq , this fallacy is discussed there. 

but 
they wo n't if they 're not planted .  . the holy spirit is the that 
helps them grow and that comes from god. 

and i failed to get help from the hs because i had a wrong attitude 
sorry , dan , but i do not think this spirit exists. people who claim to have 
access to it just look badly deluded , not gifted .  .

 ( deletion ) 
 ( god is) the one who created the night , the day , the sun and the moon. 
each is travelling in an orbit with its own motion.  ( qur'an 33 ) 

the positive aspect of this verse noted by dr. maurice is that 
while geocentrism was the commonly accepted notion at the time  ( and for 
a long time afterwards ) , there is no notion of geocentrism in this verse 
 ( or anywhere in the qur'an) .  . 


well , that is certainly different , but it looks as if there is a translation 
found for everything. by the way , i am most surprised to hear that night and 
day move in an orbit .  . 

and that the sun travels in an orbit without saying that earth does , too , 
sounds geocentric to me.

in article  ( gregg jaeger ) writes 
yes. the qur'an discusses this point in several ways , some of 
them quite directly .  . for example , it says that if god were 
to appear them there would be no need for faith and belief as 
the evidence would be definitive .  . 

ah ! excellent. so why does n't she appear to me i'm a little weak in the 
blind faith department.  ( besides , she does n't even really need to appear 
how about , oh say , a little tip something like put your all on 3 in the 
7 30 at the dog races ... perhaps in a dream or vision . ) . 

how do we know that 
muhammed did n't just go out into the desert and smoke something 

would a person who was high write so well and with such consistency 

i'm afraid i do n't know arabic i have only read translations .  . i would n't 
know it if it were well written.  ( consistent , though , is one thing the quran 
is not . ) . and have you read it in arabic besides , some of my best 
writing has been done under the influence of , shall we say , consciousness 
altering substances .  . 

and how 
do we know that the scribes he dictated the quran to did n't screw up , or 
put in their own little verses 

they 'd have to be very good to do so without destroying the beauty 
and literary quality of text arabic text. 

yes , so how do we know they were n't very good  ( again , assuming that the 
quran is written . ) . 

and why can muhammed marry more than four women , 
when no other muslim is allowed to 

muhammad did not exceed the number after the revelation regulating 
the number of wives a man could marry , but before it. 

ok , i retract this point.  ( although i might still say that once he knew , he 
should have done something about it . ) . 

 ( although i think the biggest 
insult to islam is that the majority of its followers would want to 
suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say so of some holy guy. not to 
mention murder the author . ) . 

i agree. but is it really true that this is the case 

i have n't interviewed all muslims about this i would really like it if this 
were false .  . but i ca n't take it on your say so what are your sources 

another case of judging principles on the basis of those who claim 
to follow them. 

what other basis do we have to judge a system especially when we ca n't get 
a consistent picture of what islam really is. do i believe khomeini do i 
go by the imam of the mosque in mecca or perhaps the guy in new jersey or 
perhaps you say i should go only by the quran .  . ok , whose translation and 
what about things like and wherever you find idolators , kill them

philip k. dick 

philip k. dick dick wrote many philosophical and thought provoking short 
stories and novels .  . his stories are bizarre at times , but very approachable .  . 
he wrote mainly sf , but he wrote about people , truth and religion rather than 
technology. although he often believed that he had met some sort of god , he 
remained sceptical .  . amongst his novels , the following are of some relevance 

galactic pot healer 
a fallible alien deity summons a group of earth craftsmen and women to a 
remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans .  . when the 
deity begins to demand faith from the earthers , pot healer joe is 
unable to comply .  . a polished , ironic and amusing novel.

margaret atwood 

the handmaid 's tale 
a story based on the premise that the us congress is mysteriously 
assassinated , and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it 
right again. the book is the diary of a woman 's life as she tries to live 
under the new christian theocracy .  . women 's right to own property is revoked , 
and their bank accounts are closed sinful luxuries are outlawed , and the 
radio is only used for readings from the bible .  . crimes are punished 
retroactively doctors who performed legal abortions in the old world are 
hunted down and hanged .  . atwood 's writing style is difficult to get used to 
at first , but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.

this somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized .  . however , it 
is probably worth reading , if only so that you 'll know what all the fuss is

true version.

the existence of god  ( revised edition) , clarendon paperbacks , oxford 
this book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with the coherence of 
theism  ( 1977 ) and was concluded with faith and reason (1981) .  . in this 
work , swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the 
existence of god. his arguments , which are somewhat tendentious and rely 
upon the imputation of late 20th century western christian values and 
aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived , were 
decisively rejected in mackie 's the miracle of theism . in the revised 
edition of the existence of god , swinburne includes an appendix in which he 
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie .  . 

j. l. mackie 

the miracle of theism , oxford 
this  ( posthumous ) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal 
arguments for and against the existence of god. it ranges from the classical 
philosophical positions of descartes , anselm , berkeley , hume et al , through 
the moral arguments of newman , kant and , to the recent restatements 
of the classical theses by and swinburne .  . it also addresses those 
positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational , 
such as those of kierkegaard , kung and philips , as well as replacements for 
god such as 's axiarchism .  . the book is a delight to read less 
formalistic and better written than martin 's works , and refreshingly direct 
when compared with the hand waving of swinburne .  .

organization u of arizona cs dept , tucson 
summary i have ! 
lines 58 

in article  ( jim perry ) writes 
anyway , since i seem to be the only one following this particular line 
of discussion , i wonder how many of the rest of the readership have 
read this book what are your thoughts on it 

i read it when it first came out , and the controversy broke. put my name 
on the waiting list at the library  ( that way if the book was really 
offensive , none of my money would find its way to the author or 
publisher) , and read it , cover to cover  ( to use a phrase that seems 
popular here right now) .  . 

and i liked it. the writing style was a little hard to get used to , but 
it was well worth the effort. coming from a similar background  ( rushdie 
grew up in bombay in a muslim family , and moved to england i grew up in 
new delhi ) , it made a strong impression on me.  ( and he used many of the 
strange constructions of indian english the at the end of a 
sentence , , the occasional hindi phrase , etc . ) . 

at the time i still sorta kinda thought of myself as a muslim , and i 
could n't see what the flap was all about. it seemed clear to me that this 
was allegory .  . it was clear that he described some local prostitutes who 
took on the names and personae of muhammed 's wives , and had not  ( as my 
grandfather thundered ) implied that muhammed 's wives were prostitutes in 
short , every angry muslim that had read even part of the book seemed to 
have missed the point completely.  ( and i wo n't mention the fact that the 
most militant of them had never even seen the book. oops , i just did ! ) 

perhaps in a deep sense , the book is insulting to islam , because it 
exposes the silliness of revealed religion why does an omnipotent deity 
need an agent she can come directly to me , ca n't she how do we know that 
muhammed did n't just go out into the desert and smoke something and how 
do we know that the scribes he dictated the quran to did n't screw up , or 
put in their own little verses and why can muhammed marry more than four 
women , when no other muslim is allowed to  ( although i think the biggest 
insult to islam is that the majority of its followers would want to 
suppress a book , sight unseen , on the say so of some holy guy. not to 
mention murder the author . ) . 

over the years , when i have made this point , various primarily muslim 
posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book 
and had called it such things as filth and lies , i would rank 
rushdie 's book with hitler 's mein or worse , and so on. 

i had much the same response when i tried to talk about the book. a really 
silly argument after all , how many of these same people have read mein 
kampf it just made me wonder what are they afraid of why do n't they 
just read the book and decide for themselves 

maybe the reaction of the muslim community to the book , and the absence of 
protest from the liberal muslims to khomeini 's fatwa outrage , was the 
final push i needed into atheism !

what is the difference between a chemist and someone who is taught

put like this , i ca n't answer. i was originally pointing out that your

tend to ignore all kinds of effects 

when they 're not important , yes. all scientists do. otherwise science would 
never get anywhere. 

your original posting stated that 
when doing chemistry , it is common to ignore atomic interactions , 

hang about not atomic interactions in general. just specific ones which 
are deemed unimportant .  . like gravitational interactions between ions , which 
are so small they 're drowned out by electrostatic effects , and so on. 

has there been some revolution in teaching methods in the last four years 

perhaps this revolution has yet to reach cambridge  ( my , now i 'll get

the bedrock of spiritual is the belief that resonant , yet 

but theology is full of reason even if it is , as we believe , based on false 
premises etc etc. 

ill defined , terms , e.g. , spirit , transcendental , mind , self , 
consciousness , ultimate reality , soul , elan vital , etc. have 
meaning. sadly , adherents of spiritual movements are seldom satisfied 

hold on there no meaning to consciousness or mind or self ! 

with this harmless they seem drawn to a belief 

what 

in the primacy of the spiritual and transcendental over the material 
and empirical , i.e. , the primacy of pipe dreams , and 
illusion over facts , science and reason. 

since when is , for instance ,  ( non behaviourist ) psychology a pipe dream 
surely the major purpose of the science of psychology is to understand the 
workings of the mind. 

all creatures , all feelings , all thoughts , all perceptions , all 
processes and all phenomena are manifestations of the mundane , i.e. , 
matter , energy , space and time. those who believe otherwise , albeit 
some do not god , are not atheists .  . 

manifestations of the mundane sounds rather transcendental to me. in fact 
matter , energy , space and time are well measured but mysterious 
concepts .  . 

does an atheist really have to believe in your or be cast out as 
not following the true faith !

rapture october 28 , 1992 

what to do in case you miss the rapture 

i. stay calm and do not panic 

your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to 
panic .  . but to do so is absolutely useless now. if you had wanted to get right 
with god before the rapture , you could have , but you chose to wait. now your 
only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the 
tribulation .  . but he that shall endure unto the end , the same shall be 
saved .  . matthew 24 13 

ii. realize you are now living during the great tribulation 

the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of 
the rapture until christ 's second coming. also know as the time of jacob 's 
 ( israel 's) trouble  ( jere 30 7) and daniel 's week  ( dan 9) , this 
period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror .  . 

iii. gather as many bibles as you can and hide them 

soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community 
(the roman empire ) , bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will 
be tantamount to treason .  . the bible , however , will be your most valuable 
possession during the tribulation .  . 

iv. read the bible like you have never read it before in your life 

since all of your bibles may be confiscated , even if you are careful , it 
is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can 
quote them. it is especially important to read daniel , luke 21 , matthew 24 , 
revelation , and amos , for these books describe the events you can expect to 
unfold before you. 

v. pray like you have never prayed before in your life 

pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you pray and pray 
and pray .  . only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual 
strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the 
sake of christ .  . 

vi. do not take the mark at any cost even in fit means you and your loved 
ones die as martyrs 

after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community , he 
will institute a world economic system , designed so that you cannot buy , sell , 
or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name. money will be 
useless. and he causes all , both small and great , rich and poor , free and 
slave , to receive a mark on their right hand or on their , and that 
no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast , 
or the number of his name. here is wisdom .  . let him who has understanding 
calculate the number of the beast , for it is the number of a man his number 
is 666 revelation 13 16 18.

vii. set a plan in motion for survival 

although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist 's government 
until the end of the tribulation , all of the time you gain in hiding is 
important for your spiritual growth and strengthening , since only those who are 
extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake. 
the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or 
mountainous area , for the antichrist 's control will come last to the least 
populated areas. take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay 
attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation .  . 
as you can see on the weather map , heavy currents of tribulation will sweep 
into our area by daybreak .  . expect delays on i 95 outbound , and perhaps school 
m 
store water and food , because you will not be able to purchase anything without 
the mark. water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste 
from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood. 
get a good water filter .  . m 
bring different types of clothing for all seasons , as well as flashlights , 
batteries , generators , and first aid supplies. in short , learn how to 
survive and live off the land as the pioneers did. 

viii. trust no one 

there will be secret agents everywhere , spying for the antichrist 's 
government. be on the lookout .  . 
perot supporters take note m 

ix .  . watch for the antichrist 

it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to , 
for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will 
bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it. we can infer from daniel 
11 certain characteristics of this man. popular during the first three and a 
half years of the tribulation , he will dominate the airwaves .  . he will be 
physically appealing , highly intelligent , with christ like and 
personality. an international politician , military and economic 
expert , his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the jews , which 
he will break after three and a half years. he will have such supernatural 
power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed .  . even the very elect will 
be deceived .  . if you do not pray and read the bible , you too will be deceived .  . 
dominate the airwaves perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh .  .  .  . m 
the antichrist will have a companion , the false sic , who 
will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak. 
all who refuse to sic the image will be killed. the final three and 
a half years will be absolutely insane , with demonized spirits everywhere. 

x. do not give up hope ! 

the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of 
christ .  . the antichrist will be defeated .  . be steadfast and endure , and you 
will be rewarded greatly in heaven. 
start reading the bible and praying now. the salvation of 
your sould depends upon it. determine that , come what may , you will not take 
the mark or worship the antichrist .  . you still have a chance to be saved or 
remain saved , but this time you will have to be faithful unto death. 

may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious return !

the fact is god could cause you to believe anything he wants you to.

the intent of my post  ( as i remember it) was to show that you cannot

of those who claim to be its followers. you have to look at the 
teachings of the religion  ( or the principles of the ideology ) itself . 
there is no getting around this. 

so to argue against islam , you have to go to the qur'an .  . bringing up 
khomeini  ( or anyone else) is relevant to discussing khomeini , but not 
necessarily relevant to discussing islam as a religion . 

sorry , fred , but for the purposes under discussion here , i must 
disagree. your point is true only in the sense that one cannot argue 
against communism by reference to the chinese or soviet , since 
those did not represent true communism .  . in judging the practical 
consequences of islam as a force to contend with in the world today , 
it is precisely the khomeini 's of the world , the rushdie fatwa 
supporters , and perhaps more importantly , the reaction of the world 
muslim community to those extremists , that we must look to. perhaps 
unfortunately from your perspective , most people are not concerned 
with whether islam is the right religion for them , or whether the 
qur'an could be used as a for a hypothetical utopia , but how 
islam affects the world around them , or what their lives might be like 
if islam gains in influence .  . when i consider such possibilities , it

free energy technology 
by robert e. mcelwaine , physicist 

ninety to a hundred years ago , everybody knew that a 
heavier than air machine could not possibly fly. it would 
violate the laws of physics .  . all of the experts and 
authorities said so. 

for example , simon newcomb declared in 1901 the 
demonstration that no possible combination of known 
substances , known forms of machinery and known forms of 
force , can be united in a practical machine by which man 
shall fly long distances through the air , seems to the writer 
as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any 
physical fact to be. 

fortunately , a few smart people such as the wright 
brothers did not accept such pronouncements as the final 
word. now we take airplanes for granted , (except when they 
 . 

today , orthodox physicists and other scientists are 
saying similar things against several kinds of  free energy  
technologies , using negative terms such as pseudo science 
and perpetual motion , and citing so called laws which 
assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed ( 1st law 
of thermodynamics ) and there is always a decrease in useful 
energy ( 2nd law of thermodynamics ) .  . the physicists do not 
know how to do certain things , so they arrogantly declare 
that those things cannot be done. such principles of 
impotence are common in orthodox modern science and help to 
cover up inconsistencies and contradictions in orthodox 
modern theories .  . 

free energy inventions are devices which can tap a 
seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe , with 
out burning any kind of fuel , making them the perfect 
solution to the world wide energy crisis and its associated 
pollution , degradation , and depletion of the environment. 

most free energy devices probably do not create energy , 
but rather tap into existing natural energy sources by 
various forms of induction .  . unlike solar or wind devices , 
they need little or no energy storage capacity , because they 
can tap as much energy as needed when needed. solar energy 
has the dis advantage that the sun is often blocked by 
clouds , trees , buildings , or the earth itself , or is reduced 
by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and 
high latitudes .  . likewise , wind speed is widely variable and 
often non existent .  . neither solar nor wind power are 
suitable to directly power cars and airplanes .  . properly 
designed free energy devices do not have such limitations .  . 

for example , at least three u.s. patents ( 3 , 811 , , 
3 , 879 , 622 , and 4 , 151 , 431 ) have so far been awarded for 
motors that run exclusively on permanent magnets , seemingly 
tapping into energy circulating through the earth 's magnetic 
field. the first two require a feedback network in order to 
be self running. the third one , as described in detail in 
science mechanics magazine , spring 1980 , ( amazing 
magnet powered motor , by , pages 45 48 , 114 117 , 
and front cover) , requires critical sizes , shapes , 
orientations , and of magnets , but no feedback. such 
a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible 
in one 's home , year round , for free. complete 
descriptive copies of u.s. patents are 3.00 each from the 
u.s. patent office , jefferson davis hwy .  . , arlington , va 
22202 correct 7 digit patent number required. or try 
getting copies of both the article and the patents via your 
local public or university library 's inter library loan 
dept .  .  . 

a second type of free energy device , such as the  gray 
motor  (u . s .  . patent 3 , 890 , 548 ) , the  tesla coil  , and the 
motor of inventor joseph newman see science , 2 10 84 , pages 
571 2. , taps electro magnetic energy by induction from 
 earth resonance   ( about 12 cycles per second plus 
 . they typically have a  spark gap  in the circuit 
which serves to synchronize the energy in the coils with the 
energy being tapped .  . it is important that the total 
 inductance  and  capacitance  of the device combine to 
 resonate  at the same frequency as  earth resonance  in 
order to maximize the power output .  . this output can also be 
increased by centering the spark gap at the  neutral center  
of a strong u shaped permanent magnet .  . in the case of a 
tesla coil , slipping a  choke coil  around the 
secondary coil will enhance output power. earth energy 
propulsion power systems , by john bigelow , 1976 , 
health research , p.o. box 70 , hill , ca  . 

during the 1930 's , an austrian civil engineer named 
viktor invented and partially developed an 
 implosion turbine   ( german name , 'zokwendle' ) , after 
analyzing erosion , and lack of erosion , in differently shaped 
, and developing sophisticated mathematical 
equations to explain it. as described in the book a 
breakthrough to new free energy sources , by dan a. davidson , 
1977 , water is pumped by an pump through a 
logarithmic spiral shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a 
critical velocity .  . the water then implodes , no longer 
touching the inside walls of the tubing , and drives the pump , 
which then converts the pump 's motor into an electric 
generator .  . the device seems to be tapping energy from that 
of the earth 's rotation , via the  coriolis effect' , like a 
tornado .  . it can also neutralize gravity ! 

a fourth type of free energy device is the  mcclintock 
air motor  (u . s .  . patent 2 , 982 , 261 ) , which is a cross between 
a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression 
ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine  ( with solar and 
planetary  . it burns no fuel , but becomes self running 
by driving its own air compressor .  . this engine also 
generates a lot of heat , which could be used to heat 
buildings and its very high torque makes it ideal for large 
trucks , preventing their slowing down when climbing hills .  . 
david mcclintock is also the real original inventor of the 
automatic transmission , differential , and 4 wheel drive. 

crystals may someday be used to supply energy , as shown 
in the star trek shows , perhaps by inserting each one between 
metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of 
particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a 
common household smoke detector .  . 

one other energy source should be mentioned here , 
despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of free 
energy. a bulgarian born american physicist named joseph 
has invented and partially developed an atomic fusion 
reactor which he calls   , which uses non radioactive 
deuterium as a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantities 
from sea water , does not produce radioactive waste , can be 
converted directly into electricity  ( with out energy wasting 
steam turbines ) , and can be constructed small enough to power 
a house or large enough to power a city. and unlike the 
and laser fusion that we read about , 
works , already producing at least three watts of power 
for every watt put in. new times (u . s .  . version) , 6 26 78 , 
pages 32 40. 

and then there are the  cold fusion  experiments that 
have been in the news lately , originally conducted by 
university of utah researchers b. stanley and martin 
 . some u.s. navy researchers at the china lake 
naval weapons center in california , under the direction of 
chemist melvin miles , finally took the trouble to collect the 
bubbles coming from such an apparatus , had them analyzed with 
mass spectrometry techniques , and found helium 4 , which 
proves that atomic fusion did indeed take place , and enough 
of it to explain the excess heat generated .  . 

there are good indications that the two so called laws 
of thermodynamics are not so absolute . for example , the 
late physicist dewey b. larson developed a comprehensive 
general unified theory of the physical universe , which he 
calls the  reciprocal system  , (which he describes in detail 
in several books such as nothing but motion  ( 1979 ) and the 
universe of motion  ( 1984 ) , in which the physical universe 
has two distinct halves , the material half and an anti matter 
half , with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing 
between them , with out the heat death predicted by 
thermodynamic laws . his theory explains the universe much 
better than modern orthodox theories , including phenomena 
that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
their heads about , and is self consistent in every way. some 
free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow , 
seemingly converting low quality energy into high quality 
energy . 

also , certain religious organizations such as  sant mat  
and   teach their members that the physical universe 
is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of 
existence , like parallel universes , or analogous to tv 
channels , as described in books like the path of the 
masters , by dr. julian johnson , 1939 , and the key 
to secret worlds , by sri paul , 1969 .  . for example , 
the next level up from the physical universe is commonly 
called the  astral  . long time members of these groups 
have learned to  soul travel  into these higher worlds and 
report on conditions there. it seems plausible that energy 
could flow down from these higher levels into the physical 
universe , or be created at the boundary between them , given 
the right configuration of matter to channel it. this is 
supported by many successful laboratory controlled 
experiments in psycho kinesis throughout the world , such as 
those described in the book psychic discoveries behind the 
iron curtain . 

in terms of economics , the market has failed. inventors 
do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop 
and mass produce free energy equipment , and the conventional 
energy producer have no desire to do so because of their 
ve ted t . the government is needed to intervene .  . if 
the government does not intervene , then the total supply of 
energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and 
will soon run out , prices for energy will increase , and 
pollution and its harmful effects  ( including the  greenhouse 
effect' , acid rain , smog , radioactive contamination , oil 
spills , rape of the land by strip mining , etc . ) . will continue 
to increase .  . 

the government should subsidize research and development 
of free energy by inventors and universities , subsidize 
private production  ( until the producers can make it on their 
own) , and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of 
free energy hardware. 

the long range effects of such government intervention 
would be wide spread and profound .  . the quantity of energy 
demanded from conventional energy producer  ( coal mining 
companie , oil companie and countries , electric , 
etc . ) . would drop to near zero , forcing their employees to 
seek work elsewhere. energy resources  ( coal , uranium , oil , 
and gas ) would be left in the ground. prices for 
conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero , 
while the price of free energy equipment would start out high 
but drop as supply increases  ( as happened with vcr 's , 
personal computers , etc . ) .  . costs of producing products that 
require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease , 
along with their prices to consumers .  . consumers would be 
able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric 
utility bills or buying home heating fuel .  . tourism would 
benefit and increase because travelers would not have to 
spend their money for gasoline for their cars. government 
tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be 
obtained in some other way. and energy could no longer be 
used as a motive or excuse for making war. 

many conventional energy producer would go out of 
business , but society as a whole , and the earth 's environment 
and ecosystems , would benefit greatly .  . it is the people , 
that government should serve , rather than the big 
corporation and bank .

you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were 
maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww2 , when it was far from clear 
that such bombing was necessary 

the world is full of evil , and circumstances are not perfect. many 
innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others. it it regretable , 
but that 's the way it is. 

and why is it that way who set things up to be that way 

this was happening before the gulf war. why did n't we send in the bombers 
to east timor why are n't we sending in the bombers now 

probably because we 're not the saviors of the world. we ca n't police each 
and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another. 

no , just the ones that have oil. or the ones that look like they might make 
a success of communism .  . 

nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet , east timor , or 
some other places. 

i do n't see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting 
them to iraq .  . 

tibetan people are rounded up , tortured , and executed .  . amnesty 
international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china .  . 

why are n't we stopping them in fact , why are we actively sucking up to 
them by trading freely with them 

tell me how we could stop them and i 'll support it. i , for one , do not 
agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it. 
i agree that it is deplorable .  . 

fine. write to your congressman and to president clinton .  . china 's status as

any idea how many kill files you just ended up in 

i , an atheist , am arguing against killing innocent people. 

you , a supposed christian , are arguing that it 's ok to kill innocent people 
so long as you get some guilty ones as well. 

hardly .  . i did n't say that it 's a good thing tm to kill innocent people 
if the end is just .  . unfortunately , we do n't live in a perfect world and 
there are no perfect solutions. if one is going to resist tyranny , then 
innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die. i did n't say 
it is ok it is unfortunate , but sometimes necessary. 

the ends justify the means , eh 

you , having criticised moral relativism in the past , are now arguing that i 
am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the 
war. 

you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist .  . 

the same tired old misunderstanding .  . moral relativism means that there is no 
objective standard of morality .  . it does n't mean you ca n't judge other 
people 's morals .  . christ on a bike , how many times have we tried to hammer 
that into your head 

where 's your christian love where 's your absolute morality oh , how 
quick you are to discard them when it suits you. as ivan stang would say ,

even this discourse in this forum. i understand the full ramifications of 
that , and i am prepared to do so. i do n't believe that you can make the 
same claim .  . 

obviously not , as i am an atheist .  . i do n't think you 'd get on with jesus , 
though he was a long haired lunatic peace nik , was he not 

and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was 
because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being 
so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing 
was n't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a 
decisive way by any other method at that time. but in the gulf war , 
precision bombing was the norm. so the point was , why make a big 
stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted 
in spite of precision bombing , when so many more civilians 
 ( proportionately and quantitatively ) died under the blanket bombing 
in ww2 

right. unfortunately for you , it turned out that my opinions on the matter 
were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too. 

i think you 're being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing 
policy , too. you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets 
and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door. as i 
understand it , that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian 
targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the 
german people. 

civilians suffer .  . but less civilians suffered in this war than 
any other other in history ! 

oh , come on. with wars like the falklands fresh in people 's minds , that sort 
of propaganda is n't going to fool anyone. 

the stories 
of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk .  . 
yes , bunk .  . the us lost 230 , 000 servicemen in ww2 over four years 
and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting ! 

yes and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered it 's 
hardly surprising the us did n't lose many men in ww2 , given that you turned

this is the most bilge i 've seen in a while. jim brown obviously 
has possession of the right wing token .  . 

diplomatic alternatives , including sanctions , were ineffective .  . 

in december , former national security adviser told a 
senate committee that sanctions were costing iraq 100 million per day , and 
that the multinational coalition could take all the time in the world. 
iraq , he suggested , was losing badly every day it the un demands , 
while the community of nations won every day with no taking of life or 
loss of life. washington newsletter .  . 

as i understand , that number is deceptive .  . the reason is that the money 
cost was in non oil sales for the most part. iraq still is not allowed 
to sell oil , or do many of the things under the initial sanctions , but 
is still surviving .  . 

and btw , the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was 
because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being 
so deplorable . yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing 
was n't accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a 
decisive way by any other method at that time. but in the gulf war , 
precision bombing was the norm. 

bullshit ! ! ! in the gulf massacre , 7 of all ordnance used was smart. the 
rest that 's 93 was just regular , dumb ol' iron bombs and stuff. have 
you forgotten that the pentagon definition of a successful patriot launch 
was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage or that a 
successful interception of a scud was defined as the patriot and scud 
passed each other in the same area of the sky 

of the 93 (i have heard figures closer to 80 , but i wo n't quibble your 
figures) , most was dropped in carpet bombing of regions only occupied by 
enemy troops .  . a b 52 drops a lot of bombs in one , and we used them 
around the clock. not to mention other smaller aircraft using dumb 
munitions .  . 

2. the patriot uses a proximity fuse .  . the adjusted figures for number 
of patriot kills of ss 1 derivitives is 60 70 . that figure came 
not from some fluke in the pentagon , but a someone working with such 
stuff in another part of dod .  . 

3. the statement precision bombing was the norm , is true around areas 
where civilians were close to the target. we dropped by very 
little bombs in populated regions , explaining the figures. 

and of the 7 that was the smart stuff , 35 hit. again try to follow me 
here that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed. 

this figure , is far below all the other figures i have seen. if it 
is indeed accurate , then how do you explain the discrepancy between 
that figure , and other figures from international organizations 
most figures i have seen place the hit ratio close to 70 , which is 
still far higher than your 35 . or does your figure say a bomb 
missed if the plane took off with it , and the bomb never hit the target , 
regardless of whether or not the bomb was dropped such methods 
are used all the time to lie with statistics. 

the stories 
of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk .  . 

prove it. i have a source that says that to date , the civilian death count 
 ( er , excuse me , i mean collateral damage ) is about 200 , 000 .  . 

i have never seen any source that was claiming such a figure. please 
post the source so its reliability can be judged .  .

was an example of an islamically owned and operated bank 
what will someone bet me they were n't real islamic owners and

and quite ruthless operation to steal money from small and often 
quite naive depositors .  . 

an islamic bank is something which operates in a different fashion to 
your modern bank , as i have explained here  ( on another thread) before. 
for example , islamic banks do n't pay fixed interests on deposits , but a 
return on investments (which varies according to the market , and is not 
fixed like interest is) .  . 

islamic banks are a relatively new phenomenon in the islamic world. 
there are no islamic banks in the west , including the usa , to my 
knowledge. i doubt if the market for them exists there at least not 
while islamic banks are at a relatively early stage of their 
development as is the case now. bcci is most certainly not an islamic 
bank did bcci ever pay a fixed interest rate on deposits if the 
answer to this question is yes , then bcci was not an islamic bank , as 
islamic banks are specifically set up to not pay or charge interest. 

whether some muslims partially owned the bank or whatever is completely 
irrelevant .  .

occam 's razor is not a law of nature , it is way of analyzing an

what end. 
it seems odd that religion is simultaneously condemned as being 
primitive , simple minded and unscientific , anti intellectual and 
childish , and yet again condemned as being too complex  ( occam 's 
razor ) , the scientific explanation of things being much more 
and , apparently , simpler .  . 

cute characterization bill however , there is no inconsistency between 
the two statements .  . even if one believes that religion is primitive , 
simple minded and unscientific , anti intellectual and childish , one 
can still hold the view that religion also adds an unnecessary level of 
complexity to the explanation. the ideas themselves do n't have to be 
complex before being by occam 's razor , they only have to add 
unnecessarily to the overall complexity of the description. 

which is it to be which 
is the non essential , and how do you know 

i think the non essential part of an explanatory system is one that 
adds no predictive capability to the system. 

considering that even scientists do n't fully comprehend science due to 
its complexity and diversity .  . maybe william of occam has performed a

john e. king posts a whopping one liner 

the modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be 
treated as a matter of faith. francis 

i have a few points to make about the above posting. 

1. science is not based on and does not consist of quotes from either 
real or alleged experts .  . critical reasoning , evidence and  ( if possible) 
experimentation are necessary. creationists frequently display a massive 
confusion about this by merely quoting both non experts and experts alike 
(some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and refusing to 
follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure .  . this strongly suggests 
that (a . ) . their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b . ) . they 
are aware of this fatal deficiency .  . of course , you may not actually be a 
creationist and this may not be your real intent .  . 

2. you have failed to identify and the surrounding context of his 
statement. why is that if is a scientific illiterate then the 
quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology .  . 
creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context 
and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate 
scientists .  . of course , you may not actually be a creationist and this may 
not be your real intent .  . 

3. evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of the modern theory of 
evolution would be a much more powerful argument than a one 
line quote from an unidentified nobody .  . it is also important to note that 
disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate 
claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck 
proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid .  . creationists seem rather fond 
of diving  ( head first) into this logical fallacy .  . of course , you may not 
actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent .  . 

4. since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science , an attack 
on evolution  ( either the fact or the theory ) really represents an attack on 
science. while the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (b ) the 
fact of evolution will not ever go away. creationists lost the battle long 
ago  ( more than 100 years in fact ) but are simply too willfully ignorant and 
irrational to acknowledge the fact. of course , you may not actually be a 
creationist and you may not really be that ignorant .  . 


warren kurt vonroeschlaub asks 

neither i , nor webster 's has ever heard of francis  . who is he 

i , like , am not to be found in webster 's b ) .  . francis 
is a scientifically illiterate creationist  ( or perhaps he is just playing the 
part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution ( the neck of 
the giraffe ) .  . in that publication he quotes a creationist  ( jean morton ) 
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could 
not have formed by chance. thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution 
(the two are quite independent ) but also concluding with a non sequitur (i . e .  . 
the conclusion does not follow ) .  . pp 70 71 also misquotes richard 
in an effort to support creationism .  . pp 84 

book was reviewed by national park service david 
in the los angeles times  ( and repeated in the  . the article was 
titled  sticks scientific neck out too far . excerpts include 

francis is not a biologist .  . he goes after darwin like mark 
after  . he flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and 
pseudo science with the of a snake oil salesman .  . he suggests 
a mystical principle  of life , using the similarity of organs 
in different creatures as evidence sic . 

note that the last statement above is actually evidence for evolution not 
against it. if john e. king is quoting from this reviewed book it would n't 
surprise me much. it 's also interesting that king had nothing to add (i . e .  . 
he only posted a quote) .  .

as many posters have said in as many posts lately , this is just 
not true. for to show no interest in the existence of god takes no 
faith at all. you make the presumption that the knowledge of the 
possibility of something is enough to require faith to render 
that possibilty of no interest. it is a very different thing to say 
that you do n't believe something than it is to say that you do n't 
have sufficent reason to believe something is even interesting to 
think about. it 's not either or. sometimes is just something else 
more interesting that occupies your mind. 

i agree that faith and dogma are inevitable , but not necessarily 
applied to god and religion. it takes both faith and dogma to 
expect the sun to come up every morning , but there is overwhelming 
reason every single day , day in and day out , for everyone to put 
his faith and dogma there. not so with the christian religion.

km yeah , hilarious. satanists believe satan is a god , but not 
km the only god. satan is a part of christian mythology .  . 
km therefore , one cannot reasonably worship satan without 
km acknowledging the existence of a christian god. satanists 
km see satan as their master , and they see god and satan as 
km adversaries of similar power. satanists believe in the 
km eventual overthrow of god and a transfer of all power to 
km their master. kevin marshall 

a great many satanists do not believe in satan .  . some do , some 
do n't .  . i 'd go so far as to assert that most orthodox satanists 
do not worship satan  ( church of satan , etc . ) . but rather worship 
self. to hear say it , only idiots and fools believe in satan 
and or allah .  . he knew that suckers are born every minute. 

maximus 2 . 01wb . 

anton 's interpretation of satanism has always puzzled me. i 
read his satanic bible a few years ago for a social studies project , 
as well as a book by arthur lyons called the cult of devil worship 
in america .  . the latter included a very interesting interview with 
the black pope in which he did indeed say that satan was merely an 
instrument for one to realize the self. 

when i refer to satanism , i am referring to the mishmash of rural satanic 
and witchcraft which existed before the church of satan .  . i 
do n't consider 's church to be at all orthodox , nor do i consider 
its followers satanists .  . combined the philosophies of nietzsche , 
crowley , and reich , slapped in some religious doctrine , added a little 
touch of p.t. barnum , and his creation the church of satan .  . 
no doubt the title was a calculated attempt to attract attention .  .  . i . 
suppose he could have just as easily called it the church of free sex. 

at any rate , it worked  ( for a while) .  . in its heyday , the church had a 
huge following , including such hollywood celebrities as sammy davis , jr. 
and jayne mansfield .  . (i have a picture of with sammy , by the 
way . ) . 

i find the idea of a satanist not believing in satan about as credible as 
a christian not believing in christ .  . but if you include the church of 
satan , then i suppose i need to alter my definition .  . webster 's dictionary 
and the american heritage dictionary will have to do the same.

well , that is certainly different , but it looks as if there is a translation 
found for everything. by the way , i am most surprised to hear that night and 
day move in an orbit .  . 

i thought about this , too some translations refer to only the latter 
two objects being in orbit , but 's translation seems to indicate 
the night and the day travelling in orbit too. perhaps this can be 
understood when one looks at it from the earth 's reference frame from 
this reference frame , the day and the night would appear to orbit the 
earth  ( travelling from east to west) .  .  ( this is from the reference frame 
when the earth is still . ) . 


well , yes , but that belongs in the other group , there is a interpretation 
found for everything. however , allowing any form of interpretation reduces 
the information of the text so to zero .  . 

by the way , i have checked the quote and i think the lines preceding those 
quoted above are more interesting 

21 32 where mountains are set on earth in order to the earth. 
21 33 where the skies  ( heavens ) are referred to as well supported .  . 

the lines given above are 21 34 after my edition. 


maybe this is what is meant by the above .  .  .  .  . it 's just a possibility .  . 

and that the sun travels in an orbit without saying that earth does , too , 
sounds geocentric to me. 

i will see if i can find out more about this. 

but it is still not geocentric .  . 


that sun and moon move and the earth is immobile sounds geocentric to me.

i read an article about a poll done of students at the ivy league

is it because they are more intelligent younger is this the wave of 
the future 

i would guess that it probably has something to do with the ease of which 
ideas and thoughts are communicated on a college campus .  . in the real world 
(tm) it 's easier for theists  ( well , people in general really ) to lock 
themselves into a little bubble where they only see and talk to those 
people who are of the same opinion as they are. in college you are 
constantly surrounded by and have to interact with people who have 
different ideas about life , the universe , and everything. it is much much 
harder to build a bubble around yourself to keep everyone else 's ideas from 
reaching you.

atheists and theists of other religions some are bound to have a change in 
their beliefs over four years. there is nowhere to run .  .  .  .  . )

reply to (mike cobb ) 

if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that what 
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally 
mandated morality pardon the extremism , but could n't i murder your 
brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was 
doing what felt good , did n't want anyone forcing their morality on me , 
or i do n't follow your morality 

i believe that morality is subjective .  . each person is entitled to his 
own moral attitudes .  . mine are not a priori more correct than someone 
elses .  . this does not mean however that i must judge another on the 
basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to 
believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is 
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is 
offensive to the majority .  . 

why how might makes right how can they force their morality on me why 
ca n't i do what i want who are they to decide what if i disagree 


well i agree with you in the sense that they have no moral right to inflict 
these rules , but there is one thing i might add at the very least , almost 
everybody wants to avoid pain , and if that means sacrificing some stuff for a 
herd morality , then so be it. 


most criminals do not see their behavior as moral .  . the may realize that 
it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral 
system but being immoral .  . 

good point , but it is being immoral in our opinion. we do n't let them choose , 
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them. 

right , and since they grew up and learned around us , they have some idea of our 
right and wrong , which i think must , in part , be incorporated .  . very rarely do 
you see criminal behaviour for philosophical reasons 



for someone to lay claim to an alternative 
moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be 
internally consistent .  . some lack an innate moral sense 

i admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense , but have little basis 
for it as of yet. how far can such a concept be extended 


 ( stuff deleted) 

do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
not him. after all , he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he 
chose .  . on what basis do we condemn other societies besides , here 's the buzz 
words , on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all 
societies 

holding that morality is subjective does not mean 
that we must excuse the murderer .  . 

why not do we have to be objective suddenly

moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior . 
1)who ) is society 
2)how ) do they define what is acceptable 
3)how ) do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position 
mac 

wow ! you got me thinking now ! 

this is an interesting question in that recently there has been a 
move in society to classify previously socially unacceptable yet legal 
activities as ok. in the past it seems to me there were always two 
coexisting methods of social control. 

first  ( and most explicit ) is legal control. that is the set of 
actions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set 
of punishments .  . 

secondly  ( and somewhat more hidden ) is social control. these are 
the actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered 
by legal control , are controled by social censure .  . ideally  ( if 
socialization is working as it should ) legal control is hardly ever needed 
since most people control their actions due to the pressure of 
social censure .  . 

the control manifests itself in day to day life as guilt and 
morality . i 've heard it said  ( and fully believe) that if it were n't for 
the vast majority of people policing themselves , legal control would be 
absolutely impossible. 

lately  ( last 50 , 100 years ) however there has been a move to 
attempt to the individual from societal control (ie .  . if it ai n't 
illegal , then do n't pick on me) .  . i'm not saying this is wrong , merely 
that it is a byproduct of a society which has 

1) a high education level , 
2) a high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media , 
3) a high level of institutionalized individual rights , and 
4) a me oriented culture. 

i guess what i'm saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition , 
here in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can 
ca n't allow people to do based entirely on personal , yet we 
are fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as 
those freedoms do n't impinge on another 's .  . 

imho society is trying to two mutually exclusive ends here. while we 
appreciate and individual rights  ( these satisfy the old 
territoriality and dominance instincts ) , the removal of socialized , 
inherent fears based on ignorance will result in the 
continued destabilization of society. 

i got no quick fix. i have no idea how we can get ourselves out of this 
mess. i know i would never consent to the roll back of personal freedoms 
in order to society. yet i believe development of societies 
follow a process which selects for stability .  . can we find a 
social model which maximizes  . freed .  . 's yet is stable perhaps it is 
possible to live with a non stable society 

anybody see a way out comments 

ps. therefore answer to question 3 we do n't .  . do we want to

i disagree with these. what society thinks should be irrelevant .  . what the 
individual decides is all that is important. 

this does n't seem right. if i want to kill you , i can because that is what i 
decide 

1)who ) is society 

i think this is fairly obvious 

not really. if whatever a particular society mandates as ok is ok , there are 
always some in the society who disagree with the mandates , so which 
societal mandates make the standard for morality 

2)how ) do they define what is acceptable 

generally by what they feel is right , which is the most idiotic policy i can 
think of. 

so what should be the basis unfortunately i have to admit to being tied at 
least loosely to the feeling , in that i think we intuitively know some things 
to be wrong. awfully hard to defend , though. 

3)how ) do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position 

by thinking for ourselves. 

i might agree here. just because certain actions are legal does not make them 
moral .

it had to happen the old allegation of the deathbed conversion of the 
noted  .  .  . other examples 
what all of these deathbed conversion 
claims have in common is that they are utterly unsubstantiated , and 
almost certainly untrue .  . 

i would not be too quick to say that they are almost certainly untrue .  . 
even strong minded people may fall back on childhood indoctrination , 
grasp at straws , or do other strange things when faced with extreme 
suffering , not to mention physiological problems which may lead to 
diminished mental capacity .  . 

at the risk of restarting an old argument and accusations of appeal to 
authority i remind readers of what i posted a while back as a kind of 
obituary for the late atheist dr. albert sabin .  . in an old interview 
rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time 
a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness .  . 
he admitted to having cried out to god while critically ill and on a

after his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination .  . do n't say 
it could n't happen to you , or that it has n't happened to others , even if 
you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this. 
people are different. i admire dr. sabin for admitting his human weakness 
in that instance .  . i would not think less of asimov for similar weakness .  . 

nevertheless i agree that these reports are unsubstantiated and may 
well be untrue .  . in any case they are not evidence for anything besides 
the power of early indoctrination and human  .

alarming amounts of agreement deleted ) 

i made my statement about razor from my experiences in physics .  . 
thanks for info in statistics very interesting and i did n't 
know it before. i follow your proof , but i have one questions. we have 
two hypotheses h and hg the latter is more complicated , which by 
definition means  ( p(h )  . 

that ( complicated ) is n't in fact where  ( p(h )  ( p(hg ) comes from it 's more 
the other way around. it 's from 

 ( p(h )  ( p(hg )  ( p(hg' ) where g  is the complement of g 

and by axiom ,  ( p(anything ) 0 , so  ( p(hg' ) 0 , so  ( p(h )  . 

in a sense , hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g , 
so i may be splitting hairs , but what i'm trying to say is that irrespective 
of subjective impressions of how complicated something is ,  ( p(h )  ( p(hg ) 
holds , with equality if and only if  ( p(hg' ) 0. 

as you point out , it 's a very simple matter to show  ( p(x h )  ( p(x hg ) 
 ( p(h x)  ( p(hg x) , and thus h is to be to hg .  . now to say 
that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say  ( p(x h )  ( p(x  . 
can you elaborate some on this. 

well ,  ( p(x a)  ( p(x b) means that x is as likely to be observed if a is 
operative as it is if b is operative .  . this implies that observing x does not 
provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between 
the respective possibilities that a and b are operative the difference 
reduces to the difference between the  ( unknown and unhelpful ) prior 
probabilities  ( p(a ) and  ( p(b ) 

 ( p(x a)  ( p(x b) 

 ( p(a x) k  ( p(a ) , and  ( p(b x) k  ( p(b ) 

where k  ( p(x a)  ( p(x )  ( p(x b)  . 

so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x 
does n't give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative .  . 

in the particular case where a h and b hg , however , we know that their 
prior probabilities are ordered by  ( p(h )  ( p(hg ) , although we do n't know 
the actual values , and it 's this which allows us to deploy the razor to 
throw out any such hg .  . 

also , in the real world it is n't as clear cut and dry it seems 
to me. we ca n't always determine whether the equality  ( p(x h ) 
 ( p(x hg ) is true. 

that 's certainly true , but the particular point here was whether or 
not a component  actually underlies the prevalence of religion 
in addition to the memetic transmission component , which even the religious 
implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of the  . 

now it seems to me , as i 've said , that the observed variance in religious 
belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model , but rather 
less well if one proposes a component  in addition , since i would 
expect the latter to against wide variance and even mutual 
exclusion among beliefs .  . thus my personal feeling is that  ( p(x hg ) is n't 
even equal to  ( p(x h ) in this case , but is smaller (h is memetic transmission , 
g is component  , x is the variance among beliefs) .  . but i happily 
acknowledge that this is a subjective impression .  . 

btw , my beef with your argument was not a mathematical one 
i checked most of your work and did n't find an error and you seem very 
careful so there probably is n't a math mistake . i think the mistake 
is philosophical .  . but just to make sure i understand you , can please 
rephrase it in non technical terms i think this is a reasonable 
request i always try to look for ways of explaining physics to 
non physicist .  . i'm not a statistician  ( nor any type of 
statistician ) , so this would be very helpful. 

not that i'm a statistician as such either , but 

the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of 
the  ( read `my' ) observations to date. however , theism  ( of the type with 
which i am concerned ) also suggests that , for instance , prayer may be 
answered , people may be miraculously healed  ( both are in principle amenable 
to statistical verification) and that god s may generally intervene in 
measurable ways. 

this means that these regions of the space of possible observations , 
which i loosely termed appearances of god s , have some 
probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic .  . 

since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to 
scatter around over the observation space , the probability which theism 
expends on making appearances of god s possible must come from somewhere 
else (i . e .  . other possible  . 

all else being equal , this means that an observation which is n't an 
appearance of god s must have a slightly higher probability under 
atheism than under theism .  . the stuff implies that such 
observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of 
the atheistic hypothesis to increase , with a corresponding decrease 
in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis .  . 

sorry if that 's still a bit , but it 's rather difficult to 
put it any other way , since it does depend intimately on the properties 
of conditional probability densities , and particularly that the total 
area under them is always unity .  . 

an analogy may  ( or may not ) be helpful. say that hypothesis a is the 
coin is fair , and that b is the coin is unfair  ( two headed) . (i 've 
used a and b to avoid confusion with h heads and t tails  . ) . 

then 

 ( p(h a) 0.5 total 1 
 ( p(t a) 0.5 

 ( p(h b) 1 total 1 
 ( p(t b) 0 

the observations are a string of heads , with no tails .  . this is compatible 
with both a fair coin (a) and a two headed coin (b) .  . however , the probability 
expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails  ( even though they 
do n't actually appear ) must come from somewhere else , since the total must 
be unity , and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance 
of heads. 

say our running estimates at time n 1 are e n 1 (a) and e n 1 (b) .  . the 
observation x n at time n is another head , x n h. the estimates are 
modified according to 

 ( p(h a) 
e n (a) e n 1 (a) e n 1 (a) m 
 ( p(h ) 

and 

 ( p(h b) 
e n (b) e n 1 (b) e n 1 (b) 2m 
 ( p(h ) 

now we do n't know  ( p(h ) , the actual prior probability of a head , but 
the multiplier for e(a) is half that for  . this is true every time 
the coin is tossed and a head is observed .  . 

thus whatever the initial values of the estimates , after n heads , we have 

n 
e n (a) m e 0 (a) 

and 
n 
e n (b) (2m) e 0 (b) , 

and since e k (a) e k (b) 1 at any time k , you can show that 0.5 m 1 
and thus 1 2m 2. hence the estimate for the fair coin hypothesis a must 
decrease at each trial and that for the two headed coin hypothesis b must 
increase , even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads. 

the loose analogy is between unfair coin and atheism , and between fair 
coin and theism , with observations consistent with both. a tail , which 
would falsify unfair coin , is analogous to an appearance of god s , 
which would falsify atheism .  . i am not claiming that the analogy extends 
to the numerical values of the various probabilities , just that the principle 
is the same. 

constant observation of no evidence for gods , if evidence for them 

is at all possible under the respective , constantly increases 

the notional estimated probability that they do n't exist , 

it 's important to draw a distinction between theism that could 
be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that ca n't .  . 
given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible , 
it does n't make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary 
view. 

quite so , but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg , 
in terms of our 's razor discussion , and i 'd bin it on those grounds .  . 

so it depends upon your conception of this god. if it 's a conception 
like zeus , who happened to come down to earth to play quite 
frequently , then i agree with you lack of evidence for this conception 
of god is evidence that it does not exist. but if your conception 
of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions  ( see below 
on falsifiable predictions ) , then i disagree lack of evidence 
does not support a disbelief .  . 

the hypotheses do n't have to be falsifiable , and indeed in my  , 
the theism is n't falsifiable .  . 

... 

i used the phrase should . given any specific  x  theism 
does not make the prediction  ( p(x ht ) 0 . that 's why i used the 
word should theism makes no predictions about any specific event. 
i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such 
and such happens , or i believe god will do such and such. but 
for any given  x  i can never , a priori , say  ( p(x ht ) 0. i can 
not even say this for the set of all  x  or some  . this is what 
do n't like about your use of probability .  . we also have no way of 
assigning these probabilities i hold science to 
criteria if someone cannot tell me how to measure , even in principle , 
 ( p(x h ) , then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h. such 
is the case when h ht  ( theistic ) and ha  . for example , 
 ( p(x ha )  ( p(x ha )  . what is  ( p(ha ) ! how do i measure it 

you do n't have to. we do n't need , in the above analogy , to know any 
prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the 
fair coin hypothesis is less than unity , and that the corresponding 
multiplier for the two headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity .  . 
you do n't need to know the initial values of the running estimates 
either. it 's clear that after a large number of observations ,  ( p(fair coin ) 
approaches zero and  ( p(two headed coin ) approaches unity .  . 

all you need to know is whether  ( p(x ha ) is larger than  ( p(x ht ) for 
observed x , and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain 
events rendered possible (not necessary) under ht which are not possible 
under ha , and all else is equal .  . 

statistics relies upon a series of observations .  . but 
what if the hypothesis is n't amenable to observation and even for 
statements that are amenable to observation , some observations are 
not relevant a sequence of observations must be chosen with care. 
i'm curious to know what types of observations x 1 , x 2 , ... you have 
in mind concerning theism and atheism .  . 

any observations you like it really does n't matter , nor affect the 
reasoning , provided that there are some possible observations which 
would count as appearances of god s . examples of this might be 
a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer , or of the veracity of 
revelation .  . 

but any statement about  ( p(x h ) for general x still counts as a 
prediction of h. if the theism in question , ht , says that prayer may 
be answered , or that miracles may happen  ( see my interpretation , quoted 
again above , of what exists  means) , then this is a prediction , 
 ( p(x ht ) 0 for such x. it 's what distinguishes it from the atheist 
hypothesis ha , which predicts that this stuff does not happen ,  ( p(x ha ) 
0 for such x. 

theism does not make the claim that  ( p(x ht ) 0 for such x . 
or i should say that my theism does n't .  . maybe i was too quick to 
say we had a common language. you said that by the existence of god 
you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by 
christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents . 
i agreed with this. however , i must be careful here. i believe 
this i'm not making any claims .  . maybe i should have changed does 
to can there is an important shift of emphasis .  . but any way , 
since i only have a belief , i cannot conclude  ( p(x ht ) 0 for 
such x . 

ok , we 'll downgrade does interact to may interact , which would 
actually be better since does interact implies a which 
we both agree is misplaced .  . 

i do n't think my theism makes predictions . maybe i'm not 
understanding what you mean by prediction could you explain what 
you mean by this word 

i 'll explain , but bear in mind that this is n't central all i require of 
a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of god s will 
never happen , as does atheism .  .  ( before somebody points out that quantum 
mechanics does n't make this prediction either , the difference is that 
qm and atheism do not form a partition . ) . 

predictions include such statements as prayer is  ( implying 
if you do the stats , you will find that prayer is ) , or prayer 
is not , or verily i say unto you , this generation shall not 
pass , till all these things be fulfilled .  . i do n't think we have any problems 
of misunderstanding here. 

persistent observation of this stuff not happening , consistent with 
ht though it may be , is more consistent with ha , as explained in the 
stats post. 

even if ht ( god exists ) is unfalsifiable , that 's 
no problem for my argument , other than that you have to let the number 
of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically .  . 

btw , i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of 
observations as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid .  . 
we , as existing humans , can never make an infinite number of 
and any conclusion that on this i do n't accept as valid .  . 

that 's fine i do n't claim that theism is false , merely that the finite 
number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is , and 
that as i continue to observe , the suggestion looks better and better. 

stuff deleted 

in the stats post , i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable 
in a finite number of observations .  . here 's the relevant quote 

the important assumption is that there are some observations which 
are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist 
hypothesis , and thus would falsify atheism these are what i called 
of god s  , but this need not be taken too literally .  . any 
observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods 
exist will count. all other observations are assumed to be compatible 
with both hypotheses .  . this leaves theism as unfalsifiable , and atheism 
as falsifiable in a single observation only by such of 
god  . 

here is my problem with this. for something to be falsifiable it 
must make the prediction that  x  should not be seen. if  x  is 
seen then the hypothesis has been falsified .  . now , atheism is a word 
in oposition to something theism .  . a theism a belief and an 
atheism a disbelief .  . so there are certain that are 
certainly falsifiable just as there are certain that are 
(e . g .  . if my theism asserts the world is only 6 , 000 years 
old and that god does not then this has been  . however , 
the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also 
unfalsifiable .  . i could be wrong on this statment  .  .  . 

i think you are an appearance of god s is sufficient to falsify 
atheism , whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable .  . 

i 'll think more about it. until then , here is a general question. 
x were unfalsifiable .  . is  ( not(x ) also unfalsifiable 

no by way of a counterexample , let x the coin is fair , or more 
accurately (so that  ( not(x ) makes sense) the two sides of the coin are 
different . this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of 
heads is consistent with a fair coin , and you have to go to an infinite 
number of to falsify x in the limit. its converse is falsifiable , 
and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared .  . 

this is partly what 's wrong with you argument which 
requires observations x 1 ... x n to be made. there are simply 
no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the 
statement god exists . now , by use of your symmetry argument , i 
can understand why someone would say since the statement 
 god does not exist  

makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it. but none 
the less this would be founded on a type of faith or if you do n't 
like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable 
evidence instead. 

i 'll assume you meant exists  up there at the highlight .  . but by our 
agreed definition of exists , the statement makes predictions as i said 
above , although it is n't falsifiable in a finite number of observations .  . 

actually , i mean  god does not exist  makes no predictions .  . 

oops .  . sorry. mea culpa .  . 

the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are 
refering to. but i can think of some conceptions of god for which 
it is true. but once again i'm open to the posibility that i could 
be wrong. so give me some examples of predictions of the statment 
god does not exist . here is one that i can think of. if true , then 
there would be no healing or  . but this can in principle never 
be determined one way or the other. there are cases in which people 
seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no 
known reason. these situations do in fact happen. they are consistent 
with a theistic hypothesis , but in no way support such a hypothesis .  . 

we agree here. 

they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis .  . i ca n't 
think of one prediction from  god does not exist  that is n't of 
this type. but i might be missing something. 

the rapture will not happen on october 28 1992. said rapture would have 
falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened , although its failure 
to happen does not , of course , falsify any other than those which 
specifically predicted it. 

no phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its 
explanation will ever be observed .  . that about sums the whole thing up.

no one asks you to swallow everything , in fact jesus warns against it. but let 
me ask you a question. do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for 
that matter anything in school. i mean it 's just what other people have told 
you and you do n't want to swallow what others say. right ... 

well , we will know for sure if we were told the truth or not , but at the 
very least there is a bit more evidence pointing to the fact that , say , there 
was a military conflict in vietnam 25 years ago , then there is a supernatural 
diety who wants us to live a certain way. the fact that jesus warned against

the life , death , and resurection of christ is documented historical fact. 

this is not true. the first two choices here  ( life and death) are 
documented , and the last one is total unless one uses the bible , and 
that is totally circular .  . perhaps it be better to use the imagination , or 
one 's ignorance .  . someone else will address this i'm sure , and refer you to 
plenty of documentation .  .  .  .

have any proof except what i am told. however all the major events of the life 
of jesus christ were hundreds of years before him. neat trick uh 

how is this there is nothing more disgusting than christian attempts to 
manipulate interpret the old testament as being filled with signs for the 
coming of christ .  . every little reference to a stick or bit of wood is 
interpreted as the cross .  . what a miscarriage of  . 


there is no way to get into a sceptical heart. you can not say you have given a 
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have. you must trust , not just go 
to church and participate in it 's activities. were you ever willing to die for what 
you believed 

well , since we have skeptical hearts  ( thank goodness , ) there is no way to get 
into us. here we have the irreconcilable difference christians glorify 
exactly what we tend to despise or trust belief faith without knowledge. 
if i am lucky one day and i happen to be thinking of god at the same time my

right , and i will trust without  . maybe. does not seem to 
be anything that is conclusively arrived at , but rather it seems to be more of

healthy morality .  . it would seem not to be. the same thing could reflect 
fanaticism , for example , and is any case an expression of simple selfishness .  .

simple logic arguments are folly .  . if you read the bible you will see 
that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic . 

if you rely simply on your reason then you will never 
know more than you do now. 

i once heard an arguement from a xtian friend similar to this. 
christianity is a higher logic .  . athiest like u will not be able 
to understand it. your atheist logic is very low. only thru faith can 
we understand the higher logic in god . 

so i asked him , so what is this higher logic 

his answer , i do n't know. 

this , the posting above highlights one of the worst things about 
 . it is abundantly clear to both atheists that 
their believe is both illogical irrational .  . their tactics , therefore 
to disregard logic rationality altogether. silly excuses such as 
the ones above and those such as , how can u trust science , science 
was invented by man ! , only goes to further show the weakness of 
their religion. 

in my country where was and still is rapidly growing , 
never try to convert people by appealing to their brains or senses .  . 
they know it would be a fruitless act , given the irrational nature 
of their faith. 
they would wait until a person is in distress , then they would comfort 
him her and addict them to their emotional opium .  . 

never in my life had i met a person who converted to coz it 's 
reasonable . rationality has no place in  ( see xtian arguement

ah , so a cruel punishment is not just if it is painful , as you

why this sudden chance in your stance 

i do n't think i 've changed my stance at all. my original stance was that 
a painless execution was not a cruel one. i did n't say what would be 
considered cruel , only that a painless death was n't .  . now , cruelty must 
involve some sort of suffering , i believe. i do n't think someone that gets 
shot in the head or really suffers very much. even a hanging 
probably produces one sharp instance of pain , but it 's over so quickly .  .  .  .

could it be that a counter example has been made , which renders your

is incorrect or , if you somehow managed to slip up , and your 
origional stance , why not admit it 

no. well , again i stated that a painless death is n't cruel , but i do n't 
think i stated that all painful executions are cruel .  . i think that some 
are cruel , depending on the nature and duration of the pain. 

by the way , how long is too long 

anything more than an instant , i guess. any death by suffocation 
, or blood loss would be cruel , i think  ( this includes the 
gas chamber , and drawing and  . i 'd say that any pain that

the information of that is invariant under your child being a son or

there has to be more 
more than what 
more than we assume .  . 

which is what , exactly 

(a) most of the people i debate disagree with my premises .  . hardly debate 
otherwise. 

your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged 
more than once. when i did it , you said , good question , and did not 
address it. 

i 've addressed it  ( your caricature is not my favourite point , needless 
to say) at length in a previous outing , and am currently discussing it with 
eric rescorla .  . 

(b) there 's little point in responding the same points everywhere i do 
my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply. 

you still repeat that point. 

i do curious , since i believe that was the first time i 've ever made it. 
not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability 
to understand you ask me the same question , i 'll give you the same 
answer , especially when in this case , i know the answer to be true. i 
do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply , but if everyone is 
making the same points , and i'm pushed for time , then i try to respond what i 
believe are the strongest formulations of those points. if that does n't 
include your post , tough this is usenet , and life is tough all over. 

(c) since there 's a great deal of responses this is n't always feasible i 
do my best to honestly answer questions put to me. 

you drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others. you appear 
with the same issue every n months , and start the at the beginning 
again. 

i 've only debated this issue twice in a.a , and occasionally in t . a .  . the 
first was in response to simon clippingdale 's positive assertion that 
disagreement about moral values acknowledges that morals 
are relative .  . it does n't .  . now , simon has dropped out of the debate 
for some time i take that to mean that he is either busy , or bored 
with the topic. i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty .  . do you 

 ( d ) i ca n't always understand what you say 

neither ca n't i understand you all the time. usually , one asks what the other 
side means. 

usually , one does. usually you 're clear , but sometimes you are n't 
and i ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight 
and i feel that i'm debating against line noise. sometimes i get tired , and 
sometimes i have other things i 'd rather do. again , this is usenet , and 
life is tough all over. you 're going to have to deal with it. 

 ( e ) you 're starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name 
in the hat in future. 

that 's supposed to be a threat 

no , that 's a simple statement , and an assertion that i am not answerable 
to those who offer me baseless insults .  . for example , those who accuse me 
of lying about my personal beliefs , while also complaining that i do n't answer 
their questions. 

like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there. 
if only everything would be so easy. 

what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there. 
because to all intents and purposes , it is there. 
we had that argument. for one , your claim that everyone senses it 
is not founded , and you have been asked to give evidence for it often. 
and then , the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it 
is there unless evidence against it has been found. 

i have no problem with the second statement. i have provided an 
argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable the 
only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey , and was offered 
by some other people too essentially , that people disagree about 
fuzzy concepts such as freedom .  . it 's a good point , and i'm thinking 
about it. 

your trick is to say , i feel a is not right , and so do many i know , 
therefore a is absolutely right. it neglects the possibility that 
these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process , 
restricting the claim of its to those who have been subject 
of that process. in other words , refutes it. you make the ontological 
claim , you have to prove it. 

nonsense. my trick is to say i feel that a is better than b and so 
does almost any disinterested person i ask. best evidence is therefore 
that a really is better than b , subject to the assumption that we 
can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b , and 
that the resulting system of values is self consistent .  . 

now get this really is better is an , a fictional model , 
in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model. it 
may or may not correspond to something true. it is nonetheless a useful 
assumption . far more useful than the equally assumed relativist 
trick , to wit 

i feel that a is better than b , and so does almost any disinterested person 
i ask. however , if even one person disagrees that a is better than b , 
or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b , 
then it is the case that b is better than a for that person , and nothing 
more can be said. 

i say this is useless because it implies that a 
seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to 
maximise b (e . g .  . a  . to do that would be to claim that 
a 's carefully considered morality would be better than the 
terrorist 's which would , of course , be true , but a no no for an ethical 
relativist .  . to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is 
simply weasel words , and an example of to rival 
anything in the world of religion. 

for a similar argument , i sense morality is subjective , it does not 
hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by 
others. 

if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively 
wrong , and it turns out not to be the case for you of course this 
is possible. it is neither evidence for , nor evidence 
against objectivism (except sometimes , in a pragmatic sense) .  . 

it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to 
judgements is absolute .  . and as long as you do n't provide evidence for 
that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to 
believe your hypothesis .  . 

i 've done this freedom , with the proviso that i still have to 
answer jon 's objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no 
objective meaning. 

further , in order to make morality absolute , universal , or objective , 
you would have to show that it is independent of humans , or the attributes 
above look quite misleading .  . 

not really. what evidence is there that anything exists independently 
of humans you 'll be hard pressed to find any that is n't logically 
equivalent when applied to values .  . 

an analogous set of premises would be 

premise 1 some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest 
route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance 
of the estate , and down the road. 

premise 2 i checked it out , and found that the shortest route from my 
which is much closer. 

you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my 
house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim , 
using premises which are logically no different. 


no. morals are a matter of belief so far. the people still believe that the 
shortest way is through the main entrance .  . no agreement on belief here. 
and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a 
shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it 
is the shortest way indeed. in other words , your analogy works only when 
one assumes that your premises are right in the first place. if not , it is 
a fallacy .  . 

and if this were an argument for objectivism , you 'd be right. it is n't , 
though , it 's a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument 
against objectivism , nor argument for relativism .  . your gimmick is to 
assume in the first place that values are n't real , and to use this to prove 
that values are n't real. in other words , you beg the question against me.

the author of the trilogy rails against natural law , natural 
morality , objective reality , and other pervasive myths .  . witty and 
thought provoking work from someone who actually seems to know an argument 
from a hole in the ground.

since theological propositions are scientifically meaningless , those of us 
of pragmatic disposition simply wo n't buy such dubious merchandise .  . ... 
maybe remotely there might be something in such promotions , as there 
might be something in the talking dogs and the stocks in arabian tapioca 
mines that w . c .  . fields once sold in his , but we suspect that we

cruel and unusual punishment .  . this shows that cruel as used in the 
constitution does not refer to whether or not the punishment causes physical 
pain. 
rather , it must be a different meaning. 

i do n't think so. although some forms of execution are painful (the electric 
chair looks particularly so) , i think the pain is relatively short lived .  .

i replied to this query via e mail , but i think there are some 
issues that are worth discussing in public. 

mta wrote 
i am doing research on atheism , part of which involves field research here 
on the net. the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this 
group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief .  . 

i would recommend you to take a look at 

1) your dictionary 
2) alt.atheism faq files 

to notice that atheism is not a belief system , and what is common 
to all atheists is not a belief , but a lack of belief in deities . 
i cannot imagine how anyone could do research on atheism without 
paying careful attention to this issue. 

first of all , i 've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a 
variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail it 's possible to give 
succinct answers to most everything , but there 's enough here to keep most of 
you typing for hours , i'm sure. 

imho , this is a poor method to do any real survey , although i'm sure the 
replies might keep you amused for hours. 

also , i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system 
although i know some of you might contend that you do n't have any beliefs 
, but 
are skeptical towards everything. i understand but you know what i mean. 
think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather phrases 
required to get the precise idea across .  . 

no , i do not know what you mean. if you are surveying our individual 
philosophies , fine , but that 's not strictly atheism .  . atheism is not 
just another , godless version of the theistic explanations for life , 
the universe and everything. it is not a belief system , and it could 
hardly be called a philosophical system. 

once more atheism is characterised by lack of belief in deities .  . 
do not twist the meaning , or assume that we have some kind of 
philosophy we all agree on. 

some comments on your questions 

what contact with other atheists have you had before and after  ( and during ) 
your conversion to atheism  ( certainly your involvement with alt.atheism 
counts how have net discussions affected your beliefs ) 

i would also like to hear more about this. have we been able to  convert  
anyone 

are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational 
means  ( proofs of the non existence of god , etc) , or was it perhaps , at least 
in part , through other means  ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc) 

this question contains a contradiction in terms. beliefs 
cannot be acquired rationally if they could , they would not be 
beliefs ! you also seem to have rather strange ideas of how people become 
atheists those who are alienated from religion do not necessarily 
become atheists , they just think very little about religion. it seems 
it requires a considerable time of honest inquiry to find out that 
religions are actually intellectually dishonest virtual realities .  . 

those who have never had beliefs will certainly find this question 
quite odd how can lack of belief be acquired when did i acquire 
lack of belief in the easter bunny (i did believe in santa , though )) 

to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your 
beliefs what phenomena of the universe and of human existence  ( anything 
from physical phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human 
affairs ) do you feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where 
are they lacking as an explanatory method 

this question does not make any sense , since atheism does not deal with 
these issues it is not a worldview , or a philosophy , or a belief system. 

sigh , why have n't i seen a good , well thought survey in the usenet 
for three years .  .  .  . and what is the point of doing surveys in the net , 
anyway just to abstract some opinions

faith and dogma are dangerous. 

faith and dogma are inevitable .  . christians merely understand and admit 
to the fact. give me your proof that no god exists , or that he does. 
whichever position you take , you are forced to do it on faith. it does 
no good to say you take no position , for to show no interest in the 
existence of god is to assume he does not exist. 

absolutely not true. without religion either an established one or 
one you invent for yourself the theist and atheist are equally 
(not) interested in god , because without religious revelation there 
is no information about god available. strip away the dogma and 
the theists atheists are no different , simply holding a different 
opinion on a matter of little practical importance .  . 

i contend that proper implementation of the christian faith requires 
reasoning , but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you 
do n't like , or find uncomfortable .  . sexual behavior is 
condemned in the bible and no act of true reason will make it any 
less condemned .  . hatred , murder , gossip all these are condemned .  . 
is there god ordained murder in the bible you bet , and if god ever 
orders me to kill you , i will. but i will first use the gideon like 
behavior of verifying that god actually ordered the hit , and will 
probably discuss it in an abram like fashion. 

sorry , but that does n't help. what test will you apply to decide 
whether it is god or satan with whom you are speaking 
how will you know that you have not simply gone insane , or having 
delusions you are like a loaded gun. 

i can hear you now , this is how jim jones and david koresh justify 
their behavior. delusional religious cults bear the same relationship 

ah , you not as stupid as i assumed .  . ) 

when the southern baptist church or the church begin to do this 
then you have reason to blame mainstream religion for the behaviors of these 
people. or should i associate every negative behavior i witness in any 
non christian with you 

yes. we 're all in this together each human making up a small part of

i found this little gem , i do n't know if anyone has any interest comments .  .  .  . 




hi everyone , 
i'm a commited christian that is battling with a problem. i know 
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds , yet 
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless , saying  you fools , 
do you still think that just believing is enough ' 

now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves 
and not by god , according to romans that person is still saved by there faith. 
but then there is the bit which says that god preferes someone who is cold to 
him (i . e .  . does n't know him condemned ) so a lukewarm christian someone who 
knows and believes in god but does n't make any attempt to live by the bible .  . 

now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do) 
as taught in romans , but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james 
in conjunction with the lukewarm christian being  spat out  

can anyone help me , this really bothers me. 

in christ ,

most figures i have seen place the hit ratio close to 70 , which is 
still far higher than your 35 .

and what exactly are your sources we have all , i'm sure , seen 's

in light of what happened in waco , i need to get something of my 
chest. 

faith and dogma are dangerous. 

religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma , and 
for that reason , i scorn religion. 

i do n't necessarily disagree with your assertion , but i disagree with 
your reasoning .  .  ( faith bad. dogma bad. religion  ( faith  . 
religion  ( bad  . religion bad . ) . unfortunately , you never 
state why faith and dogma are dangerous. 

if you believe faith and dogma are dangerous because of what happened in 
waco , you are missing the point. 

the branch davidians made the mistake of confusing the message with the 
messenger .  . they believed koresh was a prophet , and therefore believed 
everything he said. the problem was n't the religion , it was the 
followers. they did n't die because of faith and dogma , they died because 
of their  ( or , in the case of the children , the of their 
 . 

i have expressed this notion in the past. some christians debated 
with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning .  . i claimed 
rationality is out of christianity by faith and dogma .  . 

so christians are totally irrational irrational with respect to their 
religion only what are you saying one 's belief in a christian god does 
not make one totally irrational .  . i think i know what you were getting at , 
but i 'd rather hear you expand on the subject. 


a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind , 
whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and dogma present 
in any religion. 

again , this statement is too general. a christian is perfectly capable of 
being a philosopher , and absolutely capable of changing his her mind. faith in 
god is a belief , and all beliefs may change. would you assert that atheists 
would make poor philosophers because they are predisposed to not believe in a 
god which , of course , may show unfair bias when studying , say , religion 




i claimed that a philosopher   is not a christian , 
but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those 
of christianity .  . consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison 
is not a prisoner , unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone 
in a prison .  . 
can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison 
can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian 
beliefs no , because if a person is free to go , he is not a prisoner .  . 
similarly , if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma , he is not 
a christian .  . 

so , christianity is a prison , eh ever heard of parole you have read far 
too much into this subject. a christian is one who follows the religion 
based on the teachings of a man named jesus christ .  . nowhere does this 
definition imply that one cannot change one 's mind. in prison , however , 
you ca n't just decide to leave. one is voluntary , the other is not. the 
two are not compatible .  . 


religion is like the gun that does n't kill anybody .  . religion encourages 
faith and dogma and although it does n't directly condemn people , 
it encourages the use of because   thinking. it is 
because   thinking that kills people. 

i prefer to think of religion as a water pistol filled with urine .  . 8 ) 
seriously , though , some  ( but certainly not all) religions do condemn 
groups of people. the common target is the infidel , a curious being 
who is alternately an atheist , a non insert specific religious 
affiliation here , a person of a different race , or an egyptian .  . 8 ) 

please explain how just because thinking kills people.  ( and please 
state more in your answer than waco .  . ) 


of course , not all humans are capable of thought , and we 'd still 
have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide .  .  . but . not as much. 
i'm willing to bet on that. 

i 'll see your conscientious and raise you a religious 
zealot with bad acne .  . 8 ) by the way , i was n't aware mass suicide 
was a problem. waco and jonestown were isolated incidents .  . 
mass suicides are far from common.

how many times did the cock crow 

mar 14 72 and the second time the cock crew. and peter called to mind the 
word that jesus said unto him , before the cock crow twice , thou shalt deny 
me thrice .  . and when he thought thereon , he wept .  . 

mat 26 74 then began he to curse and to swear , saying , i know not the man. 
and immediately the cock crew. 
mat 26 75 and peter remembered the word of jesus , which said unto him , 
before the cock crow , thou shalt deny me thrice .  . and he went out , and wept 
bitterly .  . 

22 60 and peter said , man , i know not what thou  . and immediately ,

joh 13 38 jesus answered him , wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake 
verily , 
verily , i say unto thee , the cock shall not crow , still thou hast denied me 
thrice .  . 

joh 18 27 peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew. 

destruction of cities  ( what said was jeremiah was zechariah ) 

 ( this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made ! 
not the only time he does this either .  .  . ) .

off , and mark includes mary and mary the mother of james the less. 
john says that jesus 's mother stood at the cross , along with her sister and 
mary magdalene .  .

saying , eli , eli , lama that is to say , my god , my god , why

thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus , he gave up the ghost .  .

finished and he his head , and gave up the ghost .  .

earthquake , and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour , that graves 
opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into , appearing to 
many  ( beating jesus to the  . mark and luke speak of darkness and 
the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints .  .

burial of jesus 

matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being 
stolen by the disciples , and for the tomb to be sealed .  . all of this was 
supposedly done , but the other gospels do not mention these precautions .  . 

how long was jesus in the tomb 
depends where you look matthew 12 40 gives jesus prophesying that he will 
spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth , and mark 10 34 
has after three days  ( meta emeras ) he will rise again . as far as i can 
see from a quick look , the prophecies have after three days , but the 
post resurrection narratives have on the third day . 

time of the resurection 

matthew says sunday at dawn , mark says the sun was rising , and john says it 
was dark. 

who was at the empty tomb is it 

mat 28 1 in the end of the sabbath , as it began to dawn toward the first 
day of the week , came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre .  . 

mar 16 1 and when the sabbath was past , mary magdalene , and mary the mother 
of james , and , had bought sweet spices , that they might come and 
anoint him. 

joh 20 1 the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early , when it 
was yet dark , unto the sepulchre , and the stone taken away from the 
sepulchre .  . 

whom did they see at the tomb 

mat 28 2 and , behold , there was a great earthquake for the angel of the 
lord descended from heaven , and came and rolled back the stone from the door , 
and sat upon it. 
mat 28 3 his countenance was like lightning , and his raiment white as 
snow mat 28 4 and for fear of him the keepers did shake , and became as 
dead men. mat 28 5 and the angel answered and said unto the women , fear 
not ye for i know that ye seek jesus , which was crucified .  . 

mar 16 5 and entering into the sepulchre , they saw a young man sitting on 
the right side , clothed in a long white garment and they were  . 

24 4 and it came to pass , as they were much perplexed , 
behold , two men stood by them in shining garments 

joh 20 12 and two angels in white sitting , the one at the head , and 
the other at the feet , where the body of jesus had  . 

belief that the disciples stole jesus 's body 

matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story , but no other gospel makes 
this claim .  . 

appearences of the risen jesus 

matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two and that jesus also told 
them , to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee .  . the disciples then went 
to a mountain previously agreed , and met jesus there. this was his only 
appearance , except to the women at the tomb .  . matthew only devotes five verses 
to the visit with the disciples .  . 

mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country , and that 
they told the rest of the disciples , who refused to believe. later he 
appeared to the 11 disciples at  . 

luke says two followers went , the same day that jesus rose from the dead , to 
emmaus , a village eight miles from , and there jesus them but 
was  . while they ate a meal together that evening , they finally 
recognised jesus , he dissapeared .  . returning at once to , 
they told the 
disciples of their experience , and suddenly jesus appeared among them , 
frightening them , as they thought he was a spirit. jesus then ate some fish 
and honey and then preached to them. 

john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he , in 
, where they were hiding .  . he breathed the holy ghost them , but 
thomas was not present and refused to believe. eight days later jesus joined 
the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas .  . once 
more jesus made an 
appearance to the disciples at the sea of but again was not 
recognised .  . 
after telling them to cast their the other side of the boat , jesus 
becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them. they all eat 
together and converse .  . 

the book of acts further adds to the confusion. it says that jesus showed 
himself to the apostles for a period of 40 days after his resurection  ( thus 
contradicting matthew , mark , luke and john ) and spoke to them of things 
pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things , while 
they , he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight. 
and while they looked toward heaven as he went up , two men stood 
by them in white apparel which also said , ye men of galilee , why stand ye

as you can see , there are a number of contradictions in the account of the 
trial , and resurection of jesus .  . if these are good witnesses , 
you would think that they could get some of these important details right ! 
 ( in fact , i cannot find very many points on where they agree. you would think 
that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly 
observing ! ) because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error , 
the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth. 
 ( due to the nature of the story , i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of 
truth . ) .

faith and dogma are irrational .  . the faith and dogma part of any religion 
are responsible for the irrationality of the individuals .  . 

i disagree. in the end , the individual is responsible for his her own 
irrationality .  . the individual 's belief in some dogmatic religion is a 
symptom of that irrationality .  . 

have you noticed that philosophers tend to be atheists 

atheists and agnostics , i would imagine , but yes , that was my point. an 
atheist would theoretically be just as ill equipped to study the philosophy 
of religion as a christian , and yet there is a persistence of atheists 
among the ranks of philosophers .  . therefore , the conflict between one 's 
religious beliefs  ( or lack thereof) and the ability to be a philosopher 
must not be as great as you assert .  . the fact that most philosophers may 
be non religious was a secondary point. 


science ,  ( as would be practiced by atheists ) in contrast , has a 
built in defence against faith and dogma .  . 

as opposed to science practiced by theists be careful here. 

science does have a built in defence against faith and dogma 
skepticism .  . unfortunately , it is not foolproof .  . there is that 
wonderful little creature known as the theory. many of us believe in 
the theory of evolution .  . we have no absolute proof that this 
theory is true , so why do we believe it because it makes more 
sense than .  .  .  . there is quite a bit of faith involved here. 


a scientist holds sacred the idea that beliefs should change to 
suit whatever is the best information available at the time , and , 
and , and , a scientist understands that any current beliefs 
are deficient in some way. 

well , not all current beliefs are deficient , but basically i agree. 


can you see the difference science views beliefs as being flawed , 
and new information can be obtained to improve them. 

ideally , this is true. in reality , though , you have to acknowledge 
that scientists are human. scientists have egos and biases .  . some 
scientists assume a particular theory is true , refuse to admit the 
flaws in that theory because of ego problems or whatever , and proceed 
to spend their time and money trying to come up with absolute proof 
for the theory. remember cold fusion 


by the way , i was n't aware mass suicide 
was a problem. waco and jonestown were isolated incidents .  . 
mass suicides are far from common. 

clinton and the fbi would love for you to convince them of this. 
it would save the us taxpayer a lot of money if you could. 

not really. i agree that we spent far too much money on the waco 
crisis ( 7 , 500 , 000 i believe) , especially considering the outcome .  . 
my point was that mass suicides in the u.s. are rare  ( jonestown was 
in , incidentally , although we footed the bill for the clean up) , 
and the u.s. has far more important issues to address. compare the 
number of u.s. citizens who have died in mass suicides with , say , the 
number of u.s. soldiers who died during one week of the vietnam war and 
you will see my point.

in article  ( bill conner ) writes 
jim perry wrote 

some stuff about biblical morality , though bill 's quote of me had little 
to do with what he goes on to say 

bill , 

i'm sorry to have been busy lately and only just be getting around to 
this. 

apparently you have some fundamental confusions about atheism i think 
many of these are well addressed in the famous faq .  . your 
are then misplaced atheism need n't imply materialism , or the lack 
of an absolute moral system. however , i do tend to materialism and 
do n't believe in absolute morality , so i 'll answer your questions. 

how then can an atheist judge value 

an atheist judges value in the same way that a theist does according 
to a personal understanding of morality .  . that i do n't believe in an 
absolute one does n't mean that i do n't have one. i'm just explicit , 
as in the line of postings you followed up , that when i express 
judgment on a moral issue i am basing my judgment on my own code 
rather than claiming that it is in some absolute sense good or bad. 
my moral code is not particular different from that of others around 
me , be they christians , muslims , or atheists .  . so when i say that i 
object to genocide , i'm not expressing anything particularly out of 
line with what my society holds .  . 

if your were to ask why i think morality exists and has the form it 
does , my answer would be mechanistic to your taste that a moral 
code is a prerequisite for a functioning society , and that humanity 
probably evolved morality as we know it as part of the evolution of 
our ability to exist in large societies , thereby achieving 
considerable survival advantages .  . you 'd probably say that god just 
made the rules. neither of us can convince the other , but we share a 
common understanding about many moral issues. you think you get it 
from your religion , i think i get it  ( and you get it) from early 
childhood teaching .  . 

that you do n't like what god told people to do says nothing about god 
or god 's commands , it says only that there was an electrical event in your 
nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled 
with a pre existing thought set to form that reaction. 

i think you 've been reading the wrong sort of comic books , but in 
prying through the i basically agree with what you 're 
saying. i do believe that my mental reactions to stimuli such as god 
commanded the genocide of the canaanites is mechanistic , but of 
course i think that 's true of you as well. my reaction has little to 
do with whether god exists or even with whether i think he does , but 
if a god existed who commanded genocide , i could not consider him 
good , which is supposedly an attribute of god. 

all of this being so , you have excluded 
yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , 
etc. and cannot participate .  . your opinion about the bible can have no 
weight whatsoever. 

hmm .  . yes , i think some heavy faq reading would do you some good. i 
have as much place discussing values etc. as any other person. in 
fact , i can actually accomplish something in such a discussion , by 
framing the questions in terms of reason for instance , it is clear 
that in an environment where neighboring tribes periodically attempt 
to wipe each other out based on imagined divine commands , then the 
quality of life will be generally poor , so a system that fosters 
coexistence is superior , if quality of life is an agreed goal. an 
absolutist , on the other hand , can only thump those portions of a 
bible they happen to agree with , and say this is good , even if the 
act in question is unequivocally bad by the standards of everyone in 
the discussion. the attempt to define someone or a group of people as 
excluded from discussion , such that they cannot participate , and 
their opinions given no weight whatsoever is the lowest form or 
reasoning  ( ad hominem poisoning the well) , and presumably the resort 
of someone who ca n't rationally defend their own ideas of right , 
wrong , and the bible .  .

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes .  . irrational 
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism .  . 

 ( deletion ) 

theism is correlated with fanaticism .  . i have neither said that all fanatism 
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism .  . the point is , 
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic .  . one could of course 
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism  ( for example) , but i just 
have to at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology 
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it. 

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your 
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered .  . 

bogus .  . i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism .  . 
the point is that theism is a factor. 

that 's your claim now back it up. i consider your argument as useful 
as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism .  . therefore 
belief is a factor in fanaticism .  . true , and utterly useless.  ( note , this 
is any belief , not belief in gods ) 


tiring to say the least. i have backed it up , read the first statement. 

i have read it. conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point. 


the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy .  . saying someone believes 
something is hardly an information about the person at all. saying someone 
is a theist holds much more information. further , the correlation between 
theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism 
because of the special features of theistic belief .  . 

truth by blatant assertion .  . evidence 


, 
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more 
reliable indicators .  . and the really dangerous people the sources of 
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical 
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing. 

that 's a claim you have to support. please note that especially in the 
field of theism , the leaders believe what they say. 

if you believe that , you 're incredibly naive .  . 


you , frank o'dwyer , are living in a dream world. i wonder if there is any 
base of discussion left after such a statement. as a matter of fact , i think 
you are ignorant of human nature. even when one starts with something one does 
not believe , one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says. 

to give you the benefit of the doubt , prove your statement. 

the onus of proof is on you ,  . what makes you think that 
theist leaders believe what they say especially when they say 
one thing and do another , or say one thing closely followed by its 
opposite the practice is not restricted to theism , but it 's there 
for anyone to see. it 's almost an epidemic in this country. 

just for instance , if it is harder for a camel to pass thru  the eye 
of a needle , why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner why 
are there churches to the square inch in my country 

now , some 
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism , 
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned 
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction 
of religious freedom .  . ever read animal farm 

that 's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to 
repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to 
fanatism , and not all fanatism is caused by theism .  . the point is , 
there is a correlation , and it comes from innate features of theism .  . 

no , some of it comes from features which some theism has in common 
with some fanaticism .  . your last statement simply is n't implied by 
what you say before , because you 're trying to sneak in innate features 
of all theism . the word you 're groping for is some . 


bogus again. not all theism as is is fanatic .  . however , the rest already 
gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and 
theism .  . and further , the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them 
to switch to fanatism easily. it takes just a nifty improvement in the 
theology .  . 

truth by blatant assertion .  . 


, by the way , is one of them. 

no shit , sherlock .  . so why not talk about instead of theism , 
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have , as opposed 
to the case you are trying to make 


because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people 
causing the correlation .  . and the whole discussion started that way by the 
statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism , which you 
challenged .  . 

indeed i did. as i recall , i asked for evidence. what is the correlation 
of which you speak 


and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw 
men. interesting that you have nothing better to offer. 

i said it reads like a warm up to that. that 's because it 's an irrational 
and bogus tirade , and has no other use than creating a nice them us 
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either 
side of church walls. 


blah blah blah .  . i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights 
protects me better from fanatics than the other way round. 

of course , other people are always fanatics , never oneself .  . your 
wish to all theists seems pretty fanatical to me. 

it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between 
that argument and the rise of fanatism .  . so far , it is just another of your 
assertions .  . 

so you can do it. 


(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that 
reason is always useful 


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has 
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate .  . one point is that 
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does 
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information. 

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful 
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would 
be irrational .  . which is it 

that 's bogus .  . self reference is not circular .  . and since the evaluation of 
usefulness is possible within rational systems , it is allowed. 

o.k. , it 's oval .  . it 's still begging the question , however. and though 
that certainly is allowed , it 's not rational .  . and you claiming to be 
rational and all. 


another of your assertions .  . no proof , no evidence , just claims .  . 

hey i learned it from you. did i do good 


at the risk of repeating myself , and hearing we had that before we 
did n't hear a refutation before , so we 're back. deal with it 
you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful. someone 
who thinks reason is crap wo n't buy it , you see. 


that is unusually weak even for you. the latter implies that my proof 
depends on their opinion. somehow who does not accept that there are 
triangles wo n't accept pythagoras .  . wow , that 's an incredible insight .  . 
i do n't have to prove them wrong in their opinion. it is possible to 
show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims 
unreliable or even absurd statements to be information. 

totally circular , and totally useless. 

their wish to believe makes them believe. things are judges by their appeal , 
and not by their information. it makes you feel good when you believe that 
may be good for them , but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls .  . from 
belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt .  . 

truth by blatant assertion .  . i 've seen as many bogus proofs of the 
non existence of gods as i have of their existence .  . 


rational systems , by the way , does not mean that every data has to come from 
logical analysis , the point is that the evaluation of the data does not 
contradict logic .  . it easily follows that such a system does not allows to 
evaluate if its rational in itself. yes , it is possible to evaluate that 
it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that 
system , but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon , that has as 
little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes .  . 

this just does n't parse , sorry. 

so far it just a matter of consistency .  . i use arguments to show 
that my system is consistent or that theirs is n't .  . the evaluation of the 

nor this. 
predictions does not need rationality .  . it does not contradict , however. 


your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics 
and mathematics are therfore circular .  . 

anybody else think godel was silly 


stream of consciousness typing what is that supposed to mean 


the first part of the second statement contains no information , because 
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism 
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the 
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an 
datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is 
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is 
used to obtain it. 


i 've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions 
of god here. 

an datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here 
is a an often refuted fallacy .  . have a look at the discussion of the 
axiom of choice. and further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems 
out of which they are usually derived .  . i exist is derived , if you want 
it that way. 

further , one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms .  . 

what is it you are trying to say 

that at some point , people always wind up saying this datum is reliable 
for no particular reason at all. example i am not dreaming . 


nope .  . there is evidence for it. the trick is that the choice of an 
basis of a system is difficult , because the possibilities are interwoven .  . 
one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions 
that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway. 

i 'd like to see this alleged evidence. 

one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method 
for usefulness , the foundation is laid by how one feels at all  ( that 's not 
how one feels about it) .  . 

i see. you have no irrational beliefs .  . but then , fanatics never do , do 
they 


compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of 
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but  . 

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism to 
say that all theism is necessarily requires a proof which 
i suspect you do not have. 


using the traditonal definition of gods .  . personal , supernatural entities 
with objective effects on this world. usually connected to morals and or 
the way the world works. 

imo , any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational .  . that does 
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of 
intelligence .  . some atheists are also scientists , for example. 


they do n't use theism when doing science. or it would n't be science. please 
note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well. 
they just prohibit formulating them as objective statements .  . 

ergo , nothing is objective .  . fair enough. 


the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe 
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis .  . however , the beliefs say they are 
more than a work hypothesis .  . 

i do n't understand this. can you your argument 

person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice. that does not make 
b true , it is at best a work hypothesis .  . however , the content of b is that 
it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis .  . testing or evaluating 
evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b  ( already believed ) 
says it is wrong a waste of time not possible. depending on the further 
contents of b idolaters protestants are to be killed , this can 
have interesting effects. 

peculiar definition of interesting , but sure. now show that a belief 
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak. why are n't my 
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants , for example maybe they 
do n't believe in it. maybe it 's the conjunction of b asserts b and 
jail kill that is important , and the belief in gods is 
entirely irrelevant .  . it certainly seems so to me , but then i have no 
axe to grind here. 


the example with your neighbours is a fallacy .  . that your neighbours do n't 
says little about others. and there were times when exactly that happened. 

nope , it 's not a fallacy .  . it just does n't go to the correlation you 
wish to see. 

and tell me , when it is not irrelevant , why are such statements about 
and idolaters in the holy books please note that one could 
edit them out when they are not relevant anymore. because gods do n't err 
what does that say about that message 

excuse me the holy books 

and how come we had theists saying ordered by god are ok. a god 
is the easiest way to excuse anything , and therefore highly attracting to 
fanatics .  . not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can 
have on the rest of the believers .  . happens again and again and again. 

a god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything , nor the only way.

was when the missile cleared the launching tube with no damage or that a 
successful interception of a scud was defined as the patriot and scud 
passed each other in the same area of the sky 

and of the 7 that was the smart stuff , 35 hit. again try to follow me 
here that means 65 of this smart arsenal missed. 

the stories 
of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk .  . 

prove it. i have a source that says that to date , the civilian death count 
 ( er , excuse me , i mean collateral damage ) is about 200 , 000 .  . 

s 

no one has attempted to calculate the costs of an execution in 
washington state , but studies elsewhere suggest it costs far more than 
incarceration .  . 
california is spending more than 90 million annually on capital cases , 
and until this year had n't executed anyone since 1972 .  . texas , the national 
leader in the number of executions , spends an estimated 2.3 million per 
execution .  . that compares to an average cost of incarceration in washington 
state of 25 , 000 per maximum security prisoner per year.

now , i do not believe in blindly following anyone , no matter 
how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law. if someone tells me 
islam says such and such , i immediately say show me the support for 
this statement from the qur'an and sunnah . i believe this to be my 
islamic duty , for according to one hadith of the prophet  ( peace and 
blessings of god be with him) , if your leader tells you to enter a fire , 
and you do it  ( and kill yourself) , then you have sinned for doing 
wrong , even though you 
were blindly following the instructions of your leader. i am 
responsible for my own actions , not abu , or imam malik , etc. , 
even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu etc. 

with this in mind , to my understanding , we must look at the reasoning 
behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeini 's fatwa .  . now , to 
my understanding , the hadith upon which those who support khomeini 's 
fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war 
time. now , brother , in general , it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say 
that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of 
peace. i think any sensible human being can see this , so i personally 
think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty , 
for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace 
regarding this particular subject. 

if you think i am wrong , please feel free to say so , with your 
reasoning from qur'an and hadith , please. not because somebody said 
so , i want the reasoning from al qur'an and the hadiths .  . 

perhaps we should take our discussion to soc . religion . islam .  . please 
email me , rashid , if you think we should do this. 

by the way , i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment 
for apostasy .  . the viewpoint i follow that there is in general no 
punishment for apostasy is very strongly supported by qur'an and 
hadith .  . this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law 
by mohamed s. el  ( american trust publications , 1981) .  . 


i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little 
justification for the punishment of apostasy in the qur'an .  . 
in islamic history , as well , apostasy has rarely been punished .  . 
belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there 
is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief , apostates have 
been generally left to believe or not believe as they will. 

however , when an apostate makes attacks upon god and 
his messenger the situation changes. now the charge of 
apostasy may be complicated with other charges perhaps 
charges of , treason , spying , etc. if the person 
makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public 
attacks  ( as opposed to arguement ) against islam , the 
situation is likewise complicated. if the person spreads 
slander or broadcasts falsehoods , again the situation 
changes. the punishments vary according to the situation 
the apostate is in. anyhow , the charge of aggravated 
apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie 's case. 

there is a distinction in the qur'an between a formal war situation 
and being in the situation where someone unilaterally 
wages war (by their actions) , creates disorder , makes mischief , etc. 
against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm 
to muslims .  . here , a small group or even a single individual could 
be said to be engaged in such a practise .  . in other words , there is 
a clear difference between a formal war situation (where two 
clearly defined parties wage war , conclude treaties , exchange 
prisoners , etc . ) . , and dealing with attacks that come from isolated 
individuals or groups against islam .  . it is the second situation , 
the unilateral attack and the spreading of that 
would apply in the case of rushdie .  . 

the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an 
offensive book  ( banning the book is secondary ) 
a full set of circumstances following the publication of 
the book come into play as well , including the deaths of many 
muslims , and rushdie 's  ( and his publishers ) media games. 


now , i do not believe in blindly following anyone , no matter 
how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law. if someone tells me 
islam says such and such , i immediately say show me the support for 
this statement from the qur'an and sunnah . i believe this to be my 
islamic duty , for according to one hadith of the prophet  ( peace and 
blessings of god be with him) , if your leader tells you to enter a fire ,

wrong , even though you 
were blindly following the instructions of your leader. i am 
responsible for my own actions , not abu , or imam malik , etc. , 
even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu etc. 

now , to 
my understanding , the hadith upon which those who support khomeini 's 
fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war 
time. now , brother , in general , it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say 
that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of 
peace. i think any sensible human being can see this , so i personally 
think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty , 
for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace 
regarding this particular subject. 

i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above. i believe 
that one of the verses on which the fatwa is based is 5 33 .  . 
every verse in the qur'an has a corresponding circumstance of 
revelation but in no way is the understanding (the tafsir ) of the 
verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance 
in which it was revealed .  . if this was the case then we could say 
that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the 
muslims were not involved in conflict , should be suspended when 
they were at war. the logic does not follow. in complex , real life 
situations , there may be many verses and many hadiths which can 
all be related to a single , complicated situation. the internal 
relationships between these verses may be quite complex , such that 
arriving at an understanding of how the verses and how 
each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task. 
it is not necessarily a simple this or that process. there may 
be many parameters involved , there may be a larger context in 
which a particular situation should be viewed .  . all these matters 
impinge on the situation. 

in other words there is a great deal involved in the qur'an .  . 
the qur'an asks us to reflect on its verses , but this reflection must 
entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith .  . 
if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal , then each 
person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that. 
however , if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to 
the 
state , to the gestation of laws and rulings , to the gestation of society , 
the dispensing of justice , the guidance of the community , then there 
are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one 
should achieve .  . muhammad as s . ) . relates some of 
these requirements , as taught by the prophet(s . a . ) . , in a hadith 

 .  .  . he . who does not distinguish in the book of allah the 
verse from the one , and a specific one from a general one , 
and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between 
a permission and an obligation , and does not recognize a verse of 
period from a one , and does not know the circumstances 
of revelation , and does not understand the technical words of 
the qur'an  ( whether simple or compound ) and does not comprehend the 
knowledge of decree and measure , and is ignorant of advancing and 
delaying  ( in its verses ) and does not distinguish the clear from 
the deep , nor the manifest from the esoteric , nor the beginning 
from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer , 
the and the joining , and the exceptions and the all inclusive , 
and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the 
subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the 
detailed one , the obligatory laws and the permissions , the places of the 
duties and rules , and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and 
does not know the joined words , and the words that are related to those 
coming before them , or after them then such a man does not know 
the qur'an nor is he among the people of the qur'an .  .  .  .  . . 

based on these and other hadiths , and in accordance with many 
verses ( why should not a company from every group remain behind 
to gain profound understanding  ( tafaqquh ) in religion and to warn 
people when they return to them , so that they may beware .  . (9 122 ) , 
a science of jurisprudence arose .  . the requirements 
for a person to be considered a  ( one who can pronounce on 
matters of law and religion ) are many. i 've listed a few major 
divisions below there are , of course , many subdivisions within these 
headings .  . 

knowledge of arabic  ( syntax , conjugation , roots , semantics ,  . 
knowledge of and principles of  . 
logic  ( mantiq ) 
a knowledge of hadiths 
a knowledge of transmitters  ( rijal ) 
knowledge of the principles of  ( qur'an , sunnah , consensus , 
reasoning ) 

the study of qur'an and sunnah for purposes of law involves 
discussion of  ( awamir ) 
discussion of negative  ( nawahi ) 
discussion of generalities and  ( aam wa khas ) 
discussion of unconditional and conditional 
discussion of tacit meanings 
discussion of the abstract and the clear 
discussion of the and the 

the principles of application of the law involves 
principles of exemption 
principles of precaution 
principles of option 
principles of 

the is bound to go through a very rigorous process 
in pronouncing judgement on a given situation. it is not a matter 
of looking at one verse and one hadith .  . 

now no one should blindly follow anyone , but there is a difference 
between blind following and to the opinion of someone who is 
clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself .  . there is the 
famous hadith of the prophet (s . a . ) . in which he says 
the  ( religious scholars ) are the of the prophet , as 
long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires , pleasures , 
and wealth of this world. the prophet (s . a . ) . was asked o messenger 
of god ! how may we know if they so concern themselves he (s . a . ) . replied 
by seeing whether they follow the ruling power. if they do that , fear for 
your religion and shun them. i do not yet know enough about the imams 
of the four sunni to comment on how this hadith applies 
to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them. 

the prophet also refered to the as the fortress of islam . my only 
point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into 
play a certain amount of expertise the specifics of this expertise is 
delineated in the qur'an and hadith .  . those who acquire this expertise 
are praised in both the qur'an and hadith those who without the requisite 
knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society , state , and religion 
are cautioned .  . 

the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this 
group , is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa  ( that is , 
apostasy ) , was wrong. when one discusses something they should at least 
base their discussion on fact. secondly , khomeini was condemned as a 
heretic 
because he supposedly claimed to be infallible another instance of 
creating a straw man and then beating him. 

perhaps we should take our discussion to soc . religion . islam .  . please 
email me , rashid , if you think we should do this. 

i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup .  . 
unfortunately , 
i do not have any access to email , so private discussion or a moderated 
group 
is out of the question (i cannot post to a moderated group like 
soc . religion . islam .  . how about soc . culture . arabic . or talk . religion . misc .

yet i am still not a believer .  . is god not concerned with my 
disposition why is it beneath him to provide me with the 
evidence i would require to believe the evidence that my 
personality , given to me by this god , would find compelling 

the fact is god could cause you to believe anything he wants you to. 
but think about it for a minute. would you rather have someone love 
you because you made them love you , or because they wanted to 
love you. 

first , i do n't expect them to love me if they do n't even know i 
exist. secondly , i would n't expect them to love me simply because 
they were my creator .  . i would expect to have to earn that love. 

the responsibility is on you to love god and take a step toward 
him. he promises to be there for you , but you have to look for yourself. 

are you daft how do i love something i do n't believe exists 
come back when you 've learned to love your third  . 

those who doubt this or dispute it have not it a sincere effort. 
simple logic arguments are folly .  . if you read the bible you will see 
that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic . 
our ability to reason is just a spec of creation. yet some think it is 
the ultimate .  . if you rely simply on your reason then you will never 
know more than you do now. to learn you must accept that which 
you do n't know. 

at which point you have stepped over the line and become a 
complete asshole. even though it 's your first offense , i wo n't 
let it slip becuase i 've heard it too goddamned many times. 

you love jesus because deep in your heart you 're a cannibalistic 
 . because i say so , and i'm much more qualified to 
assess your motivations than you are. 

fortunately , there are some things i get to accept on evidence 
rather than faith. one of them being that until christians like 
yourself quit being so fucking arrogant , there will never be 
peace. you 've all made sure of that.

in article ,  ( todd kelley ) writes 
in light of what happened in waco , i need to get something of my 
chest. 

sadly understandable .  .  .  . 


faith and dogma are dangerous. 

yes. 


religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma , and 
for that reason , i scorn religion. 

to be fair , you should really qualify this as semitic western religions , but 
you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway. 

i have expressed this notion in the past. some christians debated 
with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning .  . i claimed 
rationality is out of christianity by faith and dogma .  . 

again , this should really be evaluated at a personal level. for example , there 
was only one jesus  ( presumably ) , and he probably did n't say all that many 
things , and yet  ( seemingly ) billions and billions of christian sects have 
arisen .  . perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and 
believes in christ as in pantheism .  . it would seem to go against the bible , but 
it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal 
interpretation . 

a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind , 
whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and dogma present 
in any religion. 

this is a good point. we have here the christian he sets up a 
system of values beliefs for himself , which work very well , and every 
event experience is understandable and within the framework of this 
system. however , we also have an individual who has the inability (at least 
not without some difficulty ) to change , which is important , because the problem 
with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to 
the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system 
without destroying whatever faith is invested therein , unless of course , all 
the tests fail. in other words , the way would be to test and evaluate 
moralities without the bias responsibility of losing retaining a system. 


i claimed that a philosopher   is not a christian , 
but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those 
of christianity .  . consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison 
is not a prisoner , unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone 
in a prison .  . 
can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison 
can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian 
beliefs no , because if a person is free to go , he is not a prisoner .  . 
similarly , if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma , he is not 
a christian .  . 

interesting , but again , when it seems to basically boil down to individual 
nuances  ( although not always , i will admit , and probably it is the 
mass oriented divisions which are the most appalling ) , it becomes irrelevant , 
unfortunately. 


i admit it 's a word game. 
i'm going by the dictionary definition of religion 
n. 1. concern over what exists beyond the visible world , 
differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith 
or intuition rather than reason ,  .  .  . '' . 
webster 's 

now let 's go beyond the word game. i do n't claim that religion 
causes genocide .  . i think that if all humans were atheist , there 
would still be genocide .  . there will always be humans who do n't think. 
there will always be humans who do n't ask themselves what is 
the real difference between themselves and people with different 
colored skin , or a different language , or different beliefs .  . 


granted 

religion is like the gun that does n't kill anybody .  . religion encourages 
faith and dogma and although it does n't directly condemn people , 
it encourages the use of because   thinking. it is 
because   thinking that kills people. 


in which case the people become the bullets , and the religion , as the gun , 
merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves , if i 
may be so bold as to extend your 

sure , religion has many good qualities .  . it encourages benevolence 
and  . ok , so take out only the bad things like faith , 
dogma , and tradition .  . put in the good things , like careful reasoning , 
and science. the result is secular humanism .  . would n't it 
be nice if everyone were a secular humanist to please the 
, you might even leave god in there , but the secular 
emphasis would cause the to start thinking , and 
they too would realize that a belief in a god really does n't put 
anyone further ahead in understanding the universe  ( ok , i'm just 
poking fun at the ) .  . 

also understandable .  .  .  . ) 


of course , not all humans are capable of thought , and we 'd still 
have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide .  .  . but . not as much. 
i'm willing to bet on that.

i do n't have to make outrageous claims about religion 's affecting and 
effecting history , for the of a.a , all i have to do point out 
that many claims made here are wrong and do nothing to validate 
atheism .  . 

bill , you seem to have erroneously assumed that this board has as its 
sole purpose the validation of atheism .  . it does n't .  . this board is 
used to discuss atheism as a philosophy , to share posters  experiences 
regarding atheism , to debunk various and theism as a whole , to 
share resources relating to atheism , and even to with others 
with similar views. and of course with the number of theists who come 
here to preach , it is also used to argue the case for atheism .  . 


at no time have i made any statement that religion was the 
sole cause of anything , what i have done is point out that those who 
do make that kind of claim are mistaken , usually deliberately .  . 

if you want to accuse people of lying , please do so directly .  . the 
phrase deliberately mistaken is rather oxymoronic .  . 


to credit religion with the awesome power to dominate history is to 
misunderstand human nature , the function of religion and of course , 
history. i believe that those who distort history in this way know 
exaclty what they 're doing , and do it only for affect .  . 

the two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are 
christianity and islam .  . both of these claim to make their followers 
into good people , and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been 
accomplished through their faiths .  . imho they are right. the american 
friends service committee  ( quaker ) , catholic relief services , bread 
for the world , salvation army soup kitchens , and mother theresa spring 
to mind.  ( can someone with more knowledge of islam supply the names 
of some analagous islamic groups ) 

when mother theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her 
christianity , i believe her. her form of theism to her deity 
such a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care 
for those in need. the point is that such a philosophy does have the 
power to change the behavior of individuals if it is widespread 
enough , it can change societies .  . 

the same works for the horrors of history. to claim that christianity 
had little to do with the crusades or the inquisition is to deny the 
awesome power that comes from faith in an absolute .  . what it seems you 
are doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never 
the solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that 
religion has had no evil impacts on history. that is absurd .  .

agreed. 

a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change 
his mind , whereas a christian cannot , due to the nature of faith and 
dogma present in any religion. 

it is hard for me to understand , but quite a few professional scientists

deletia in case anybody had n't noticed , frank and i are debating 
objective morality , and seemingly hitting semantics .  . 

secondly , how can i refute your definition i can only point up its 
logical implications , and say that they seem to contradict the usage 
of the word objective in other areas. indeed , by your definition , an 
objective x is an oxymoron , for all x. i have no quibble with that 
belief , other than that it is useless , and that objective is a perfectly 
good word. 

it may be that , being a non native english speaker , i 've 
misunderstood your usage of objective , and tried to debate something 
you do n't assert my apologies .  . i'm at a loss to imagine what you really 
do mean , though. 

how many ages can the universe have , and still be internally self 
consistent i 'd be amazed if it was more than one. how many different 
moral systems can different members of society have indeed , single 
individuals , in some cases and humanity still stick together 

begging the question. people can have many opinions about the age 
of the universe and humanity can still stick together. you are 
saying that the universe has a real age , independent of my beliefs about 
it. why 

wrong point. the age of the universe has no direct effect on 
humanity 's sticking power , in the way the moral system of a society can 
have. 

i'm saying the universe has a real age , because i see evidence 
for it cosmology , astronomy and so on. i say this age is independent of 
people 's opinions of it , because i know different people have a lot of 
different opinions in the matter , yet empirical tests consistently seem 
to give roughly the same results. 

the age of the universe , like most scientific facts , can be 
verified through means that 'll give the same result no matter 
who performs the testing  ( albeit there are error bars that may be on the 
side .  .  . ) .  . 

this assumes that the universe has a real age , or any kind of reality 
which does n't depend on what we think. 

i ca n't see how it does that. put a creationist to the task of 
performing the tests and calculations , see to it  ( s)he ) makes no blatant 
errors in measuring or calculating , and the result of the test will be 
the same. 

why should an extreme biblical 
creationist give a rat 's ass about the means of which you speak 

because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their 
opinion. if those tests were just my opinion , then their own tests 
(which would then be their opinion) would contradict mine , even if we 
conducted said tests in identical manner , no they do n't , which i take 
as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them. 

i 've heard of no way to verify morality in a 
consistent way , much less compute the errors of the measurement care to 
enlighten me 

the same is true of pain , but exist , and can be predicted 
to work with some accuracy better than a random guess. 

map the activity of nerves and neural activity , if you mean 
physical pain. you have a sharp point , i 'll give you that but you still 
have n't given me a way to quantify morality .  . 

i wrote 
elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value. 

we agree. hypotheses , however , can change i hold that there is no 
ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could 
, but that they could be changed in any way imaginable , 
producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes. 

if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if .  .  .  . , 
that can be tested , 

better and worse are  ( almost ) always defined in the context 
of a moral system. your prediction will always be correct , within 
that moral system . what you need now is an objective definition of 
good and bad i wish you luck. 

people 's ideas about the age of object x are not objective 
you can have any idea you like , and i ca n't stop you. and 
their ages is another ballgame they are what they are , and if you 
dislike some detail of them , that 's a problem with your opinion of 
them. 

sure. assume an objective reality , and you get statements like this. 

is n't that what you 're doing , when assuming an objectively 
real morality besides , what exactly is provably wrong with my 
statement 

i claim that morality is an opinion of ours , and as such 
subjective and individual .  . if i'm wrong , then some more or less 
objectively real thing exists , which you label objective morality 
can you back up this positive claim of existence 

can you back up your positive claim above no. that 's because it 's an 
assumption .  . i make the same assumption about values , on the basis 
that there is no logical difference between the two , and the empirical 
basis of the two is precisely the same. 

claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive 
claim besides , i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder 
different individuals , both fully functional as human beings and members 
of society , but yet with wildly different moral codes .  . if morality was 
objective , at least one should be way off base , but yet 
 incorrect  morality seems to function fine. how come 

as for producing these individuals , it might be easiest to pick 
them from different societies say , an islamic one and some polynesian 
system , for example  ( if such still exist) .  . 

deletia testing for on desks 

now take a look at morality .  . see anything if so , please inform me 
which way to look , and why to look that particular way , as opposed to 
some other. get my drift 

no. just look. are you claiming never to know what good means 

one thing is good under some circumstances , because we wish to 
achieve some goal , for some reason. other times we wish to do something 
else , and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all. 

some things are hard to make good , because we 'd seldom if ever 
wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into. still , 
the aztecs were doing fine until the wiped them out. 

i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why. 
i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone , immutable .  . 

... 
that 's a  ( simple ) matter of proving the track record of the 
scientific method. 

i think it 's great , and should be applied to values .  . i may be completely 
wrong , but that 's what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of 
thought. 

yes , me too , and i 've tried a thing or two down that line it 
does n't look good for objective values to me at all.

in article  ( rob strom ) writes 
i was making two separate points , both of which attack 
face value bible interpretation 

(1) to judge the bible 's value today , you judge it based on 
the way it is used today. that is , what do commentators 
actually say , what do rabbis teach , etc. 

i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have 
been referring to one problem with a highly interpreted tradition 
like this is what happens when a schism occurs , and over time certain 
large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor 
exactly a face value interpretation .  .  .  . 

(2) to judge the bible 's value when originally written , 
you (a) read it in the context of its time (not 
with today 's assumptions ) , and (b) compare it to 
the practices of surrounding people. 

while the context of the time is important , value judgments must 
ultimately be according to current understanding , or at least to some 
base standard  ( relative stability success of a society , e . g . ) .  . this 
is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people , 
for instance according to the bible , the surrounding people were 
immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits .  . we need to look 
rather at what those peoples were really like. for instance , in 
what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is 
symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of 
whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue by the 
bible 's own terms idolatry is inherently evil , but i see no evidence 
that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time 
were particularly bad people , relative to the people in the bible .  . 

 .  .  . scissors . and cloth .  .  .  . now in the past , our ancestors 
did cut cloth with scissors , but they at least knew that 
their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth , 
so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from 
their earlier barbarism , and made the transition to 
modern civilized paper cutting that much easier. 

sounds good , but it presupposes teeth neighbors , which i see 
no support for. one can argue that post facto assertion of inhumane 
neighbors can be used to make moral points , but that does n't mean that 
the actual neighbors really were inhuman .  . more to the point , such 
of the people across the river or over the mountain , or 
even of a different people dwelling among us , is all too common. 

that complex 
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic 
interpretations of that history is interesting , but i still do n't 
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it 
to attack condemnation of the original history. 

note that i'm speaking of historical interpretation here , for instance 
claiming that hammurabi 's an eye for an eye was primitive brutal 
retribution , while moses  version was an enlightened benign fine 
 ( because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way) .  . as 
of 3000 years ago or so , they probably both meant the same thing. 

to be sure , i'm arguing from a parochial perspective. 
i belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against 
overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe , 
and this book is the book of my tribe .  . the book commands 
us to dedicate ourselves to study , to improve the 
world , and to set an example as a light to the nations . 

we 've revered the book , and i think we 've been successful 
as scientists , as artists and musicians , as leaders 
in important humanitarian causes .  . it 's hard for me to 
separate the success of my people from the virtue 
of our book. you 'd have to argue that we 'd have 
done significantly better with a different book or with no book , 
or that another tribe with a different book or 
with no book has done significantly better. 

i do n't belittle the accomplishments , particularly the intellectual 
ones , of the jewish people. i have given up on trying to think by 
analogy , since i do n't know of any other  tribe  that is at all 
similar (the closest i can think of are the , but i do n't know 
enough about them to make a meaningful comparison) .  . i think a 
tradition of reflective study , of flexible rather than dogmatic 
interpretation , is a good thing. i think that with such an attitude a 
case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a 
1943 captain america comic  ( or whatever the babylonian equivalent 
would have  .

another one rescued from the bit bucket .  .  .  . 

over the years the over this book has been discussed on a.a. and 
elsewhere on the net. generally , the discussion comes down to the 
contention on the one hand that tsv contains such blood libel against 
islam as to merit , if not death , than at least banning and probably 
some sort of punishment and on the other that rushdie , particularly 
as a non muslim in a western country , had every right to write and 
publish whatever he chose , regardless of whether some muslims find it 
offensive , without fear of persecution or death. 

i am naturally inclined to the latter position , but find myself in an 
interesting position , because i think this is a fine book , only 
incidentally concerned with islam , and moreover i'm damned if i can 
find anything offensive in it. 

over the years , when i have made this point , various primarily muslim 
posters have responded , saying that yes indeed they have read the book 
and had called it such things as filth and lies , i would rank 
rushdie 's book with hitler 's mein or worse , and so on. 
unfortunately , these comments are usually generalities , and attempts 
to follow up by requesting explanations for what specifically is so 
offensive have met either with stony silence , more generalizations , or 
inaccurate or out of context references to the book which lead me to 
believe that few of them have actually read it . corrections and 
attempts to discuss the text in context have been ignored .  . 

anyway , since i seem to be the only one following this particular line

not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible , excitable

(c) one of them is wrong , but we never have any information as to who , so 
we make our best guess if we really must make a decision. 

 ( d ) the idea of a right moral judgement is meaningless  ( implying that 
whether peace is better than war , e.g. , is a meaningless question , 
and need not be discussed for it has no correct answer) 

 ( e ) something else. a short , positive assertion would be nice. 

as i hope you can tell , (b) and (c) are actually predicated on 
the assumption that values are real so statements like these 
ca n't consistently derive from the relativist assumption that values 
are n't part of objective reality. 

i am a relativist who would like to answer your question , but the way you 
phrase the question makes it unanswerable .  . the concepts of right 
and wrong  ( or correct incorrect or true false ) belong to the 
domain of epistemological rather than moral questions. it makes no 
sense to ask if a moral position is right or wrong , although it is 
legitimate to ask if it is good  ( or better than another position) .  . 

let me illustrate this point by looking at the psychological derivatives 
of epistemology and ethics perception and motivation , respectively .  . 
one can certainly ask if a is right  ( correct , true , 
veridical ) or wrong  ( incorrect , false ,  . but it makes little 
sense to ask if a motive is true or false .  . on the other hand , it is 
strange to ask whether a is morally good or evil , but one can 
certainly ask that question about motives .  . 

therefore , your suggested answers (a) (c) simply ca n't be considered 
they assume you can judge the correctness of a moral judgment .  . 

now the problem with  ( d ) is that it is double barrelled i agree with 
the first part  ( that the rightness of a moral position is a 
meaningless question) , for the reasons stated above. but that is 
irrelevant to the alleged implication (not an implication at all) that 
one cannot feel peace is better than war. i certainly can make 
value judgments  ( bad , better , best ) without asserting the correctness 
of the position. 

sorry for the lengthy dismissal of (a)  . my short  ( e ) answer is 
that when two individuals disagree on a moral issue , 
neither is right  ( correct ) or wrong  . they simply hold 
different moral values  .

that i had come from one of his comments. he stated that god is not 
necessarily a religious term , but could be used as other scientific terms that 
give explanation for events or theories , without being a proven scientific 
fact. i think i got his point i can quote the section if i'm being vague .  . 
the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates. are there

the willingness of true believers 
to die for their belief , be it in jesus or jim jones , is 
well documented , so martyrdom in and of itself says little. 

it does say something about the depth of their belief .  . religion has 
both deluded believers and con men. the difference is often how far 
they will follow their beliefs .  . 

i have no first hand , or even second hand , knowledge of how the 
original apostles died. if they began a myth in hopes of exploiting 
it for profit , and followed that myth to the death , that would be 
inconsistent .  . real con men would bail out when it was obvious it would 
lead to discomfort , pain and death. 

the story in 1 kings regarding the 450 prophets of is of no 
help in this debate. one can easily assume that they believed that 
no overwhelming of elijah would be forthcoming .  . he was 
simply a fool , who would be shown to be so. the fire from heaven was

 ( about my reply ) 

diplomatic ) 

it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming , usenet , diplomacy 
is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through , is n't it 

i realize i'm fighting occam 's razor in this argument , so i 'll try to 
explain why i feel a mind is necessary. 

kevin , unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little 
about , algorithms .  . your reasoning , as i see it , is very much along the 
lines of roger , who claimed that mathematical  insight  cannot 
be algorithmic in his book the emperor 's new mind concerning 
computers , minds , and the laws of physics . however , 's 
claim that he has mathematical insight , or your similar claim 
that collapse only when we consciously take a look , 
could be just illusions .  . 

we are taking very different viewpoints i try to ponder 
on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective , 
realising that it might not be anything special , but certainly 
useful. thinking back of what i wrote , do you think worms have minds 
or not they are able to experience pain , at least they behave 
just like that. yet it is conceivable that we might some day 
in the future perform a total synthesis of c. from 
the elements. would such a worm have a mind 

firstly , i'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms .  . they 're 
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out , but not 
at working out the method itself. 

this is true to some extent .  . however , i do not think that our brains 
work like computers , at all. in fact , there is substantial evidence 
 ( skarda , 1985 freeman 1987) that brains work more or less 
, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve .  . 
our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators , i suppose. 

the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered .  . does 
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already 
pre programmed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely , given that 
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 worth of genetic 
material , much of which is n't used. 

indeed , this is extremely unlikely , given the vast impact of nurture 
on our mind and brain. i suggest , however , that before trying to 
understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms .  . 

kevin , take a look at the references i mentioned , and think again. 
i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind 
are neurologists , and biologists  ( but do not 
flame me for my opinions ) , since they study beings that are 
conscious .  . 

the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot 
lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different. 

and please , do not bring qm into this discussion at all not 
all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness 
plays some special role in physics .  . i would say it does n't .  . 

the other problem with algorithms is their instability .  . not many 
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code , yet 
people survive strokes without going completely haywire  ( there are 
side effects , but patients still seem remarkably stable . ) . also , 
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate 
can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it 's 
code 

again , brains are not computers . do n't forget this. this does not 
mean they need something else to work they just work differently. 
their primary  purpose  is perception and guidance of action , 
self awareness and high intelligence are later appearances .  . 

the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour  ( replace 
 colour  with the sensation of your choice . ) . presumably , the 
materialist viewpoint is that it 's the product of some kind of 
chemical reaction. the usual products of such a reaction are energy 
different chemicals .  . is colour a mixture of these 

you are still expecting that we could find the idea of  green  in 
our brains somewhere , perhaps in the form of some chemical .  . this is 
not how i see it. the sensation  green  is a certain time dependent 
pattern in the area v4 of our visual cortex , and it is distributed 
with the help of areas v1 and v2 to the rest of the brain. 

indeed , a firing pattern. i have sometimes thought of our consciousness 
as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns , 
but this is just idle speculation .  . 

scientific american 's september 1992 issue was a special issue on 
mind and brain. have you already read it from cover to cover ) 
there are two articles on visual perception , so you might be 
interested. 

but again , please note that subjective experiences cannot be 
observed from a third person perspective. if we see nothing but 
neuronal activity , we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the 
mind. 

kalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation 
of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the 
patients  state of mind. for instance , a patient whose area 
was stimulated  ( without his knowledge) by remote control during 
a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression , and 
started discussing a plan to his girlfriend. 

in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing 
situations , when the patients have started flirting with the 
therapist .  . 

in conclusion , there is evidence that 

1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences , 
brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage 

2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in 
various areas of brain when we think of colours , our 
visual cortex is activated etc. 

3) consciousness is an afterthought we become conscious of our 
actions with a half a second delay , and our brains are ahead 
of our  conscious will  by at least 350 ms. 

thus , i think it is to turn the question why do  i  see 
colours around and ask what is this  i  that seems to be 
observing , since it seems that our conscious mind is not 
the king of our brains .  . 

if this is so , a 
computer wo n't see colour , because the chemistry is different. does an 
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an 
equivalent that does n't it should n't , because the outputs of each 
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances .  . so why do 
we see colour 

this depends on what is meant by  seeing  . does a neural 
network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from 
0 to 9 see the numbers , if it is capable of sorting them 

if you are asking , why does an animal who is conscious of itself 
as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who 
does n't , i have a good answer read my previous posting , 
where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap 
roles and act more morally , so that they do n't unconsciously 
kill each other with newly discovered weapons .  . (a bit extreme , 
but this is the basic idea . ) . 

when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools , 
a sense of identity and the concept of  self  had to evolve in 
line with this development. indeed , respect for others and 
conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages 
for social animals , such as early humans. 

if i remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of a , 
with two processes acting on it. the first process has been called 
 unitary evolution   ( or 'u') , is governed by 's equation 
and is well known. the second process , called various things such as 
 collapse of the  or  state vector reduction   ( or 'r' ) , 
and is more mysterious .  . it is usually said to occur when a 
 measurement  takes place , although nobody seems to know precisely 
when that occurs .  . when it does occur , the effect of r is to abruptly 
change the  . 

if minds are required for this , does this mean that until human 
minds came to the scene , never collapsed , but remained 
in the for aeons my , how powerful we are. 

this has been discussed before , and i think this topic is irrelevant , 
since we do not agree that minds are necessary , and neither do 
physicists .  . 

anyway , i'm speculating that minds would be in part x. there seems to 
be some link between consciousness and r , in that we never see linear 
of anything , although there are alternative 
explainations for this. i 've no idea how a brain is supposed to access 
part x , but since this is only speculation , that wo n't matter too 
much ) my main point is that there might be a place for minds in 
physics .  . 

i agree , but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics 
needs sharp minds to solve many real problems. ) 

i 'll go back to my nice padded cell now , if that 's ok with you )

which killings do you say are religously motivated 

for example , i would claim that the recent assassination of four

at the time

what would you call is when someone writes the killings in n . i .

now , it 's possible to argue that 
religion in the past is a major contributing factor to the violence in

not enough of a historian to debate it. 

given that the avowed aim of the ira is to take northern ireland

by that church , i fail to see why the word past is appropriate. 


but to claim that the killings in n . i . are not religously

to be a new claim .  . the different claim to which i refer is the claim 
which you were seemingly attacking in the previous post , namely that religion 
is not a major historical cause of the present violence .  . i do n't assert

has the same sort of conspiracy ever occurred since , (i mean there must 
have been dozen of times in the past two thousand years when it would have 
been time for a  messiah  to be born. 


it has. there is a guy running around in switzerland who claims to have 
been conceived similarly .  . his mother says the same. his father is said to 
be a bit surprised. 

but anyway , there have been a lot of messiahs , and many have had a similar 
story about their birth. or their death. a list of messiahs could be quite 
interesting. 


would n't you feel bad if you turned out to be wrong and the conception of 
christ was via god i can just imagine your faces as mary asks you if 
you 've ever had a child yourself. 


i would wonder why an omnipotent god pulls such stunts instead of providing 
evidence for everyone to check. and the whole question is absurd .  . 

would n't you feel bad if you 'd find out that stones are sentient , and that 
you have stepped on them all your life and would n't you feel bad when you 'd 
see the proof that jesus was just a plot of satan 


if they wanted to save image they could have done what joseph planned to 
do in the first place have a quite wedding and an equally quite divorce , 
(i think it was quite easy to do under jewish law) .  . in that regard they 
would have been pretty dumb to think up a conspiracy like the one you 've 
outlined in that they a bringing attention on themselves.  ( messiah 
appearances were like royal scandals in zero ad israel ,  ( see the part in 
acts when the are discussing what to do about the growth of the 
new church , (i . e .  . one wise guy said leave it alone and if it is what it 
says it is nothing can stop it and if it is n't then it will just fizzle out 
 . 


you 've forgotten the pride factor. 


it did n't fizzle , (the church i mean) .  . 


the argument is a fallacy .  . it is like thanks for reading this far on the end 
of a letter. most religions claim that they wo n't fizzle because they contain 
some eternal truth. so does christianity .  . since there are old religions it is 
no wonder to find old religions that have it that they would last. 

roll twelve dice .  . calculate the chance for the result. argue that there must 
be something special about the result because an event with a chance of 
1 (6 12) could hardly happen by chance only. feel elevated because you have 
participated in letting that special event take place.

pardon me i am trying to apply human terms to non humans 

that 's right. you are basically stating that morality can only deal with 
humans , because only humans are sentient enough to be moral  ( that is , 
you say that morality can only deal with intentions ) .  . 

i have never said that only humans are the only beings which are 
sufficiently sentient to have intentions .  . in fact , i have explicitly 
said that i am perfectly happy to consider that some animals are 
capable of forming intentions .  . 

what i am objecting to is considering programmed or instinctive 
behaviour to have moral significance , since , it seems to me , 
such behaviour does not involve intention .  . 


i think that even if someone is not conscious of an alternative , 
this does not prevent his behavior from being moral .  . 
i'm sure you do think this , if you say so. how about trying to 
convince me 

i think that a moral act is moral whether or not the implementor 
thinks it is. 

that 's not the point. the point is whether the implementor thinks 
at all . the issue is not whether thinking produces opinion a 
or opinion b , but whether thinking takes place , period. 


i 've offered , four times , i think , to accept your definition if 
you allow me to ascribe moral to the orbital motion 
of the planets .  . 

hmm .  .  .  . perhaps you can ascribe it. i could say that many human actions 
are not natural and thus do n't follow a natural morality .  . 

since humans are part of nature , are not all human actions natural . 

or perhaps you 're going to throw in a definition of natural that 
will allow us to describe some actions as natural and some as 
not natural . if so , what is the definition 


other than those death which surround mating rituals , other animals 
just do n't kill each other  ( within a species ) that often , do they 

sure they do , as multiple posters have show you. sharks , for example , 
eat wounded sharks .  . i 've personally seen cats eat their newborn .  . 

are you in some kind of denial people give you example after example , 
and you go off the air for a week , and then pop up claiming that it 
never happened. it 's very strange.

i 'll accept this as a compliment although i'm always a little paranoid

, it 's what i think of as human nature. i'm not sure it 
undermines either religion or atheism since both claim special 
knowledge about the truth and since such claims are always suspect , 
all we can learn from it is that humans are a very arrogant species .  . 
my point is that we cannot ignore human nature when examining human 
claims .  . the trick here then , is to find some way to abstract our 
infinitely fallible nature from whatever reality is out there so we 
can see what there is to see. i can think of no way this can be done.

i am doing research on atheism , part of which involves field research here 
on the net. the following is a survey directed towards all readers of this 
group , intended to get data about the basis of atheistic belief .  . i would 
seriously appreciate it if each and every one of you would fill it out and 
mail it back to me at 

first of all , i 've tried to structure questions that can be answered in a 
variety of ways , with varying amounts of detail it 's possible to give 
succinct answers to most everything , but there 's enough here to keep most of 
you typing for hours , i'm sure. as much detail as you want to give me (i mean 
it) is great , but it 's also important for me to have as broad a base of 
individuals as possible , so even minimal responses are far better than nothing 
it 's a short survey if you just answer the questions without elaboration .  . 

secondly , i hope some of the questions do n't come off as obnoxious i know that 
phrases like what would convince you of the existence of god imply that i am 
a seminary student intent on proving you all to be ignorant godless heathens .  . 
in fact , i'm not too sure about the existence of a higher power myself , so my 
use of god is a question of rather than ideology it 's easier 
than just repeating a deity or higher power every time. 

also , i tend to use a lot of anthropological buzzwords like belief system 
although i know some of you might contend that you do n't have any beliefs , but 
are skeptical towards everything. i understand but you know what i mean. 
think of such buzzwords as abbreviations for the rather phrases 
required to get the precise idea across .  . 

lastly , thanks ! please fill out as much as you can , in as much detail as 
you can , and send them to me. my research and i thank you. 



where would you place your beliefs , on the spectrum 
theism agnosticism weak atheism strong atheism 
feel free to elaborate on your specific beliefs .  . 


in what , if any , religious tradition were you raised did you ever believe 
in the existence of a god  ( several of the following questions presume 
that the answer to this is yes if you 've always been an atheist , or at 
least never a theist , you may have to modify the question answer somewhat . ) . 


how serious was your your family 's involvement 

how and when did you start to doubt the tenets you were raised to believe 

how and when did your final break with your beliefs , if any , occur i 
realize that this is often more of an ongoing process than an event per se 
whatever the case , just describe it in whatever detail you wish. 


what contact with other atheists have you had before and after  ( and during ) 
your conversion to atheism  ( certainly your involvement with alt.atheism 
counts how have net discussions affected your beliefs ) 

to what extent do you think other atheists have influenced you in your 
beliefs did you come by your beliefs through discussion , through 
independent means , or by some combination of the two or other means 


are you convinced that your beliefs were acquired through wholly rational 
means  ( proofs of the non existence of god , etc) , or was it perhaps , at least 
in part , through other means  ( alienation from mainstream religion , etc) 


to what extent do you feel you understand the universe through your beliefs 
what phenomena of the universe and of human existence  ( anything from physical 
phenomena to the problem of the existence of evil in human affairs ) do you 
feel are adequately dealt with by your beliefs , and where are they lacking as 
an explanatory method 

what would it take for you to question , or change , your beliefs what would 
convince you of the existence of god , what would convince you of the 
plausibility of god 's existence , and so forth how dynamic are your beliefs 
are they constantly changing have they stayed more or less the same for 
some time 

are you involved in a career or education in science to what extent do you 
think science has influenced your beliefs  ( issac asimov claimed that science 
was the new secular religion , and that scientists are , in a very real sense , 
the new priesthood .  . do you see the pursuit of science as having a quasi 
religious base , or even a religious element ) 



this survey is intended to get data from a broad range of individuals , but 
also to help me narrow down the field to a small group of people whose 
ideas and histories could be very useful to me. would you be willing to have 
me , on the basis of this survey , write you to find out more about you and your 
beliefs if not , fine your filling out the survey alone is great. 



thanks again. feel free to contact me if you have any questions about what 
i'm doing with this data , or if you have anything to say in addition to what 
i 've asked about above.

an atheist .  . you probably think you are very clever , but we see this all

but the possibilities of creator and eternity carry with them too much

indeed i may .  . and one may be an atheist and also be gullible , excitable

that a person is easily led .  . whether they have a worship or belief 
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be 
beside the point. 

sure. but whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing , 
not whether they are easily led .  . 

not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible , excitable

have to discuss if that concrete cause , rather than atheism , was the 
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour .  . 

i'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour merely that

many who would not agree on morality of something. the analogy 
does not hold .  . 

i have , however , given an example of a value people agree on , and explained 
why. people will agree that their freedom is valuable .  . i have also 
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective 
ethics the if assertion above. and that is what i'm talking about , there 
is n't a point in talking about ethics if this ca n't be agreed. 

one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , 
while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees 
with a set of morals you have to give .  . 

i'm not doing morals  ( ethics ) if we ca n't get past values .  . as i say , 
the only cogent objection to my  freedom  example is that maybe people 
are n't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable .  . 
maybe not , and i want to think about this some , especially the implications 
of its being true. 

further , the above is evidence , not proof. proof would evolve out of testing 
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories .  . 

garbage .  . that 's not proof either. 

the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer 
the objections .  . evidence that you are a preacher .  .

since this is alt.atheism , i hope you do n't mind if we strongly disagree .  .  .  . 

the fact is god could cause you to believe anything he wants you to. 
but think about it for a minute. would you rather have someone love 
you because you made them love you , or because they wanted to 
love you. the responsibility is on you to love god and take a step toward 
him. he promises to be there for you , but you have to look for yourself. 

indeed , knock and it shall be opened to you . dan , why did n't this work 
i firmly believed in god for 15 years , but i eventually realised i was 
only deluding myself , fearful to face the truth. ultimately , the only reason 
what kept me believing was the fear of hell. the mental states i 
had attributed to divine forces or devil 's attempts to 
destroy my faith were nothing more than my imagination , and it is easy 
to achieve the same mental states at will. 

my faith was just learned fear in a disguise .  . 

those who doubt this or dispute it have not it a sincere effort. 

god is demanding too much. dan , what was it i believed in for 15 years 
if sincere effort is equivalent to active suspension of disbelief 
what it was in my case i 'd rather quit. if god does not help me to 
keep the faith , i ca n't go on. 

besides , i am concerned with god 's morality and mental health. does 
she really want us to believe in herself without any help  ( revelations , 
guidance , or anything i can feel ) if she has created us , why did n't 
she make the task any easier why are we supposed to love someone who 
refuses to communicate with us what is the point of eternal torture 
for those who ca n't believe 

i love god just as much as she loves me. if she wants to me , 
she 'll know what to do. 

simple logic arguments are folly .  . if you read the bible you will see 
that jesus made fools of those who tried to trick him with logic . 
our ability to reason is just a spec of creation. yet some think it is 
the ultimate .  . if you rely simply on your reason then you will never 
know more than you do now. 

your argument is of the type you 'll know once you try . 
yet there are many atheists who have sincerely tried , and believed 
for many years , but were eventually honest enough to admit that 
they had lived in a virtual reality. 

what else but reason i can use i do n't have the spiritual means 
christians often refer to. my conscience disagrees with the bible .  . 
i do n't even believe i have a soul. i am fully dependent on my 
body indeed , i am this body. when it goes up with flames , so 
does my identity .  . god can entertain herself with copies of me 
if she wants. 

to learn you must accept that which you do n't know. 

what does this mean to learn you must accept that you do n't know 
something , right o. but to learn you must accept something i do n't 
know , why this is not the way i prefer to learn. it is unwise to 
merely swallow everything you read. suppose i write a book telling 
how the great invisible pink unicorn (tm) has helped me in my 
daily problems , would you accept this , since you ca n't know whether 
it is true or not 

note that the is also omnipotent , omnipresent , and loves just 
about everyone. besides , he  ( and she ) is guiding every writer on this planet , 
you and me , and not just some people who write legendary stories 
2000 years ago. 

your god is just one aspect of his and her presence .  .

to fight iran i agree. and i agree in ruthlessly hunting down those 
who did or do. but we did sell arms to hussein , and it 's a done deal. 
now he invades kuwait .  . so do we just sit back and say , well , we sold 
him all those arms , i suppose he just wants to use them now. too bad 
for kuwait .  . no , unfortunately , sitting back and letting things be 
is not the way to correct a former mistake. destroying hussein 's 
military potential as we did was the right move. but i agree with 
your statement , reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to 
sell arms to hussein .  . so it 's really not the gulf war you abhor 
so much , it was the u.s. 's and the west 's in selling 
arms to hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable , right

my theory , though yet unproven , is that this is due to simple envy .  . 

no its not. 

its due to the fact that there are two issues here religion and religion. 

religion is personal belief system. 
religion is a memetic virus .  . 

people loudly proclaiming their beliefs are crossing the border from 
religion religion. people that want to save others are firmly 
entrenched in religion ( ) .  . 

rule 1 of not practicing religion is to shut the fuck up , unless 
you discuss it politely .  . this means that the motive behind the conversation 
is not only your self wish to spread the word. 

religion is something that ultimately comes from within a person , and 
reflects their value judgements .  . religion is something that is 
contracted from others and does not reflect the persons value judgements 
 ( other than perhaps i think i 'll be brainwashed today ) .  . 

religion is a drug .  .  .  . 

i believe you can discuss religion. however , the post that started this 
off was not as discussion , it was more a proclamation of 
someones religion. 

if you think i'm talking about censorship or that i'm closeminded you have n't 
understood this. i do n't have any problem with the discussion of 
religion , its just religion that i ca n't stand .  .  .  .

no one asks you to swallow everything , in fact jesus warns against it. but let 
me ask you a question. do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for 
that matter anything in school. i mean it 's just what other people have told 
you and you do n't want to swallow what others say. right ... 

the life , death , and resurection of christ is documented historical fact. as much 
as anything else you learn. how do you choose what to believe and what not to 
i could argue that george washington is a myth .  . he never lived because i do n't 
have any proof except what i am told. however all the major events of the life 
of jesus christ were hundreds of years before him. neat trick uh 

there is no way to get into a sceptical heart. you can not say you have given a

also played a significant role as a model for the u.s. constitution .  . 
furthermore , apparently marx and engels were strongly influenced 
by a study of society , using it as the prime example of 
a successful , , egalitarian , society. 
goes on to say that both the u.s. and the u . s . s . r .  . would do well 
to study the original document , figure out where each went wrong , 
and try to get it right next time. 

that 's fascinating .  . i heard that the chinese , rather than

that 's fascinating .  . i take it that you 're expressing skepticism 
at the idea that those ignorant savages could have influenced 
the constitution of the people who stole their continent .  . you 
could be right , but it sounds plausible to me. is there any 
reason that you dismiss it out of hand here 's some more 

recent scholarship has shown that in the mid indians were not 
only invited to participate in the deliberations of our founding 
fathers , but that the great binding law of the confederacy 
arguably became the single most important model for the albany 
plan of union , and later the articles of confederation and the 
constitution .  . that this would be absent from our school texts , 
and from history , and from media is not surprising given the devotion 
americans feel to our founding myth great men gathered to express 
a new vision that has withstood the test of time. if it were 
revealed that indians had a role in it , imagine the blow to the 
american  . 
... 
by , when most of these men and others gathered to the 
albany plan of union , the first try at confederation , they invited 
forty two members of the grand council to serve as advisors 
on structures .  . benjamin franklin freely acknowledged 
his interest in the achievement in a famous speech at 
albany congress it would be a strange thing .  .  . if . six nations 
of ignorant savages sic should be capable of forming such a union 
and be able to execute it in such a manner that it has 
for ages and appears , and yet that a like union should 
be impractical for ten or a dozen english colonies .  . 
according to , franklin meetings of chiefs 
and congressional delegates in order to hammer out a plan that he 
to be similar to the confederacy .  . 

is professor donald , jr. , of the university of california

american nation addresses this issue.

reply to (mike cobb ) 

if morals come from what is societally accepted , why follow that what 
right do we have to expect others to follow our notion of societally 
mandated morality pardon the extremism , but could n't i murder your 
brother and say that i was exercising my rights as i saw them , was 
doing what felt good , did n't want anyone forcing their morality on me , 
or i do n't follow your morality 

i believe that morality is subjective .  . each person is entitled to his 
own moral attitudes .  . mine are not a priori more correct than someone 
elses .  . this does not mean however that i must judge another on the 
basis of his rather than my moral standards. while he is entitled to 
believe what his own moral sense tells him , the rest of society is 
entitled to pass laws spelling out punishments for behavior that is 
offensive to the majority .  . 

why how might makes right how can they force their morality on me why 
ca n't i do what i want who are they to decide what if i disagree 

most criminals do not see their behavior as moral .  . the may realize that 
it is immoral and not care. they are thus not following their own moral 
system but being immoral .  . 

good point , but it is being immoral in our opinion. we do n't let them choose , 
we make the decision that their actions are wrong for them. 

for someone to lay claim to an alternative 
moral system , he must be sincere in his belief in it and it must be 
internally consistent .  . some lack an innate moral sense 

i admit to lean toward the idea of an innate moral sense , but have little basis 
for it as of yet. how far can such a concept be extended 

and 
thus may be incapable of behaving morally .  . while someone like hitler 
may have believed that his actions were moral , we may judge him immoral 
by our standards. 

do you mean that we could say it would be wrong for us to do such a thing but 
not him. after all , he was behaving morally in his own eyes and doing what he 
chose .  . on what basis do we condemn other societies besides , here 's the buzz 
words , on the idea that there are some actions wrong for all humans in all 
societies 

holding that morality is subjective does not mean 
that we must excuse the murderer .  . 

why not do we have to be objective suddenly

this is a standard argument for fundies .  . can you spot the the

they have not been able to offer real proof of that

i just thought it necessary to help defend the point that jesus 
existed .  . guys jesus existed .  . if he didnt , then you have to say that 
socrates didnt exist cuz he , like jesus , has nothing from his hands that 
have survived .  . only plato and others record his existance .  . many others 
record jesus  existance , including the babylonian talmud .  . sorry guys , the 
argument that jesus may not have existed is a dead point now. he did. 
whether he was god or whether there is a god is a completely different 
story , however. 



most of them 
try it using the  ( very ) flawed writings of josh mcdowell and others to prove

rh righto , dan , try this one with your cornflakes .  .  .  . 

rh the book says that muhammad was either a liar , or he was

rh said he was. some reasons why he would n't be a liar are as 
rh follows .  . who would die for a lie would n't people be able 
rh to tell if he was a liar people gathered around him and 
rh kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing how his

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes .  . irrational 
belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism .  . 

 ( deletion ) 

theism is correlated with fanaticism .  . i have neither said that all fanatism 
is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism .  . the point is , 
theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic .  . one could of course 
argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism  ( for example) , but i just 
have to at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology 
to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it. 

imo , the influence of stalin , or for that matter , ayn rand , invalidates your 
assumption that theism is the factor to be considered .  . 

bogus .  . i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism .  . 
the point is that theism is a factor. 

that 's your claim now back it up. i consider your argument as useful 
as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism .  . therefore 
belief is a factor in fanaticism .  . true , and utterly useless.  ( note , this 
is any belief , not belief in gods ) 

, 
blind obedience to authority , lack of scepticism , and so on , are all more 
reliable indicators .  . and the really dangerous people the sources of 
fanaticism are often none of these things. they are cynical 
of the gullible , who know precisely what they are doing. 

that 's a claim you have to support. please note that especially in the 
field of theism , the leaders believe what they say. 

if you believe that , you 're incredibly naive .  . 

now , some 
brands of theism , and more precisely some theists , do tend to fanaticism , 
i grant you. to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry , not a reasoned 
argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction 
of religious freedom .  . ever read animal farm 

that 's a straw man. and as usually in discussions with you one has to 
repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to 
fanatism , and not all fanatism is caused by theism .  . the point is , 
there is a correlation , and it comes from innate features of theism .  . 

no , some of it comes from features which some theism has in common 
with some fanaticism .  . your last statement simply is n't implied by 
what you say before , because you 're trying to sneak in innate features 
of all theism . the word you 're groping for is some . 

, by the way , is one of them. 

no shit , sherlock .  . so why not talk about instead of theism , 
since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have , as opposed 
to the case you are trying to make 

and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw 
men. interesting that you have nothing better to offer. 

i said it reads like a warm up to that. that 's because it 's an irrational 
and bogus tirade , and has no other use than creating a nice them us 
split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either 
side of church walls. 

(2) define irrational belief . e.g. , is it rational to believe that 
reason is always useful 


irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason. the latter has 
been discussed for a long time with charley wingate .  . one point is that 
the beliefs violate reason often , and another that a process that does 
not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information. 

well , there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful 
based on reason would be circular , and argument not based on reason would 
be irrational .  . which is it 

that 's bogus .  . self reference is not circular .  . and since the evaluation of 
usefulness is possible within rational systems , it is allowed. 

o.k. , it 's oval .  . it 's still begging the question , however. and though 
that certainly is allowed , it 's not rational .  . and you claiming to be 
rational and all. 

at the risk of repeating myself , and hearing we had that before we 
did n't hear a refutation before , so we 're back. deal with it 
you ca n't use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful. someone 
who thinks reason is crap wo n't buy it , you see. 

your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics 
and mathematics are therfore circular .  . 

anybody else think godel was silly 

the first part of the second statement contains no information , because 
you do n't say what the beliefs are. if the beliefs are strong theism 
and or strong atheism , then your statement is not in general true. the 
second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an 
datum does not lend itself to rational analysis , but is 
assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is 
used to obtain it. 


i 've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions 
of god here. 

an datum lends itself to rational analysis , what you say here 
is a an often refuted fallacy .  . have a look at the discussion of the 
axiom of choice. and further , one can evaluate axioms in larger systems 
out of which they are usually derived .  . i exist is derived , if you want 
it that way. 

further , one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms .  . 

what is it you are trying to say 

that at some point , people always wind up saying this datum is reliable 
for no particular reason at all. example i am not dreaming . 

compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of 
their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but  . 

i ca n't agree with this until you are specific which theism to 
say that all theism is necessarily requires a proof which 
i suspect you do not have. 


using the traditonal definition of gods .  . personal , supernatural entities 
with objective effects on this world. usually connected to morals and or 
the way the world works. 

imo , any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational .  . that does 
not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of 
intelligence .  . some atheists are also scientists , for example. 

the affinity to fanatism is easily seen. it has to be true because i believe 
it is nothing more than a work hypothesis .  . however , the beliefs say they are 
more than a work hypothesis .  . 

i do n't understand this. can you your argument 

person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice. that does not make 
b true , it is at best a work hypothesis .  . however , the content of b is that 
it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis .  . testing or evaluating 
evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b  ( already believed ) 
says it is wrong a waste of time not possible. depending on the further 
contents of b idolaters protestants are to be killed , this can 
have interesting effects. 

peculiar definition of interesting , but sure. now show that a belief 
in gods entails the further contents of which you speak. why are n't my 
catholic neighbours out killing the protestants , for example maybe they 
do n't believe in it. maybe it 's the conjunction of b asserts b and 
jail kill that is important , and the belief in gods is 
entirely irrelevant .  . it certainly seems so to me , but then i have no 
axe to grind here.

indeed i may .  . and one may be an atheist and also be gullible , excitable

i would say that a tendency to worship tyrants and ideologies indicates 
that a person is easily led .  . whether they have a worship or belief 
in a supernatural hero rather than an earthly one seems to me to be 
beside the point. 

sure. but whether or not they are atheists is what we are discussing , 
not whether they are easily led .  . 

not if you show that these hypothetical atheists are gullible , excitable 
and easily led from some concrete cause. in that case we would also 
have to discuss if that concrete cause , rather than atheism , was the 
factor that caused their subsequent behaviour .  . 

i'm not arguing that atheism causes such behaviour merely that 
it is not relevant to the definition of atheism , which is  lack of belief in

as per various threads on science and creationism , i 've started into a 
book called christianity and the nature of science by jp  . 

as i do n't know this book , i will use your  . 

a question 
that i had come from one of his comments. he stated that god is not 
necessarily a religious term , but could be used as other scientific terms that 
give explanation for events or theories , without being a proven scientific 
fact. 

it depends on how he defines god. the way i understand the meaning 
of that term it being used in a useful way in science. ideas drawn 
from an understanding that god is supernatural precludes us from forming 
scientific assertions that can be falsified , that is , where we can decide 
that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations 
drawn from them. 

some have an interest in the definitions within 
science to make them more , and especially in a basic 
way , to religious dogma .  . this pursuit always fails .  . 

i think i got his point i can quote the section if i'm being vague .  . 
the examples he gave were quarks and continental plates. are there 
explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of 
themselves , or can everything be quantified , measured , tested , etc. 

reconciliation of science with religion involves the 
tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge , 
or that the domain of truth in each is limited in some way. it 
the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge 
while allowing for the different concerns of these separate  . science 
and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional 
answers , at best. science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful 
questions. more questions can be posed than it can answer. at the basis of 
sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve 
in contradiction .  .

faith and dogma are inevitable .  . christians merely understand and admit 
to the fact. give me your proof that no god exists , or that he does. 
whichever position you take , you are forced to do it on faith. it does 
no good to say you take no position , for to show no interest in the 
existence of god is to assume he does not exist. 

consider special relativity .  . it has n't be proved , nor has it been 
disproved .  . no one has a proof one way or the other , but many people 
are interested in it ! 

i 've satisfied myself that nothing could indicate absolutely the 
existence of god one way or the other. the two possibilities 
are and  . of course no set of circumstances can 
be inconsistent with , but similarly , no set of circumstances 
can be inconsistent with  . in , any phenomenon that 
could be described as god is considered part of the natural world , to 
be studied as any other natural phenomenon  ( gravity , for instance) .  . 
for example , if a loud   voice vociferously announced , 
am god , i exist , and i will prove it by reversing the force of gravity , '' 
and if then gravity did indeed reverse , a  ( probably a scientist) 
would say , , we sure did n't understand gravity as well as we 
thought we did , and that loud voice is something new. perhaps we 
did n't understand thunder as well as we thought we did either . '' . 

i contend that proper implementation of the christian faith requires 
reasoning , but that reasoning cannot be used to throw out things you 
do n't like , or find uncomfortable .  . sexual behavior is 
condemned in the bible and no act of true reason will make it any 
less condemned .  . hatred , murder , gossip all these are condemned .  . 
is there god ordained murder in the bible you bet , and if god ever 
orders me to kill you , i will. but i will first use the gideon like 
behavior of verifying that god actually ordered the hit , and will 
probably discuss it in an abram like fashion. 

i'm sure glad you do n't know where i live , since you do n't seem 
to realize it is impossible for you to distinguish between voices 
in your head , and god 's voice. 

i can hear you now , this is how jim jones and david koresh justify 
their behavior. delusional religious cults bear the same relationship 
to christianity that rape bears to sex form but no substance .  . 
when the southern baptist church or the church begin to do this 
then you have reason to blame mainstream religion for the behaviors of these 
people. or should i associate every negative behavior i witness in any 
non christian with you 

you seem to have missed my point. even if jim jones and david koresh 
were not religious people , my point remains that faith and dogma 
are dangerous , and religion encourages them. jim jones and david koresh 
also encouraged them. my point does not rely on jim jones and david 
koresh being religious .  .

i guess i'm delving into a religious language area. what exactly is morality 
or morals 

i hope there is not one with a subject like this you just have a spiral .  . what 
would then be a morality of a morality of morals .  . labels do n't make arguments .  . 
one really needs a solid measuring stick by which most actions can be 
interpreted , even though this would hardly seem moral .  . for example the best 
thing for me is to ensure that i will eat and drink enough. hence all actions 
must be weighed against this one statement. whatever helps this goal is 
moral , whatever does not is immoral 

of course this leads such a blank space there are so many different ways to 
fulfill a goal , one would need a hyper morality to apply to just the methods. 

i never thought of eating meat to be moral or immoral , but i think 
it could be. how do we differentiate between not doing something because it is 
a personal choice or preference and not doing something because we see it as 
immoral do we fall to what the basis of these morals are 

seems to me we only consider something moral or immoral if we stop to think 
about it long enough ) on the other hand , maybe it is our first gut 
reaction .  .  .  . which who knows perhaps here we have a way to discriminate 
morals .  . i do n't instinctively thing is right (the same way i 
instinctively feel torture is wrong) , but if i thought about it long enough and 
listened to the arguments , i could perhaps reason that it was wrong  ( is that 
possible ! ) ) see the difference 


also , consensus positions fall to a might makes right. or , as you brought out , 
if whatever is right is what is societally mandated then whoever is in control 
at the time makes what is right

in article  ( rashid ) writes 
stuff deleted .  .  .  . 
the point of my post was that rushdie was not being condemned solely 
for the words in his book  ( although this was certainly a contributing 
 . it was the whole series of actions of rushdie and his 
publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media 
placed on the book , that  ( in large part) led to the fatwa .  . the 
kind of fatwa levelled against rushdie is not lightly placed and there 
are any number of anti islamic writers both within and outside the 
islamic world who have not had made against them. here , someone 
who adds fuel to an explosive situation , might be charged with incitement 
to riot if people die in the rioting the charges against him might 
become even more serious. 

how can rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating 
against him the deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with 
the demonstrations , or on the demonstrators themselves , if they were 
violent .  . to what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour 
against rushdie 

once the rushdie situation exploded into the media , the muslim voice on 
the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes 
showing 
the dramatic highlights of muslim demonstrations .  . for every twenty or so 
newspaper , magazine articles , interviews etc. supporting rushdie , there 
would 
appear one muslim voice. this person was usually selected based on how 
dramatic and incoherent he was , not on his knowledge of islam or the 
situation at the time. this approx. twenty to one ratio continued 
throughout the escalation of the crisis , with rushdie in the central 
as the man of the moment , the valiant defender of 's 
right to free speech decoupled from responsibility .  .  ( as an aside , it 's 
interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up , 
some books  ( defaming certain ethnic and religious groups ) continued 
to be banned here. it was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these 

groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of 
hate towards these groups. for muslims this kind of double standard 
was annoying . ) . 

rushdie saw this as a golden opportunity to out at 
organized 
islam , and he did so with admirable verbal skill. the only kind of islam 
which rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular islam an islam 
separated from it 's qur'an , it 's prophet , god , its legislation , and most 
importantly from any intrusion into any political arena .  . fine rushdie 
made 
his views known the muslim 's made their anger at his book known. the 
scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions it was , by this 
time , 
already a political situation affecting governments as well as 
individuals .  . 
the situation was a serious one , with far reaching political implications .  . 
at the centre of this turmoil was rushdie , throwing fuel on the fire 
engaged 
in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution .  . 

now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as 

this has no responsibility , has no reason to exercise restraint of any 
kind , has no 
obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the till 
matters calm down. perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly 
defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary 
work , no matter what insult they find within it. perhaps you see him as 
a kind of secular heroic knight , mounted on the his media steed , 
doing battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism . 

well khomeini saw him as a author who 
grew up in a muslim atmosphere , knew well what muslim 's hold dear , 
who wrote a book which uses certain literary conventions 
to slander , insult , and attack islam and its most notable personalities 
who , when 
faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis , continued with 
his mischief in the world stage of the media who , even after people were 
injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation , 
continued his mischief , instead of having the good sense to desist .  . 
khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale , mischief 
making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged .  . the deaths 
of muslims around the world and rushdie 's continued media mischief 
even after this , was the triggering factor that seemed to 
decide khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief .  . the person at the 
centre of all these events was rushdie he was the source of the 
continuing mischief all media support , government support was 
just that support. the source was rushdie  ( and his publishers , who 
were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy 
to see rushdie constantly in the  . the islamic rulings that 
deal with people who engage in this kind of grand scale mischief 
making , was applied to rushdie .  . 

you 're attempts at justification are not doing the 
image of islam any good. 

i have made no attempts at justification , only at explanation. image is 
the chief concern of muslim  apologists  for islam and for rushdie .  . 
if muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub culture 
within a larger secular culture , such that the secular principles and laws 
had precedence over the laws of islam then i have no doubt that islam 
would then be thought to have a good image  ( principally because it would 
by and large reflect the secular image) .  . a good image usually means be 
more 
like me . 

your attempts at totally rushdie reflect exactly the attitude 
that 
resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis .  . 

in iran , the situation was monitored for many 
months when rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free 
worldwide voice that the media gave him , the situation was monitored 
more seriously. when , even after many deaths occured worldwide , rushdie 
still did not desist the fatwa was pronounced .  . when behaving like 
a total jerk endangers lives , and the jerk sees this and still insists 
on his right to behave like a total jerk he has the rug out 
from under him. 

if the muslims did n't make such a big fuss over the book , like issuing 
death threats , and killing publishers , no one would have heard of it. 

the fatwa came later much later. if rushdie did n't mouth off so much in 
the 
media , the fuss would have died down no one would have been killed , no 
fatwa would have been passed the whole episode would have away.

with the southern baptist convention convening this june to consider 
the charges that freemasonry is incompatible with christianity , i thought 
the following quotes by mr. james holly , the anti masonic flag carrier , 
would amuse you all .  .  .  . 

the following passages are exact quotes from the southern 
baptist convention and freemasonry by james l. holly , m.d. , president 
of mission and ministry to men , inc. , 550 n 10th st. , beaumont , tx 
77706 .  . 

the inside cover of the book states mission ministry to men , 
inc. hereby grants permission for the reproduction of part or all of 
this booklet with two provisions one , the material is not changed and 
two , the source is identified .  . i have followed these provisions .  . 

freemasonry is one of the allies of the devil page iv. 

the issue here is not moderate or conservative , the issue is god 
and the devil page vi. 

it is worthwhile to remember that the formulators of public 
school education in america were freemasons page 29. 

jesus christ never commanded toleration as a motive for his 
disciples , and toleration is the antithesis of the christian message. 
page 30. 

the central dynamic of the freemason drive for world unity 
through fraternity , liberty and equality is toleration .  . this is seen 
in the writings of the  great  writers of freemasonry . page 31. 

he jesus christ established the most sectarian of all possible 
faiths .  . page 37 .  . 

for narrowness and sectarianism , there is no equal to the lord 
jesus christ . page 40. 

what seems so right in the interest of toleration and its 
cousins liberty , equality and fraternity is actually one of the 
subtlest lies of the  father of lies . ' . page 40. 

the southern baptist convention has many churches which were 
founded in the lodge and which have corner stones dedicated by the 
lodge .  . each of these churches should hold public ceremonies of 
repentance and of praying the blood and the name of the lord jesus 
christ over the church and renouncing the oaths taken at the 
dedication of the church and or building. page 53 54 .  .

actually , it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted us

back water country , we probably would n't intervene .  . not that we do n't 
care , but we ca n't be the world 's policman .  . or if a coup had occured 
in kuwait  ( instead of an invasion ) , then we still would n't have acted 
because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to 
saudi arabia .  . but the combination of the two , an unprovoked invasion 
by a genocidal tyrant and the potential danger to the west 's oil 
interests , caused us to take action. 

there are many indications that would have taken place had saddam

none. this has been openly stated by ex pentagon analysts .  . pull .  .

i'm not setting up a strawman at all. if you want to argue against the

lots of wars  ( very ot) .  . no one has ever found any metal swords or 
and traces of a civilization other than the native americans .  . 

this is just one example. 

from free inquiry , winter 83 84 , the following is an 
introduction to the article joseph smith and the book of 
mormon , by george d. smith .  . the introduction is written by 
paul  . 

mormonism the church of jesus christ of latter day saints 
claims a worldwide membership 5.2 million. it is one of 
the world 's fastest growing religions , with as many as 
200 , 000 new in 1982 alone. because of the church 's 
aggressive missionary program , covering more than one 
hundred countries , it is spreading even to third world 
countries. 

mormonism is both in moral outlook and 
evangelical in  . the church is run along strict 
authoritarian lines. led by a president , who allegedly 
receives revelations directly form god , and a group of 
twelve apostles who attempt to maintain orthodoxy in belief 
and practice , the church is opposed to abortion , 
pornography , sexual freedom , women 's rights , and other , in 
its view , immoral influences of secular society , and it 
forbids the use of tobacco , alcohol , coffee , and tea. 

centered in salt lake city , the church is extremely wealthy 
and politically powerful in and many other western 
states. among well know present day mormons are ezra taft 
benson  ( former secretary of agriculture ) , the family , 
the of the hotel empire , and a score of high placed 
government officials .  . 

the mormon church was founded in western new york in 1830 by 
joseph smith who claimed that by divine revelation be had 
found gold plates containing buried on a hill 
and that with the help of visits from the angel he 
had been able to translate the writing into the book of 
mormon , the basis of mormon belief .  . this book , written by 
the commandment of god , claims that the ancient hebrews 
settled in america about 600 b.c.e. and were the ancestors 
of the american indians .  . mormons believe that those who 
have been baptized in the true church will be 
after death and that deceased non mormon family members can 
be baptized by proxy and thus join their relatives in the 
hereafter .  . because of these beliefs , mormons have been 
considered by christian denominations and 
as heretics by religious fundamentalists .  . 

joseph smith was a controversial figure in his day he was 
both worshiped as a saint and denounced as a fraud .  . because 
of persecution he led his band of loyal followers from 
, new york , westward to ohio and then to illinois , 
where in he was shot to death by an mob .  . brigham 
young , who reportedly had as many as eighty wives , took over 
the leadership of the church and led the mormons further 
westward , to found the new zion in salt lake city. 
following the teachings of joseph smith in the practice of 
polygamy was perhaps the mormons most controversial practice 
in nineteenth century america .  . 

while other religions go back many centuries 
, 1200 years christianity , 2000 and judaism , 
3000 and attempts to examine their beginnings are 
difficult , extensive historical investigation of mormon 
roots is possible. some mormons are willing to examine this 
history objectively , bu others maintain that such scrutiny 
is dangerous to the faith. 

in the following pages , free inquiry presents two articles 
about the mormon church. first , george d. smith , a lifelong 
member of the church , provides a detailed critical 
examination of joseph smith and his claim the the book of 
mormon was divinely revealed .  . second , we present a portion 
of an interview with philosopher sterling , also a 
mormon since birth , who questions the treatment of the 
history of the church by mormon authorities .  . paul

i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how 
deviant the view as i 've articulated it above (which may not be 
the true view of khomeini ) is from the basic principles of islam .  . 
so that the non muslim readers of this group will see how far from 
the simple basics of islam such views are on the face of them. and 
if they are not in contradiction with the basics of islam , how 
subtle such issues are and how it seems sects exist in islam while 
they are explicitly proscribed by the qur'an .  . 

discussing it here is fine by me. shall we start a new thread called , 
say , infallibility in islam and move the discussion there 

i think this should be illuminating to all. let me make a first 
suggestion. when arabic words , especially technical ones , become of use 
let us define them for those , especially atheists , to whom they may not be 
terribly familiar. please also note that though i did initially refer 
to khomeini as a heretic for what i understood to be a claim rejected 
by you since of personal infallibility , i withdraw this as a basis 
for such a statement. i retain this reference in regard 
to khomeini 's advocacy of the thesis of the infallibility of the 
so called twelve imams , which is in clear conflict with the qur'an 
in that it places the twelve imams in a category of behavior and example 
higher than that of the muhammad , in that the qur'an shows that the 
prophet was clearly fallible , as well as (it appears , given your 
theological statment regarding the natures of the twelve 
imams ) placing them in a different metaphysical category than the 
remainder of humanity , with the possible exception of muhammad ,

as evidence for the resurrection , it is often claimed that the disciples 
were tortured to death for their beliefs and still did not renounce 
their claim that jesus had come back from the dead. 
now , i skimmed acts and such , and i found a reference to this happening 
to stephen , but no others. where does this apparently very widely held 
belief come from is there any evidence outside the bible is there any 
evidence in the bible i sure have n't found any .  .  .  . 

briefly , no. there is widespread folklore , but no good documentary 
evidence , or even solid rumor , concerning the deaths of the apostles .  . 
further , the usual context of such arguments , as you observe , is no 
martyrs for a lie i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather 
than recant is evidence for the truth of their belief .  . this adds the 
quite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered 
the chance of life by  . since we do n't even know how or 
where they died , we certainly do n't have this information. (by the 
way , even in the case of stephen it is not at all clear that he could 
have saved himself by  . the willingness of true believers 
to die for their belief , be it in jesus or jim jones , is 
well documented , so martyrdom in and of itself says little. see

noting that a particular society , in this case the mainland uk , 
has few religously motivated murders , and few murders of any 
kind , says very little about whether inter religion murders elsewhere 
are religiously motivated .  . 

no , but it allows one to conclude that there is nothing inherent 
in all religion  ( or for that matter , in catholicism and protestantism ) 
that motivates one to kill .  . 

motivates or allows the christian bible says that one may kill 
under certain circumstances .  . in fact , it instructs one to kill under 
certain circumstances .  . 

i 'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them 
to kill under certain circumstances .  . i do get your distinction between 
motivate and allow , and i do agree that if a of theism  allows  
, then that 's an indictment of that theism .  . but it rather 
depends on what the  certain circumstances  are. when you talk about 
christianity , or islam , then at least your claims can be understood .  . 
it 's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls 
apart. one could believe in a god which instructs one to be utterly 
harmless .  . 

for my part , i conclude that something 
else is required. i also happen to believe that that something 
else will work no less well without religion any easy them us will 
do. 

and what does religion supply , if not an easy them us 

not necessarily .  . love thy neighbour does not supply a them us it 
it. and my definition of religion is broader than my 
definition of theism , as i have explained .  . 

by insisting that even the murder of four , chosen because 
they were catholics , and who had nothing to do with the ira , by 
protestant extremists , is not religously motivated , i think what 
you are saying is that you simply will not accept any murder as 
being religiously motivated .  . 

no. what about that guy who cut off someone 's head because he believed 
he was the devil incarnate that was religously motivated .  . 

what about the protestant extremists who killed four catholic 
that was n't religiously motivated 

not in my opinion. if they were doing it because of some obscure 
point of theology , then yes. but since all protestants do n't do this 
 ( nor do they elect extremists to do it for them) , it 's just too broad 
too say religion did this . i'm saying that the causes are far more 
complex than that take away the religious element , and you 'd still 
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism .  . you 
know , when most catholics and protestants worldwide say  stop the 
killing  , one might listen to that , especially when you claim not 
to read minds. 


also , the murders ensuing from the fatwa on mr. rushdie , the inquisitions , 
and the many religous wars .  . 

what 's so special about these exceptions is n't this all just a 
grab bag of ad hoc excuses for not considering some other murders 
to be religiously motivated what 's the general principle behind 
all this 

the general principle is that it 's fairly clear  ( to me , at least) that 
religion is the primary motivator  ( enabler , whatever) of these. it 's 
not nearly so obvious what 's going on when one looks at ni , apart 
from violence of course. 

it 's not an abstract argument . northern irish protestants say 
we do n't want to be absorbed into am officially catholic country. 

now what are we supposed to do are we supposed to reply no , 
that 's only what you think you do n't want. mr o'dwyer assures us 
that no matter what you say you want , you really want something 
else 

you think the unionists would n't mind being absorbed into a non catholic 
country  ( other than the uk of course) it 's a terrible thing to lose 
a mind. maybe the word country is there for more than just kicks .  . 
i certainly do n't believe that the unionists are in it for god i think 
they wish to maintain their position of privilege .  . 

i'm still listening to what they say , and you are still telling us 
your version of what they think. you read minds , and i do n't .  . 

you 've speculated on my motives often enough , and you do n't take 
my statements of my own beliefs at face value therefore your claim 
not to read minds has no credibility with me , sorry. i also note that 
you fail to answer my question. it just looks to me very much like 
you have an axe to grind especially as you are indeed ignoring what 
most protestants say which is the killing . the people you 
refer to are properly described as unionists , not protestants .  . 

as for their position of privilege , what is that if not religion 
based 

it is based on politics , bigotry , and heartless extremism .  . none of these 
things are synonymous with religion , though there is certainly some 
overlap .  .

perhaps you can explain the difference to me , since you seem to see it 
so clearly .  . 

 ( rest deleted) 

that 's a fallacy , and it is not the first time it is pointed out. 

it 's not a fallacy note the if .  . if a of disinterested people 
agree on a value  ( we 're not doing ethics yet benedikt ) , then what 
is the difference between that and those people agreeing on a trivial 
observation 


the reference to it 's not yet being ethics is dubious .  . you have used the terms 
absolute , objective and others interchangeably .  . same with moral values , values , 
at all , worth , , and usefulness .  . you infer from them as if they were 
the same. 

to the if .  . when the if is not fulfilled , your intermission is a waste of time. 
assuming that you do n't intend this , it is reasonable to conclude that you 
want to argue a point. 

you have made a interesting statement here , namely that of the disinterested 
observer .  . there is no such thing in morals .  . probably the shortest proof for 
objective and morality being a contradiction .  . 


for one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon .  . unlike 
a football. further , you conveniently ignore here that there are 
many who would not agree on morality of something. the analogy 
does not hold .  . 

i have , however , given an example of a value people agree on , and explained 
why. people will agree that their freedom is valuable .  . i have also 
stated that such a value is a necessary condition for doing objective 
ethics the if assertion above. and that is what i'm talking about , there 
is n't a point in talking about ethics if this ca n't be agreed. 


fine. and that freedom is valuable is not generally agreed upon .  . i could 
name quite a lot of people who state the opposite .  . (not that that was n't 
mentioned before) .  . in other words , you have nothing to fulfill your strong 
claims with. 


one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , 
while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees 
with a set of morals you have to give .  . 

i'm not doing morals  ( ethics ) if we ca n't get past values .  . as i say , 
the only cogent objection to my  freedom  example is that maybe people 
are n't talking about the same thing when they answer that it is valuable .  . 
maybe not , and i want to think about this some , especially the implications 
of its being true. 


clutching a straw .  . i do n't believe in mappings into metaphysical sets were 
loaded terms are  . those who deny the morality of freedom make quite 
clear what they say , their practice is telling .  . yes , there are even those who 
are willingly unfree .  . it is quite common in religions , by the way. for one , 
there is a religion which is named submission .  . 

do n't even try to argue that submission is freedom .  . 


further , the above is evidence , not proof. proof would evolve out of testing 
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories .  . 

garbage .  . that 's not proof either. 


if it were so , it would argue my case. but i am afraid that that is considered 
proof. 


the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer 
the objections .  . evidence that you are a preacher .  . 

name that fallacy .  . 

there is something universally valued in a moral context.

i reiterate for the nth time also that i do n't agree with k 's fatwa ,

to show why rushdie is not particularly due sympathy by those who hold 
their religion in high esteem and do n't enjoy seeing things which slander 
it  ( like the story of the satanic verses  ( as opposed to the rushdie 's 
tsv )) played with for amusement .  . 

so although you do n't agree with the fatwa , and apparently do n't think 
rushdie should be killed for his book , yet you think he is not due 
sympathy for being being under this threat .  . furthermore you base this 
reaction solely on the fact that he wrote about a particular 
well known story which if true might reflect poorly on the 
absolute truth of your religion. yet , this opinion is formed without 
recourse to actually looking to see how the story is used in context , 
accepting at face value the widespread propaganda on just what this 
book contains and what the author 's motivations are. and then you 
come forward and recommend another book which touches on  ( presumably

as promised , here is rafiq 's discussion of the nature of 
the so called satanic verses from which rushdie 's title has been 
taken.  ( rafiq , muhammad and the quran , penguin '91 ) 

here follows an introduction to the controversial incident , and an 
apologetic explanation purporting to show why it could n't actually 
have happened. the historicity of the episode does n't matter to what 
follows 

i do n't know whether i'm quoting gregg or below. anyway , back 
to current affairs , 

rushdie has , by his own admission , drawn 
on the version given by the orientalist watt 

among others this incident is not something rushdie or watt or anyone 
else dug up from nowhere , it is a well known story , a myth if you 
will , known  ( according to umar khan) to every muslim school boy and 
girl , and so presumably to rushdie , and to  . 

and then allowed his 
imagination to run wild 

yes , this is what writing fiction is all about. rushdie was writing 
about a crisis of faith , and chose this myth to present it , by placing 
the actor in the role of the angel whose name he took .  . 
rushdie was not writing a history or theology book , and nowhere claims 
or implies that this is what actually happened. it 's somewhat like 
stories woven around the relationship between jesus and the reformed 
prostitute mary magdalene  ( another  . or those referring to the 
arthurian , or the grail legend , or the wandering jew , or dozens 
of others. if you can stand to read the work of a blasphemer , 
consider salman rushdie 's children 's book and the sea of 
stories for an idea of the way a a specific 
works with existing story lines. 

to ridicule muhammad 's integrity .  .  .  . 

no. muhammad 's 's integrity is not really in this 
part of the story , and there 's no reason to think this was rushdie 's 
intent , as the archangel , produces the verses  ( divine and 
satanic ) , though he does n't know their  . it is not implied 
 ( in a straight reading) that muhammad influences them 

not my voice i 'd never know such words i'm no classy speaker 
never was never will be but this is n't my voice it 's a voice. 
's eyes open wide , he 's seeing some kind of vision , 
staring at it , oh , that 's right , remembers , me. he 's 
seeing me. my lips moving , being moved by. what , whom do n't 
know , ca n't say. nevertheless , here they are , coming out of my 
mouth , up my throat , past my teeth the words. 
being god 's is no fun ,  . 
god is n't in this picture. 
god knows whose i 've been. 

it 's ambiguous is somehow manipulating is it satan 
or something else the answer is not given. 

to be sure , the question is raised .  . this novel explores faith and the 
role of revelation in religion , among other things. addressing loss 
of faith implicitly raises questions about the truth of revelation , 
but this novel proposes no answers , at least not directly .  . the very 
existence of a newsgroup named alt.atheism raises the same 
questions , more forcefully , and does propose some answers , which is 
the real relevance .  . if rushdie 's mild fictional exploration is filth 
and lies , and he asked for what he got , are we next on the fatwa 
list  ( that 's a rhetorical question , of course . ) .

i love god just as much as she loves me. if she wants to me , 
she 'll know what to do. 

but if he she did you would probably consider it rape .  . 

of course not. i would think that would be great fun , not having ever 
felt the joy and peace the christians speak of with a gaze .  . 
this is not what i got when i believed i just tried to hide my fear 
of getting punished for something i never was sure of. the bible is 
hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. god did 
not answer. in the end , i found i had been following a mass delusion , 
a lie. i ca n't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint 
of her existence .  . 

obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe. so  .  .  . 

i suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe 
and analyse their position. in fact , it is amusing to note in this 
context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the 
opposite one should not examine one 's belief critically .  . 

i 'll tell you something i left out of my  testimony  i posted to this 
group two months ago. a day after i finally found out my faith is over , 
i decided to try just one more time. the same cycle of emotional 
responses fired once again , but this time the delusion lasted only 
a couple of hours. i told my friend in a phone that it really works , 
thank god , just to think about it again when i hung up. i had to admit 
that i had lied , and fallen prey to the same illusion .  . 

no one asks you to swallow everything , in fact jesus warns against it. but let 
me ask you a question. do you beleive what you learn in history class , or for 
that matter anything in school. i mean it 's just what other people have told 
you and you do n't want to swallow what others say. right ... 

i used to believe what i read in books when i was younger , or what 
other people told me , but i grew more and more skeptical the more i 
read. i learned what it means to use reason . 

as a student of chemistry , i had to perform a qualitative analysis 
of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. i hated experiments 
like this they are old fashioned and increase the student 's workload 
considerably .  . besides , i had to do it twice , since i failed in my first 
attempt .  . however , i think i 'll never forget the lesson 

no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is x , 
it may still be y. it is very tempting to jump into conclusions , take 
a leap of faith , assure oneself , ignore the data which is inconsistent .  . 
but it can still be wrong. 

i found out that i was , after all , using exactly the same mechanism 
to believe in god mental self assurance , suspension of fear , 
filtering of information. in other words , it was only me , no god 
playing any part. 

the life , death , and resurection of christ is documented historical fact. 

oh and i had better believe this dan , many ufo stories are much better 
documented than the resurrection of jesus .  . the resurrection is documented 
quite haphazardly in the bible it seems the authors did not pay too 
much attention to which wild rumour to leave out. besides , the ends of 
the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance , 
the end of mark (16 9 20) is missing from many early texts , says my bible .  . 

jesus may have lived and died , but he was probably misunderstood .  . 

as much 
as anything else you learn. how do you choose what to believe and 
what not to 

this is easy. i believe that the world exists independent of my mind , 
and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what i 
observe .  . nothing else need to be taken on faith , i will go by the 
evidence. 

it makes no difference whether i believe george washington existed or not. 
i assume that he did , considering the vast amount of evidence presented .  . 

there is no way to get into a sceptical heart. you can not say you have 
given a 
sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have. you must trust , 
not just go 
to church and participate in it 's activities. were you ever willing to 
die for what you believed 

a liar , how do you know what my attitude was try reading your bible 
again. 

i was willing to die for my faith. those who do are usually remembered 
as heroes , at least among those who believe. dan , do you think i'm 
lying when i say i believed firmly for 15 years it seems it is 
very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not 
do so anymore. but i ca n't go on lying to myself. 

blind trust is dangerous , and i was just another blind led by the blind .  . 
but if god really wants me , she 'll know what to do. i'm willing .  . i just 
do n't know whether she exists looking at the available evidence , 
it looks like she does n't .  .

it seems a very large part of christianity is based on the notion that 
it is the right religion , and that just about any other way of looking at 
the universe is flat out wrong. in the old days we had the inquisition and the 
burning of heretics now we have pat buchanan trying to start some cultural 
war because he ca n't stand to live in the same country as all these other , 
non god fearing people. 

its a survival trait .  . there are only a fixed number of resources  ( people ) 
for religions to inhabit .  . the doctrines of intolerance and not using 
birth control are devices whereby the meme of the  ( capital r ) religion

yes , this took some getting used to of course not having an indian

mc theory of creationism my theistic view of the theory of 
mc creationism ,  ( there are many others) is stated in genesis 
mc 1. in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth. 

and which order of creation do you accept the story of creation is one of the 
many places in the bible where the story contradicts itself. the following is 
an example .  .  .  . 

gen 1 25 and god made the beast of the earth after his kind , and cattle 
after their kind , and every thing that upon the earth after his 
kind and god saw that it was good. 
gen 1 26 and god said , let us make man in our image , after our likeness 
and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of 
the air , and over the cattle , and over all the earth , and over every 
creeping thing that upon the earth. 

gen 2 18 and the lord god said , it is not good that the man should be 
alone i will make him an help meet for him. 
gen 2 19 and out of the ground the lord god formed every beast of the 
field , and every fowl of the air and brought them unto adam to see what he 
would call them and whatsoever adam called every living creature , that was 
the name thereof .  . 

even your bible cannot agree on how things were created. why should we 
believe in it

jon livesey writes 

what i said was that people took time to copy the text correctly. 
translations present completely different issues. 


so why do i read in the papers that the texts had different 
versions of some ot texts .  . did i misunderstand 

reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in 
the world. newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of 
religion , and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a real 
story  ( that is , a bigger headline) .  . 

let 's back up to 1935. at this point , we have the masoretic text , the 
various  ( translations commentaries in aramaic , etc . ) . , and the 
septuagint , the ancient greek translation. the masoretic text is the 
standard jewish text and essentially does not vary .  . in some places it has 
obvious corruptions , all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. 
these passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the and 
to the septuagint .  . 

so when they took the time to copy the text correctly , that includes 
obvious corruptions 


now , the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars 
first , it includes additional texts , and second , in some passages there are 
variant readings from the masoretic text  ( in addition to fixing predating 
the various corrupted passages) .  . it must be emphasized that , to the best of 
my knowledge , these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars , and 
have little theological import .  . 

so when they took the time to copy the text correctly , that does not 
exclude variant readings from the masoretic text which are of little 
theological import 


the dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient copy of almost all of 
isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other ot books. there 
is also an abundance of other material , but as far as i know , there is no 
sign there of any hebrew to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the 
septuagint) .  . as far as analysis has proceeded , there are also variations 
between the dss texts and the masoretic versions. these tend to reflect the 
septuagint , where the latter is n't obviously in error. again , though , the 
differences  ( thus far) are not significant theologically .  . there is this big 
expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the 
material , but so far this has n't happened. 

the dss are important because there is almost no textual tradition in the 
ot , unlike for the nt .  .

wait a minute , doug .  . i know you are better informed than that. the us 
has never invaded nicaragua  ( as far as i know) .  . we liberated grenada 
... 

liberate is the way an invader describes an invasion , including , if 
i'm not mistaken , the iraqi liberation of kuwait .  . never invaded 
nicaragua only with more word games can you say send in the 
marines 

so if you mean by the word invaded some sort of military action where 
we cross someone 's border , you are right 5 out of 6. but normally 
invaded carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation .  . 
 ( if some nation invades the u.s. virgin islands , would they be 
invading the virgin islands or the u.s. ) so from this point of 
view , your score falls to 2 out of 6  ( mexico , panama) .  . 

oh , good word games. if you let the aggressor pick the words , 
there 's scarcely ever been a reprehensible military action. 


what 's a peace nik is that somebody who does n't masturbate 
over guns n ammo or what is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik 

no , it 's someone who believes in peace at all costs . in other words , 
a person who would have supported giving hitler not only austria and 
, but poland too if it could have averted the war. and one 
who would allow hitler to wipe all all jews , slavs , and political 
dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone. 

that 's a convenient technique , much seen on alt.atheism define those 
who disagree with you according to a straw man extreme that matches 
virtually nobody .  . 

is it supposed to be bad to be a peace nik , you ask well , it depends 
on what your values are. if you value life over liberty , peace over 
freedom , then i guess not. but if liberty and freedom mean more to you 
than life itself if you 'd rather die fighting for liberty than live 
under a tyrant 's heel , then yes , it 's bad to be a peace nik .  . 

very noble and patriotic .  . i'm sure the fine young americans who 
carpet bombed iraqi infantry positions from over the horizon , 
destroyed iraq 's sewer and water infrastructure from the safety of the 
sky or further , or who bulldozed other iraqi infantry into their 
trenches or more importantly the commanders who ordered them to were 
just thrilled to be risking death  ( if not risking it by much) in the 
defense of the liberty of ... well , wealthy kuwaitis .  . ca n't have 
those oil fields under a tyrant 's heel if that tyrant is antagonistic 
to us interests .  .  .  . 

the problem with most peace niks it they consider those of us who are 
not like them to be bad and unconscionable . i would not have any 
argument or problem with a peace nik if they held to their ideals and 
stayed out of all conflicts or issues , especially those dealing with 
the national defense .  . but no , they are not willing to allow us to 
legitimately hold a different point of view. 

having pigeon holed peace niks  ( in this context , people who 
disagree with me about the conduct of the gulf war ) into 
peace at all cost hitler supporting genocide , you can 
now express righteous indignation when they refuse to fit this mold 
and question the conduct of the war on legitimate terms. how dare 
they ! 

they militate and 
many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  ( what rank

yes , hypocrisy indeed ! those violent peace niks !  ( care to list an 
example here ) 

all to stop we warmongers who are willing to stand up 
and defend our freedoms against tyrants , and who realize that to do 
so requires a strong national defense .  . 

wow instant '80 's nostalgia ! of course , peace nik itself is a 
'50 's cold war derogatory term equating those who promote pacifism 
with godless pinko communists . yes indeed , i felt my freedoms

your discusion on the reality of atoms is interesting , but it 
would seem that you are verging on the question is anything real 
that is , since observation is not 100 reliable , how can we say 
that anything is real . i do n't think this was the intention 
of the original question , since you now define out the word 
real so that nothing can meet its criteria .  . 
just a thought. 

brian 

ps rainbows and shadows are real they are not objects , they 
are phenomenon .  . an interesting question would be if atoms 
are objects  ( classical ) or phenomenon  ( neo quantum ) or what 

i 've been following this train of talk , and the question of dismissing atoms as 
being in some sense not real leaves me uneasy .  . 

it seems to be implied that we only the effects , and therefore the 
underlying thing is not necessarily real. the tree outside my window is in 
this category .  .  .  . is observe the light which bounces off of it , not the tree 
itself. the observation is indirect , but no more so than observations i have 
made of atoms .  . 

also , what about observations and experiments that have been routinely done 
with individual atoms .  . i am thinking in particular of atom trapping 
experiments and tests of fundamental quantum mechanics such as the quantum zeno 
effect , where an individual atom is studied for a long period of time. 

some of the attempts at quantum mechanical arguments were not very satisfying 
either. one has to be carefull about making such arguments without a solid 
technical background in the field. what i read seemed a little confused a 
quite a red herring .  . 

anyway , if the purpose of a public debate is to make the audience think , it 
worked. after doing so , i'm willing to try to defend the following assertion 
if anyone cares 

atoms are as real as trees , and are real in the every day sense of the 
word real .

for kuwait .  . no , unfortunately , sitting back and letting things be 
is not the way to correct a former mistake. destroying hussein 's 
military potential as we did was the right move. but i agree with 
your statement , reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to 
sell arms to hussein .  . 

but it 's still happening. that 's the entire point. only last month , john 
major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of 
arms to saudi arabia .  . the same month , we sold jet fighters to the same 
indonesian government that 's busy killing the east  . 

i heard about the arms sale to saudi arabia .  . now , how is it such a grave 
mistake to sell saudi arabia weapons or are you claiming that we should n't 
sell any weapons to other countries straightforward answer please. 

it 's all very well to say oops , we made a boo boo , better clean up the 
mistake , but the us and uk keep making the same mistake. they do it so 
often that i ca n't believe it 's not deliberate .  . this suspicion is reinforced 
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a 
economy on arms sales. 

who benefits from arms sales hint , it is n't normally the gov't .  . it is 
the contractor that builds that piece of equipment. believe it or not , 
the us and uk do n't export the huge quantities of arms that you have 
just accused them of doing. arms exports are rare enough , that it 
requires an act of congress for non small arms to most countries , if 
not all. do you believe in telling everyone who can do what , and who 
can sell their goods to whom

point morals are , in essence , personal opinions. usually 
 ( ideally ) well founded , motivated such , but nonetheless personal. the 
fact that a real large lot of people agree on some moral question , 
sometimes even for the same reason , does not make morals objective it 
makes humans somewhat alike in their opinions on that moral question , 
which can be good for the evolution of a social species .  . 

and if a real large lot  ( nice phrase) of people agree that there is a 
football on a desk , i'm supposed to see a logical difference between the two 
perhaps you can explain the difference to me , since you seem to see it 
so clearly .  . 

 ( rest deleted) 

that 's a fallacy , and it is not the first time it is pointed out. 
for one , you have never given a set of morals people agree upon .  . unlike 
a football. further , you conveniently ignore here that there are 
many who would not agree on morality of something. the analogy 
does not hold .  . 

one can expect sufficiently many people to agree on its being a football , 
while you have to give the evidence that only vanishing number disagrees 
with a set of morals you have to give .  . 

further , the above is evidence , not proof. proof would evolve out of testing 
your theory of absolute morals against competing theories .  . 


the above is one of the arguments you reiterate while you never answer

perhaps you have a different understanding of what physics is. if we

are n't objective either. that 's what i mean when i say there 's no objective

 ( consider , for instance , that speed of light in

it 's an axiom that it 's invariant .  . but if the two of us measure it , we 'll 
get different answers. yes , we call that experimental error , but it 's not

you could argue that the value of c is objective , to within some

kevin wrote 

this post is probably either brilliant or insane. do let me know 
which .  .  .  . ) 

a brilliant example of using the objection against 
materialist theories of consciousness .  . 

diplomatic ) 

i realize i'm fighting occam 's razor in this argument , so i 'll try to 
explain why i feel a mind is necessary. 

firstly , i'm not impressed with the ability of algorithms .  . they 're 
great at solving problems once the method has been worked out , but not 
at working out the method itself. 

as a specific example , i like to solve numerical (not the 
simple do the sums and insert the answers type , the hard ones . ) . to do 
these with any efficiency , you need to figure out a variety of tricks .  . 
now , i know that you can program a computer to do these puzzles , but 
in doing so you have to work out the tricks yourself , and program 
them into the computer. you can , of course ,  obfuscate  the trick , and 
write the program so that it is uncovered , but as far as i can see , 
the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered .  . does 
this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already 
pre programmed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely , given that 
our brains ultimately are encoded in 46 worth of genetic 
material , much of which is n't used. 

one way around this is to bring the environment into the equation , but 
 ( again , as far as i can see) this still has an air of  if you see 
object x , then perform action y , ' and we do n't seem to get anywhere. 
the algorithm has to anticipate what it might see , and what 
conclusions to draw from it 's experience. 

the other problem with algorithms is their instability .  . not many 
algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code , yet 
people survive strokes without going completely haywire  ( there are 
side effects , but patients still seem remarkably stable . ) . also , 
neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate 
can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it 's 
code 

the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour  ( replace 
 colour  with the sensation of your choice . ) . presumably , the 
materialist viewpoint is that it 's the product of some kind of 
chemical reaction. the usual products of such a reaction are energy 
different chemicals .  . is colour a mixture of these if this is so , a 
computer wo n't see colour , because the chemistry is different. does an 
algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an 
equivalent that does n't it should n't , because the outputs of each 
algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances .  . so why do 
we see colour 



however , such a view is actually a  . how should minds be 
able to act as observers , feel pain and pleasure and issue 
commands any better than the brain moreover , how do the interactions 
occur 

a bit of idle speculation .  .  .  . 

if i remember correctly , quantum mechanics consists of a , 
with two processes acting on it. the first process has been called 
 unitary evolution   ( or 'u') , is governed by 's equation 
and is well known. the second process , called various things such as 
 collapse of the  or  state vector reduction   ( or 'r' ) , 
and is more mysterious .  . it is usually said to occur when a 
 measurement  takes place , although nobody seems to know precisely 
when that occurs .  . when it does occur , the effect of r is to abruptly 
change the  . 

i r as an interaction between the and  something 
else , ' which i shall call  part x . ' . it seems reasonable 
to assume that something causes r , although that something might be 
the itself  ( in which case , part x is simply the 
 . note , though , that we 'd need more than u to explain r . ) . 

anyway , i'm speculating that minds would be in part x. there seems to 
be some link between consciousness and r , in that we never see linear 
of anything , although there are alternative 
explainations for this. i 've no idea how a brain is supposed to access 
part x , but since this is only speculation , that wo n't matter too 
much ) my main point is that there might be a place for minds in 
physics .  . 

i 'll go back to my nice padded cell now , if that 's ok with you )

there are a number of places where the masoretic text  ( mt ) of the ot is

the clipper initiative is an announcement by clinton that all the 
secure voice phones will use the same crypto chip , as a de facto 
government standard. problem is , the government is admitting that 
they hold the keys to break the code easily , and the justice department 
will be using the keys to listen in on illegal activities. many 
people are really scared about such an initiative because it is 
a major step towards outlawing real crypto protection on things 
like email if you read the press release. the project was developed 
by nsa and given to nist .  . it uses two keys s1 and s2 that the 
government claims are needed to break the code. they claim that 
these keys will be handed to two different companies , and when they 
get a warrant to do a wiretap (the chip is nicknamed the wiretap chip) , 
they have to get the keys from both companies. people have poked holes 
through and through the press release official version and shown how 
it is nowhere near as nice as it sounds , and i have given the simplified 
version. people over on sci.crypt are really scared about this 
proposal it seems.

dean , 

i think you 're letting atheist mythology 

great start. i realize immediately that you are not interested 
in discussion and are going to thump your babble at me. i would 
much prefer an answer from ms healy , who seems to have a 
reasonable and reasoned approach to things. say , are n't you the 
creationist guy who made a lot of silly statements about 
evolution some time ago 

confuse you on the issue of 
divine justice. according to the most fundamental doctrines of 
christianity , when the first man sinned , he was at that time the 
entire human race and any punishment meted out would necessarily 
affect the entire race of which he was the sole all . 
humans coming after him would , being of the same race  ( species ) , share 
in that judgement .  . it has nothing to do with who deserves what. 
from the perspective of god , humanity is but one category of created 
things and that category is condemned .  . 

duh , gee , then we must be talking christian mythology now. i 
was hoping to discuss something with a reasonable , logical 
person , but all you seem to have for your side is a repetition 
of the same boring mythology i 've seen a thousand times before. 
i am deleting the rest of your remarks , unless i spot something 
that approaches an answer , because they are merely a repetition 
of some doctrine or other and contain no thought 
at all.

merely a question for the basis of morality 

moral ethical behavior societally acceptable behavior . 

1)who ) is society 

society is the collection of individuals which will fall under self defined 
rules. in terms of un decisions all the sets of peoples who are represented 
at the un are considered part of that society. if we then look at us federal 
laws provided by representatives of purely us citizens then the society for 
that case would be the citizens of the us and so on. 

2)how ) do they define what is acceptable 

acceptable are those behaviours which are either legislated for the 
society by representatives of that society or those behaviours which are 
non verbally and , in effect , non consciously , such as picking your nose on 
the show , no one does it , but there is no explicit law against 
doing it. in many cases there are is no definition of whether or not a 
behaviour is acceptable , but one can deduce these behaviours by 
observation .  . 


3)how ) do we keep from a whatever is legal is what is moral position 

in an increasingly litigation mad society , this trap is becoming exceedingly 
difficult to avoid .  . with the infusion and strengthening of ethnic cultures 
in american  ( and australian , to bring in my local perspective ) culture the 
boundaries of acceptable behaviour are ever widening and legislation may 
eventually become the definition of moral behaviour .  . for instance , some 
cultures  dominant religion call for live sacrifice of domesticated animals. 
most fundamental christians would find this practice abhorrent .  . however , is 
it moral , according to the american society this kind of 
problem may only be definable by legislation .  . 

obviously within any society there will be differences in opinion in what is 
acceptable behaviour or not , and much of this will be due to different 
environmental circumstances rather than merely different opinions. 

one thing is for sure , there is no universal moral code which will suit all 
cultures in all situations. there may , however , be some globally accepted 
mores which can be agreed upon and as a globally enforcable 
concept. the majority of mores will not be common until all peoples upon 
this earth are living in a similar environment  ( if that ever  .

imagine that dollars turn up in your bank account every 
month. suppose further that this money is being paid to you by (a) your 
big hearted benefactor , or (b) a bug in an atm. let 's 
suppose that this is a true dichotomy , so  ( p(a )  ( p(b ) 1. trouble is , 
is in a different universe , so that no observations of are possible 
(except for the banks you could n't possibly afford it ) 

now let 's examine the case for (a) .  . there is no evidence whatsoever that 
there is any such thing as a big hearted benefactor .  . however , 
 ( p(exists(b h a b )  ( p(not(exists(b h a b ) 1. on the grounds that 
lack of evidence for is evidence against when we have a partition like 
that , we dismiss hypothesis (a) .  . 

turning , therefore , to (b) , we also find no evidence to support that 
hypothesis .  . on the same grounds as before , we dismiss hypothesis (b) .  . 

the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible 
hypotheses , and even though we know by construction that the money 
arrives every month , we have proven that it ca n't , because we 
have dismissed all of its potential causes .  . 

that 's an extremely poor argument , and here 's why. 

premise 1  .  .  . this . money is being paid to you by either (a) your big 
hearted benefactor , or (b) a bug in an atm . 

thus each monthly appearance of the bucks , should it happen , is an 
observation on , and by construction , is evidence for the 
existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm . 

premise 2 no observations on are possible. 

(except for the banks you could n't possibly afford it ) 

you forgot to include this. my premise is actually 

premise 2 the of the set of possible observations on 
is one. 

this is clearly contradictory to the first. 

not if you state it properly. 

trouble is , on the basis of premise 2 , you say that there can be no evidence 
of either the benefactor or the bug , but the first premise leads to the 
conclusion that the appearance of the bucks , should it happen , is evidence 
for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug . 

voila , a screaming contradiction .  . 

with my highlights sc 
but in a strawman argument. there is only evidence for  ( oneof(benefactor ,  . 
no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible. that is 

not evidence for bug , and neither is it evidence for benefactor .  . nor 

is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as 
if there were no benefactor bug  ( two statements , both would be false) .  . 

this is still contradictory .  . it reduces to 

(1) arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug . 

(2) this is not evidence for benefactor , neither is it evidence for 
bug  ( meaning that it does n't lend more weight to one than to the 
other) 

(3) therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence 
can exist for bug . 

but (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2) .  . when you say (paraphrased) 
in (2) that this is not evidence for benefactor , for example , what you 
mean is that it 's no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug . 

yes , that 's what i mean. 

in (3) , however , you 've shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor 
so that it now means  evidence for benefactor rather than 
 evidence for benefactor w.r.t. bug . 

not really , i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other. i 
think this is just a communications problem. what i am trying to say , 
in my clumsy way , is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates 
to theism making predictions  ( prayer , your  rapture  example) , i do n't 
buy your use of occam 's razor in all cases where a 0. 

in my example , one could n't dismiss 
benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity one of these is necessary 
to explain the  . i brought up the  one by one dismissal  process to 
show that it would be wrong to do so. from what you 're saying in this 
post , it seems you agree , and we 're talking at cross purposes. 

(3) is still in contradiction to (1) .  . 

some sums may help. with b benefactor , b bug , d arrives in account 

(1) implies  ( p(b b d ) 1 

assuming that  ( p(bb d ) 0 , so it 's either the benefactor or a bug 
which is responsible if the bucks arrive , but not both , then 

 ( p(b b d )  ( p(b d )  ( p(b d ) 

so 

 ( p(b d )  ( p(b d ) 1 

but (3) implies that 

 ( p(b d ) 0 and  ( p(b d ) 0. 

no , this is n't what i meant.  ( p(b d ) 0.5 and  ( p(b d ) 0.5 , with 
necessarily no new observation  ( we 've already seen the dosh ) to change 
those estimates .  . i was trying to say  ( again , in my clumsy way) that 
it would be wrong to assign 0 probability to either of these. and that 's 
precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods gods are 
one class of hypothesis  ( there are many others) belonging to a set of 
hypotheses one of which is necessary to explain something which otherwise 
would not be satisfactorily explained .  . it can be thrown out or 
retained on grounds of non rational preference , not of science or statistics. 
alternatively , one could chuck out or retain the lot , on the grounds 
that the answer ca n't be known , or that the notional probability estimates 
are effectively useless , being equal  ( agnosticism weak atheism) .  . 

as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x , 
where x is gods , pink unicorns , nothing , etc. and no observation 
tends to one conclusion over the other. 

exactly the point i was making , i think. so we do n't throw out any of 
these , contrary to your assertion above that we do. 

some people do , simon , and they think they are doing excellent science. 
my sole point was that they are n't .  . 

only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis h i (i . e .  . x 
where  ( p(x h i ) 0) can cause  ( p(h i ) to go to zero after a finite 
number of observations .  . only in this case do we get to throw any of the 
hypotheses out. 

exactly my point , though i may have been unclear .  . 

you said the opposite , which i guess is the source of my confusion. 

i was merely trying to illustrate the of doing so. 

what i'm trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of 
evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence , this does not hold true for 
all , or perhaps any , versions of theism and it is n't true that those for 
which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor .  . 

on the contrary , those for which it does not hold are exactly those which 
can be discarded using the razor .  . see my post on the other branch of this 
thread. 

then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of. if 
the razor holds for gods , then it holds for all like hypotheses .  . which 
means that you 're assigning  ( p(x h i ) 0 for all i , though we 've already 
established that it 's not correct to do so when  ( sum(p(x h i )) 1 over 
all i. 

simply put , anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or 
non existence of gods , whether inductive or no , is at best mistaken , and 
at worst barking mad. 

luckily i make no such claim , and have specifically said as much on numerous 
occasions .  . you would n't be constructing a strawman here , would you frank 
although that does n't , of course , rule out my being barking mad in any case 
(i could be barking mad in my spare time , with apologies to cleese et  . 

but i think you miss the point once again. when i say that something is 
evidence against an hypothesis , that does n't imply that observation of 
the said something necessarily the hypothesis , reducing the 
estimate of  ( p(h data) to zero .  . if it reduces this quantity , it 's still 
evidence against h. 

no , i got that. i'm talking about the case when a 0. you 're clearly 
correct when a ! 0. and i'm not constructing a strawman  ( though it 's 
certainly possible that i 've misunderstood what you 're  . however , 
by any standards , a system that says when a 0 , gods are highly unlikely , 
and when a ! 0 gods can be dismissed using the razor , is a system purporting 
to be an inductive proof that gods either do n't exist , or are unnecessary 
to explain any or all phenomena .  . in my experience , systems such as this 
 ( including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain 
a fallacy upon close examination .  . if that 's not what you 're saying , then 
please put me straight.

i think many reading this group would also benefit by knowing how

from the point ov view of an atheist , i see you claim khomeini was n't 
practicing true islam .  . but i'm sure that he would have said the same about

this is a very good point. i have already made the clear claim that 
khomeini advocates views which are in with the qur'an 
and have given my arguments for this. this is something that can be 
checked by anyone sufficiently interested. khomeini , being dead , 
really ca n't respond , but another poster who supports khomeini has 
responded with what is clearly sophistry .  . this should 
be quite clear to atheists as they are less susceptible to

so , to answer your question , the only way you can judge is by learning 
more about islam , that is by reading the qur'an and understanding it 's 
basic principles .  . once one has done this it is relatively easy to see 
who is following the principles of islam and who is acting in a way at 
odds with islam .  . khomeini by attributing a superhuman status to twelve 
muslim historical leaders is at variance with one of basic principles 
of islam , which is that no human being is metaphysically different than 
any other human being and in no sense any closer to god in metaphysical

this is fascinating .  . atheists argue for abortion , defend homosexuality 
as a means of population control , insist that the only values are 
biological and condemn war and capital punishment .  . according to 
benedikt , if something is , it cannot exist , which in 
this case means atheists i suppose. 
i would like to understand how an atheist can object to war  ( an 
excellent means of controlling population growth ) , or to capital 
punishment , i'm sorry but the logic escapes me. 

first , you seem to assume all atheists think alike. an atheist does not 
believe in the existence of a god. our opinions on issues such as 
capital punishment and abortion , however , vary greatly .  . 

if you were attacking the views of a particular atheist  ( benedikt , i 
presume ) , then please present your argument as such and do not lump us 
all together. 

as for the issues , let 's start with abortion .  . personally , i do not support 
abortion as a means of population control or contraception after the fact. 
however , i support the right of any woman to have an abortion , regardless 
of what my personal views may be , because it would be arrogant of me to tell 
any individual what he she may or may not do to his her body , and the domain 
of legislators should not extend into the uterus .  . that 's my opinion , and i 
am sure many atheists and theists would disagree with me. 

i do not defend homosexuality as a means of population control , but i 
certainly defend it as an end to itself. i think most homosexuals would 
be angered to hear of anyone characterizing their personal relationship as 
nothing more than a conscious effort to keep population levels down. 

as for atheists believing all values are biological , i have no idea what 
you 're talking about. 

finally , there are the issues of war and capital punishment .  . an atheist 
can object to either one just as easily as a theist might .  . you seem to 
be hung up on some supposed conspiratorial link between atheism and 
population control. could this be the atheist cause you were referring 
to a few posts back

mathew , i agree. this , it seems , is the crux of your whole position , 
is n't it that the us should n't have supported hussein and sold him arms 
to fight iran i agree. and i agree in ruthlessly hunting down those 
who did or do. but we did sell arms to hussein , and it 's a done deal. 
now he invades kuwait .  . so do we just sit back and say , well , we sold 
him all those arms , i suppose he just wants to use them now. too bad 
for kuwait .  . no , unfortunately , sitting back and letting things be 
is not the way to correct a former mistake. destroying hussein 's 
military potential as we did was the right move. but i agree with 
your statement , reagan and bush made a grave error in judgment to 
sell arms to hussein .  . 

but it 's still happening. that 's the entire point. only last month , john 
major hailed it as a great victory that he had personally secured a sale of 
arms to saudi arabia .  . the same month , we sold jet fighters to the same 
indonesian government that 's busy killing the east  . 

it 's all very well to say oops , we made a boo boo , better clean up the 
mistake , but the us and uk keep making the same mistake. they do it so 
often that i ca n't believe it 's not deliberate .  . this suspicion is reinforced 
by the fact that the mistake is an extremely profitable one for a 
economy on arms sales. 

so it 's really not the gulf war you abhor 
so much , it was the u.s. 's and the west 's in selling 
arms to hussein which ultimately made the war inevitable , right 

no , i thought both were terrible.
